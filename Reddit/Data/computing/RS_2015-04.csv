30zolh,57,2015-03-31,Should mods be allowed to work directly and be influenced by a company to perform PR work within their subreddits or should mods stay always partial to the desires of their community first and foremost.,gahyoujerk,TheoryOfReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/30zolh/should_mods_be_allowed_to_work_directly_and_be/,"Recently there has been some controversy in the /r/leagueoflegends subreddit, a journalist got information from an anonymous source within the mod team that Riot Games the company that creates League of Legends has direct contact with many of the mods of the /r/leagueoflegends subreddit, with an NDA agreement even existing.

Also things that have been exposed are Riot employees telling mods to remove certain content and perform basic PR actions and some former mods of /r/leagueoflegends becoming Riot employees and others be given internships.  

Additionally, the lead moderator is shown to ask other mods for their addresses, so that they can receive Riot swag, which leaves a question whether the company gave the mods gifts just because or because they helped perform PR duties for them.  

All of these things are a clear conflict of interest, and reddit has the rule that a company can not pay mods to do PR work, but it seems being paid in company swag and signing of NDA agreements by the company are overlooked by reddit staff.

[A look at the relationship of Riot Games and League subreddit mods](http://www.dailydot.com/esports/riot-games-league-of-legends-subreddit-relationship/)

Should such conflict of interests be allowed between mods and companies who are influencing the decisions of some mods or should there exist clear boundaries and the mods should care first and foremost about the desires of the community members rather than company interests?

Is there anything that can be done in the future about such conflict of interests?"
30zpao,4,2015-03-31,I've hit a wall and could really use some help.,lolmycat,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/30zpao/ive_hit_a_wall_and_could_really_use_some_help/,"Before making you read a long wall of text, I’ll start by explaining exactly what my post is about.

I am a 2nd year Computer Science major at a local community college in Southern California looking for some advice on landing an internship or part-time job.  I have applied to several companies, but have yet to get my foot in the door.  I’ve searched high and low but seem to be unable to find many realistic job openings.  I have hit a wall, and honestly, it has begun to wear on me.  More than anything, I want to begin using my programming knowledge in a real-world environment, and get a taste of what it is like to work with a team of professionals.  I can only imagine how much it would allow me to grow as a programmer and individual. 


If any of you have gone through the same difficulties, or have any advice that could help, I would be incredibly thankful.
So now a little background on myself.  I am 21 years old, live in Orange County, CA, have been programming since my freshman year of high school, have been studying Computer Science for the past 2 years at a local community college, and will be transferring to a 4 year CS/UC school in the fall.   However, I have found little to no help at my community college with finding an internship.  I really enjoy programming and feel that it comes naturally to me.
  
I took my first CS class junior year of high school (AP Computer Science A), and received a 4 on the AP exam.  As of today, I am fluent in C++ and Java.  Instead of writing a huge wall of text I’ll just detail the specifics of my CS background.  Anything I list below I have a great understanding of and can code from scratch.


* 	**Object Oriented programming (C++ and Java)**

*      Methods, Objects, Polymorphism, Inheritance, etc.   

* 	**Data Structures**

*     - Queues, Stacks, Lists (single,  double, circular)
        - Binary Trees (ADT, Red-Black) 
        - Maps, Hash Maps, and Dictionaries
        - Graphs (Dijkstra's algorithm, Floyd–Warshall algorithm, MST, etc)
        - Hashing
        - Search / Sort algorithms
* 	**UI design**
*     - JavaFX, AWT

This list goes on. Like I had mentioned, my understanding of Java and C++ is fairly in-depth.  

I have no problem with things like pointers, iterators, input/ output, method and operator overloading; the little things I see many of my classmates skim over and never really learn the ins and outs of.  Aside from school I have made a huge effort to push myself to learn as much as I can on my own: constantly trying to find more advanced ways of completing assignments, and spending way too much time on sites like Stack Overflow.  I have no issue following previously determined style guides and code documentation standards, and have some experience with HTML, PHP, SQL, and JavaScript.  As for program development, I have done several team projects using AGILE, specifically JIRA.

I’m sure there are a dozen things I haven’t listed that I know as well, but you get the idea.  With this information, any tips or advice on finding internships, building a better resume, etc. would mean *a lot*.  I know I can code well, but not being able to use all these skills I have spent hundreds of hours learning and practicing has got me in a slump.  It’s somewhat exhausting to spend so much time with something and have little to show others for it.   It would just be nice to get a foot in the door, and have some sort of tangible reward for all the hard ward I have put in thus far.


For those of you that spent to time to read this, *I really appreciate it*."
30zr6j,2,2015-03-31,I think I have an addiction to my medicine.,I_Need_To_Vent_15,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/30zr6j/i_think_i_have_an_addiction_to_my_medicine/,"Throw away account.

I've been taking Methylphenidate (Ritalin) for a while now. I'm 25 years old. I started taking it my second year of college 3 years ago. It was an on and off thing, usually taking it when I needed it. When I graduated I stopped taking it when I started working but shortly after I went back on the drug.

Fast forward to now and I think I am addicted to it. I can stop taking it for a few days without any withdraws but the only time I have done that recently is when I was out of pills.

After a year of taking it, why do I think I am addicted to it? 
First off, I have been trying to improve myself. I have been reading more and more. As a high school dropout I never did read any books. Now I have been reading ""self-help"" books, practicing mindfulness (meditating) and learning how to cook (4-Hour Chef).

When I am on it I get so relaxed, my mind becomes clear and I don't have racing thoughts but I become lazy. I don't want to do anything, I don't want to talk to anyone. I just want to either read a book or play video games.

I think taking Ritalin has also screwed with the way I look at my job and career. 2 years ago I started as an intern and kicked ass. Moved up to full time employee and did some great work. These past 8 months I feel like I have been slacking. I hardly do my work, I am always on Reddit, YouTube, Facebook.. etc. This usually happens when I take Ritalin. Once I begin to focus on something I can't get my mind off of it. When I am not focusing on work, I can't direct my focus towards my work. This has caused me to hate my job. I want to quit but I can't. 

I've been looking into starting my own online business but how I can have a successful business when I can't excel at my current job? How can I focus on a business when I can't focus on my own job? I feel like all this is happening because of my medicine but I can't stop taking it.

Another sign: My girlfriend and I have been trying to go on a diet and I can't stay motivated to stay on the diet. I keep eating snacks, drinking soda and eating foods that are not recommended for the diet. I keep telling myself ""once I start working out I will be able to keep on track with a good diet."" When I take my pills I have no energy to work out! I'm just tired and would rather use my brain to learn than work out. I think taking these pills are one of the reasons why I have gained weight!

I want to get back to being passionate about my job again. I want to get back to the old me. The one who was full of energy all the time and made everyone laugh but I think this addiction has ruined me. I haven't told my girlfriend this because I don't want to start a fight. I need help :(


**tldr** I think I'm addicted to Ritalin. I'm afraid its ruining my life but I can't stop taking it."

It seemed like a great experience and with me getting married this year, it was time for me to get a big boy job. 

I mentioned that I have some moderate Drupal experience. You know, the works. Setting up the site, configuring modules, setting up views, basic theming and all of that stuff.

So on my 4th day, a project comes up where we have to insert a new form into this ajax loaded pop-up. Stupid me says that I can handle it (nobody else in the company had even touched Drupal so it would have been me anyways) and so I was given a deadline and I began getting to work. 

First off, the client gave us a broken version of the local site, we had to use a database from 6 months ago in order to get it to work. The ajax pop-up form wasn't a block being loaded dynamically, it was a custom module. Over 2000 lines of PHP code I have to go through. 

However, I didn't complain. It was going to be a learning experience so I just met it head on. But in the meantime, I was having the whip cracked at me by two project managers. And today it got so bad that I got dragged into the CEO's office for a talk... The two project managers, the Director of IT and the CFO were there as well. He kept telling me that I need to ask for help, but how can I ask for help when I'm the only one who knows Drupal? The only person who was able to help me at all was the director of technology who wore many hats and was tangled up in his own business.

This is a 1-month contact-to-hire job and I'm not sure if I'm going to take it. Today was utterly embarrassing. The fact that a co-worker of my  ""disappeared"" doesn't help my morale either.

Do you think it's going to get any better?"

Another school Dayana boy was this one long. we barely got to talk but for the bread time we did I was happy. 
YOU GOT THE INTERVIEW for your internship and I'm just so very proud of you considering that they only choose 10 people out of all that apply. I know you're going to nail this.


I know you're nervous my darling but that's ok you're going to do fantastically.

Today was pretty uneventful, started with going to the gym for a little bit, I actually worked up quite a sweat today. Then I went home and showered and headed off to work. You poor thing you told me you'd be spending your tutoring session doing homework if no one showed up. 

You always work your ass off for school and I know I take up a lot of your time. I just want you to know that you make me so proud every day and I can see how hard you work. 


Today has been a slow day at work so far. No crazies...not much of anyone at all though really. Throughout my day there hasn't been a second where your beautiful smile wasn't floating around in my thoughts. 
Guess what else!! I'm off work tomorrow! I know you're gonna have work that you're gonna need to complete but if you want I'd love to help you prepare for your interview in any way that I can. 

Oh at work I spilled a case with a bunch of water absorption balls for flowers and now it's like there's jello all over. 

Anyways that was basically my day, I can only hope your day is going wonderfully. Last time you messaged me you told my how tired and hungry you were :( I hope you found time to eat and get some rest. 

I love you so much my noodle and when I'm there you can always rest your head on my shoulder when the day is too long
Keep smiling my love because you have the most beautiful one.

Until tomorrow

I recently received an offer from a large somewhat well known internet company (900-1000 alexa global ranking ~300 US only ranking, ~500M - ~1Bn yearly revenue).

The position is for a Release Engineering Internship where I believe I would be working mostly with C# and the .NET stack.

The salary offered is 30$/hr (already confirmed in offer letter).

My main goal for a future internship would be to work at Google/Amazon/Microsoft.

Should I hold out for a better offer or is this about as good an offer that I am going to get as a freshman CS student? This would be my first ""industry experience"", as my previous experience comes from working in 2 research labs (Robotics + Bioinformatics) during my freshman year. 

I have not heard back from Microsoft even though I applied several months ago and applied to Lockheed Martin as well with no response either. I was already rejected from the Google Engineering Practicum this year as well. At this point should I just consider this a rejection and accept my existing offer?"

I was going to post this under my normal username but it went a little darker that I though it would so I've made a throw away account to post it.

I don't really know where to put this and offmychest seems to be somewhat of a catchall. I never write/type what I think and am not sure what this post is going to turn into.

I'm just so tired. Mentally and physically, life just seems like it's kicking my ass. I'm 29 college educated and should by all means be able to be maintaining at least. But I'm not. I'm going to skip over a lot but my biggest mistake of my life was deciding to go to college. I thought I'd do it right, start in community college, transfer to city college and then if necessary go somewhere “good” once I knew what I wanted to do. I did that but when all was said and done I ended up still ending up with $144,000 in loans before interest for a useless art degree in commercial photography. May things went wrong in school such as my car getting totaled in a hit and run, roommates disappearing and leaving me to foot rent bills I couldn't afford and other roommates stealing my portion of the rent eventually getting evicted, regressing into serious depression (major depressive disorder or MDD specifically). Regardless I worked my ass off, didn't party, did what I was told was good work, made connections and had a shitty full time job while assisting and doing bit work on the side to support myself during and after school. Then the loans started to come due.

My god I had no idea what I had gotten myself into. I've had a job since 14 and had never bought anything I couldn't afford, or even had a credit card. I had always just known if I couldn't afford it I would just have to do without. Counselors, teachers, and my parents had told me I needed a good education to succeed though and I foolishly dove head first into what now are $1400ish a month loan payments.

I quit my job and moved back home as soon as I realized I wasn't making nearly enough to cover, rent, food, phone bills, anything, and the loans. Unfortunately the same week I saw the number I'd need to be paying my car's transmission failed. So, I basically abandoned everything I owned, that I couldn't sell on craiglist including the car (I did get $1200 for a car I had paid $2700 for a year earlier), in the month I had before the first wave of loans were due. Using that money I bought a $1600 car in CA where I was knowing that would get me much less in CT, put everything else I had in it and drove across the country where all my degree reliant connections were useless, with the hope that I'd be able to find a job while living at home where I could make headway on repaying the loans. If anything in my life has been stable I at least have great and supportive parents. They know they made the wrong call convincing me to go to school and co-signing the loans but they've still helped me out more than I can say.

That has sort of worked. It took 4 months to find a job, It started with an internship that paid $10 an hour at a furniture store in their advertising department composting in After Effects which I was new to. It was supposed to last one month at which point they would hire me if I proved myself. In the month before the internship began I treated learning the program like a job and on my second day at the internship they were using stuff I was making in ads. Just the same they kept me on at 10hr for 3 months instead of 1 but then did higher me on salaried at $32,000 a year. I thought that was going to be ok. 

Then my engine blew up in the $1600 car that got me across the country. It was a Toyota Celica that got 30ish mpg on the cheap gas. This was important as I've got to drive about 50miles a day to get to and from work. My parents thankfully had a 3rd car that they've now been lending me for over a year. It turned out that after taxes and benefits my take home from the job as a compositor is only $1920 a month. The student loans being paid back at the minimum are about $1300 a month, that this third car gets 17mpg on 93 octane so it's costing me about $300 a month to get to work. I'm trying to save up to fix my car as I can't find anything reasonable locally that I have any hope is going to keep running. I'm pretty much stuck going nowhere.

I paid over $15,000 in interest on just one of the 3 loans I have last year an was only able to take $2000 off the principle. At The current rate of repayment if the variable interest rates don't go up I'll be paying these off until I'm over 65. I'm only able to survive right now because my parents are paying for pretty much everything other than the loans, and my dad is 70.

I've picked up a second job on the weekends picking up medical laundry. It brings in another $100ish a week which I'm hoping to used to pay off other bills and maybe eventually get my car running with but it's so disheartening. I'm a 29 year old, living at home with his parents, driving their car, working full time in an advertising department for a company that brings in $100,000,000 a month (I don't see what everything cost just sales numbers) making a take home of just $10.83 an hour with a $144,000 degree, literally picking up shit stained sheets from a convalescent home on the weekends. Not that I have much free time with the full time job with an hour commute each way during the week and the part time job but I have lost all interest in things that I had enjoyed. Biking, photography, snowboarding, even videogames and tv. I've lost any interest in dating and haven't even tried to see anyone in over 4 years.

It doesn't help that I've fallen back into depression badly too. Last November I voluntarily went to the ER room for an “emergency evaluation” after my Psychiatrist, therapist and normal doctor all called me during work one day asking me to. I ended up being kept there and being put in the in-patient psych ward for being “passively suicidal.” This was all sorts of not helpful because even with my insurance I then had $2500 bill that my I've been dealing with. I was told I was supposed to attend an out patient program but it was going to cost another $10,000 of which insurance would cover some of but still leave me with an additional $2500 bill. I didn't do it for that reason. I'm honestly not better than I was when I went in. Not that I don't think about it all the time, but I'm not going to kill myself because it'd just put the loans on my parents. Between having to face a dead son and that I'd never do that to them. 

So I just go on day to day going through the paces. I've tried so hard to do the right thing, the honest way, not take advantage of people, not be a burden on my parents, but I just feel like a leech. I just feel like a hollow shell who's sole point is to generate profit for the banks that own my loans, and the company I work for. I'm so unbelievably stressed and depressed I feel like sleep has no regenerative benefit anymore. I can sleep 8, 10, 12, 14 hours and I still have people tell me I look exhausted. I genuinely have trouble remembering what feeling happy, or glad, or hopeful feels like. I'm told that's got something to do with the MDD and synapses in my brain making poor connections or something. 

I don't know. I was hoping writing this might help me shed some light on what to do or something or be therapeutic. It didn't and wasn't. Oh well at least I got it off my chest? (insert fake laugh)"

I have been dealing with undiagnosed depression since early middle school.  It is undiagnosed because up until recently I have been pretty good at keeping all of my negative feelings an self-hatred to myself.  On top of that, I have never been one to believe in institutions.  I honestly believe they only make people like me convenient to live with, for others, rather than to actually help me.  

I have recently told my mother of my self-hatred, and how I strongly considered suicide in middle school due to bullying, and I wish I hadn't because she thinks everything I do, now, is because I hate myself.  I have not been a bullying target since the end of middle school, but my on views on myself are becoming too much for me to deal with.  Every time I look in the mirror in the morning I become furious because how I look is never good enough.  

I am in college and I truly have no idea what I am doing with my life anymore.  I hate my major and am convinced I could not thrive in anything I might enjoy.  My fraternity recently placed me on academic probation because of a class that should not have been an issue in the first place.  For the record, I joined a fraternity in hopes that my life would in turn become better, you know, surround yourself with a positive outlook and whatnot.  Well, I am no longer welcome there for the majority of the events now because of my academic status, so I turned to weed and loneliness because of how unwelcome I now feel around the place.  

I have a girlfriend who says she loves me, but my self-hatred won't let me grasp why the hell anyone would enjoy the presence of me.  She knows how I feel about myself and that I feel that I am only having a negative impact on her life.  She tries to calm me down at times like these but she just doesn't know how to anymore.  

I'm sick of not being able to do anything for myself anymore.  Showering is becoming more not worth it everyday, and eating is becoming a luxury that I feel like I shouldn't have.  People that I reach out to feel that I am simply wanting them to do my work for me.  I am looking for an internship but don't even know how to begin.  I have stopped smoking weed, so now I can't sit and reconcile on my life without becoming more distressed.  

I have more to say on my situation but I feel it won't make any logical sense because of how distressed I am at the moment.  I feel like I am losing control of my emotions and can't get a hold of my life anymore.  Everything is becoming too much and I am too tired to fight anymore.

UIUC - top 5 CE program, but lower ranked overall, cold and harsh weather, perhaps unappealing location. UCLA - top 15 CE program, high overall university ranking, high brand value, great weather, urban campus.

My priority is getting a job or going to a top notch grad school after 4 years, and am keen to have the best possible education/skills in the subject, and land great internships and research opportunities on the way. Which university would be the one to go for?

Thanks so much for helping me make this crucial decision.

- social experience/scene
- opportunity for intellectual development (socially and academically)
- availability/ease to get into the classes I want
- impact of school size (Swarthmore is small, UCLA is huge)
- job opportunities (internships, etc.), and how important job opportunities are over a well-rounded academic experience.
- entrepreneurship

I think I would already fit in really well at UCLA, but I think I would be exposed to a completely new social and academic experience at a top liberal arts college (which is somewhat exciting, even scary!). I really am conflicted between the two :/ What are you opinions?"

**44,480 villagers** spamming ""A"" for for **4 years!**

*Written by /u/Superburke who was too busy unintentionally catching bass.*

You open your eyes and find yourself on a train going.... where? You're not quite sure. In the corner of your eye you see a blue and white cat eyeing you up, before getting up and sidling towards you. He asks you for the time. You tell him it's about 2:55PM. He asks if he can sit across from you. You still don't know where you're going or who this animal is. For some reason, this all seems perfectly normal to you.  He asks for your name. You repeat it back to him. You remark that you think it's quite a cute name. He agrees, saying he thinks you're a ""pretty cool gal."" Wait a minute. You're a guy. You correct him, resulting in him apologising and confirming your gender one final time. He asks you where you're going. You realize you get to *choose* where you're going. You tell him a generic town name, not realizing this is one of the most important decisions you'll ever make.

He shows you a map of the town you claimed to be going to and you confirm the map is accurate. Suddenly, a chime plays and the train comes to a halt. You get off the train after saying goodbye to the cat and exit the train station. A group of animals await your arrival. In hushed voices, they discuss something before shouting greetings towards you. A dog starts yapping things to you about your mayorship. You're quite confused. You still don't know who any of these animals are. After dwelling in thought for a second, it occurs to you that there was a monkey driving the train you were on a minute ago, and that everyone around you is an animal of some kind. The dog whisks you away to the town hall, yaps some more things you don't really listen to, then tells you to head up to a real estate agent in the upper part of town. Before you take your leave, she subtly mentions that you are now officially the mayor of the town.

You head up to the train station where you arrived not minutes ago and cross the tracks. You spot a unit named ""Nook's Homes"" and head inside. An overly enthusiastic raccoon somehow sells you a house and you now have a temporary home in the form of a tent and a sizable mortgage in the town's official currency, bells.

It's been about a year since you arrived in the town. You're still somehow the mayor. You've completed quite a few projects in the town, like a coffee shop *( where you now work, )* some benches, a campsite and a dream suite. Your bell count is a number too big for you to be able to count. You've been to a tropical island where you met the former mayor and earned some sweet rewards. You've caught every bug and fish in the book. You've paid off your mortgage and have started paying mansion tax due to the sheer size of your house. You think you've finally made it.


In reality, you're just getting started.

Welcome to the life-sucking void that is Animal Crossing.




/r/AnimalCrossing is a tight-knit community revolving around the Nintendo game, Animal Crossing. With posts ranging from [artistic interpretations](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/225jxb/recreated_a_beautiful_drawing_as_best_as_i_could/) to [frog death threats](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1gyjdw/extra_bells/). Everyone is always [happy to help](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/30nin5/do_villagers_always_move_into_the_same_plot/) with any questions, concerns -- or anything really. Even the villagers [chip in](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/30n4bw/so_i_sent_a_letter_to_this_villager_when_i_was/) with your problems sometimes. Sister subreddits include /r/ACTrade, ( allows for easy organising of item trading ) /r/ACTurnips, ( helps you to top the stalk market ) /r/DreamCrossing ( to visit others towns ) and /r/RateMyMayor ( a quite clever rating system used to determine the legitimacy of individual players, determined by ratings left by other players. ) Of course, as with every subreddit, /r/AnimalCrossing has [its](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1gvs99/not_what_i_thought_it_was/) [own](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1h8tyh/oh_retail_xpost_from_rgaming/) [humour](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1gklwi/told_my_wife_to_visit_my_house_and_lie_on_the_bed/). One of the best parts of Animal Crossing is the level of customization given to you in your house. With that in mind, there [certainly](http://imgur.com/a/X3M98) [isn't a](http://imgur.com/a/yOGEd) [shortage](http://i.imgur.com/trp089x.jpg) [of inspiration](http://imgur.com/a/Pvyez) [for your](http://imgur.com/a/zu9cc) [latest crib](http://imgur.com/a/uPwZ3)! 



I sat down the lovely moderators for a coffee at the roost and asked some questions.



&gt; #1. Tell us a bit about yourself!

 &gt;&gt; **/u/LadyDrac**  I'm a late 20-something residing in the state of Washington who enjoys Animal Crossing just a wee bit too much. My dog is learning Pavlovian theory for nerds. The sound of my DS closing makes him extremely excitable because he knows that it means it's finally time to go play outside or do something fun together. Husband has also started to become trained and now knows to take a detour through the McDonalds when we drive by for ""that streetpass thing."" I would make Kapp'n proud with my job in the cruise industry and I only wish I had a ship of my own to christen as the Cucumber of the Seas.

&gt; #2. How did you initially get involved in the /r/AnimalCrossing community?

 &gt;&gt; **/u/LadyDrac**  I would not be happy with my game until I had obtained everything... and part of everything was grabbing an elusive 7-11 set before duping was commonplace. Naturally, Reddit was the place to come! Eventually, someone decided it would be a good idea to make me a mod since I was always involved with answering peoples' questions about the game or sharing new information based on what I had learned in my own game or research I had done.

 &gt;&gt; **/u/E_lucas**  I started this subreddit a while back when talking with another redditor around /r/gaming or something, and we realized there was no Animal Crossing sub. It was started then had absolutely no community for a year or so. Began to pick up around the launch of New Leaf, and even those with previous iterations only discovered the sub late (and now their online capability has been shut down ;_;)

&gt; #3. If you have one, what is your favourite post of all time on /r/AnimalCrossing?

 &gt;&gt; **/u/LadyDrac**  It's too hard to limit two years of participation down to a single post. There have been so many posts here that have restored my faith in the goodness of others, made me laugh hard enough that I couldn't breathe, or impressed me with a skill or talent that truly took dedication to master. Each post here truly captures that so many different people with so many different interests and so many different play styles can still come together as a community over something as simple as a video game.

 &gt;&gt; **/u/E_lucas**  I don't think it's possible to pick a single post that stands out. My favourites will always be fan art and comics. You can almost project your own emotions on to how people interact with their villagers. Everyone constantly talks about their ""dreamies"" and their best possible population. It's hard to explain the connections you make with the NPC's, but they have so much personality that they become a huge part of what the game is. When people put down on paper how they feel when a villager does something awesome, or dumb, or moves away, everyone who plays AC can relate.

&gt; #4. A very important question; who is your favourite villager ( or other character! ) in Animal Crossing?

 &gt;&gt; **/u/LadyDrac**  There are too many characters that I truly enjoy to pick just one so I guess I will share my top three favorites. I'll start with the NPCs first. Phyllis is probably my all-time favorite just because her snarky remarks just crack me up. She's admittedly lost some bite in New Leaf so I really miss the ""real"" Phyllis from games past but I can understand why Nintendo made the effort to tone her down... children really wouldn't understand the ""disgruntled postal worker"" vibe she gives off. Next up, I have to admit Celeste is just too adorable for her own good and is probably my favorite ""sweet"" character to balance out Phyllis' bite. She is just so beyond cute in the Animal Crossing Movie that if I lived in the town, I would probably spend a lot of my time in the museum with her! For my favorite villager character, I have to admit Vesta has been my favorite for a while now. She loves to sew and craft just like me and she always seems to be positive even if it's a crummy, rainy day.

 &gt;&gt; **/u/E_lucas**  Genji is my favourite villager and gym bro, Brewster, because I'm a coffee addict, and Pascal, because he's just so chill.. maan. Of course KK also has a special place in my heart, but that's a given for everyone.

&gt; #5. Is there anything else you'd like to share?

 &gt;&gt; **/u/LadyDrac**  I guess I'll end this by saying I am so proud to be part of such a caring community and I feel honored that so many people (around the world even!) look to me for help or reliable knowledge in the game. I am honestly just a girl behind the screen with an intense love for Animal Crossing but so many people have put their faith in me to provide accurate information and keep the community running smoothly. It's just very humbling and I very much appreciate all of the support and encouragement I have received from the community. Lastly, I would encourage anyone who checks out /r/AnimalCrossing to also please check out and support our sister communities linked in our sub wiki. We all work together to truly make the Animal Crossing Reddit community a safe and enjoyable place and they deserve just as much credit, if not more, for making this little corner of Reddit worthwhile &amp;amp;lt;3

 &gt;&gt; **/u/E_lucas**  I just want to shoutout to the Animal Crossing community as a whole. I don't think there is a gaming community out there who is as nice and ready to help out a fellow villager/mayor at any moment. From all the boards, IRC's, etc. that I've been a part of over the years, the community really becomes as much as a village as those in our games.

Now, excuse me whilst I go attend to my weeds.

310zej,80,2015-04-01,I'm completely stuck.,SyntheticalFox,japan,https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/310zej/im_completely_stuck/,"Background: I came to Japan for my end of study project then got hired in the company after completion of the internship. I got laid off a few month later and after 2 months of depression staying at home the hard reality hit me: I'm broke.

I left my place today as it was both the end of the lease and the time until which I had paid the rent.

My residence card expires in 15 days.

My problem: I cannot either go back to France or stay here.

I am currently at Narita airport and my plan was to try and buy a last minute plane ticket to France, UK or Germany but I only have 29k JPY in my possession but the last minute plane tickets are 400k+ JPY...

I cannot not buy a plane ticket online because my baking card expired during my stay. I also only have 300 EUR left on the account.

If I go back to Tokyo I will be homeless and soon both illegal and broke.

I know that I'm stupid for waiting until I am cornered to ask for help. I don't know what to do. Any idea is greatly appreciated.

Update: The tables have turned quite a bit. The French consulate answered me with a screenshot of the Air France website showing several 340 USD tickets. I went there by myself and got the same results, while a one way would be 2570 USD. I will go to the counter and ask for a round trip tomorrow.

Update 2: This doesn't look good the counter plane tickets are way more expensive than the ones online. I've tried Turkish Airlines and Etihad Airlines and in both cases the plane ticket was way more expensive at the counter compared to the price displayed online. I'll see what I do after tomorrow morning after seeing what happens at the Air France counter.


Update3: Apr 2nd 04:37 Narita Airport

Thank you all for your support. At this point I still don't have a surefire way to go back to France.
I managed to stay at the airport for the night with the  people that are waiting for their morning flight.

Here's the current plan of action I've decided:

- I will try to buy an inexpensive plane ticket at the Air France counter using cash when it opens at 08:00. I estimate the probability of success to be very low both because I still only have 29k JPY but also because other companies have shown to raise the price on airport cash payment. I might as well try since I'm here.

- If this fails I will go to the embassy and ask them if it is possible that they help me buy the Etihad tickets online in exchange for cash.

I still have got 14 days on the resident card and need to go to the immigration office in person in order to deal with visa issues so this matter is postponed for now.
Once I leave the airport I don't know when I will be able to read this topic again so good bye for now.

Update 4: Apr 2th, Shibuya Starbucks, 12:09

I left the airport early in order to be at the embassy in the middle of opening hours. They want me to contact my family which is the last thing I want to do.

For that reason I'm trying to contact a friend and ask him to book and pay the flight for me.

I have a meeting with the consulate this this afternoon where they will basically force me to accept to call my family.

Final update: Apr 2nd, Narita Airport, 22:40

At around 15:00 an old friend of mine offered to lend me the the money and buy the ticket as soon as he read my message. He basically gave me control over my path again.

My flight leaves tomorrow at 21:30. Thanks everyone for sharing your knowledge and support. I learnt a lot. It helped me go through this. I wish you all good fortune in Japan -in my stead haha."

31161i,1,2015-04-01,I finally opened up to someone and promptly got crushed (relationship and break-up vent),Kartoffelplotz,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/31161i/i_finally_opened_up_to_someone_and_promptly_got/,"So, I know this is not going to be a greek tragedy or a Shakespearean drama. There is no illness, no accidents, no deaths in here, just me and my meager problems. But I need to write it off my chest anyway, so here it goes... 

A little background on me that's important to the story: I grew up in a family with four sons and I was the youngest of the four, so as a child I was constantly battling for attention and 'friendship' (among brothers) with my older brothers. But the oldest one is nine years older than me, the second oldest seven years and the third brother four years. Naturally, my next oldest brother was the person closest to me in my family, as my mother had her hands full with four sons, my father worked a lot and my two oldest brothers were close enough in age to have a common circle of friends and were very close in between themselves, (somewhat naturally) leaving out us two younger brothers. When I was nine, said next oldest brother commited suicide. It devastated our family but me especially as I lost the person closest to me, the person I'd crawl in bed with on Sunday mornings, the person that'd help me set up 'dates' in elementary school... 

Following that I had a pretty rough time in school, I was easily hurt, tended to lash out and was pretty unstable. Combine that with being small and scrawny and you got the perfect victim for bullying. All this led to me pretty much shutting myself off from any intimate relations and not letting anyone getting close to me. During university I had several girls trying to establish relationships and whenever I sniffed out their intents, I pushed them away / broke off contact and justified it to myself by focusing on little flaws and telling myself that they were absolute dealbreakers. So as of now, I am a 27 year old man that has never had a stable relationship.

**The actual story**

5 1/2 month ago, I temporarily moved to another town for a 6 month internship. At one of the intern meet-ups fairly early on, I met a girl who I hit it off with. Not right away, this was no 'we met and it was instant love' fairytale. No, this was interest in one another that slowly grew into more. And this time I forced myself to go on with it and finally take the risk. It took us until about two month ago to even finally kiss and get our attraction out in the open. Her being very shy didn't exactly help the situation, considering my inexperience with dealing with those situations.

Anyway, after this we spent some incredibly nice weekends with each other, I felt... comfortable with her. I just relaxed when lying in her arms and felt good, no strings attached. As someone who's mind is normally constantly racing, this was a pretty big deal.

Cue: Yesterday. Her internship ended that day and today she moves back to her university town to continue her studies. And somehow, neither of us has had the guts before to force the issue of what's going to happen with us now, so it all came down to the last moment. We met with another friend as a bar (so he could say goodbye to her as well) and had some beers and afterwards I waited for the subway with her and we finally had to face the facts. She asked me for my opinion and I told her that I would want to try it long distance. And then she told me that she could not imagine it to work. 

Needless to say I was devastated and I should have walked away right there and then. Take the loss and get on. But no, I stuck around, we talked, went over to my place (that was nearby), talked, kissed, cuddled and for long times didn't talk at all but just sat there, contemplating the fucked up situation. At some point I even finally flat out told her that I loved her, but what good was it at that point?

She left at around 2:00 AM because she needed fresh air and time to think. I haven't heard from her since (not that I'd have expected it), but my guts feel like the gordian knot. I just want to engage in the sort of mellow alcoholism, where you buy a bottle of vodka and some beers in the morning and then proceed *not* to get shitfaced in the morning and spend the day passed out but rather keep a nice level of 'constantly drunk'. But, alas, I have to work of course. So here I sit, at work, not being able to focus at fucking all and feeling like shit. I don't even know what to feel, I wildly sway between accepting that she is gone and clinging to the hope that she comes around and reevaluates her position. Most fucked up thing? The moments when I realize that I have to consider her gone are the ones when I feel good.

Oh, and another thing: This is happening in Germany, so it is now 9:50 AM and distances are not quite the same magnitude as in the US.

So... yea. I needed to get this off my chest. It felt good just typing it out.

**tl;dr: Have had bonding issues ever since childhood due to traumatic events, finally force myself to let an intimate relationship happen, promptly get my heart crushed.**"
3116fd,1,2015-04-01,Just letting it ALL out{Long Read},[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3116fd/just_letting_it_all_outlong_read/,"**I don't expect anyone at all to read this. I just wrote it because I need to let it out.**

This isn't my first account, nor my second. In a fit of pointless stupidity I deleted my first two at different moments. I'm depressed, borderline suicidal. I spend 16 hours a day in my bed. I haven't worked in 3 months, nor have I have any reason to go to school. I graduated in December. 

You see I grew up really depressed. As a kid and teen I had an embarrassing medical issue. As I grew up I had no real friends; my real friends picked on me. I was kicked out of my high school for not trying, kicked out of my college and nearly kicked out of university. Somehow, I managed to still make it through the education system.

No girl every really liked me. I was barely any girl's friend, let alone her boyfriend. When I was 18 I got my first girlfriend and she happened to be my bestfriend beforehand. I remember being happy, feeling wanted and everything. I had waited years for someone to acknowledge I exist in a positive manner. Although I got kicked out of my high school, I was in advanced courses but no one took me as someone intelligent, in fact I was an idiot and I got bullied and told that straight to my face, along with other nasty words.

When I finally had someone I liked and who liked me back I thought This.Is.It. FINALLY someone who likes me for who I am. She even told me she loved me and I did the same! One day her father found out of my existence and she left me. Not because I was a bad person, but rather I wasn't the same religion as her. Given that we were good friends prior I imagined she'd give me a chance to say goodbye or at least stay in touch. Instead, she played with me. I tried to stay in her life and she would give me elaborate stories such as her father beating on her every time I contacted her. I felt so much pain, helplessness and confusion. I wanted to help so badly. Then she told me one day, she didn't have the heart to tell me she didn't want to be with me anymore so just made stories up, hoping I'd leave. Who does that? Who invents stories about being abused in hopes someone would leave? I didn't and I got played because of it. It took I think 6-7 months for me to see her and just get an ounce of closure. Back then, not everyone had an iphone so it was a different dynamic.

I had failed college at this point and every opportunity to earn my way back in was worse than the last one. I'd get an 65 in math(needed at 75) and the second time I'd try? 39. The third, 24. I just didn't care, I was so depressed.

When I turned 19 I had fallen so deep into depression I began to do cocaine. I would do 2-4 grams of uncut cocaine a night. The drug dealer was my friend so I got a 'cost price' and if I didn't, I wouldn't be able to afford it. I remember not being able to afford it once and telling my father ""I need money for school"" and he paid me. I took every single bill and snorted gram after gram of cocaine with it. I lied to my own father and stole from him in order to get cocaine, I was ashamed but I couldn't stop. 

I remember how it made me feel. I was so depressed the feeling of cocaine made me want to express myself. I would talk intelligently with friends about things and I'd feel liberated and every single time without fail the come down would happen. I'd get paranoid. I'd drive but I had my eyes on the rear view mirror looking for cops - and I thought everyone was a cop - more than I had it on the actual road. I remember driving onto a sidewalk once and not noticing until I fell off and my car thumped.

I had met this girl online at the time, a friend of a friend. I enjoyed her company. I was always picky and this was no exception. I liked her, I remember at the time running to MSN messenger at 8 pm every day because that's when she'd be on. I'd pretend of course, appear offline, wait 5 minutes then casually go online and ""hey"" you know? The old trick. I remember sometimes I actually was disappointed because I'd do the 5 minute wait and she'd go offline after 4, presumably because no one was on.

I had grown to like her but always felt I was kind of 'trying too hard' and she was out of my league. She really was/is beautiful you know. Smart, funny, playful, a great listener, etc...but I had no chance.

I tried to stop cocaine but I had a hard time. I was always high as fuck, paranoid. I remember I had been driving my friends home at 2 am but staying out till 5-6-7 am driving in circles around my neighborhood and sneaking to random streets to park and do a line. I couldn't even snort right, 4 am and I had my eyes looking out for someone to catch me. I lost count on how many times I wasn't even paying attention to the snorting and cut my nose with a fresh mint bill. Most times I wouldn't notice until my hand was covered in blood and the bill was red. I was too high to notice.

What I did to quit is I had about 300$ worth(8 grams or so) of cocaine on me for casual use. It was no different than the other times except I was tired of feeling like a freak. I remember my coke 'buddies' said ""X person is in the hall of fame!"" for coke use. I was in the hall of shame. It was brutal. So that night I threw away the 300$ worth into the wind. I crushed the rocks into a fine powder, opened the ziplock and threw it away, 300$ worth. I was unemployed, no job, nothing. I had stolen from my parents, 300$ worth of cocaine at cost price was gold to me yet I did it anyway.

I drove home and my friend asked me if I had any left. I told him no, it was all gone. I threw it away in hopes that I would never do it again. I tried to brainwash myself, in a good way. Buying coke at this point wouldn't be logical, I had 300$ worth and threw it away. I challenged the depth of my pride because if I went back now I would have to admit I had a problem without a doubt. I had too much pride and I stopped cold turkey. I stopped talking to my friends, I needed to.

Before I had stopped I had lost my virginity to some random chick double my age. Yay right? No really. It was weird. It later caused me a plethora of problems. I did it because I felt I'd be alone forever and I didn't really know what would happen that night. I had slept with her but then she was passed around(willingly). I felt like a moron, what was I doing? Problem is, I barely got hard and I didn't cum the first time. I marched back in and had sex with her again, desperate to say I had 'officially' had sex. I was a 20 year old virgin, 50% away from a movie about me. I felt desperate and alone, it was stupid.

Turns out the girl I liked also liked me. We met in December of 2007 and I was clean and working morning shifts for a parcel service. I went out for drinks to meet this girl after nearly a year of online talking(yah, we took it slow) and she was drunk before she met me. She was so nervous to meet me she had drank too much to let loose. I ended up taking care of her that night, her friends came by and told me to watch it or else...then they walked away and abandoned their friend. I didn't do a thing but I resented the way they acted towards me, like I was the bad guy somehow. 

She told me she was going again the week after and I went too. We clicked again and had our first kiss. My friend told me she was out of my league and to give up but I was sure she was the girl for me. 

We started being official in early 2008. I continued to work and did better in school. I got a new job, got promoted quickly a few times and felt important. My old job was annoying and every time I offered suggestions they told me ""You can do it your way if you're supervisor"". It was frustrating because I knew I was intelligent. 

I said fuck it and went back to school as an engineer. At first, same problem as usual, no effort. I was told I was on probation and it would be kicked out if I didn't improve. That's when it clicked, *not again*. Not this time. I thought of myself as a father, husband, role model. I wanted to make my parents proud, I wanted to be proud of myself. I did it, I worked my ass off and boosted my marks up substantially to the point I was regarded as very smart by my peers, something no one even told me in high school, let alone university.

I remember in 2008 my GF got breast surgery to correct what she felt was a deformity. We had only dated a month and I had no business getting involved but I regret it anyway. An implant would be put in order to correct an issue. The implant would go 'under' the muscle or something and wouldn't be noticeable. Problem is, it never happened. The implant didn't blend in seamlessly as predicted. It caused my GF much discomfort and depression and I was there for her. She told me once she removed her implants I would likely leave. That was ridiculous but she believed it, somehow. She removed it after 3 years we dated or something like that. During that time she had nose surgery as well.

She battled depression and the girl who had inspired me and been there for me and believed in me was no longer as optimistic and cheerful. She was sad. The depression got worse, to the point I was told to ""kill myself"", insulted, broken up with, etc... It was abusive but she'd apologize within a day, citing her depression and impulsiveness as the main reasons for the outbursts.

It continued for some time, she told me she was suicidal being at home with her mother but I hadn't graduated yet so didn't have the resources to support a move. She was on the verge of doing so...just barely. I had taken classes with her and allowed her to cheat off me in certain situations.

I told myself I would spend 2014 finishing my last year of university and working 12 months of full time internships at same time. I slaved to the bone. I did it because I wanted to put a down payment on a house or condo or something. 

I remember in April, I had finished my first internship that had me at work at 6 am and out of school at 9 pm. Add in travel times and everything, I was destroyed. I was so exhausted I could barely handle myself. Add in her depression to worry about and her insults and everything. I was just drained.

I had put on a lot of weight during my time at school, mostly because I hate most vegetables and secondly because I eat more junk when I'm stressed. Comfort food. She hated it and I don't blame her.

In may she left me, citing loss of attraction. It was fine though, I was determined to lose the weight at this point anyway. Summer semester, less classes, more time for fitness baby! She left me May 17th. May 21st I woke up in cold sweat feeling she was with another man. Later that day she told me she was texting another guy. It broke my heart. She had no friends, she was depressed. I wanted to say ""don't talk to him"" but I swallowed my pride and said ""as long as it's a text buddy"" and she assured me she'd never meet him but was curious. She began to tell me she liked him in one form or another, that he was her 'type' or that the words he said turned her on. It frustrated me and our relationship of 6 years was coming to a very important point. I told her, if she met him so soon, it would disrespect me beyond belief after everything I've done. Not to mention she told me she just needed time and would try us again in the near future.

I spent the next few weeks arguing with her, trying to understand how she let a text buddy get between us. There was no logic to it and I thrive on logic, I went mad. 

June 7th, I found out she met him and told her she betrayed me. She promised she wouldn't. I asked her to see me, she refused. I said my goodbyes and was ready to move on, albeit painfully. 

She called me like 15-20 times that night and love got the better of me, I called her back the next day and she wanted to talk and would stop talking to the other guy. We got back together June 8th.

I gave her a chance. I met her and she confessed they shared a make out session at his house but that was all.

I felt different from that moment. I felt my idealism in romance just get to me. She would ask me, ""where do you want to move?"" and I'd say ""I'm looking for a place on my own"". 

She went through another surgery in august, jaw surgery for open bite. I wasn't a fan, still not but she insisted that she couldn't live without doing it. She did it and the surgeon screwed up.

I remember during the time not understanding what had transpired June 7th. I battled it in my head for so long, I felt lied to. In September she did a revision for the surgery and it wasn't better. I remember asking her, ""did you tell me the truth?"" several times during the summer and she insisted I was crazy to think otherwise and that I should let it go. This time, she cracked. I was at work and I needed to leave. I left and she told me, ""I cheated on you and I had foreplay with the guy. I met him May 9th, may 20th and June 7th behind your back"".

I began to have panic attacks and severe depression. I saw a therapist. I broke up with her but we remained essentially 'together' but not really.

Her 2nd surgery wasn't any better. I remember feeling so hurt that I told her I would be seeing other people for the same purpose she met that guy. I met 2 girls, a date each and while I kissed them I didn't feel anything. I couldn't relate and the pain wouldn't go away.

I kept asking her ""Did you tell me everything?"" and little by little details started to come out that would tear me apart but I have a NEED to know this stuff. She insisted and swore on my life that she had said everything. After her 3rd surgery, I asked again. She confessed that she had slept with the guy. 

She isn't happy with her 3rd surgery but more details have come out, minor details but details that kill me inside. I'm her only friend and she's my bestfriend but I think this whole situation has killed me on the inside. I feel dead inside. I've tried killing myself twice by mixing my panic attack meds and hard liquor but I guess I wasn't into it.

Every single day I wake up thinking I'm suicidal and the girl who I care about, who hurt me, is suicidal too. It's a mindfuck. She says she'll kill herself and if she does, I'm a goner. I love her even though I'm mindfucked about what is left in terms of trust for our relationship. I'm caught in a position where I can't breathe or else either I or she will die and I feel so fucking miserable. She's miserable too. I should note, she was always good to me, apart from when she got depressed. She helped me through a lot and I'll never forget it. I'm foolish in some ways but I'm extremely loyal. Just at this point, I'm completely lost and I can no longer breathe without fear of my life or hers.

**If you made it this far, thank you for reading. I just needed to let it out.**"
3119qv,2,2015-04-01,I [23M] dated one of my best friends [25F] and I'm afraid we have destroyed our friendship,selonsaintmathieu,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3119qv/i_23m_dated_one_of_my_best_friends_25f_and_im/,"I feel like this must be a pretty common story, however I don't know how to solve this.

So, I started college in 2010 and after one month I met this girl. She was witty, funny, we had a lot of things in common and we soon became very close friends. I'm pretty sure that there already was a mutual physical attraction but we managed to implicitly draw a clear line and for four years our relationship was an unambiguous friendship.

That's until last summer. At some point in last July we started to date each other, things happened quite naturally. She is the one that initiated it. Things went really well for two months, and I became really infatuated with her. Then at some point by the end of september (that's my guess) she started to lose interest for some reason. I don't know what caused this and I genuinely don't care, the thing is that she didn't *said* so and left me in a one-sided relationship, most likely because she feared hurting me. While she never said that she wanted our relationship to end, she distanced herself sharply : she left many of my calls / text messages unanswered, for which she kept giving obviously fake reasons. Now at this time I was in love and I wanted this relationship to work, and she never said things clearly, and when I got to meet her she acted casually and to me it felt like nothing had changed so this went on for approximately two more months, until the end of november. Needless to say, I felt miserable for most of these two months (well, most likely both of us did) and I slowly started to slip into depression. At some point it became obvious that this was becoming really bad for the both of us, so I confronted her about this and she admitted that she wanted our relationship to end and had wanted it for some time. To which I answered that it was okay, that we could just go back to being friends like we were before ; I think we were both really relieved. The thing is that it wasn't exactly true and that I was still infatuated, and actually quite bitter about the way it ended - so not a good ground for a working friendship eh (please note that I only realise this clearly in hindsight).

After that, things are going quite better until Christmas. Just before Christmas we're having a party where old college friends are coming back to town, and I get wasted, like *seriously* wasted. I don't really know what I did that night but I'm pretty sure that she didn't liked the way I behaved. At some point in the night she told me ""you remind me of J"" (J is a guy that harassed her through text messages for a while) - this shocked me and she pretended she was taking the piss but I'm not sure she was and even if she was there's a reason why she chose *that* way of taking the piss. I know for a fact that I didn't get touchy or anything but I was drunk as a skunk and I might have said a few things that lacked subtlety - to put it mildly. I didn't apologize after that - mostly because I didn't know what to apologize for (also probably out of bitterness and shame, and to be honest I'm pretty sure it was actually not a big deal and that it would have gone unnoticed in another context). I felt really bad after that and at this point I realized that I wasn't in the right set of mind to be a good friend anymore and so I stopped trying to contact her for a while (well, unfortunately I drunk texted her once a few weeks later but it was just some random bullshit, nothing personnal).

Right after the Christmas vacations I started an internship in a firm, which meant that we didn't get to see each other daily in college the way we used to. In february, I start dating another girl. By the end of february, I randomly meet my former friend / girlfriend (the one this story is about) again at a party. By this time she's been out of my life for almost two months and I'm certain to have lost any romantic interest in her. Things are a bit awkward in the beginning but we end up chatting casually, having a real good time and a few good laughs. So I'm feeling great, and I'm thinking that all of this is finally over and we can serenely go back to being friends again just like in dem good ol' times. I said something along the lines of ""hey we should hang up again some time"" and she seemed enthusiastic.

The thing is that I've been trying to contact her since then, but have received no answer. I'm not harassing her at all, I've sent maybe three messages in a month, random things like ""hey I'm going to X's place tonight, do you wanna come ?"" - you know, things friends do, and I've been extra extra careful never to offer anything where there would be only the two of us. To make things more difficult my best friend (like my very very best friend, we spend evenings together maybe one day out of two) is also one of her friends (we all belonged to a very tight knit group of friends in the first years of college that was eventually spread out) and he's not aware that we were in a relationship (he was away when all of this happened), he keeps trying to invite her at his place but she keeps dodging it under phony pretexts - I'm pretty sure she fears that I'll be here too (and quite rightly so because I'm indeed pretty much always there).

So at this point it has become pretty clear that she's trying to avoid me, which is strange because things went really well the last time we met. I know that she never gets into discussions about personal matters / feelings even with people that she trusts and so most likely she has lots of unsaid issues about the way our relationship ended - I'd love to talk about it to put an end to any misunderstanding but I can't just come over to her and say *hey come on let's talk about our relationship that ended four months ago and was an absolute emotional disaster for the both of us*. 

As I said I'm really certain that I've lost any romantic interest in her and this is just about gaining her friendship back - I'm aware that it'll never be quite the way it was before but she was one of the closest friends I had for four years and I don't want to lose her. So I just have a simple question : admittedly I may have fucked many things up, but how can I contact her again to make her feel more comfortable ? 

TL;DR : started a relationship with a close friend last summer, it ended badly with me trying hopelessly to maintain a one-side relationship for a couple of months, now we've both lost any romantic connection and I want us to be friends again but she's avoiding me although she's acting quite friendly when we randomly meet up."

311m92,34,2015-04-01,UMVC3 Patch Notes!,Khuraji,MvC3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MvC3/comments/311m92/umvc3_patch_notes/,"**Overall**

* Capcom no longer has the rights to ""the license that shall not be named for legal reasons"". As a result, it will now be referred to as ""Mahvel"".
* Changing the game name in the system has caused save times to be twice as long as before and after every new screen you enter.
* This game will never be released on PC, just in case you weren't 100% on that.
* Cross-platform online play was looked into by Dave our intern. After months of work he presented us with ""Uh, not gonna happen bro"". 
* In-game running commentary from Yipes can now be turned on in the options menu.
* Beating the computer in Arcade Mode will result in salty messages from said computer opponent. This is to prepare players for the online environment. 


**Gameplay Mechanics**

* Mahvel seconds are now the same as real seconds. The game has been sped up to match.
* TAC's hitstun is working as intended.
* Unblockables have been kept in the game. Mahvel baybee.
* Hard-tagging in the middle of a combo will automatically bring in Dr. Strange, even if you didn't pick him.
* Players now *must* pick Dr. Doom on their team.
* Option Selects are no longer considered cheap. The Mahvel Gods have spoken.


**Online**

* Complaints about the online rank system have been received. Instead of playing just one round, players will now play until someone loses just 1 character. This should match your generations short attention span.
* Online lag has been fixed to play more fairly. If you lag during your combo the game will now deliberately add lag to the opponents next combo. You're welcome.
* To ensure we are not being discriminatory, region select has been removed and you will now always be paired with someone from another country.
* You rage-quitting will now result in a penalty. This will be a strongly worded message popping up telling you not to do that again.
* The programming of the strongly worded message on your console will unfortunately result in your opponents console restarting - this is unavoidable.


**Characters**

* In response to your requests we have added several new characters including: Blackheart, Cable, Colossus, Cyclops, Gambit, Iceman, Juggernaut, Marrow, Omega Red, Psylocke, Rogue, Sabretooth, Silver Samurai, Spiral, Thanos, Venom and War Machine.
* Due to licensing issues, all ""the license that shall not be named for legal reasons"" characters will be removed from the game - including all the ones we were planning on adding.
* Zero has been given a new move called ""Konran"". This ability randomly chooses one of Zero's special abilities and can be cancelled by itself on block. Now not even Zero players will know how they opened you up.
* Choosing between Dr. Doom's assists has proven very challenging for most players. As a result, we have combined them all into one.
* When Vergil activates Spiral Swords he also walks on his tiptoes like a ballerina with his hands above his head.
* Nova's Dolphin kick will force a ground bounce every time allowing players to play basketball with opponents. You like that?
* Sentinel's cr.m is now toggle-able, allowing Sentinel to stay sitting on the ground kicking his feet like a child until he gets his way.
* MODOK's head is 15% bigger.
* Ghost Riders j.S is now unblockable to all new players.
* Spiderman no longer says ""See you later!"" since he always hops right back over to you after he says it anyway.
* Wolverine now laughs at you when you accidentally Swiss Cheese.
* Hulk now does 20% more damage in laggy situations.
* Thor has deliberately reduced his own health so he stops getting the crap beat outta him in training mode.
* Characters with trench coats are now even more arrogant.
* Pheonix Wright will sometimes not object and actually agree with you.
* Morrigan's Cyclone Kick now hits high and low.
* If they are in the same team, Dante now sits in Frank West Shopping Cart like a teenager who just watched ""Jackass"" for the first time. If it's a THC he will also shoot his guns.
* Magneto can no longer walk.
* Spencer's Bionic Lancer now always hits assists.
* Wesker can now only pull one nuke out of his butt each game.

Also, here's my entire life story…",wheredidallmymoneygo,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/311y4f/new_here_hi_could_use_some_advise_or_just_words/,"**TL;DR - Workaholic buried in debt, succeeding in career, but neglecting life. Ready to dig myself out of the hole. What can I do to start taking control of my life?**

Diagnosed in middle school (16 years ago), on &amp; off different meds thru the years, currently taking generic Strattera. Despite the constant struggle of paying attention, I did very well in school. Graduated, broke into the music industry, worked my way up from intern to errand boy to professional, now freelance. This year I feel like I've finally broke through the stagnant plateau in my career. I'm finally earning much more money than I was previous years, basically just got a raise. January I made more than I ever had in a single month, and my work future looks bright. 

...But I've been so focused on my career and burying myself in work (often working 12 hour days), I have been **severely** neglecting every day life stuff. So bad that I've dug a huge hole for myself that I don't really know how to get out of. 

Made a throwaway, so I'm just gonna lay out everything in a depressing list of failure…

* Don't have health insurance. 

* Need to go to the dentist. 

* Don't have car insurance either. 

* Crashed my car several years ago while I was an intern, Couldn't afford to fix it, so I've been driving around with a busted door/window for years. Then missed the registration, couldn't afford the repairs to pass the smog check  so I never renewed them. Years went by on expired tags, got several tickets, a few turned into failure to appear in court, never settled that. A few weeks ago it got impounded by the police, and the back fines were more than the car was worth, so I gave the title to the tow-yard (they agreed to wave the fines) and now I'm car-less. Still haven't got a new one, just taking Uber to work. 

* This will be the second year not paying taxes. I'm sure there are extra fines piling up. 

* I have past due outstanding invoices amounting to several thousand dollars that I could collect on if only I were good on the phone… :-/ Most of them are in the process of paying, but sometimes I just lose track. Made a detailed Excel sheet to organize which ones are outstanding, but I still have to follow through and get payment. 

* With this new increase in cashflow I bought a new laptop with the intention of selling my old one for close to the same price, still haven't even made the eBay page yet. So I could get an extra $800 for that thing if only I got off my ass and listed it.

* Been paying 20 bucks a month (for maybe 2 years?) on some porn site I rarely visit, but don't know how to cancel because I forgot my password.

* Almost always buy expensive take out food cause I hate buying groceries.

* Holes in my shoes &amp; nothing good to wear cause I fucking hate shopping for clothes. 

* Bought a new pair of shoes on eBay, but wasn't home when they were delivered. I never got my ass to the post office so they've been sitting there for maybe 3 months now. Got returned to sender, then got lost in the mail. Whatever, they were stupid shoes anyway. 

* I'd like to go to the gym, but I'm too lazy and I hate people I don't know. Not overweight, but I would like to get into shape. Never been before, sounds like a scary endeavor. :-/

* Student loans are several months past due (give or take $800/month). Even though I now actually have the money to pay them, my credit is ruined. I've kind of lost track of how many there are and how long they've been late.

* 2 grand in 18% interest credit card debt, plus who knows how much is past due on my student loans, plus taxes, past due traffic tickets, plus I need a new car. 

...But I've got 5 grand sitting in my bank account, with another 4k coming next week (provided some of those those past due accounts go thru), and solid good-paying work coming in the months ahead, more than I've ever made. This is the first time I've ever had this much cash, I'm not sure what to do first. I've been living soooo poor during my first few years in the industry that I just adopted a lifestyle of neglecting everything related to money. 

There's also the booze habit, though now it's craft beer and aged whiskey instead of 40's and high life.

I'm kind of working what some might call a high-stress job, usually 12 hour days. Sometimes I'm so exhausted that whenever I get a day off, I just sleep in, drink, watch netflix or play video games. All those other things are just too much stress to deal with on my only fucking day off. The past two days I worked 15 hour shifts, and all I wanna do is have a glass of whiskey before heading to sleep &amp; prepare for another 12 hour shift tomorrow. Not much time to do much else. 

But that's my job, I'm either working or I'm not working. I'm freelance, so I can choose my days off or my days on. I just keep thinking that the more hours I work, the more money I'll make to dig myself out of this hole and come back to normal society. But I never actually take the time or effort to pick up the shovel. I'm so far deep at this point, that being successful is my only option. 

So lately I've been taking as much work as possible, and I've finally come into enough money to start digging myself out of this ridiculous life-neglecting pit of failure, but I don't know where to start. :-/

Anyway, this annoyingly detailed list has been super cathartic for me. I've never told anyone this pile of bullshit that's been on my back, and I seriously thank you if you have actually read this far. 

Any advice on where to start? "

It's an all-male apartment, is right next to the first shuttle stop so you are guaranteed a seat when going to campus, and are the first to get off when you get back from campus. It's alcohol and ent friendly, and all the other roommates are students (juniors) as well, like videogames (we have wii + wiiU + ps3 + TV set up right in the living room), and are really friendly. One is a computer science major, another is a biology-related major, and the third is still undecided.

312o48,6,2015-04-01,"I [21M] want to break up with my girlfriend [21F], but there's nothing wrong with our relationship, I just don't want to be in one anymore.",FifthOfJameson,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/312o48/i_21m_want_to_break_up_with_my_girlfriend_21f_but/,"On paper, this girl is perfect for me. She's pretty, smart, funny, we have similar tastes in pop culture, the sex is fantastic, she's exceptionally tolerant and patient with my ADHD, and she's a great cook. The problem is, I just don't want to be in a relationship right now. Let's rewind.

So, I'm currently finishing my junior year of college. Back in August, my ex dumped me out of the blue, after a two year relationship. She was my first serious girlfriend (I don't consider anything under at least a month ""serious""). We had made long term, marriage plans. Part of that was naive, but still, I could honestly have spent the rest of my life with her. Anyway, we had to do the long distance thing over the summer because she had an internship in Boston, and, as I later found out, she started to have feelings for a guy in her building (who didn't reciprocate said feelings). We broke up, and I was a hot mess. 

Jump ahead a few weeks. I go back to school for my junior year. I live in a house with five other guys, so I had a great support system, but I still was pretty messed up from the break up. I remained in this state until mid-September. After a couple of disastrous (and in one case repulsive) Tinder dates, I matched with the girl who is now my girlfriend.

 Admittedly, we both rushed into it. Last Spring, her long time boyfriend (a weed dealer that treated her like shit) unceremoniously dumped her. She spent the summer sleeping around and trying to get over him. Unsurprisingly, when we met, she was in just as much of a fragile, needy state as I was. We were officially a couple after just four days, and we said our first ""I love you""s shortly thereafter. We were both broken people looking for love. In most situations, this would lead to both of us settling with the wrong people, because we just needed to be cared about. Somehow, we ended up with each other. We're highly compatible, so what could have easily been a rebound turned into a six and a half month relationship. 

So now here I am. I love her. I don't want to hurt her. But at the same time, I really don't want to be in this relationship anymore. Between this relationship and my most recent previous one, I've spent all but three months of my time in college in serious relationships. I want to just do my own thing for a while. I love her, and I love spending time with her, but I wish I wasn't obligated to do so. Truth be told (as much as I hate to say it) at least to a certain extent, she's reverted to the friend zone. 

That's part of the issue. Over the past six months, she's become my best friend. I don't want to lose her by breaking up with her. Toward the beginning of February, I almost broke up with her, but I couldn't bring myself to do it, because she said that it was all or nothing. We decided that since my main issue at the time was feeling suffocated by our relationship, we would cut down on how frequently we hang out (at the time, we got together almost every day). 

That helped for a while, but now I'm right back where I was before. It's come down to a matter of indifference. I could stay in this relationship and be content, but content is the farthest that would go. What makes this state of ennui worse is that she's riding just as high as we were when we first got together. Before I started feeling this way, I made long term plans with her. At this point, I feel like I'm going to end up doing to her the same thing that my ex did to me. And honestly, I understand my ex now. She said that her main reason for breaking up was that she didn't want to be in a relationship anymore. She was going through the exact same thing that I am now. Hell, last spring I convinced her to not break up with me in a similar fashion to what my current girlfriend did to me in February. 

I don't know, guys. I don't want to crush my best friend. And between the occasional impulsivity of my ADHD (before you ask, I have an actual diagnosis) and the possibility that my last break up may have given me commitment issues, I don't fully trust my own judgement. I am in real need of some guidance here. 



   
**tl;dr**: Got dumped in a rough way, almost immediately rushed into a relationship with a lovely girl who was experiencing the same pain, now I want to break up with her because of my own need for independence. "

312w6n,1,2015-04-01,I got an internship! Will it's focus on web-development be strictly beneficial?,newOnahtaN,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/312w6n/i_got_an_internship_will_its_focus_on/,"Hey guys! I've been very actively reading the sub since last September, and after many dozens of rejections, I found myself in this last week with 5 offers to choose from for the summer of my Sophomore year. Woooo!   

My most competitive offer expired yesterday at business close, and in the final hour of things (2:00pm yesterday really) I received an even more competitive offer from a medium sized company in NYC as a Full-Stack developer. I ended up going with this option because it paid better, because I would work with more unfamiliar technologies as a learning experience, and because I wanted to work in NYC. 

Here's my question: the second best offer, the one that got knocked out late in the game, was a .NET position in Charlottesville, VA. The winning offer is web development in AngularJS and Ruby on Rails.  I'm familiar with desktop development in several languages already, and a newbie to web-dev, and I saw NYC as an opportunity to expand my skillset, but I am somewhat worried that I may be labelled as a 'web-dev' guy after this. Does such a label exist? Or am I just being unnecessarily fretful over the decision that I just made?

For context, I'm aiming for an SDE Internship with one of the Big 4 for next summer, and I'm wondering if my choice will have much of an impact on my suitability for those roles."

312xrx,1,2015-04-01,"Almost one year out of undergrad, 23/M",Yitbos92,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/312xrx/almost_one_year_out_of_undergrad_23m/,"Hello r/PersonalFinance,

Long time lurker, first time poster. Before getting into my situation I just wanted to say this sub has been a wealth of knowledge for me, more people need to be financially responsible. I’m turning 23 next week and I wanted to be sure I’m on the right track and not a huge fucking failure.

**My situation**:

I grew up pretty lower-middle class in the rural Midwest. I am the first person to attend and graduate college in my family. Luckily, I got a pretty hefty scholarship for being from a shit-hole area (lots of drugs and crime, maybe only 5 kids I graduated HS with attended college) and Mom and Dad were able to provide help as well. I attended my state school because it was the cheapest tuition and living expenses. 
I graduated undergrad with 0 debt and lived pretty frugally in college.

HOWEVER, the degree I got is basically worthless for the time being. I graduated with a B.A. in Communication last May after not meeting the minimum for my college’s business school (I always wanted to do business). I ended up graduating with a 3.3 GPA, many extracurricular activities and clubs and two internships under my belt. However, I regret every day when I wake up I got the degree I did. It was basically my junior year of college and I needed a major I could complete in four years with the credits I had unless I wanted to go into debt. I copped out and said fuck it, I need something. I’m not interested in it whatsoever, but at least I’m not in debt over it. 

I was one of the lucky ones in my major. I found a job 5 weeks after graduating that was salaried with great benefits. I work for the state using I would say maybe 25% of my degree (rendering it not completely useless but basically). However, my salary is shit. I make $31,000 a year. Since I work for the state, 10% of my salary per month is dumped into the state retirement plan. My employer matches more than I put in. Below are my numbers:

$2571.67/month pre-tax
$1775.99/take home pay

I am forced to put in $254.17 a month into my retirement, my employer puts in $355.83, which brings me to $610 a month into my retirement. 

Current expenses:

$640/rent
$35/internet
$8/Netflix
$350/savings

The other monies I typically “live on” (groceries, entertainment, random shit) and then at the end of the month I dump what’s left from my checking into my savings. I have a used car and I guess the main thing is my rent that drains my money. 

I currently have 5k in my savings account. I’m not sure what I should be doing differently – I’m open to any suggestions you may have. I’m considering going to graduate school in a few years after I gain some experience to get a better job. Some days I feel like I’ve failed, but other days I feel like for a 23 year old I’m doing okay. I’m really hard on myself but ultimately I want to better myself and make sure my loved ones like my little brother don’t make the same mistakes as I did.

3130wi,5,2015-04-01,"Me [23 F] with my fiance [29 M] 3.5 years, how to leave fiance when nothing is wrong per se, we just have incompatible goals and priorities in life",logta,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3130wi/me_23_f_with_my_fiance_29_m_35_years_how_to_leave/,"As you can probably see from the title, I was young when I met my fiance. I was 19 years old and in university, he was 26 and temporarily in the big city I was living in to do an internship after finishing his masters and struggling to find employment in his home city.

I need to say off the bat that my fiance is a wonderful man. He is the kindest, the most thoughtful, and the most considerate person that I have ever met. We have so much fun together. He would never ever do something to intentionally hurt me. He is a fantastic person, which makes me feel so horrible for wanting to do something that I know will crush him. I feel like a shallow bitch. Please tell me if I am. I appreciate the honesty of this subreddit.

I didn't know what I wanted in life when we first met, I was just a 2nd year university student, so being in a relationship with someone who was equally lost and wandering through life was perfectly OK at the time.

Since that time he moved back to his home city (in a different region of the country than we were living in before) and I followed suit a few years later. I struggled to find employment in my field as the economy is really bad in his home city and eventually found a soul-destroying job in an entirely different field. But I did it for him, because I was determined to close our long-distance relationship and make it work despite hating his home city. He had not been employed since moving back to his home city. I was later able to attain employment in my field in a different city in the same region of the country, 1 hour away driving or by train from his home city, and my fiance moved with me to the new city. My fiance currently has an 8 week temping position, his first employment since 2012 (he has a trust fund from his rich grandpa which is how he was able to sustain such a long period of unemployment).

Since finishing university and starting my career I've grown substantially as a person. I didn't know what I wanted before but now I have a better idea of what I want. And I've come to realize what I want and what he wants are entirely incompatible.

I have a work-hard, play-hard attitude towards life. My passion is traveling, and given my way I'd spend every spare cent and every day of vacation from work I have traveling. We live in Europe so this is relatively cheap (thanks EasyJet and Ryanair!). He doesn't share this same passion. It's a struggle to convince him to spend €250/year going away for 4 days (on trips I meticulously plan months head so that they're as cheap as possible). He would genuinely be happy going years without leaving the region of the country we live in. I'm from Canada, and I've yet to be able to convince him to spend the money to go and visit my friends and family back home.

He's happy to only make enough to afford rent on a decent apartment and to be able to go out to eat a few times a month, as he gets his enjoyment in life from things like fantasy football, watching films, and occasionally hiking (we live in a mountainous region of the country). He doesn't have the career drive that I have. All he wants is to be able to purchase a 1 or 2 bedroom apartment 10 minutes down the road from his mother's house and whatever job he can hold down in order to pay the mortgage. I want so much more than that. I didn't have a career drive when I met him as I didn't have a career then, but I do now, and I'm passionate about pushing myself in my career that means so much to me with the added benefit that I can afford to follow my passion of traveling when I'm not at work. He's just the same as when I met him. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with his attitude towards life. There isn't. It's just different than mine, and I don't feel that the two attitudes towards life are compatible.

Another problem I have is how we deal with problems. When I see something in life I immediately fix it. He, on the other hand, puts things off until they reach breaking point and then freaks out that things didn't work out the way he wanted them to. This drives me crazy and makes me worried for things like long-term finances. But every time I bring up his procrastination I'm nagging him.

The other issue is where we live. He doesn't want to leave this region of the country. I've lived in both (small) ""major"" cities in this region and I really dislike both. And I've really tried to like them- I've taken classes at the local university, I go to yoga classes, I've joined a community organization, I go to a monthly book club-- I've put in a ton of effort to make friends here and learn to like it. Ultimately I'm just happier living in a big city, like the one I grew up in or the one we were living in when we met. I want to move back to the city we were living in when we first met. He hated living there and has no interest in going back.

I've tried talking about all of this with him, I have for months but it goes nowhere.

This summary I don't think does justice to how different our goals in life are, but I've tried and I don't want to get too specific.

I feel like marrying him is a mistake due to the differences we have.

Am I doing the right thing?

In addition, how on earth do I go about breaking up logistics-wise? I have a grand total of zero friends here so I don't have anyone to crash with and I don't have much money saved. I don't want to dump our apartment on him (we still have 4 months left in the lease). There's a 2 month notice period until August, when it goes down to 1 month. I was planning on moving out and paying half the rent anyway as it seems unfair to make him pay for expenses he didn't foresee (in terms of paying all the rent until the notice period is up) but I don't really have the money for that so I was going to wait until August when I've saved up enough and it goes down to 1 month. I was planning on finding a new place, taking the day off and moving my stuff out when he's at work and talking to him when he gets home. Is this cruel? It seems the quickest/easiest way to me so that we don't have to live together when it's over.

I want to minimize the pain for him because he's a wonderful person, we just want very different, incompatible things in life.
   
**tl;dr**: I've grown up and changed since beginning a relationship with my fiance at 19, I want to break up but am unsure if it's the right thing to do because he is a good person and how to go about the logistics of breaking up with him as we live together and I don't have any friends here."

I went to a strip club around 6pm on a friday. The place was dead. I sat between 2 dancers who looked bored and after a minute or 2 the dancer to my left started talking to me. Very cute girl. She seemed smart as hell too. Too smart to be working in this place. She was there only to get herself through school. 

Now we've all heard that before, but I believed her. We talked for hours about practically everything. Books, music, movies, school (she is an accounting major just like I was). Before I knew it, 3 hours goes by and the place is busy. I get her number and being the ultra smooth gentleman I am, I asked her for a dance. Well needless to say it is awkward as hell (even though the woman is like fricking Aphrodite) and when it's over she makes a joke about at least we'll have a funny story to tell our grandkids about how we met. 

We texted for a week or so and then I drove out to meet her in a normal circumstance. Still cute as ever but more normal seeming now. Quiet like me, but still just as smart as before. We decided to make it official about a month later. We've been dating for over a year and a half now. 

She's scheduled to be done with school in December. And just turned an internship at a large bank into a temp position until she graduates where she will become full-time. She hasn't danced in almost 5 months and things are finally looking great after a lot of struggles. She's helped me so much and I can't say enough about her. Our personal life is less hectic. (Who accepts their son/brother to date a stripper?) And My family loves her and she is finally getting something good she deserves. 

So even though it was a struggle at times, I'd still love to meet you again babe. Same time, same place."

Only two women work in this department.  One woman is in her forties, married with kids, writing requirement documents.  The other is also a software engineer, my desk neighbour and ""work friend"".  We get along quite well, we're the youngest of the bunch, we lunch together (along with some other colleagues), but don't really socialise outside work.

The majority of employees eat at the company restaurant, so we get to see the people of other departments: the beautiful optical engineer of floor 4, the ladies of HR etc.  And when the weather becomes fine and they start wearing skirts, we get to hear my girl colleague's nasty remarks about the length of their dresses and the number of lose buttons on their blouses.

I usually ignore it, or mumble something like ""it's not *that* bad, is it?""  Because they really don't stress unprofessionally and also because eh... it looks nice.  I've never given it much more thought then.   

Recently a female intern started in our department and I have a little crush on her.  She's a little bit more curvy than the protected ideal, but she's undeniably pretty.  I was told her boobs were showing too much and she dresses inappropriately.  And I got genuinely offended, but I didn't react.  Partly because I don't want people to know I like the intern and partly because I have no clue how a man can react in a situation like that.  It's easy to point at male opportunism.

TL;DR My female colleague comments about how a girl I like dresses.  I got offended.  How should I react?

Edit: whilst we're at it, you may also give suggestions on the totally unrelated matter of how to ask an intern for a date."

Sadly, the gods of IT has the linux server managing the Domain and the AD, and the DoorServer 2003 running the firewall, Storage, etc. Being the well known techie at the school, there was no IT on site, the teachers depended on me. I also had the sysadmin's desk phone number. (Let's just call him $SA)


Now, the district was unrolling the next generation clients. (God they had HORRIBLE Networking capabilities, they ended up recalling them. Damn Wireless) The Monday that the masses (aka students) came back, we were very excited. Well, Nobody could login on the the New Clients. Now, I was in the back room calling $SA.

&gt;$SA Odd, the network isn't down, yet. Try pinging the DoorServer.

&gt;$SA how about the Linux Server?

&gt;$ME 15ms Response.

&gt;$SA Logon to the Gen2 clients local account and check the Domain Name.

For example, I have a close friend who is currently finishing his degree and doing an internship at a small place, and I'm afraid he's going to get invited to stay there permanently when he finishes it.

I can't help but feel pissed off inside anytime he mentions internship in quotation marks (indicating he's doing well there and is a possible future employee), or how he's been working on this or that project. I should feel happy for him, and yet, I can't.

I know we are pretty close skill wise, because when we were both on the same programming class we got very similar grades (hell, I even very slightly beat him). We both like programming, but he tends more towards the design and art side, while I prefer the more ""mechanical"" side of things.

I love helping people out with technical stuff when I can, him included, but I can't understand why his, and other friend's lives, mess so much with my head and make me slightly angry. Sometimes I even wish to see him fail. What the hell is wrong with me?

I also am afraid to lose him as a friend, in this specific case. I feel that at some point he might get too obsessed with work, and make no time for me or anyone else. For now I think everything's okay enough, but I've already lost a good friend thanks to that kind of behaviour.

New Hampshire, ~ 50 minutes north of Boston.

Physical:

I'm 22, 6'4"", 190lbs, I'd describe myself as slim/fit, brown hair, hazel/green eyes, a bit scruffy looking at the moment (shaved my mountain-man beard off a couple of weeks ago). I've always been told I'm attractive, but I won't try to claim that as a fact.

About:

I'm a full-time computer engineering student, part-time software engineer intern, then I also have another part-time job at a hospital. I try to go to the gym at least 5 times a week (which is more difficult when I'm buried with school work), I played football up to and in high school, soccer and lacrosse prior to that.
I'm really into video games when I have free time to pour into them, I enjoy suspense and superhero shows/ anime/ movies but I'll watch almost anything, and I don't really know how to describe my musical taste. Right this second I'm listening to Thousand Foot Krutch and my favorite band is System of a Down, but I also enjoy some hip-hop and rap (although I wouldn't necessarily put much from either on a playlist), and I listen to some electronic/dubstep. New things in technology really interest me, as well as learning interesting things (even before Reddit, I used to find a way to drop a 'did you know?' statement into every conversation).

Goal:

I'm honestly looking for someone I can really click with- someone who could be my best friend and more. This is absolutely not bragging, but I don't really have trouble finding girls to chat with. However, most of the time within a few days it turns sexual, and that ruins the long-term chances for me. I don't want a FWB or a sexting partner, and I think a lot of the time it comes to this because me and whoever I'm talking to have nothing in common. We have nothing to talk about, so it basically turns into ""we're both attractive let's talk about sex"". I don't want someone who's WILLING to go there right off the bat, I want someone I have enough in common with that we can become friends and then keep progressing. I can be a relatively jealous guy, so if you're willing to see me with my pants off on day one then I'm going to assume that's how you are with other guys and I'll lose interest pretty quickly.

Need Advice

(I apologize in advance for the blabs and details)

Here's my story:

I graduated with a BA from an average university in Canada; launched a small business and later moved overseas to my original home country to also launch it and set it up there. As I was doing so I took on a full time job working at a multinational PR firm. I was working both and things were looking good but income was tight and the business was an unstable income as I was doing it part time at this point.

5 Months later, I received a too good to be true job offer at a major corporation in Dubai. However due to conflict of interest of my business and this corp. I had to shut my business down. With a  very impressive salary and tremendous benefits, I couldn't have asked for more. I said I would get corporate experience and then later relaunch the business at a more professional level.

I quit my full time job, shut down my business, broke up with my girlfriend and moved to Dubai. Unfortunately, at this time due to personal relationships and agressive changes moves from continent to continent I had fell into acute depression. I hated the city as I believed it was just too fake and not for me. I also realized that I was too inexperienced for the position I had took on. The company was also a dog eat dog kinda vibe especially in Dubai since 80% of the population are expats who can only reside there if they work.  (I was also not provided any training whatsoever)

In addition to my depression, within my 3 months probation I lost all confidence of myself and developed bad work ethic. Soon enough out of anxiety, I found myself expressing to my boss that I am unhappy. I was let go a few weeks later.

1 business down &amp; 2 jobs down (1 quit/1 fired)

Gladly I was able to get back on my feet and found another job yet with half the salary at a boutique firm. The nature of the job I did not like at all however I took whatever became available to be able to remain in the city until i find something more relevant. 

The depression has not left me, and trying to cop with the opportunity of a life time that I just blew, plus not even liking what I would be doing, I lasted 8 months and then it was just a point of wasting my time and the company wasting its money. both management and I noticed that it was not working out yet we had friendly relationship so we agreed that I will begin looking for another job and will remain working with them until I find one. (My performance was not so bad)

I eventually left the company and noticed that Dubai was possibly a wrong move and moved back to Canada where I started over again working at a retail store while looking for a 4th job. 

I got an opportunity to do an unpaid internship at a pretty decent agency. I then willingly impressed all those of the company from juniors to COO's. I was promised a position if an opportunity arises. My internship period ended and there were no vacancies. Yet upper management willingly found a need in the company and created a totally new position to the company so I could stay. 

However it was a role that I had absolutely no academic or professional experience in, and since it's new it had no structure or guidance and again no training provided., let alone the salary was relatively low.

I managed to hustle my way through projects the best I can, yet none of my coworkers really understood what my role was. 

Eventually my responsibilities started to decrease and getting delegated to those older in the company with more experience.

No one has time to hand hold or teach which I totally understand. 
However, being neglected and overlooked all the time began noticeable and I began to complain and again developed bad work ethic thinking they clearly don't care about my development and what I do and I am already getting really shit pay. So I decided to take  10 day unpaid vacation to see my family at this point as I had 0 paid vacation for the first year of my employment. 

Every time I get home after work I reflect on my performance and realize or the stupid things I've done. I.e:

-Texting
-Yawning
-Lateness
-Joking often with other coworkers
-Complaining and bad mouthing 
-Frequent smoke breaks

These are all things that are not strange to many other coworkers yet with my circumstances I am really worried and not sure what to do. I feel like I am going to get fired from this job sometime soon too due to this bad work ethic. I am 25 If this happens then I feel like I have truly fucked my career at this point.

1 business down  &amp; 4 jobs down (1 quit/ 1 mutual/2 terminated) within only 5 years.

Is my career over?

314yfd,1,2015-04-01,I'm having a really hard time making friends and I've been feeling really lost in the crowd lately,geraniumkisser_,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/314yfd/im_having_a_really_hard_time_making_friends_and/,"I am a freshman in college at a medium sized school in a city with a lot of smart and energetic students. At the beginning of my first semester, I instantly clicked with a group of three other girls. We would go to meals together, explore the city, and even had a movie night that ended in tears and hugging. Needless to say, we got really close quickly. Then, a couple months into the semester, they stopped hanging out with me. Maybe it happened because two are roommates and the other lives next door, who knows. I began to notice posts on Facebook and Instagram of the three of them together, making me feel really left out, and slowly, our group texts died out. I tried to reach out and ask when they were getting dinner, etc, but nothing happened. I spent the next month or so trying to find another group and eventually, I started hanging out with a girl who I consider to be much cooler than me. She introduced me to a couple of her friends, not many though, and while we would have lunch together, she never asked me to hang out with her at night. At the end of that first semester, I thought, ""enough is enough"", and I joined a sorority. Greek like isn't huge at my school but it's a decent size and not at all typical so I went for it and ended up getting a bid from the top sorority. Yay, I thought this would change everything but it's a couple months in and I haven't noticed a huge difference. The cool girl from last semester and I begin to hang out a bit more during the second semester but I notice that whenever we're together, she talks about herself. She tells me about the guy she's hooking up with who eventually becomes her on again, off again boyfriend, her pregnancy scare (the scariest part is that she wouldn't know who the father is), and more things like that  which are so significantly different from my experiences as a non-drinking, non-drug-doing virgin by choice. I mostly just sit in silence when we're together and give motherly advice (she endearingly calls me ""mom"" now) because I don't have anyone else to hang out with. The other issue is that she ignores me when she's around other friends. Yay. 

At this point, you're probably wondering if I've gotten involved in anything. Yes, I have. A lot of things. Most of the activities I'm involved in are art related (a student-run gallery and magazine) and through those, I have been commissioned by various other clubs for design-related work. The issue with art people though is that they're no very welcoming. I go to club meetings very regularly and participate a lot in discussion and helping with events but I'm lucky if others in the club say hi to me on campus. It's also important to note that I interned last semester at a well known company which sucked up a lot of my time and others thought was a really cool internship. Because of my sorority, a lot of people say hi to me now but that's it. I haven't become actual friends with any of my ""sisters"" yet which is sort of rubbed in my face by all of the hellos because it sometimes feels like people see me but don't care to take the time to know me. That's actually a really present source of anxiety for me— people saying hi and leaving. At the first sorority mixer with one of the frats, I went with an open mind hoping to meet some people but I ended up leaving after 15 minutes and half a panic attack. I felt like a spec amidst so many other people, some of which were saying hi but none of which stopped to keep me company. After this experience, my first semester weekend routine of watching movies and painting in my room returned which just makes me feel more isolated. I know that it's bad to do this and that I should put myself out there by going out at night but my fear is that if I just show up alone at a party, there won't be anyone there to hang out with. 

Now, I'm desperate for companionship. All of friends are scattered around the country and while it's nice to talk to my best friend on the phone for two hours, it would be nice to have someone to talk to here who I could physically be with. I'm tired to spending my meals and nights alone. Even as an introvert, I'm desperate for some human interaction. What reminded me of my loneliness is that my sorority formal is coming up in a month and date submissions need to be handed in two weeks from now. I have absolutely not a single guy friend at this school and I feel like the night, while I don't want to miss it, might give me another panic attack or make me feel terrible about myself. 

I apologize for how rambly this is. I am currently sniffling and holding back tears, sitting on a staircase that leads to a locked roof door in a building on campus in an attempt to get away from the crowds gathered downstairs in the gym for a fire drill. I am really, really sorry but I don't want to reread what I've just written to check for mistakes because I know that if I do, I'll just start crying and I don't want to right now. I guess I am just looking for some support or advice. 

tl;dr Freshman in college with a really hard time making/ keeping friends with a deadline approaching to get a date for an event. "
315b8a,3,2015-04-01,Stories of recovery?,thatsRIDDIKULUS,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/315b8a/stories_of_recovery/,"I had my first panic attack this past summer, the night before I flew to New York to start an amazing internship that I had worked my ass off to get. I was laying in bed, trying to go to sleep, when all of the sudden my stomach dropped as if I just found out I was going to die any second. My heart pounded in my chest and I couldn't stop pacing in my room. I started having these irrational thoughts/fears that I was going to have a seizure. My hands felt numb, there was a ringing in my ears, my jaw felt tight. I finally wore myself out/cried myself to sleep enough that my body was too tired to stay awake anymore.

I've had four more panic attacks since then, but I don't even have to be having a panic attack to feel the symptoms. Every once in awhile I'll be in a group setting and feel the jaw tightness creeping in, or start feeling like I'm having an allergic reaction (I have food allergies) even if I haven't eaten anything remotely questionable, or the ear ringing will start and I'll have to go sit in the bathroom for five minutes to calm down.

This disease has altered my life in horrible ways. I am a college senior and should be enjoying every second of senior year, but half of the time I feel like I'm not even at home in my own head. I hate this and I'm terrified about graduating and starting a new job, and I'm scared that even a little added stress in my life will make this 100x worse.

I don't really know why I'm posting, it just feels really good to type it all out. I guess I'm wondering if any of you have advice/inspiration about overcoming this disease? I'm worried I might never feel truly normal again, and that my old self is gone. Does it get better? Or will it always be running in the background of my mind?"

I'm an ECE student who applied to the internships game really late. Long story short, I ended up taking a lot of credits the past two semesters and didn't have much time to apply for internships (though, admittedly, I didn't apply as much as I should have). Does anyone have any advice for undergrads who're trying to apply late for ECE-related internships?"
315j06,3,2015-04-01,Advice on sticking with it from someone who has failed at just that multiple times,[deleted],loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/315j06/advice_on_sticking_with_it_from_someone_who_has/,"I'm mostly making this to keep myself accountable, but I figured I could share some advice along with it to try and help people not fall off the wagon (and then eat the wagon). 

1) Don't do ""last hurrahs"" where you eat a ton of your favorite foods. 

I've done this far too many times. I'm pretty sure all it does is increase your addiction to shit foods while also adding 3,000 calories to start undoing the first day of your commitment to fitness. 

Along with this, don't wait til next week, or tomorrow. Just start now. It's illogical to set yourself back right from the gate. Think about it. 

2) follow the 2 days rule

Sometimes I feel lazy and skip the gym for a day or eat bad food for a day. That's more than fine but as soon as I skip two days, the % of time that is followed by a complete regression is very high. So, come hell or high water don't go off-path for 2 straight days. If a mile long walk is all you can take then do it. 

3) bad stuff will happen in your life. Don't let it make you fall off. 

There's no doubt that I have Binge Eating Disorder (I go to grocery stores to buy raw cookie dough and eat all of it that day. I spend $15 at Taco Bell and eat it before I get home. I've eaten out of trash cans more times than I can count) so I might have more trouble with this part. But at the end of the day being fat sucks compared to being healthy, and you're only making your life worse by fighting sadness with candy. 

I look back at the happiest parts of my life and they were all when I weighed my lowest of 165 (2 separate times- was originally 250 in HS). And the saddest are when I weighed 200 after gaining it back(where I'm at now.) 

Basically NEVER think it isn't worth it. Because it 10000% is and deep down you know it. 

4) do what's sustainable for you

Sometimes I'll have a good thing goin and I'll try to send it into overdrive. Like once I had lost 10 over a month but decided I wanted to start leangains and eat all my food within 4 hours and lift 5x a week. Well all that led to for me was me getting overworked and giving up entirely. 

So if you like eating chips every day and just doing cardio? Hey as long as you're losing weight and sticking to it, you're doing just fine. 

5) never be afraid of the scale 

You know when you're Killin it, eating at a -500 deficit and hittin the gym, you just can't wait to take a shit and hop on the scale to see progress. 

Well when you know you've misbehaved you avoid it. Don't do that. It's better to see yourself gain 4 lbs in a week and correct it than pussyfoot around the issue until June and you've gained 20. 


And even on that note don't avoid this subreddit. Lord knows I do when I'm not counting calories. Just looking at the top posts for the day (takes 30 seconds) helps keep you motivated

I've disobeyed all these steps and I put on 30 lbs since December when some bad shit happened in my life. Well I have an awesome internship in NYC this summer that I want to turn into a full time job, but I know my odds to get hired back are lessened if I walk in as a fat fuck-just human nature. And I look terrible in my dress clothes that I bought when I was thin so I gotta reverse that trend.

THE ORIGINAL 1942 SONG IS LEGENDARY. THERE IS NOT A MORE LEGENDARY SOUNDTRACK (fuck of halo fanboys, i am an halo fanboy but it just isnt as legendary)  THE SONG IS EPIC. DRIVING IN TO BATTLE WHILE LISTENING TO IT. THEN THEY HAVE TO FUCKING RUIN IT WITH DISTORTED RADIO SOUNDS THAT RAPES YOUR FUCKING MIND WHEN LISTENING TO IT.


THIS IS THE GOD DAMN BRILLIANT ORIGINAL SONG, PREPARE FOR AWESOMENESS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg0Tmydj29M


THEN THEY DO THIS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRN62IebC04 what the FUCK IS THAT?  WHAT IS THAT EA? WHAT IS THAT? WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS THAT? I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS, THAT IS THE SOUND OF OUR MINDS BEING RAPED, IS WHAT IT IS. IT SOUNDS HORRIBLE. DISTORTED RADIO NOICE WITH SOME HINTS OF FUCKING DUBSTEP? WHAT. IS. WRONG. WITH. YOU?

WHY DO YOU DO THIS? WHY? WHYWHYWHY? YES WE GOT BETTER TECHNOLOGY NOW THAN BACK THEN, BUT THAT DOES NOT JUSTIFY THE RAPE OF AN ORIGINAL AND LEGENDARY SONG. trying to cool down. Why not create a new original song, instead of raping the old one more and more? WHY not create a new song for the new Battlefield games INSTEAD of raping the old one? IS it really that hard to come up with a new song? But we all know what the problem is. EA likes money. They love money so much they cant justify spending it on creating something original, something that actually requires some funding. Instead they rehash and ruin an old song. When i say this i mean it from the bottom of my heart. Fuck you.

I guess what im trying to say is, CREATE SOMETHING  NEW AND ORIGINAL. Even if its bad, just do it. Beuase atleast you tried.

**Corporate Chris:**

* Early on possibly the day after the first mention of CC but be for they were pushing it hard I believe it was Fez who made a slip and mentioned Chris being near by/doing something.

* The day they had to broadcast from a different studio there were technical problems and in a fluster Shelby said something along the line of ""Chris said he is handling it"" to which later Ron referred to as Shelby breaking kayfabe.

* Ron getting ahead of himself as he does sometimes mistakenly calls Fez Chris as he is setting up in an indirect way for Fez to say some things about CC.

* Kayfabe breaks referring to Chris being in the booth by guests and other staff off of the top of my head: Two by Michelle, One by Big Jay, One by Jason Nash.

* What's in the booth!?!?!...No mention/Thanks of a fill in board OP which always happened from the times I remember. Multiple references to the interns being on the board which would need supervision while Shelby was in studio, Very fast and intuitive reactions bringing up music on Dalet from the booth/Old clips etc. that only someone with intimate knowledge of the R&amp;F file system would know rivaling when Pips was still with the show all indicating that Chris has been on the board every day so far.

**Fed's Retirement:**

*  Based on that when they switched from the O&amp;A channel to Rawdog (Jan 6th 2014) R&amp;F said for the first time they wouldn't be signing together and that Fez would be signing in 4 month intervals depending on his performance, This wasn't brought up other than after the first 4 months. Lines up with Fez's contract being up. Long planning? Fez is really retiring? Coincidence?

* When going to the first break of the April 1st show Ron who has always used the same out cue of ""It's the Ron &amp; Fez show"" says ""We'll be right back....Man they bought..."" as the mic is quickly faded out.

* Odd Ibang article listed as: Fez Whatley Announces Retirement From Radio, Which contained a long and full detailed history of Beachcombing which has since been changed to a more legitimate looking retirement announcement.

I really liked the basic analysis problems but I fell flat when I got to the harder stuff.  I thought I would find people like me but even the nerds are highly social and athletic, at least compared to me.  I was made fun of for rambling about specialized topics and flapping my hands.

316gvj,0,2015-04-02,Am I alone on this...probably not,[deleted],dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/316gvj/am_i_alone_on_thisprobably_not/,"Hi, 
Just trying to vent, and looking to make some conversation over this matter. Let’s start with my background. First off, I have never had a girlfriend; I did ""talk"" to a girl for a period of five months in high school, but I do not really count it. I also had a girlfriend for about a week once, but I guess that does not count either. Fast forward to college, I have met some interesting people and have made some friends along the way, but I just cannot seem to get out there in terms of dating. My first experience with dating, or attempt at dating, came during my second semester where I met ""kat.” We both transferred in at the same time, and when it came time to choose lab partners I asked if she wanted to work with me. I think we got along ok, there were a few laughs here, and just generally a lot of small talk. Later in the semester, midterms came and so I asked if she wanted to study together. We got to know each other a little better, and studied together again for our second midterm and finally the final. While we studied, I basically spent the whole time answering her questions, and going over the material with her; I basically felt like a tutor. During finals, I asked her if she would be interested in getting some coffee. But, we were both busy due to finals and so I said that I would be getting back to her towards the end of finals, and that way we would both have more free time and would be less stressed. When I finally asked her, her response was that she would be out of town and would let me know. I never heard back from her after that. This made me feel like I was being used, I probably was being used, and made me feel like crap. I understand that sometimes girls do not want to be mean when rejecting people sometimes; I did not know what to make of it, so I did not contact her again because I guess I “go the hint.” I tend to react based on what I know, and to me this was a situation similar to when I had a girlfriend for about a week. After she broke up with me, I tried to remain in contact with her, but she would give me delayed responses; I later found out from one her friends that the reason she delayed was because she was hoping that I would get the hint and cease talking to her. I know the situation with kat is not the same, but what else was I supposed to conclude or do? And so, I went ahead and deleted kat’s information from my phone so I would not be tempted to drunk call her at some point in the future. I just wanted to move on. 

My second experience with dating came last year. I met this girl through a friend of mine in class, and at one point we all worked on homework together on separate occasions. I admit that I may not have been the nicest of people to her, and would make fun of her selection in movies. We never hung out outside of school. I saw her at a party that our mutual friend invited us both to, and I got to talk to her a little more. She later dropped the class we were both in, and so I decided to give her a call to ask her out since I would not see her anymore; I had her number because we worked on homework together a few times. During our phone call, she was a bit reluctant to hang out, just the two of us, she eventually agreed to hang out, but she only wanted to hang out on campus; I agreed, since I just wanted to get to know her better. We agreed to hang out later on that week, but her tone and the fact that I had to just continually say that I wanted just the two of us to hang out made me think that it was going to fall through. The day came, and I asked, through text, if we were still on for later that night, and she said that she had some errands to run before meeting and may be a little later, but would let me know when she would be free. Later that night, my roommates decided to go out to dinner and so I joined thinking that my plans with her were going to fall through anyways. Dinner took really long, and I did not hear from her until later on that night. There was no way for me to get back and so I asked to postpone for the weekend, she agreed. I can’t quite remember if I had asked her if we were still on as the weekend approached, but at some point there was no more contact between the two of us. I thought ok, we are not going to meet she may just have trouble saying no so I just won’t ask anymore. We had not agreed on the time, but we did agree to meet on a Saturday. I was at a meeting that Saturday morning/afternoon when she called me and asked if I still wanted to meet. At this point I was very confused, maybe I had it all wrong. I agreed to meet with her right after my meeting. We finally met, in a computer lab, we say hi and we sit down. We talked a little, and I asked what she was up to and she told that she was just filling out applications for internships. She puts on her headphones the moment we sit down, and we do not talk the whole time I am we are there, I think we were there for about 45 minutes before I decided to ask her a question to try to break the ice, or at least start a conversation, and she just gives me a very hostile response with a tone that made it seem like she annoyed that I would ask her such a stupid question. I did not know what to do at that moment, and so I just got up and told her I was going back home. I was really frustrated, and as she said bye I flipped her off and just kept walking away. 

As I write this, I am starting to think that I may have come off as a total asshole while I was trying to set up a time where we could both meet and hang out. Guess I can’t blame her for acting the way she did. 
These experiences, along with some earlier have lead me to believe that my personality just does not seem to fit with others. I cannot seem to find anyone with similar interests in music, humor, or even movies; things that are usually starting points for some kind of a relationship.  I do not know what to say or think on the matter. I sometimes think that it has been my past experiences with girls that has lead me to this point, but that would be placing the blame solely on others. I may share equally in the blame.
The worst experiences I have had have been in high school. I have been called gross, and weird by just about every girl I have shown any interest in. I guess I may have been a typical “nice guy” at those moments, but I feel I have since changed a bit, or maybe not. My friends in high school would always tell me that I am a boring person, because I would never really talk much. I was always used a spring board to make my friends look good in front of girls. I want to place the blame on these experiences, but again, I may be avoiding blame myself. 

Now, I feel that I have nothing to offer anyone. I now think that everyone around me is shallow when it comes to dating, because I guess I am shallow too. To me, this means that I do not stand a chance, because I am not good looking. I have often been told by one my friends tell me that I should not settle, and that I can date anyone I like. But, I think that she is just being nice. Most recently, one of my friends have told me begin to take an interest in things that girls like. What does that even mean? I like what I like, and will not pretend to like something that I don’t. This does not mean that I am not willing to try new things, or am reluctant to expose myself to new experiences. It is a very vague statement. 

I do not go out since most of my friends have graduated already. One of my only remaining friends at school has a girlfriend who he spends most of his time, with while the other is just a hardcore gamer who never leaves his room or the house. 

I have been going to gym and made gains over the past two semesters. I have also lost a significant amount of weight. But, my motivation for going has not been to make myself better looking for girls since I will still be ugly regardless of the weight I loose, and the muscle I gain. I go because I generally just enjoy it. Before starting college I boxed, and fell in love with being active and so going to the gym has reawaken that part of me. But, through all of this I still feel shitty and empty. One of my friends says that I will eventually find someone, but how will I? I am very focused on what I want to accomplish with my degree, and I am sure that everyone whom I would be remotely interested in will also feel the same way. Where will I find this person? The dating arena only gets worse after college. I have come to the conclusion that I may be what someone settles for in the future, which frustrates me. I guess I have completely shut myself off at this point, and no amount of talks I have had with anyone has helped at all. I doubt that you will either, to be completely honest. I am not expecting anyone to even respond, and instead just down vote me into oblivion. That’s ok, I just needed to all this crap out of my head and onto some medium where I can organize all of these thoughts. 
Everyone seems to just hate the “nice guy,” but do not offer any help. I do not know if I fall under this category, but I am starting to think that I do. I want to have a light bulb moment in this aspect of life, but that just does not seem to come at all. I can anticipate that some responses may go something like: “it’s just part of the game, and you should just get over it,” but I doubt that anyone has had the experiences I have had. There is only so much rejection one can take before feeling inadequate, and I am at that point right now.

My name is Dean. I am 26 years old originally from Long Island, NY.

I moved to LA on my own two years ago and I am soon to be graduating from College for Audio Engineering attaining my associates in that field. 

I have a tenacity and drive within myself that I earned my way to moving here, supporting myself and maintaing two part time jobs.

Sure, my school has a career advisement department but unfortunately, their way is mostly advice and unpaid internships.


I understand this is a way, and I will not exclude it. I do have rent
to pay however and it is hard with classes and a part time job to balance.


I am almost Pro Tools Certified and have a resume working in construction unions from NY and LA when I first moved here.


I love sound, I love manipulating it and recording and mixing in general.


I want to work in either post, with ADR, Foley and second systems
as well as the music side of things.


I am asking for advice, or if anyone knows of a foot in the door opportunity. 

I am always wanting to earn, through hard work and professionalism, my way up into a career.


Thank you everyone.

316pbs,7,2015-04-02,Help! I think my Mirena has changed my body image for the worse.,rawrxchomp,birthcontrol,https://www.reddit.com/r/birthcontrol/comments/316pbs/help_i_think_my_mirena_has_changed_my_body_image/,"Hey reddit

I'm becoming really troubled regarding my current Mirena IUD. 

I turned 21 in August. I'm a student an engineering student in college, and I work as an engineering intern part time. I have never been pregnant, and I have had the same SO for the past 2.5 years. I have been logging my eating habits since late 2012, since that is when my weight loss endeavor began, and I continue to exercise 3-5 times a week for at least half hour. Since my Mirena insertion, I have noticed a ~7-10lb increase in weight, a constantly hard and ""swollen/bloated"" outward protruding stomach, and inability to shed it.

Here's my history:

When I was 19, I started looking into birth control. I started off on Lo Loestrin Fe, started Ortho Tri-Cyclen shortly afterwards, and then settled on Apri. I stayed on Apri until October 2014 and decided to have a Mirena IUD inserted. Apri was fantastic to me regarding keeping my skin clear, keeping the bloating down, and not inhibiting me from losing weight. For the ~2 years I was taking Apri, I was able to lose ~30lb with a healthy diet change and exercise. I was always able to lose weight after with consistent caloric deficiency + exercise after the initial 30lb lose, but it would always be my reluctance that would gain it back.  I started to hate Apri during the last 9-6 months I was on it, however, because I noticed that my mood swings were out of control and my libido wasn't what it use to be. I delayed taking a new pack of Apri for 2 weeks in order to plan my period to line up in my favor for some upcoming events and I noticed that I was craving sexual activity more during this break. 

Once I started Mirena, I felt more in control of my emotions and my body; my mood swings have been nonexistent and my libido is back. I have noticed a change in my body image though. Since I began Mirena, my acne has come back and I have gained ~10lb. My stomach has started to look very flubby and swollen--almost extremely bloated. In light of this, I started exercising more, added weight circuits to the mix, and have been super conscious of my consumption (to the point where I track every shot I took on saturday nights). Three months of this has not made a dent in my weight and I feel more exhausted. 

I went to my Gyno, she looked at my charts, and told me that my increase in weight from before the insertion and now aren't that big of a deal. I don't think she understood how self conscious I am about my body image since I put a lot of hard work into becoming comfortable in how I look and feel. 
Since that Gyno visit, I have gotten a personal trainer and continued exercising, regulating my food intake, and sleeping more to fight the fatigue. I still have not seen results and I really think it's my Mirena to blame.

I have visited the dermatologist twice since insertion and we have changed my topicals and antibiotics around. Though my acne has been improving, my skin is nothing like it use to be. 

Although I thank my Mirena for protecting me from pregnancy and allowing me to be more in control of my emotions and sex drive, this change in body image has stunted me from those benefits since I become really frustrated, and almost ugly, looking in the mirror. 

I'm considering having Mirena removed and possibly looking into Skyla, but I recently learned that it's made by the same company as Mirena.

So reddit, what are your thoughts on my situation? Should I take a break from Mirena, try a different BC, etc.

316up3,0,2015-04-02,Used a Mac for the first time for 6 months - Have a few questions for my next purchase!,v0lta_7,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/316up3/used_a_mac_for_the_first_time_for_6_months_have_a/,"I've always been a Windows/Linux user, but I used a Macbook Air for 6 months which I got during my internship. It's time for me to buy a new laptop now so I'd really like if you can answer a few questions for me. Please be as unbiased as possible :)

First of all, I was absolutely floored by the experience. I finally understood what the hell Apple fans meant when they talked about experience. It's far smoother, far slicker, far more comfortable to use. I do have a few questions though:

1. Have you ever used a *similarly priced* Windows laptop? I've always used laptops far cheaper so maybe I'm not making a fair comparison in my mind. How's the 'experience'? I mean trackpad (my favorite thing about the macbook air), feel of the keyboard, screen viewing angles, OS smoothness. Everything but the core OS functionalities.

2. On the software side, however, I was really disappointed by a few things. First being maximizing. What the hell is up with the maximize button. It just expanded the window vertically slightly so that it covered the available vertical height. What is the point of this?! I know shift+maximize does 'proper' maximize, but isn't this really unintuitive? Also, minimizing. Some programs minimize to the right side section of the dock. Some programs insist on minimizing even on pressing the close button, but they go to the normal section of the dock! Whaaat!

3. Window management - 6 months is a long time and I still couldn't get my head around it. My most used program was Chrome, with 4+ windows open, 10+ tabs in each. Along with various other programs open. And I noticed there were 3 places I had to look into when I was looking for a particular window. a) The Minimize section of the dock towards the right. b) The normal section of the dock, which sometimes held pseudo-minimized windows even after pressing the close button! c) The super-maximized windows which take up the entire screen.     
Isn't this a bit messy? I never seemed to know where my windows were if I wasn't aware of how I'd left my computer before I left for a cup of coffee. In MS Windows, it's the taskbar. All open windows are grouped in the taskbar, no nonsense. Add to that, the fact that 'close' pseudo minimizes some programs. Which have to be 'closed' with 'quit'. But it proper closes some other programs! How is this ambiguity acceptable? What is the reasoning behind this?

4. File management - Oh man. I actively ignored any file management needs because I found it so awful. Maybe this is because I've been using PC style file management for over 18 years but still. What's up with that god awful cover art style file browser? I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. Plus we can apparently only put files in sections like 'Pictures', 'Videos' etc. but no custom folders? 

Overall, I love the hardware, absolutely adore the trackpad, and also the smoothness of OSX. But functionality wise these are a few things that bugged me. I'm posting to see if there are other people bothered by these things, and what they do to make these better. And to find out whether these things are affecting me only because I'm a first time user, and maybe they would eventually become insignificant problems.

I have a few questions for you! :),kleva,UGA,https://www.reddit.com/r/UGA/comments/3175hn/considering_transferring_to_uga_as_a_business/,"Hi /r/UGA! Please excuse my ignorance with the following questions lol, I haven't visited UGA yet and I don't know anyone who's gone there, either. :p

1. How are the job prospects? What about internships? Would there be an advantage to living in Atlanta (attending GSU) since It's right in the city, or is it just as good in Athens? What are your experiences? 

2. I'm a city person, so considering to live in Athens is pretty strange for me right now. BUT I also really enjoy nature, quaint shopping areas, and the college town culture. Does Athens have this?

3. Are there SAFE and inexpensive apartment complexes near campus (and near stores)? It seems like apartments there are pretty cheap, but I wonder about how safe they are. Any recommendations for a place to live would be very much appreciated! 

4. is UGA respected more than, say, GaTech or GSU in regards to their business program? GSU and GaTech are definitely trying to work their way up, especially with entrepreneurship, but I'm unfamiliar as to what UGA's is doing with their business program.

5. and finally - do you know of a UGA grad who's gone to work with good companies, whether in this state or out of state? 

Thank you for answering, I'm sure it will make my decision a bit easier! :)"

I feel like Engineering was a waste of time..,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/317dpf/why_does_nobody_want_to_hire_me_i_feel_like/,"I have applied to 200+ jobs and have had 2 interviews. That's less than 1% of all of my applications.. I graduated in April 2014 with a 3.4/4 gpa with BEng Mechanical and 4 great internships (everyone that I talked to/worked with liked me and I walked away with some great references), but haven't had any hopeful prospects since August. I've gone to my university's career center and tweaked my resume and cover letter to represent my skills and what I can do best, but apparently it wasn't worth it. 

I'm beginning to feel worthless and like a waste of air. I have $1000 to my name, enough for car insurance, gas and phone bill until July (luckily I get to stay with my parents for free), but I don't think I can handle applying to anymore jobs. I look at a job title and think ""Yeah, I might like this"", go into the description and it lists the requirements, and then I get doubtful, and question my self-worth because this new job is so similar to the last one that I didn't get so then I just close the tab and lay down in bed. 

I haven't felt this down since my first year of engineering when I was close to being kicked out because of my grades.. I know that people say that you should treat applying to jobs like a job, but I don't know how much longer I can go on with this. I got so desperate for any job and self-worth that I applied to local restaurants and businesses, but they look at my resume, see BEng, laugh at me and ask if it is a joke, then pass it back and say they aren't hiring.. I'm getting really sick of this now. I don't have any patience for anything, every little thing sets me off. I don't even hang with my friends anymore because I don't have the money to waste getting back and forth to wherever.. 

To top it all off, I don't even remember what my passion for engineering was.. I did want to go into oil and gas, or automotive.. now I don't even know.."

I'm wondering 2 things,

1) How do I know where to apply? Do I search for MS in Data Science or is it MS in CS, Stats, or Analytics or something? Or do I look for professors instead? Do I have a choice of whether it's actually applying methods to data or research into different ""data scientific""  techniques?

2) More immediately, I don't have anything planned for this summer (my last summer in college) but I've done an REU research program my freshman summer and did nothing my sophomore summer. I'm a finalist for a software dev (probably) internship right now but probably won't get it. Do I **need** an internship like that or should I just find a professor here to do research with this summer/next semesters?

317kdt,0,2015-04-02,"I've gone and done it again, compared myself to my skinny but 'alpha' friend Sam on Facebook, now I feel shit. I then read David Wong's 6 Harsh Truths and it seems justified disappointment in self. 22M",Xemnas81,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/317kdt/ive_gone_and_done_it_again_compared_myself_to_my/,"**tl;dr** I am feeling more depressed after comparing myself to my very outing and talented friends on Facebook, then I read 6 Harsh Truths from Cracked and it sorta reminded me I am a loser doing nothing with my life-this is at once an unfair assessment to make of myself since I am scoring as moderately depressed on medical records, but nonetheless the harsh truth**

Cliffs 

* Sam was one of my oldest, closest friends in middle and high school. He was always a bubbly, funny, goofy and optimistic guy, but to start with very shy like myself. For a time he looked up to me, as did the whole friendship group. 

* Around junior high, Sam's grandfather passed away from liver failure and cardiac arrest (alcoholism ran in the family). He spent several weeks traumatised, and then vowed to go YOLO. He moved away from home to Uni a few hundred miles away, after a first year where he basically just sold out and became a LAD getting drunk every night, blitzed his exams and made tons of friends, really coming out oh shell.   

* In high school, after my parents got divorced, I was recovering from what I now see to be ongoing depression and anxiety disorder/panic attacks. A few symptoms of this, extreme hypochondria (the belief I myself was dying of heart disease), constant fatigue and insomnia, and disordered eating meant I was in no state to move away from home, sadly. I did however save a lot of money from tuition fees with this. This was all related to my low self-esteem from being Dyspraxic

* I went to Uni in hindsight, a year too early, first year I just went to lectures and did my best not to think about the idea I was dying, so I didn't make many friends, but I grew closer to some of my friendship groups at home. Eventually I became a forum addict, to The Student Room and much later (after graduation) yours truly, Reddit, to replace normal social interaction. However I regularly made posts like this, which frustrated people.  

* I had one relationship, however this went to shit largely because of my low self esteem as a result of my social anxiety. Also TSR trolls started feeding me PUA/Redpill theory and, along with BB Misc which I was frequenting, convinced me I was 'beta' which has become a self fulfilling prophecy. 

* Over time it has become increasingly apparent that my friends, and hell my brother, who moved away have done notably better in their social lives, and are more productive, successful, happy individuals than myself. 

Example: 

Sam

a) Graduated with 2.1 

b) Just landed a job with a chemical plant

c) Had a retail job before me 

d) Dating a hot girlfriend and they seem to be in love, has had several girlfriends

e) Tons of friends, as evidenced by Facebook

f) Good with girls 

g) Really good artist (evidence: I've seen it, recognition on Facebook)

h) Pretty good guitarist(evidence: I've heard him, we jammed a few times)

i) Funny

j) Skinny but athletic, pretty good looking

Another friend (let's call him Jay):

a) Graduated, doing MSc

b) Has his own place at 22, after his parents moving to America 

c) Lead guitarist for a now professional rock band 

d) Funny 

e) Great with girls 

f) Just broke up with hot girlfriend, petty down about that right now but still, has had several girlfriends

One more, Matt: 

a) First degree, really smart 

b) Works out/good looking big guy 

c) Good with girls, Romeo of our old social group from high school, pattern carried on in Uni
 
d) Currently doing extreme fitness courses like Ironman and Tough Mudder

e) Last time I saw him a year ago, he'd landed an internship with Rolls Royce

 then there's me, I'm trying to be objective 

a) Graduated with 2.1 

b) Depressed due to unmanaged anxiety/social anxiety/some obsessive thought loop thing which sometimes goes into paranoia

c) Used to be good drummer but lost my kit when I moved house, can't (don't?) practice as much these days

d) Used to be good with animals but lost confidence when we had to put my cat up for adoption, again when we moved house 

e) Unemployed and on benefits due to depression/anxiety. Had a weekend retail job in Uni but eventually went on sick leave because I couldn't handle the pressure. I can't handle capitalism atm

f) Seemingly good with kids in fairness, evidence: I volunteer in an elementary school helping kids who struggle to read to get motivated and pick up their confidence

g) 'Smart' but actually not that smart, as reported by others outside of my family/counsellors, just book smart-used to be smarter. Definite slide in my skills, although produced some good work during my degree and some interesting shower thoughts for TSR, largely intellectual masturbation

h) Virgin, had one girlfriend, mutual breakup for reasons, but probably pushed her away

i) Suck with girls, truly a phobia (except this one girl sigh) 

j) Forum addict, with drastic consequences (significant downslide in relationship with ex as it got worse, along with porn-&gt; see below)

k) 'Nice guy' (as in I am that guy who puts Happy Birthday! on your Facebook wall like that means jack shit. But again in fairness I am kind to my close friends and help them through their problems

l) Insomniac, practically given up now due to porn addiction and as mentioned forum addiction, as it stands I've had 5 hours sleep

They spend all day at work programming. They put up with shit conditions and work extra hours because they love the job. They go home and work code on side projects. Their github overflows with open source contributions. They read programming blogs in their free time. Programming is more than just a job for them.

I also know a lot of companies seem to be looking for this kind of person.

I am not this person. Nothing against those who are. But I already sacrifice enough of my life to the god of RSI at the altar of the desk and keyboard. I genuinely do enjoy programming. But at 5 PM I want to turn off my computer and not think about code at all until I come in the next day. I want to spend that time doing and thinking about other shit.

I'm not fussed about getting a big salary, but I do want good work conditions. Don't get me wrong - I'm not looking to slack off all day. I will work hard during work hours, and go home happy with no need to think about work when I'm not at work.

I have a First (top degree classification in the UK) in computer science from one of the best unis in the country. I'm currently most of the way through a master's. I have done a couple of good internships (and got a job offer from one of the companies but turned it down to do my master's). I think if I really wanted to, I could work hard on some side projects to boost my overall portfolio and get a good job at one of the major companies. But that is really not the environment I want to be in.

Is this the wrong industry for me?"

Every time it feels too long of a story because there's a lot of background.  I'm gonna make this short as I can.  For 10 or so years I have been depressed.  Convincing myself not to kill myself was a daily struggle, but I kept it hidden and coped with a lot of drugs, mostly weed and occasional painkillers and ecstasy.  I always kept to myself because I never wanted to burden others with my problems.  About 7 months ago I went to TomorrowWorld and started feeling happy after trying LSD for the first time.  My depression never fully left, but I was doing better after making some new friends there who I would rave with back home.  Last month I stopped my drug use to look for a summer internship.  My mood began to decline and so did my grades in school. The stress of playing catch up and overthinking about everything hit me really hard with depression again.  I went on spring break last week in PCB to try and release some stress and regain some happiness. It wasn't as much like TomorrowWorld, and the first few days weren't too great for me.  My friend gave me some Xanax to ease my tension, and I was able to open up and feel more like myself.  I had never tried any anxiety meds before then.

We ended up meeting these girls on the second last day in the same resort as us, and I felt like I really hit it off with one of them.  I'm not good when it comes to girls and am still a virgin, so this was a big step for me.  Her phone battery died the first night we met so I had no luck there. Texted her the next morning and we spent the last day together.  We ended up doing some LSD that night and was in bed with her, but I was too fucked up to actually have sex.  She did text me the next day and said she had a great time, though.

The backstory leads to what's bothering me.
  
Here's the first: 
I don't think this girl really wants a relationship, and I'm fine with that because neither do I at the moment.  We also live more than 10 hours away from each other.  She was really just a really cool person that I'd like to stay in touch with, like I've done with friends I met at TomorrowWorld.  I don't know what I can say or do without coming off too strong or cold.

Now onto the second part:
I just got back from an exam that I know I failed hard.  I'm expecting academic probation after this semester and I've been overthinking and stressing myself out way too much.  I've found more Xanax from my friend and it helps a lot with calming my thoughts and keeping me away from suicidal thoughts.  I've come to the point where I can admit I need help with my mental health, and through writing this, I'm pretty sure it's anxiety.  I'm gonna have to let my parents know, and that scares me.  I've kept this act of ""good, responsible, successful son"" with them for so long that they might think I'm trying to just get drugs.

Like the title says, I love my CS education. The classes I'm taking/ have taken (Data structures, Algorithm design, Combinatorics, Operating Systems, Computer Vision, Bioinformatics, Automata Theory, and much more) have been tremendously interesting and extremely fun to take. It seems that everyday in my Combinatorics class I have an 'aha' moment and learn something rad.


Now looking ahead, I'll have to secure a full-time job in June 2016 since I have no interest in going to graduate school or being unemployed. Problem is, I've grown to greatly dislike the current software industry and it's associated culture. It seems that everyone is money-obssesed, pushing out shitty little apps that do worthless things, trying to come up with the next big whatever-the-fuck. And then, to get interviews at these shitty little web startups, you have to have 5 prior internships, a GPA of 3.999, be the former president of the CS club (how many presidents could there be?), have countless open source contributions, and have 10+ substantial github projects. I'm exaggerating of course, but you get the idea. Once you get this interview at a shitty little web startup for a web dev. position, you get to field questions like, 'write a turing machine', 'write a binary search tree and every possible traversal algorithm', 'implement a fully associative CPU cache', and similar. Who do they think they are, asking these kinds of questions? You're making a fucking website, you don't need that kind of knowledge to make a fucking website!


So here's the punchline: I'm not interested in working in a beer-chugging, frat bro startup pushing a shitty ass tinder-esque app to maximize profits and 'get rich as fuck brah'. I don't want to work in the web development industry with the associated 'culture fit is important and we have yoga on Thursdays'. I don't feel that these things do justice to my education that I've worked so hard for, and I feel that I'm not reaching my full potential if I end up getting tickets asking me to move a button 2 pixels to the left all day or whatever. So what are my options?


I want to work with the stuff I learned in my CS education, I don't want to get a higher degree, there must be something for me?"

I'm a student looking at internships, and I had an interview with a medium size company, and was offered the job, I told them I need some time to think because I'm waiting on other companies responses, and they gave me a deadline of Monday at 12:00pm. I'm currently in the process of interviewing with a huge IT company (think HP, IBM size) and I think I have a really good chance of getting the position. The problem is, we were working out times to interview, and we were shooting for Friday so I'd have enough time to get responses and make my final decision, but because it's Good Friday, they told me they'll need to conduct the interview on Monday. I'd be fine with that (obviously if it's in the morning, and they'd be fine because they know I'm looking at other options as well), the problem is, my schedule with my current internship includes me being there on Monday from 7:30am - 3:00pm. 

I guess I'm just wondering what the best thing to tell my current internship would be? The position I was already accepted for would be a really good opportunity (Intern to hire) and it's paid, but the Job at the big IT company would be amazing, I'd be able to learn a lot, it pays double the other internship and I feel like I have a really good chance to get it, but I don't want to turn down the offer I already have based on a good feeling.

I hope my ramblings weren't too hard to understand, I'm sort of trying to come up with a solution ASAP and I hope I'm coming off coherently. I'd really appreciate any help, thank everyone."

I'm being intentionally pessimistic in that I'm assuming I won't get a callback for another internship at this same company (I'm a sophomore now), so what I'm worried about is what smaller companies think. Basically if I'm applying for internships again in 7 months time and I have ""Facebook intern, summer 2015"" on my resume, is that gonna be a major red flag? In that I fluked an i/ship at a great company but  I wasn't good enough to continue there - indicating either that I fluked it or I had some major personality flaw, or whatever?


tl;dr Will it look bad if I apply to 'generic SV webdev company' with a big4 on my resume? Because it implies I fucked up somewhere that gave me all the opportunities I could ever ask for?"

318ha8,3,2015-04-02,Law Bound: I would like to sincerely thank r/Christianity and a few users in particular for their prayers.,executeanddontfail,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/318ha8/law_bound_i_would_like_to_sincerely_thank/,"TLDR; Prayer from strangers helped get me into law school. 

On Friday, December 5th of 2014 I got onto Reddit to ask for prayers for the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) that I was taking the next day on Saturday, December 6th. I had been praying so hard for so long to do well on the test because I had done poorly on an LSAT I took earlier in September scoring a 145. A 145 placed me in the 27 percentile (not even close enough to apply and have a shot). Through prayer, I had a firm faith that I was supposed to go to law school but the LSAT was pushing me away from law school given my low score. I was overwhelmed and confused. I asked for prayer from friends, family, and of all places.... r/Christianity. 

I went into the December LSAT with a sense of peace and got out with the same sense of peace only to receive my score back on January 1st of 2015. SCORE: 145. Two tests, back to back.... same score. When I got my score back however, I was calm, I was collected, and I was abnormally content with it. I prayed the moment I saw my score and said ""I give it to you Lord.""

I spent the first weeks of 2015 calmly studying for the February LSAT and praying non stop. Instead of praying for a great LSAT score on the February LSAT, I prayed for God to take total control of my life and lead me where I needed to go, using a verse from the song ""Oceans"" by Hillsong United* as my daily reminder of my prayer goal. I continued working on my applications and my personal statement (the required essay for entry to law school). 

As I studied for my last opportunity to take the LSAT in February, I worked on my personal statement everyday. During this time I was filled with an overwhelming sense of personal reflection and was distinguished with a sort of wisdom that I had never once possessed before. I wrote my personal statement with an air of sincerity that was virtually non-existent in my life until those few weeks. I could feel a shift, a movement (whatever you want to call it) of my inner being. Already a relatively good writer, I was confident in my skills to write the essay but a personal statement is much different than an essay you write for a college course. Personal statements require a story and a window into one's own perspective, which is not easy to portray in writing. As I wrote, I could feel thoughts popping into my  head that were undeniably foreign, yet on par with the intentions of my story. I felt like everything was excellent until of course...

Sunday, Feb. 1st, 2015----  I laid down to go to sleep and prayed for a peaceful week before the LSAT that I was going to take the coming Saturday. I had 6 days to relax and wait patiently for it.... I prayed a long prayer and went to sleep. I woke up the next morning on Monday and woke up at 2 am with my mind telling me ""PULL OUT"". Assuming I was just having stress dreams, I went back to sleep until 4 am and my awoke with my mind racing and saying ""DONT TAKE IT."" Again, I went back to sleep until I woke up for the day well rested at 9 am and the first thought I was bombarded with when I  woke was precise and clear, ""DONT TAKE THAT TEST! YOU DONT NEED TO TAKE IT! PULL OUT!""

I went into the kitchen where my mom was ironically rambling about how she was late to her Bible Study and I said to her, ""Hey I am going to pull out of the LSAT, I don't think it will matter."" I woke up and I knew what to do........I needed to pull out of the Feb LSAT, finish my personal statement, and apply with the two 27%ile 145's that I had. It was bold. It was also not recommended by every blog, website, lawyer, lsat tutor, and mentor I had talked to over my four years of college.... but I knew it was EXACTLY what I needed to do. 

I am not a spontaneous person. I am mildly outgoing and like to have fun, but I am the type to look both ways 10 times when trying to cross a one way street. I also like to follow the books. My decision to in apply with 145's was so beyond my normal thought process I laugh when I think about how out of the norm for me it was. 

But my laughter lulls when I realize how truly blessed I am and how I was blessed through faith, prayers from family, and prayers from strangers. 

I wrote the greatest story of my life in January and February 2015. I was granted wisdom, sincerity, patience, peace, determination, and most importantly faith as I worked on it. I know such gifts came through faith and from the prayers of strangers like those on r/Christianity. 

After submitting my applications I relied on faith and prayers of such strangers and waited, feeling there was going to be something to come out of everything I had been experiencing. 

In the 6 day window when I sent out my applications, I met a man who offered me a summer internship at one of the top corporate law firms in a beautiful skyscraper in Ft Worth, TX. 

A week later I received three waitlist emails from Tier One Law Schools. (William and Mary, University of Colorado Boulder, and University of Georgia).

A week after that on March 16th, I was accepted to my first choice law school at my degree granting institution. Two days later I turned 23. 

I am standing today with acceptance to law school, a renewed sense of self identity,firm confidence, and (according to my family and girlfriend), a softness of heart and mind. I attribute it to God 100%. God works through prayer in people however, and He worked through those who prayed for me. I am sure there were others who read my post 3 months ago, prayed, but did not comment and I thank all of you. But specifically, I would like to thank:

What do I do?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3191yx/i_have_social_anxiety_and_its_killing_my_life/,"Please bear with me if you can even if story is kind of pathetic. I'm a 19 year old college kid that has always been socially awkward. I can't ever remember a time not being like this, even as a child.

Recently I've been having job interviews for internships. I've been turned down at 4 places. This was a massive wake up call for me. I've been able to limp through life hating myself and wishing I had the guts to speak to people (as a side note I will not and cannot blame others for my issues... I've ran into so many kind and supportive people along with spiteful people that there is no way that wholly blame others). Now I know that I can't continue like this.

I don't think I'm a sociopath; I think I truly do care about others to an extent. But if there's someone who drops their phone and I'm within reach I feel too scared to help out. In situations like this I end up hating myself because by doing nothing I end up doing the wrong thing. 

Right now I'm at the pits. I really don't know what to do since the ""real world"" clearly will not tolerate my level of social anxiety. I apologize if I sounded insincere or if this seems like a self-gratifying rant, but I really have no idea how to go on with my life. I don't know where to go from here. If you've read through this thanks for putting up with this crap. 

EDIT: I realized I left out a ton of stuff I could have put up about myself. I don't really have any friends... Going back to the issue of blaming others, I just can't bring myself to return the favor of kindness to others. There have been a few that have persisted but I never really feel close to them. 

Another thing is that I think I appear cold or uncaring to others. Some more talkative and bolder people as well as my family have mentioned this to me. I'm not even consciously thinking negatively towards others most of the time. 

Yet another thing I remembered is that I usually feel pretty pessimistic and strung out. I feel very stressed and unhappy the days before an exam or if I failed an exam. I also dislike hearing people talk to much about themselves... I guess in a way I don't care for people that feel sorry for themselves. But that also makes me a hypocrite. :( The more I think about it the more complicated it seems and the less innocent I realize I am. 

I'm probably leaving out a ton of details but I can't think of any at this point. "

It will be my Junior year, and I have already finished all of the core CS classes (281, 370, 376). I still have to take Math 214 (or 417, someone told me one of the professors was easier) and 4 credits of intellectual breadth.

So I have a lot of freedom to choose my schedule, but it's also fairly difficult to balance interest with difficulty/courseload. It's also a big semester for getting internships, and what classes I take could make a decent impact (I'm sure companies would rather see 482 or 381 on a resume than something like Machine Learning). I'm looking at the following EECS courses:

* **381: Object Oriented Programming**   Looks great to companies and supposedly makes you a much better programmer in general, helpful for future classes. Also a ton of work

* **388: Intro to Computer Security** Heard it's a great and useful class, and apparently a light workload so easier to fit in with other EECS classes

* **482: Operating Systems** Very essential and useful for landing internships, but also very difficult

* **485: Web Database and Information Systems** Also useful in industry, doesn't seem too interesting but probably a good class to have under my belt

Any advice on which I should take? One possibility I thought of was 388, 381, and each the intellectual breadth class or Math 214. It's only 12 credits, but I've heard that's recommended when taking 381 since it's such a massive workload. Another possibility was taking two (or maybe all) classes out of 388, 482, 485, in addition to an intellectual breadth course and Math 214 (or no math if I took the 3 EECS).

I'd really appreciate any help. If it makes a difference, I'm currently taking 281, 370, and 376 and am not having any problems with time management (despite being told I ""would die""), and I've done very well on the 281 projects so far."

On here, me and littlethieflord will be posting a creepypasta or urban legend and all shit spooky, every 2 days.

Let's begin with a classic!

Here's Squidward's Suicide:

I just want to start off by saying if you want an answer at the end, prepare to be disappointed. There just isn't one.

I was an intern at Nickelodeon Studios for a year in 2005 for my degree in animation. It wasn't paid of course, most internships aren't, but it did have some perks beyond education. To adults it might not seem like a big one, but most kids at the time would go crazy over it.

Now, since I worked directly with the editors and animators, I got to view the new episodes days before they aired. I'll get right to it without giving too many unnecessary details. They had very recently made the SpongeBob movie and the entire staff was somewhat sapped of creativity so it took them longer to start up the season. But the delay lasted longer for more upsetting reasons. There was a problem with the series 4 premiere that set everyone and everything back for several months.

Me and two other interns were in the editing room along with the lead animators and sound editors for the final cut. We received the copy that was supposed to be ""Fear of a Krabby Patty"" and gathered around the screen to watch. Now, given that it isn't final yet animators often put up a mock title card, sort of an inside joke for us, with phony, often times lewd titles, such as ""How sex doesn't work"" instead of ""Rock-a-bye-Bivalve"" when SpongeBob and Patrick adopt a sea scallop. Nothing particularly funny but work related chuckles. So when we saw the title card ""Squidward's Suicide"" we didn't think it more than a morbid joke.

One of the interns did a small throat laugh at it. The happy-go-lucky music plays as is normal. The story began with Squidward practicing his clarinet, hitting a few sour notes like normal. We hear SpongeBob laughing outside and Squidward stops, yelling at him to keep it down as he has a concert that night and needs to practice. SpongeBob says okay and goes to see Sandy with Patrick. The bubbles splash screen comes up and we see the ending of Squidward's concert. This is when things began to seem off.

While playing, a few frames repeat themselves, but the sound doesn't (at this point sound is synced up with animation, so, yes, that's not common) but when he stops playing, the sound finishes as if the skip never happened. There is slight murmuring in the crowd before they begin to boo him. Not normal cartoon booing that is common in the show, but you could very clearly hear malice in it. Squidward's in full frame and looks visibly afraid. The shot goes to the crowd, with SpongeBob in center frame, and he too is booing, very much unlike him. That isn't the oddest thing, though. What is odd is everyone had hyper realistic eyes. Very detailed. Clearly not shots of real people's eyes, but something a bit more real than CGI. The pupils were red. Some of us looked at each other, obviously confused, but since we weren't the writers, we didn't question its appeal to children yet.

The shot goes to Squidward sitting on the edge of his bed, looking very forlorn. The view out of his porthole window is of a night sky so it isn't very long after the concert. The unsettling part is at this point there is no sound. Literally no sound. Not even the feedback from the speakers in the room. It's as if the speakers were turned off, though their status showed them working perfectly. He just sat there, blinking, in this silence for about 30 seconds, then he started to sob softly. He put his hands (tentacles) over his eyes and cried quietly for a full minute more, all the while a sound in the background very slowly growing from nothing to barely audible. It sounded like a slight breeze through a forest.

The screen slowly begins to zoom in on his face. By slow I mean it's only noticeable if you look at shots 10 seconds apart side by side. His sobbing gets louder, more full of hurt and anger. The screen then twitches a bit, as if it twists in on itself, for a split second then back to normal. The wind-through-the-trees sound gets slowly louder and more severe, as if a storm is brewing somewhere. The eerie part is this sound, and Squidward's sobbing, sounded real, as if the sound wasn't coming from the speakers but as if the speakers were holes the sound was coming through from the other side. As good as sound as the studio likes to have, they don't purchase the equipment to be that good to produce sound of that quality.

Below the sound of the wind and sobbing, very faint, something sounded like laughing. It came at odd intervals and never lasted more than a second so you had a hard time pinning it (we watched this show twice, so pardon me if things sound too specific but I've had time to think about them). After 30 seconds of this, the screen blurred and twitched violently and something flashed over the screen, as if a single frame was replaced.

The lead animation editor paused and rewound frame by frame. What we saw was horrible. It was a still photo of a dead child. He couldn't have been more than 6. The face was mangled and bloodied, one eye dangling over his upturned face, popped. He was naked down to his underwear, his stomach crudely cut open and his entrails laying beside him. He was laying on some pavement that was probably a road.

The most upsetting part was that there was a shadow of the photographer. There was no crime tape, no evidence tags or markers, and the angle was completely off for a shot designed to be evidence. It would seem the photographer was the person responsible for the child's death. We were of course mortified, but pressed on, hoping that it was just a sick joke.

The screen flipped back to Squidward, still sobbing, louder than before, and half body in frame. There was now what appeard to be blood running down his face from his eyes. The blood was also done in a hyper realistic style, looking as if you touched it you'd get blood on your fingers. The wind sounded now as if it were that of a gale blowing through the forest; there were even snapping sounds of branches. The laughing, a deep baritone, lasting at longer intervals and coming more frequently. After about 20 seconds, the screen again twisted and showed a single frame photo.

The editor was reluctant to go back, we all were, but he knew he had to. This time the photo was that of what appeared to be a little girl, no older than the first child. She was laying on her stomach, her barrettes in a pool of blood next to her. Her left eye was too popped out and popped, naked except for underpants. Her entrails were piled on top of her above another crude cut along her back. Again the body was on the street and the photographer's shadow was visible, very similar in size and shape to the first. I had to choke back vomit and one intern, the only female in the room, ran out. The show resumed.

About 5 seconds after this second photo played, Squidward went silent, as did all sound, like it was when this scene started. He put his tentacles down and his eyes were now done in hyper realism like the others were in the beginning of this episode. They were bleeding, bloodshot, and pulsating. He just stared at the screen, as if watching the viewer. After about 10 seconds, he started sobbing, this time not covering his eyes. The sound was piercing and loud, and most fear inducing of all is his sobbing was mixed with screams.

Tears and blood were dripping down his face at a heavy rate. The wind sound came back, and so did the deep voiced laughing, and this time the still photo lasted for a good 5 frames.

The animator was able to stop it on the 4th and backed up. This time the photo was of a boy, about the same age, but this time the scene was different. The entrails were just being pulled out from a stomach wound by a large hand, the right eye popped and dangling, blood trickling down it. The animator proceeded. It was hard to believe, but the next one was different but we couldn't tell what. He went on to the next, same thing. He want back to the first and played them quicker and I lost it. I vomited on the floor, the animating and sound editors gasping at the screen. The 5 frames were not as if they were 5 different photos, they were played out as if they were frames from a video. We saw the hand slowly lift out the guts, we saw the kid's eyes focus on it, we even saw two frames of the kid beginning to blink.

The lead sound editor told us to stop, he had to call in the creator to see this. Mr. Hillenburg arrived within about 15 minutes. He was confused as to why he was called down there, so the editor just continued the episode. Once the few frames were shown, all screaming, all sound again stopped. Squidward was just staring at the viewer, full frame of the face, for about 3 seconds. The shot quickly panned out and that deep voice said ""DO IT"" and we see in Squidward's hands a shotgun. He immediately puts the gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger. Realistic blood and brain matter splatters the wall behind him, and his bed, and he flies back with the force. The last 5 seconds of this episode show his body on the bed, on his side, one eye dangling on what's left of his head above the floor, staring blankly at it. Then the episode ends.

Mr. Hillenburg is obviously angry at this. He demanded to know what the heck was going on. Most people left the room at this point, so it was just a handful of us to watch it again. Viewing the episode twice only served to imprint the entirety of it in my mind and cause me horrible nightmares. I'm sorry I stayed.

The only theory we could think of was the file was edited by someone in the chain from the drawing studio to here. The CTO was called in to analyze when it happened. The analysis of the file did show it was edited over by new material. However, the timestamp of it was a mere 24 seconds before we began viewing it. All equipment involved was examined for foreign software and hardware as well as glitches, as if the time stamp may have glitched and showed the wrong time, but everything checked out fine. We don't know what happened and to this day nobody does.

There was an investigation due to the nature of the photos, but nothing came of it. No child seen was identified and no clues were gathered from the data involved nor physical clues in the photos. I never believed in unexplainable phenomena before, but now that I have something happen and can't prove anything about it beyond anecdotal evidence, I think twice about things.

Basically, I got into the co-op program at my school from high school but I'm pretty much failing this year (barely passing all my classes, and finals haven't even started yet). I was just informed that I have been dropped from the co-op program. I have too many credits (I got transfer credits from IB) to re-apply. 

The way my co-op advisor makes it sound, it's like I'll never get a job in CS for as long as I live. My dad tried to make it better by telling me that this is an opportunity for internships and semesters abroad, something I couldn't do while in co-op. Since everyone praises co-op so much, I've been freaking out since I got the news.

Is it true? Will I never get a job?"

* Will graduate university in May 2016
* 0 exams passed
* Will sit for Exam P in July
* Will hopefully sit for Exam FM early next year
* No internship experience as of yet
* Associate's Degree GPA : 3.9
* Bachelor's Degree GPA: TBD

Given the above information, I have recently discovered that I will be able to definitely graduate from my university in 1 year as opposed to previously believing that I would maybe be able to graduate in 1.5 years if I took 2 summer classes each summer due to the credits I'm bringing in from a previous four-year institution. 

This, however, means that I will be a senior next year and next summer will be my last chance to get internship experience  (I didn't have any luck finding internships for this upcoming summer), and from what I understand, many places aren't willing to take on interns who have just graduated, which means I've possibly flew past the chance to get some valuable work experience.

What can I do to help remedy this situation? With only 2 exams passed (which is a definite *maybe*) I will not be very competitive without any work experience. I'm willing to work anywhere in the Midwest which might help due to the amount of actuaries wanting to work in the Northeast and whatnot, but I'm not sure how much that adds to my chances. "

I am an electrical engineering student and I have been offered an internship for this summer at a well known company and I am not sure whether I should accept it. The company is in the top 25 list of [**Fortune 500**](http://fortune.com/fortune500/). 

A little background: I have two internships under my belt. The first one was just a three month summer long one and the second one is the one I am still working at to this day, (about 2.5 years now). Which I believe is a lot of experience compared to most students. 

The reason I am unsure if I should accept is I am not sure if my current job will accept me back after I return in August. My current part time internship helps me pay for my schooling and I would very much like to have a place to return to in order to help pay for my schooling and some other minor bills. By the way, I am guaranteed a job right out of school by my current company.

So in conclusion, would having this *Fortune 25's* name on my resume be almost like future ""job security"" that will help me land interviews and jobs quicker or should I not worry about that seeing as I have a lot of internship experience already -- and worry more about maintaining my current internship/job in order to cover my schooling and some minor bills?

When their adult child with children doesn't invite them and their own parents/siblings don't roll out the red carpet to make sure all their ""hallmark"" quality fantasies come true, its you the scapegoat who is freaking out.

Worse its my 41st tomorrow and mommy dearest demands I go out to eat with her or I am suicidal.  Seriously?

Fuck this. Most of why I don't want a relationship with her is because she is an absolutely paranoid sociopath during a holiday week.  The entire months of December, January, February, March is a long drawn out of depression for her. I am talking about her watching ""Miracle on 34th street"" and ""A Christmas Story"" daily these months, with huge crying spells.  That shit didn't disappait until a few years ago at the insistence of her married, felon, unemployed, diseased boyfriend.

Now I have told mommy dearest that since I am moving out May 1st because her Nboyfriend demands it I won't be continuing a relationship with her.  Obviously she knows I am serious because she is quite melodramatic about the end of our relationship.  And she has been calling relatives to complain about me.

What's weird is, I have forwarded the emails from this last week to my sister and my youngest aunt.. I am listening now to the audio recording of mommy dearest's phone conversation with my golden child sister who received these emails, my sister lives on FB and probably saw the emails yet doesn't tell my mom I sent them to her.

There is no point in spending a birthday meal with my mom or spending a holiday with her when I am not going to know her after May 1st.   She isn't going to be nice anyway, she never is.

Did I mention the last holiday mommy dearest had to drive out of town to spend with family was last Thanksgiving. Because I didn't sit in the car with her for 267 miles each direction while she was drunk she decided I was mentally ill. so when she came back, her next day at work she got a ""social worker intern"" to forge a SSI referral.

31a7mt,1,2015-04-03,A Question to those in Industry from an Indecisive High School student,Battlefront228,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/31a7mt/a_question_to_those_in_industry_from_an/,"I'll cut right to the point. At the moment I am trying to choose between UIUC and Purdue for Computer Science. Students on both sides vouch for their program, as is to be expected, but now I want a third source: those who work/hire in the Computer Science field.

Purdue I've been accepted into Vanilla Computer Science. UIUC is a bit weirder.

Officially the major is called CS+Astronomy, a branch of the new CS+X program, created in 2013. Since it's so new, there really isn't any data on industry reception. There is data on the schools CS+Math and CS+Stats programs, and ive heard nothing but positive feedback from professors, grads and students about those two. Other branch programs I could potentially switch two are +Chemistry, +Lingustics, +Stats and +Math. All the +X majors are located in the college of arts and sciences (LAS) while vanilla Computer Science is located in the college of engineering (CoE).

The gist of the +X programs is this: approx 64 hrs of 100-300 CS classes and 24 hrs of 200-400 X classes. I've been told I could enroll in 400 lvl CS classes, but the adviser later contradicted himself. When asked how hard a transfer into Vanilla would be, he stated difficult as the university was having trouble getting CS students in ""advanced CS courses"". 

Honestly, like most CS students my eye is on the lucrative Silicon Valley internships and jobs. while work as a computational scientist sounds interesting, I'm not convinced that's for me. 

Transfer to CoE is possible, albeit difficult. I feel that Purdue would offer more security in my major, yet UIUCs program keeps drawing me back. UIUC is a top 5 CS program up there with Stanford and Berkely. Purdue ranks in the low 20s. UIUC also has a nicer CS building, imo, and of the 3000 applicants to CS, I was one of only 300 to be accepted, so that has to count for something (that's a 10% admit rate). 

I apologize for the wall of text. I'm only 18 and here I am making the biggest decision of my life. My questions go as follows:

-What is industry perception of both schools
-What is industry opinion of the UIUC branch programs
-if I attended UIUC, which branch would be the best in the event I could not achieve transfer to CoE
-If there are any Computational Scientists on here, I'd be interested to hear about your job 
-Grads from either school, tell me about your experience

Costs don't matter to me at this point. I do find myself attracted to UIUC at the moment, but Purdue offers more security. Any help is appreciated."

31an9i,3,2015-04-03,Undergraduate seeking some advice,goggthegrunt,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/31an9i/undergraduate_seeking_some_advice/,"I know there's probably been a million of threads like these (in fact I saw another one earlier today), but I'd like some advice more specific to my situation from people that have experience in the field of bioinformatics. I tend to write a lot, so I'd like to thank you advance for reading about my situation.

I'm currently in my third year of my undergraduate career with a major in biochemistry. At the end of my second year, I took a class on the 'modern' era of biology. That class changed my perspective of how I view biology. One of the topics in the class was bioinformatics, and the capabilities of the field blew my mind. From, there I decided that I wanted to pursue bioinformatics.

Currently, I've decided to keep with my biochemistry major. I'm declaring a computing specialization for my major and a bioinformatics minor to supplement my major. The computing specialization actually isn't much. It's pretty much a watered down version of the bioinformatics minor, and it's entirely contained within the minor. I figure since it's no extra work, I might as well declare a computing specialization.

In terms of coursework and knowledge from the program I have set up for myself, I will have a good background in the biology aspect of bioinformatics, but I am not entirely sure of how strong my computer science will be for bioinformatics. The bioinformatics program at my school is still very primitive, and there's no formal department yet. Due to this, the coursework is rather loose. Following the coursework set-up by the minor, I will have taken C++ (three classes), three 'bioinformatics classes' (computational genetics, algorithms, and genomics), and four math/statistics classes (linear algebra, algorithms, probability, and data analysis). I'm still completing some of the preparation work for the more core classes such as the bioinformatics courses, so I cannot give a very detailed explanation of what each class will cover. **I was wondering if this is really enough in terms of preparing myself academically for a career in bioinformatics.** From what I've gathered, I will be needed more experience in coding (learning more languages like Python and R) and more mathematics (discrete structures?).

**Secondly, I would like to know what the advantages and disadvantages of getting a PhD vs. Masters are.** I guess this also extends into the whole industry vs. academia conversation as well. From what I understand, bioinformatics is not the best field for academia. I was told that bioinformaticians are often not lead authors on papers because while bioinformatics can be used as an excellent analytical tool, people want findings to be experimentally proved. Essentially, I was told that experiments/wet-lab researchers are better suited in academia than dry-lab researchers such as bioinformaticians. I tend to see more people go for Masters in bioinformatics than PhD's, and I'm guessing this is because the industry is better suited for bioinformaticians. I'm still quite fuzzy on this whole area, so any elucidation on this would be helpful.

**The last couple of things I would like to ask are in terms of research experience.** Since my freshman year, I have been working in a wet-lab studying breast cancer. While I enjoy this lab very much, I feel like it's not progressing towards my desired career path of becoming a bioinformatician. For a while now, I have been thinking of looking into some of the bioinformatics labs at my school, but I have a couple of concerns. The lab I am currently in is going to be publishing a paper fairly soon, and while I am not completely necessary to finish up the work for this paper, I would like to leave with my project resolved rather than left hanging. Secondly, I feel like I do not have enough computer science knowledge to truly contribute to a dry-lab. The only coding languages I know are C++ and JavaScript, and my math background is not quite strong yet (I have only taken multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and some basic statistics...I haven't yet completed all the math in the minor I stated above). **I'm not quite sure whether I should stay in my current wet-lab or look for a bioinformatics lab.** I would appreciate any thoughts.

**My final question is about internships and getting experience in the industry.** Since working in the industry is a very common route for bioinformaticians, I think it would be wise to get a feel for how the industry is. So far, all my experience with science has been in an academic setting through classes or university research labs. That being said, I've been having difficulty finding internships/opportunities for undergrads in bioinformatics. Most of the internships for bioinformatics that I've found asked that a Bachelors degree was already obtained. I'm looking around at the bigger companies, but I was wondering if there are any companies that might offer opportunities for undergrads specifically interested in bioinformatics like myself.

I know that was a lot of text! Thank you for bearing with me, and I really appreciate any comments and thoughts!"

It all started with me dating this wonderful man (23/m) who was in the department with me at college. We hit it off extremely well and started dating. He soon moved in with me and everything was peachy. Problem is, I'm more of a polyamorous person, so I crave attention and love where I can (history with divorced parents, lack of attention as a child, blahblablah).

Now, I used to RP as a kid. Loved the creativity of it all, let me escape reality and whatnot. So I picked it back up, which is where I met my best friend (28/m). We also hit it off, but he lived across the country. We flirted and whatnot, but he understood that I was in a relationship and was very respectful of it all.

Enter stage right the current love of my life (21/m). He's everything I've ever dreamed of. Not the most handsome guy, but wonderful, muscular, handy, Texan to boot. We hit it off hard. So hard, in fact, that boy #1 found out and I had to cut it off, since boy #1 and I were still dating at the time (I'm terrible, I know).

Fastforward to the present day. Boy #1 and I broke up since we're now states apart while he finishes his degree and I start my career. Boy #2 and I are in a relationship of sorts since we're now in the same state, but again, he realizes that it's temporary while I sort my fucked up life out.

The problem comes with boy #3, who is still states away and having trouble coping with the pain I put him through already. We had a period where we cut communication and I thought I'd never hear from him again. Months later, he reaches out, and we confide in each other that we never stopped loving the other and now it's all sorts of caddywampus. 

Boy #1 will be in the same state soon to start on the same internship as me. So that'll put three of us in the same vicinity while I'm still seeing what my options are like with boy #3. At this point in my life, I want to settle down, but my problem is I don't want to choose and then regret not fleshing out all my options. Now boy #3 is saying he doesn't want a relationship because of the pain I've caused him and it'll take some time to regain that, but I'm scared of losing him and... does any of this make any sense at all? Because it doesn't to me, either.

I know that most responses will berate me for juggling three guys at once. And yes, totally my fault. I'm stupid and irresponsible and I hurt everyone around me. I get that. I just don't know what to do. All three are wonderful men whom I love very much, and I know that in the end, I will end up hurting two to be with one. But I have no idea what to do anymore.

My junior summer I will likely be working at a different large firm (where I hope to work after school). My senior year will be more relaxed including studying abroad and enjoying my last days in college (i.e., no job).

I'm excited about this plan, but I'm afraid that it will be interpreted as job hopping by prospective employers. Should I cut my first internship off my resume come senior year to combat this? Or should I rethink my plan altogether?"

I've been lucky enough to talk to people who played a huge role in my life, from Leonard Nimoy to Elvis Costello (at different ages, natch.)

We started as a studio show because it was logistically much easier and also much easier to edit. But it became obvious that we had to do our comedy in front of people who might, say, laugh. So we turned the aircraft carrier around and started doing it every week live. I date our real success from that moment, exactly 10 years ago this month.

I am a finance major who is looking to break into consulting. I am currently a junior, but will need to take an extra semester of classes to graduate. This essentially puts me in the ""junior year"" category for recruiting purposes next fall. I come from a semi-target school, and know my GPA is on the lowish side for consulting (3.6). 

I  will be doing a corporate finance internship for a Fortune 50 media company over the summer, and am looking for the best books and guides to help me learn more about case interviews and the consulting recruiting process. What resources would you recommend? 

Here is a little background about me and some things that will hopefully help me stand out during recruiting:

1. Will be interning with Google next Fall and Winter, while going to school, for their ""Community Leaders Program."" I will be helping local small business owners improve sales and profitability through online marketing. 

2. Corporate finance internship this summer at a well-known media/telecommunications company

3. I launched a very successful service business here in my hometown. Company is an official sponsor of our state's Miss America pageant. 

4. Volunteered in Mexico for two years for a non-profit organization, am fluent in Spanish. Served as a leader for a non-profit organization in China for 6 months. 

Thanks for any books/guides/resources that would be helpful to start branding myself for recruiting season!"

31bxgt,47,2015-04-03,I had the worst convenient care experience yesterday and need to rant about it!,queen_crow,breakingmom,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/31bxgt/i_had_the_worst_convenient_care_experience/,"So, I have a cold and after a week I started worrying it was a sinus infection, so I went to convenient care last night after my husband got home. 

First, the nurse refused to tell me what my blood pressure was - I didn't need to know for any specific reason, but I always ask because I like to know. And I've never had a nurse/doctor say anything other than telling me what my BP was. This lady said, ""Don't worry about it."" And I said, ""I'm not worried, I just like to know."" She snapped at me, ""Normal. It's normal."" Ooookay. 

Then she kept asking if I were still taking random medications I haven't taken in ages - despite my entry form saying I'm currently not on any medication. I said ""nope, not anymore"" to three medications and then she sighed loudly and said, ""Are you even taking ANYTHING??"" Uh, no, that's why I wrote ""none"" under ""current medications"" on the damn form. Side eye. 

Then the doctor came in, and he was like... MAYBE my age (23). 100% positive he was a student or intern, not a doctor. Not a huge deal, though, since I wasn't dying or anything. I just wanted to know if I needed antibiotics or suck it up and deal with being sick! He kept making comments about my stretched out earlobes:

""Wow, those are some big holes (wink)"" Ew. 
""That's so hot, you're so brave."" EW. JUST DO DOCTOR THINGS SO I CAN LEAVE. 

So he says I don't have a sinus infection ""yet"" so I should try sudafed or Mucinex. Okay, so I ask if both of those are safe for nursing because I haven't been sick in the last two years so I haven't had to worry about nursing-safe cold meds. He spent about five seconds staring at my tits in silence. I'm not kidding. Then he says, ""Why, are you nursing?"" No, fuckhead, I'm just curious if the medication is nursing-safe for *literally no reason*. ಠ_ಠ I say yes, I am nursing. 

And he raises an eyebrow and asks how old my kid is. I say, ""She's almost two. Are sudafed and Mucinex safe for nursing?"" He continues to not answer me, instead giving me a dirty look and asking me why I am still nursing my daughter. I say, ""That really isn't the issue here, I'm just asking you about the medication."" He sighs loudly and says he has no idea if they're nursing-safe. WOW you are a terrible doctor. I ask if he can ask someone who knows, and he IMMEDIATELY produces a print-out from the obgyn department with a list of pregnancy-safe and nursing-safe OTC meds. 

**Why didn't he just hand me that in the first place instead of being a giant creepy asshole?!**

I thank him and stand up to leave. He says, ""I shouldn't even have to tell you this, but you need to think about weaning soon."" I just walked out without even responding because I was so OVER THIS D-BAG. Remind me to never go to the fucking convenient care clinic ever again. Jesus fucking Christ. 

**edit:** I called the clinic just now and made a report. The lady I spoke to seemed really irritated that he acted that way! I told her that he made excessive comments about my body modifications that made me really uncomfortable and said that he avoided answering my question about it being nursing-safe, instead grilling me and making me feel like I shouldn't be nursing my toddler - and that even after I asked several times all he did was hand me a sheet of pregnancy-approved medications (I just looked at it and saw it isn't even nursing-approved medications!). That isn't even the same because some meds affect milk supply and that's not as much of an issue if you're just pregnant! So I feel a little better knowing that this nurse practitioner will be spoken to about his behavior, and she made a note on my file that I don't want to be seen by him ever again. "

This program, having been taken past its logistics stage is now on the pilot leg of its run and will include the nations of Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Egypt, Central African Republic, South West Africa, Tunisia, Algeria, Eritrea, Uganda, and others. 

The program will encompass the following;

 -India and the aforementioned nations will set up a subsidized university exchange program for students right out of high school or with equivalent qualifications so that students from areas where higher education is not available have an affordable means of getting their higher education.

-India and the aforementioned nations jointly subsidize the tuition cost and implement a better work study program for students to pay off the costs for their books, other essentials like food can be provided through state food stamps or regulation meal plans should that be necessary.

-Encourage economic collaboration of our businesses in creating and overhauling existing programs for Indian companies to hire African job seekers and African job seekers to hire Indian job seekers as well as provide internship opportunities for students in the exchange program while they stay overseas.

-Lastly, facilitate cultural exchange by giving the students varying options in their housing overseas, namely following the conventional system of having a student stay with a host family or in a rented apartment in the country they are studying in. 

In addition, India will be offering nations who sign up investment into their primary education system with small disbursements ranging from one hundred million to seven hundred million per year given budgetary restraints, NGO's and government cooperation will run this and anti-corruption measures will be in place. With these measures, the people of India hope to forge stronger ties with Africa as friends and allies separated only by geography. "

I'm sorry if this isn't the right sub, but the people that post here are the kind of people I need to talk to. 
I created a throw away because of how ashamed I am of everthing I am about to say. I am currently a sophmore at a university majoring in CS. I have been programming for about 4 years, 2 years at a vocational school while I was in highschool, and two years here at uni. I have always struggled as a programmer, the concepts and OOP didnt come naturally to me. I have worked very hard to get to the point I am at now in my CS ""career"". I spent hours longer than my peers trying to grasp concepts that they can code in minutes. Looking at algorithms are hit and miss, either I can see them and how they work fairly easy, or it takes hours of analysis to make any sense of what I am looking at. I have always scraped by my CS classes and seemed to have fallen through the cracks in a sense of my placements. I don't feel like I belong with my peers in terms of the programming capabilities that they have.

 I am currently taking data structures, a ""weed-out"" class, and I'm the one thats being weeded-out. I spend upwards of 6 hours a day on my projects on top of my 4 other classes. Its stressful. Its straining my relationship and I am in a constant state of anxiety when it comes to programming. When it comes to programming itself, I have gotten better gradually over time (as does anything if you practice enough) but its a much slower graduation than everyone around me. I strive to be the best I can be, I don't anticipate ever being the best, but my best quality is my drive. I will never quit. I know that this is what I love to do, and want to do. I will do anything to get it, but I have no confidence in myself or my abilities. I dont have time currently to practice my skills outside of school. My in-school projects take up all of my time, and even then I usually dont finish them. I visit my professor reguarly and always have a hundred questions. I'm just slow. I'll get there, but you have to force it down my head.

This anxiety, and overall lack of confidence has reached its apex this week. I have an interview for a company as a Java programming intern this summer. My projects are in C++ now, and I would have to spend much time re-learning syntax and the quirks of java before my interview and I'm on a time squeeze. The interview conflicts with a project deadline, and although I have requested (and recieved) more time on my project, I feel it wont be enough to allow me to accomplish both the project, and the knowledge that I need going into my interview. I have a constant feeling that I need to throw up because of the amount of pressure I have going forward in my career. I refuse to quit.

My main question: Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? What do you do when you have no confidence in your programming abilities? What should I do?"

I've set a personal goal to get a summer internship at Google in 2016. I know that some people may look down on me for setting a goal like this, but it's been a goal of mine for some time, and I think I would learn a lot from the experience.

My marks at school are high, I have a GPA of 3.8 and a CS GPA of 4.0. I understand the concepts that are being taught in my classes and am currently TAing a CS course. Academically, I'm doing really well, however I feel academics and grades don't play too big of a role in the mind of a recruiter at Google.

I've worked on a few personal projects, made a couple of games, a few mobile applications and a couple of web applications. I have strong experience in C++, C, Ruby on Rails, Java and Javascript. But still, I don't think I've done anything special that separates me from every other student that wants to work at a big company.

A lot of people on this subreddit, and in many other places, say that doing personal projects is extremely important to getting a good job and improving. But every project that I've worked on, has been fighting with tools and meshing APIs together. Repeatedly working on projects like this doesn't seem like it's helping me in any way, sure I now know how to use the Google Places API to write an autosuggestion menu on Android, but does something like that really matter in the long run?

I personally believe that I'm a good problem solver, I've excelled at interviews (although I have yet to interview with a company that is known to give ""hard interviews"") and have aced algorithm courses. And I feel that if I get an interview with a company like Google, I can succeed.

But I haven't done anything substantial enough that would get me to the interview. My projects all seem like anybody could do them with enough time investment, which makes me think that they're not the type of thing that Google will look for.

So what should I do to guarantee getting an interview? What can I do to make myself stand out? How can I make my projects more than just mindless integration of different tools?

Any help would be appreciated."

For the record I don't believe in the concept of the friendzone (i.e. I think this is his problem and not the problem of the people he likes) but all of our mutual friends describe his situation as such. Not sure if this is relevant at all, but he's a 24 year old virgin, he's been in 4-5 ""relationships"" between age 19 and 24, the longest of which was about three weeks. He is in his final semester of college. 

Jose and I have been friends for about 15 years, and in pretty much every aspect of his life he runs into interpersonal relationship issues. He comes from a religious family and I'm not sure that's part of it, but he's like a real life Paladin and thinks he can brute force his way through any situation by behaving virtuously. Sort of like a Disney prince: ""If I am good enough and my heart is pure enough any action I take can only reflect that"". He describes himself as a 'virtuous or gallant knight in a world full of jerks who only care about themselves'. 

Basically, he thinks too much and romanticizes potential relationships, so that by the time he's actually in a relationship with a woman, he's built it up so much in his head that she can't possibly compete with his vision. He thinks that if he acts safe/passive, she'll like him more than her ex who beat her, or her father who abandoned her. You get the idea. And then because he sees himself as some kind of knight, he gets overly sad/upset when she isn't thankful for what he's done for her, while most of what he's ""done"" only exists in his mind. This becomes a mental cycle of ""I would do anything for her, I will do anything for her, I have done everything for her, why doesn't she appreciate me""?

He believes that any great aspiration requires many months of foundation work, even when the 'preparation work' has nothing to do with the end goal, simply because of his belief that ""good things come to those who work hard"". For example, he believes that taking a job in food service rather than an internship in his field will make him a better professor, because the food service position involves ""working from the bottom like a real American"". He believes that learning COBOL/Brainfuck rather than C/Java/Javascript will make him a better/more in-demand programmer because it requires more work. He has put 3+ years into a simple timer app he's been working on because he believes if he's put a certain amount of years into something, the universe will see how hard he's worked and to balance it out, he'll make millions. 

To him, the ""foundation work"" thing also applies to relationships. He has to build himself up, sometimes for months, so that he and whatever girl he's courting will be close enough friends for him to finally make his move. In his current situation, he has been good friends with a woman for several years (he's only liked her romantically for the past 6-8 months though), enough so that their relationship/friendship constantly made her exes jealous. They've been on a few dates, mostly to Dairy Queen, various nature parks, etc. I think they'd make a cute couple but it's not my call. 

When we ask him about it, he'll say things like ""I've almost gotten her comfortable enough so that she'll occasionally send me a text message"" or ""I can almost halfway make a comment about us watching the sunset without her shutting down, I'm making serious progress"" and in my head I'm thinking, if you were going to be successful here you could straight up ask her to watch the sunset with you after about a day or two of hanging out and she'd most likely be cool with it. Of course we're all being really supportive of him because unlike most of his past crushes, we all think they'd make a really good couple. 

According to Jose, if he moves very slowly and becomes her safety and her rock, he'll build up a foundation of trust and friendship and the relationship will naturally progress from there. I feel like he's a lot like I was when I was 16-19 and I just sort of outgrew it on my own so I'm hoping he'll do the same, but at the same time he's 24 and he might need a push in the right direction. 



**tl;dr**: What would you recommend? How do we give him this push in the right direction?"

The consensus was that you were just starting to look for a job when hiring for the summer is (for the most part) over.

I said that the company that I'm working at is looking to hire an intern and that I'd be happy to forward your CV and github along to our HR. However, I never heard back from you. Here was a great opportunity to earn real life experience but you missed out on the opportunity. In fact, we hired a 2nd year CS student from Waterloo to help with database development.

**I am not here to vindicate you, but to offer you advice.** I graduated 2 years ago in a hyper competitive finance program. I skipped schools most days to come to Toronto so I can network because marks and extra curriculars were not enough to distinguish me from my peers and my family did have the connections. I had to create my own opportunities to get ahead of the the thousands of resumes.    

In a society where knowledge is a commodity and credential inflation is common, I offered to help you but you showed no action. The adage ""it's not what you know is who you know"" is very important these days. Everyone has a bachelor's degree and a lot of people have over 16 months of internship experience coming out of a 4 year undergrad. 

In the future, please please please show more initiative and jump on every opportunity presented. Because if you dont, that person will unlikely give you a second chance later on."

Does anyone think that the interview might have been too easy? They asked a online test to debug 7 questions which frankly anyone who has taken a two week java class should have aced. Then, the phone interview consisted of questions right out of the programming interview books. It is extremely odd because they pay much better than similar companies. I've noticed that the rigor of programming assignments in college classes is way higher(literally failed half my CS classes) than the programming interviews at top companies."

- Coming up to my second out of four year mathematics degree at UCL
- Not in the committee of any societies
- Have some programming experience
- Average of 90% so far but not sure if I can continue it 
- Have had about three part time jobs during my degree (one required leadership and communication, other was tutoring, another was cleaning)

I was originally planning to do the 3 year BSc but I applied and failed for actuarial internships this year so figured I'd stick it out for the 4 year MSci, meaning i'll be applying for internships again next academic year. Not sure why I failed - I applied to about eight firms, got through to one telephone interview and didn't manage to pass it because my answers to the competency questions were not good enough.

I'm not sure what I should do over the summer, and to be honest - I'm scared that I'll be in the same position again next year. So I'm asking, is there any hope? What should I do over this summer to make it productive? I have many ideas of what to do - but just wanted some advice. 

I have also included my CV, and I'm wondering if my odd academic training might raise eyebrows? I spoke to my careers department and they told me it was solid, and employers wont care that I messed up beforehand, as I'm now on track.

31czc5,6,2015-04-03,Has anybody ever in their college career experienced burn-out and taken time off for mental health? How did it help?,thefinestsomething,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/31czc5/has_anybody_ever_in_their_college_career/,"First off, I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this inquiry in. I'm currently not in graduate school but graduated from a combined undergrad/grad program (but considering graduate school again for another program) so since there isn't really a subreddit for that weird limbo area, I figured this might be a relevant place to post it in.

Here's my story (warning: it's long! If you're on here procrastinating, maybe save it for another day :) )

It's taken a long time to articulate this, because I've been afraid to talk about it or even post it on online forums for the fear of people telling me ""you're doing so great in life"" and ""most people would wish they were in your situation"". The guilt coupled with my depression made my mental health even worse, but I'm at a stage where I am a little more confident about myself to talk about it now.

I was a very ambitious high school student who loved learning and loved being a part of activities where people make real changes or have conversation that lead to action. I didn't have a stable high school life (kept moving, had to make new friends, get used to new schools and their course offerings), so I was very driven to get into a good college eager to actually learn and find meaningful lifelong friendships. I worked hard (maybe way too hard) and got pretty good (but could have done better) grades with average test scores. I had a very wide variety of interests, but to water it down to two main things, I loved listening to experiences and writing them down (hence why I wrote for the school newspaper and enjoyed journalism) and also loved science, especially chemistry and biology. I wanted to be a medical doctor to combine my love for human experiences and science, but also knew medicine was kind of a default choice for many, so I was open to figuring out my path in college rather than being fully decided. My vague game plan was to be a pre-med while majoring in some kind of an ethnic studies major. After not being accepted to my top school choices, I moved to another state to stay with family, which would still offer me in-state tuition. The only thing was, I planned to either go to the local community college or just stay at the school for two years to transfer. The majors I applied at other schools weren't offered and there wasn't much diversity, which was a bit of a priority for me as a minority. 

Anyway, I actually found out on summer orientation that I got into this health program at my school which was well known in the local area and considered prestigious and selective. I was nervous because this major is a pretty specific path and I didn't know if I was ready to decide by the age of 17 what I want to do for the rest of my life. But seeing my parents eager (although they usually don't pressure) and having doubts about my mental capacity and intelligence in being a medical doctor along with the fear of not having a viable plan B, I decided to stick to the program. Another thing that helped was after a year and a half of not making friends, I finally met some laid back, seemingly fun folks from my major who formed a little study group with me. and was starting to feel like I was belonging at school.

But by the 3rd year when my official graduate level studies began, things started to change. My ""friends"" were becoming increasingly cold and aggressive. They'd put their own frustrations on me and when I'd try to help them with problems, they'd get angry when they weren't getting the right answers. They knew I liked being helpful, so when they needed notes or something when they had another appointment to go to, I'd give them mine. Eventually ""one appointment"" became 3-4 days of not showing up to class for weeks in a row and asking me for notes and homework became routine. In fact, one of my friends kept ""forgetting"" to do her homework and when I started turning it in early to have her not copy it, she'd say ""next time, don't turn it in early"". 

I started to become depressed since these graduate studies began. My grades went from a 4.0 in my first years to an increasingly dramatic fall after getting many B's and C's. I started to see a therapist, but I had no idea what to explain. I had mild depression and anxiety since I was young and other issues going on at home (family illnesses), that I focused on as well as telling her I was upset that my friendships weren't working out and that I was feeling lonely and isolated as a minority when what was a bigger thing here that I didn't articulate at the time was that, for the once very passionate and ambitious person I used to be, I wasn't feeling passionate at all and I was even considering taking a semester off, but couldn't bring myself to not graduate on time. I was trying to convince myself that passion isn't important and that I have to be realistic that every job gets boring, so my main priority should be on stability and money, based on what kind of an attitude I collected from my peers. I felt simultaneously bored but guilty, because I had a shining opportunity in front of me but I wasn't into what I was studying. Despite everything, I did go through all the motions of studying: pulling all-nighters, taking notes, trying to look for an internship. To note, an internship in my program is students working in the same environment, doing the same thing. The only pre-requisite employers were looking for was that you were an enrolled student at an accredited program. I had gone through e-mails, direct visits, manager calls and mock interview practice; 10x more than what other peers who got internships were doing. For my peers struggling alongside me, I volunteered to mention their names alongside mine in e-mails to managers, which I realize now is something nobody would have most likely done for me. Eventually, those peers got jobs, probably through their own efforts of contacting, while I struggled until my very last year trying to find one. 

I was burning out and losing sight of what I was doing. I was unable to answer ""what made you want to do your major?"" when people asked. In the beginning, it was something about my own experience with an autoimmune disease and my love biological sciences and passion to understand people's experiences, but with the lack of empathy from my friends and the insinuation that we were the smartest kids in school, I felt that what I was supposed to do wasn't to understand people viscerally but know that I have authority. Most people didn't even ask why I chose what I did because when they'd hear what I was doing; they'd just say things like ""you don't even have to worry about grad school like we all have to!"" or ""you'll be making money when you graduate while we'll be out here broke"". I'd pretend to laugh, but inside I'd get so much anxiety being reminded of my troubles finding an internship, my grades dropping and being with friends who weren't interested nor passionate about anything except one-upping each other on exams or graduating and showing off their degree to people. I started to join groups outside of my college to distract myself, volunteered a little or attended after class lectures, which made things more bearable. 

However, unfortunately, by just going to class/distracting myself, I wasn't seriously preparing for the reality of the real-world. I could find an internship, which was the biggest factor next to getting my degree for getting job prospects, and what I was also realizing was that my major was undergoing a shift where there were far too many graduates than there were jobs. Before, anybody could find a job and jobs were considered relatively ""cozy"", doable work schedules and good pay. But later, I was learning that this was no longer true and my classes and the classes to come are sort of the first ""guinea pig"" classes to experience the consequences of the shift. I enrolled in a dual-degree program, assuming it would widen my prospects, but after two classes, I realized it wasn't for me and that it probably wouldn't do much unless I really found an internship with some managerial role. 

It wasn't until my last year, which was a full year of practical experience in six different settings, that I kind of got a glimpse of the real world. I started working closer with faculty after one experience, and in fact had opportunities to give presentations related to my interests and was able to present them to the entire department. I started to gain a feeling that I was finally doing things meaningful to me and was excited about this more than ever. One of my professors even used one of my presentations (with my permission) in one of her own presentations as a visiting faculty member at another school. I expressed my enthusiasm to my main supervising professor and made initiatives to make some of his classes better. When the time came to ask for a letter of recommendation for a program I wanted to apply to my main professor flat out refused. I was shocked beyond belief and upset. When I asked him why, he said ""I didn't do anything special to deserve a letter of recommendation"". I take constructive criticism and my capabilities/weaknesses seriously, but he didn't give concrete evidence as to why he rejected to write me a letter. The other professor who used my presentation for her own said to me ""I would write you one, but I would have to mention several weaknesses, one being multi-tasking"". She cited a time I turned down to help her with something because I told her it coincided with a main activity my main supervising professor had me do. 

I tried to see what other kids in my class who seemed to get along better with professors were doing, to see what I was doing wrong, and many seemed to develop a rapport with professors that seemed like friendships: happy hours, helping them move in/out of stuff from their houses...you know, like friends do. I don't have a problem with that, I guess I never thought to do it because I never got along with my professors like that. But I guess that also illustrated that maybe I was stand-offish or not friendly? I don't know.I found another professor to write me an LOR from another science department who I had experience teaching with who really seemed to encourage me and make me feel like I'm good at what I'm doing, but since he was not directly associated with the practice areas of my major, his word didn't have much weight as much as the others.

Ultimately, with the job ordeal going on in my major, the lack of faculty support, the lack of friends support (there's far more to my friend's advantage taking that would make this post longer than it already i) plus a family illness at home, I graduated with major depression and anxiety. My family was initially upset with me telling me I was being ungrateful, but when they would see the physical impact of my mental health plus watching me apply to a ton of jobs with no interview responses, and after confirming with family friends who were in the same field, they started advising me to take it easy. I've taken a long time off (maybe time I should have taken off during a semester at school) and in between done some remote volunteering, cared for my family member who is luckily recovering, applied to jobs, had my resume revised, gotten in touch with other faculty and old supervisors and have started to look at alternative pathways and while I'm still struggling to find a job, I think my health is improving now that I have some idea of an alternative game plan for me. 

However, I can't say my depression/anxiety is completely gone and still have trouble finding motivation. I'm taking a path that is different and sort of unprecedented than what my peers are doing and I'm filled with anxiety somedays thinking I will fail and uncertainty as I 100% don't know what I'm doing.  I still have occasional trouble sleeping, difficulty being focused and organized, but everyday, I am trying to do a little something to get back into a routine with exercise, household chores, etc. 

After my long spiel here, I appreciate everybody who has taken the time to read this and was also wondering if any of you here have experienced burn-out or a situation similar to mine. How did you identify it was burn-out, or a mental health issue and did you take time off? How did it help? Any other methods or self-help books for this kind of a situation would also be useful."
31d3rx,3,2015-04-03,Letters from the RRR,Imightbeflirting,Askasurvivor,https://www.reddit.com/r/Askasurvivor/comments/31d3rx/letters_from_the_rrr/,"So I've received a pair of letters from the RRR. They have little steam engines on the paper. It's cute. These were at the bottom, so they're each a couple weeks old... I just haven't gotten around to them yet, and for that I apologize.

*Dear Miss Princess,*

*I was so happy, no overjoyed to hear that you’d survived! We were combing the FCC territory with our steamers but apparently you never washed downstream near the tracks or into the range of our search parties. Rest assured, had we found you, you would have been taken perfect care of. We have started manufacturing medical supplies, which I hope will convince that doctor of yours to please reconsider visitor’s hours.*

*Truly Yours and no one else’s,*

*Jameson, President of the RailRoad Republic*

The next letter is from Psycho, also of the RailRoad Republic. We'd known each other from our time at Randolph as the near-last survivors. She'd done well for herself, earning the distinction of being appointed chief of... well, no one really knows. But she is pulling a lot of strings, apparently.

*Hey.* it began simply. Ever to the point, Psycho was.

*I don’t think I need to tell you this, but Jameson’s full of shit on that “only for you” bit. Jameson’s knocked up his sixth intern this year- she’s not on maternity leave until it’s near time, but it’s gotten to the point that he doesn’t even apologize about it. The first one he ever knocked up is coming off maternity leave soon, though, so we’ll see if having to train brand new interns drops off (which lightens up my workload) as he just knocks them up all over again, or decides he’s had enough kids (unlikely), or if he’s just going to double-down on the whole “spread the seed” thing.*

I paused and considered the term, then regretted doing so as I imagined his hairy... right...

*Disgusting, I know. The man is an animal. He’s got something like eighty snotty screaming whelps on the way now, assuming they all make it through delivery. Surprisingly, he hasn’t tried anything with me since we first met, where his troops found me standing blood-drenched in the splattered hallway of Lynchburg. I think he’s just waiting to make his move, or he's scared. Frankly, both possibilities are entertaining, and the ability to clean up after his messes while helping run this odd little country actually is a lot more fun than I thought it would be. Oh, he's equal parts running this country, though, don't get the wrong idea. The policies and trades are mostly him. The man is a genius at that sort of thing when he’s at the right level of drunk. Therefore, it’s a blessing that he’s an alcoholic. When he’s sober, it’s hard to get him to come out of his room. Every morning, I bust down his door and shove a bottle down his throat until he’s buzzed enough to go for a stroll through the downtown.*

Now *that* was a mental image I could laugh at, even if it hurt to do so.

*We’ve started sending out advance parties from our disabled corps, finding them work. So far, they’ve saved a couple trains, but this hasn’t been an issue before now. From the pictures we’ve seen from Beachbum’s footage from the Battle for the Valley, these special zombies look unpleasant. I’m sorry you’re going through a rough time. We’ve heard whispers of further trouble, too. Without getting too pretentious, I fear that dark days lie ahead for us all. We’ve had to abandon our Midwest settlement as the Earth’s crust collapses near there, and the RoC, as useless as they were for us, at least stood for being on the right side of things. We’re about to commit some military forces to the Western campaign, because otherwise it looks like we’re all going to die. Hang in there. If you need anything, though, just call.*

It’s a weird life out here. Here’s hoping yours is still interesting as well. Write me back sometime.

~Psycho”

Just to recap: Psycho was being friendly to me just now. The apocalypse has already begun, so what is this a sign of? How much worse can things get?"

31dpck,1,2015-04-03,SAP developer to data modeler? Looking for career path advice.,[deleted],ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/31dpck/sap_developer_to_data_modeler_looking_for_career/,"Hello. I am looking for career path advice.

In 2012, I graduated from a private college with a Bachelor of Science and majors in Computer Science and Philosophy. Prior to graduating, I had worked as a medical transcriptionist, technology support specialist, college tutor, software quality assurance intern, and business intelligence design intern. After graduating, I started my first full-time position at an energy company as an SAP developer, specializing in SAP CRM after a year. I have designed, developed, and supported a number of enhancements and new solutions, including interfaces with and processes within other systems including Oracle databases and a billing/enrollment/EDI application.

I love what I do and the people I work with. I have enjoyed the opportunity to learn SAP and my business area deeply. However, I feel that I may be becoming too comfortable and running out of room to grow at the pace that I prefer. While I still love designing large and complex SAP solutions, the task of developing them feels less creative and more like routine. I miss feeling like a beginner. Also, I fear that I’m becoming too specialized with my technology and business area. I may want to move in a few years and would like to have skills and experience that support multiple career options. And so, I think that it may be time for a new challenge.

A data modeler from my company recently retired. Having worked with him when I was a BI design intern, I remember respecting him and being interested in his work. Rather than focus on one business area, he worked with many business areas and translated their requirements into technical implementations that supported their decision-making. He did so utilizing a wide array of technologies including Oracle, SAP, and BI applications. At my company, compared to my position, data modeler is at the next, and top, proficiency/compensation level.

I expressed interest in filling his position and it sounds like it may be a possibility. Within my company, it would definitely increase my current and potential compensation, but does it seem that it would be a good fit for me? Provide the creative technical challenges and rapid growth that I like? Offer me the skills and experience to have a flexible career path? I discussed this with another data modeler at my company and he seems to think so. Long-term, I could see myself becoming less technical in a solutions architect position, becoming more technical in a DBA position, or staying along the same path of a software developer should it continue to challenge me creatively. I need more experience to know, but I would appreciate input from anyone who may have more experience or insight already.

Thank you."
31dtl4,1,2015-04-03,Deciding: Expensive Specific-Focus College vs. Cheap Non-Focus College,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/31dtl4/deciding_expensive_specificfocus_college_vs_cheap/,"I'm at the stage where the college letters have all come back, and the time to make a decision is drawing near. I already have my heart set on a major, Computer Science, which I have a very strong background in, having started from a very early age.

Now I'm faced with a massive decision. There are two colleges that I wouldn't mind attending: College A, which is about an hour and 20 minutes away, has very nice facilities, and has an (allegedly) accredited game development track for the CS majors. It runs at $40k yearly, after scholarships and housing and whatnot; and College B, a state school that's within commuting distance from home, is known for its CS program, and is considerably cheaper to attend than College A, at $5k a year.

Now, both colleges seem to be very good, but my problem is twofold: first and foremost is the financial issue. For College A, even if I were to get a job, I would still need to take out a sizable loan each year. I have an internship at a power plant next year, and that has the potential to be quite high-paying if it evolves into a job, but I still would have the debt hanging over my head for several years after I graduated. The next portion of the problem is the social aspect: I think living away from home would be a healthy start to the transition of actually moving out, when the time comes. If I were able to commute each day, it would be cheaper than living on-campus. Also, two of some of my closest friends wish to attend College A; one seems to have his heart set, the other is still deciding, but likes the school a lot. I know I could easily live without them, what with Skype and all.

My current mindset is that if I were to attend College A, I would need to seriously haul ass about securing/working a job to start paying off my student loans, both before and after graduation. I REALLY don't want to put those off longer than I need to. However, if I were to attend College B, I would only need to worry about student loans for a few months, assuming I am working even a mid-low paying job, but I would lose out on the facilities and the focus-specific courses.

Any and all advice would be appreciated, I've been wracking my brain to try and find which is the right path to take between idealism and reality.

Edit: Didn't downplay some issues quite right."

So, I suppose that's my biggest question! The tech industry is booming in the neighboring Bay Area, and I feel that putting up the cost to come to this school would be worth it, if coming to this school means that I would have access to internships throughout my time at school, and have a head start in the competitive job market out there. Any advice that anyone might have would be much appreciated. Thanks, again!"

I'm a novice out of Vancouver BC. I've been self-teaching and cutting various shorts and music videos for free for the last six months. I think I know enough now to take a job as an AE, even if it's just an internship, but I've no idea how to go about it. When I search mandy or craigslist, the postings are usually no-budget student films or Toronto-based. 

I don't know any editors in my city and I'm honestly not even sure where to find them. The post-houses here seem to specialize in VFX, and the film community as a whole is highly geared toward the production side of things. Most of the features, MOWs and tv series here go back to LA for cutting.



Are there any canadian editors on this subreddit? Is Toronto better than Vancouver? As far as moving to LA, I've spent a lot of time there and would have no problem moving - but with the high editor population already existing, it seems unlikely that a company would sign off on a work visa for a pretty green AE."
31edh8,226,2015-04-04,Me [20F] with my three siblings [20sM/F]. My brother [28M] sent me the meanest text messages I've ever received. We're supposed to be planning a big sibling get together for my birthday. Now I'm stuck between trying to work it out with him or just calling the whole thing off.,ipreferrainbows,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/31edh8/me_20f_with_my_three_siblings_20smf_my_brother/,"Hey there relationships, I don't know what my next should be. I feel trapped between a rock and a hard place. Sorry, I didn't mean for it to be this long.

I have three siblings; two brothers and a sister, ranging from [28M], [26F], [23M], to me [20F]. We all live in different states in the USA. Background: Our family grew up with some problems. Dad was an abusive addict for a good while. He's doing alright now. Mom was there for us, still tries, but does her share of things that upset various combinations of her children depending on what it is. She's changed a lot.

As a result, a lot of myself and my siblings' personalities have been, in one way or another, shaped by the events during our time at home and after. My brother [23M], who we will call James, has adopted a sort of ""mediator"" personality over the years. When we were younger, his end game was just to make everyone stop fighting and be happy. Today, he still tries to be the mediator. He is often successful, but sometimes he is objective to a fault. The usual complaint from me about him is when a situation arises that he should definitely take an emotional position on/make a stand for or against in our family, he will usually just completely stay out of it as to avoid sides. This can make me and others feel like he isn't there for us when we have been wronged. He got a good job right out of college and is doing well, so now he also likes to give advice to the point where I've had to ask him to tone it down. All around he's a good guy, just seems to suppress his emotions sometimes and get a bit cocky from his achievements.

My sister, Jess[26F], does not have a good relationship with my brother [28M], who we will call Dan. The two of them haven't gotten along for as long as I can really remember. Jess had to take on a lot of responsibility when things were going down the drain in our lives, and I think that made her sensitive, hot tempered at times, and easily defensive. She is still this way and can be a huge bitch if you say something that offends her. Ultimately, she is a really sweet person who has contributed a lot to my life. She's very happy and bubbly. She would be there for anyone, she is just really sensitive and doesn't like to be lectured, therefore can be a nightmare to be around if she feels offended. It is her way of trying to cope with feeling hurt.

The oldest, Dan, has historically held a lot of anger over the events of our past, and the ones that are still affecting us today. My other siblings and I have come to terms with a lot of the things that have happened to us and generally enjoy our lives. He has, for my whole life, been angry and struggling to figure himself out, resulting in a lot of lashing out, name calling, physically intimidating displays, and scrutiny of everyone who is doing something wrong in his eyes.

Currently, Dan is very successful; he has worked very hard for years to get to where he is now, which is in a position of employment that is usually occupied by someone twice his age. He is involved in a disorienting amount of extra curriculars; he is constantly busy. He's got a great salary, great apartment, is in grad school, and is always looking to improve his resume; he doesn't let anyone forget these things, whether on purpose or by accident. His physically aggressive and over the top actions have died down for a few years now, as a result of getting himself out of a dark place which was likely caused by the culmination of our families problems. During this time is was just awful to deal with and scary. Now, the main issue with him is still his temper; if you say something he doesn't like, he will freak out on you for it. He will yell, hang up the phone, and may or may not shit talk you to anyone who will listen later on. He will keep you on the phone, ranting about this or that for an hour if you let him, and when you want to get off the phone he will more often than not, make you feel bad for it. He constantly wants to know the updates of my life, my plans for jobs, internships, etc. If you don't take his advice (which by itself is usually good and logical), he looks at you like you're fucking up your whole life unless you instead do something that he will approve of. You need to be doing something to further your life ALL the time. I think he is a good person deep down. I have come to think he is just incredibly sensitive; maybe even more than the rest of us, and gives suffocating advice as his way of contributing to our lives, being involved, and making up for the way he way before.

I am the youngest, been through more schools than any of them and just as many houses. I've gotten the short end of the stick on a lot of things and everyone recognizes that, which is saying something considering the things everyone else had to deal with. I am currently in college and while I have loans, I am getting help from mainly my Mom and sporadically, my Dad.

The Problem is, my 21st birthday is coming up over the summer. I am the last kid to turn 21, and all I've been wanting since before we began to actually plan anything, was just to get all of my siblings in one place. To have a drink with them. No fighting. Take a picture and have a great memory for when things aren't so great in the future. Something I can be happy about and cherish. This is important to me because for the majority of my life as a contributing member of society, I haven't had most of my siblings with me. A lot of the terrible things we all had to deal with got worse while my brothers and sister were in and out of college, leaving me alone for some really life changing things. They all kept in touch, but it was very hard not to have them with me physically.

Today, James and I were solidifying our plan to get all the kids together. He has orchestrated a lot of the planning with me, as we decided to have everyone fly to where he lives. We also decided that instead of having the get together on my birthday, we are going to have it on HIS birthday which is about two weeks after mine. I agreed to this because it was on a holiday weekend, giving us an extra day of fun, as well as an additional reason to celebrate. We decided to also include my cousin Jeremy [28M], who is very close to us.

After getting off the phone with James today, he had me call Dan, Jess, and Jeremy, to tell them the for sure plan, as they knew the rough plan before. I called Dan first, and told him the plan. His response was something like this:

""Well, that weekend might be the first weekend of classes for me so I probably won't be able to attend. The other thing is that Grandma is going to sell the house later this year so Dad wants us to go there, so we could just meet there, and frankly, I have no interest in going to (insert city where James lives) because it's dirty and smelly.""

My response was that I might have classes too but I am going to try to work it out, so is there anything you could do to try to work it out? He then said that he wasn't going to miss classes for *that*, that it would send a bad message to those whom is made concern. My response, which was prompted by the insult to where James lived, was a fumbled:""Well, Dan, not to sound like a brat, but I don't think it's always about you sometimes... It wouldn't matter to me if we were meeting in a cardboard box, it's a family thing and I would just want everyone together, so could we just try to see?"" Well, I didn't even make it to ""cardboard"" before he hung up on me, mid-sentence. I didn't even get to surprise him with Jeremy's potential attendance.

I sat there for a moment, then called James and told him what happened. We talked for a bit, a notable point being that Grandma is my Dad's Mom and not very pleasant. Jess and Grandma don't entirely speak, and overall, suggesting we go to Grandma's was really out of left field. James said he would call Dan and get him to come around. When I hung up, I saw the text message from Dan I had waiting for me that said:

""I'm really fucking sick and tired of your nonsense. You are a complete flake, terrible and following up, frankly and fucking liar, you constantly blow people off when they ask you things or offer you help. You lay around seemingly doing nothing half the fucking time and waste all sorts of resources and opportunities. You whine about money when you're the only kid in the whole family that got any kind of financial support for school. That you're a coward towards the world pisses me off to no end. It's a waste of fucking potential. You're not just a brat you're beyond selfish. You call me at work then tell me to spend $700 bucks to fly across the country for a weekend to a city I frankly hate, on a what may be my one holiday weekend, to potentially skip first day of classes in my masters degree for a program of study that meets once a week. Basically equivalent to 2 weeks of undergrad classes. Then you start telling me I'm being selfish and try to guilt me with ""family"" although it's really just convenient for you and James. You are completely self-centered.""

I was bawling for an hour. I called my boyfriend, who then tried to find the words to help me. He wound up saying that he thought Dan's behavior was learned from my father, and thinks it's interesting that he usually just shits on my Mom and Jess, not James and my Dad, even though my Dad is the root of many of our families problems. Dan's justification for not shitting on my Dad is that he is at least trying to make up for the terrible things he did now. His main source of helping now is by giving us money here and there. He often says: ""When I come into some money I'm going to help all my kinds; paying for college was something I never wanted any of you to do"", which is why he helps me with money now.

Anyway, when James eventually texted me saying ""So Dan really likes the idea. The dates may work for him, but he's not yet sold on (James' city). However, I'm putting in a good case for him to change his mind. Let me keep working on him and see what comes of it!""

I then sent him a screen shot of the text messages. this is the converstion that followed:

James: He says things like that every once in a while to me. Definitely not defending him, that's a little intense. Definitely uncalled for and unture. I'm sorry, he should certainly apologize. Like I said, he does like the idea and wants to do something, but idk if you want to do something with him anymore after that unless he apologizes.

Me: You read over his messages a few times and tell me how you would handle it"". 

James: I agree, uncalled for and too much.

Me: None of it should have been said whatsoever. To say it was ""too much"" suggests it was a good amount at some point.

James: You are correct. It shouldn't have been said at all. I'm sorry. I told him it was fucked and he needed to apologize.

Me: I appreciate that, but personally, what am I supposed to do? I feel like with Dan, we have all (sub)consciously accepted his typical asshole behavior as normal, and only when he REALLY goes over the top, we say something, because ""It's Dan"". But the fact is, I can't think of the last time you or Jess even said a fraction of that to me. If one of your friends said that to you, you would stop being their friend. I can't stop being his sister, so what am I supposed to do? Accept a forced, likely fake/half assed apology, to keep a peace that obviously isn't really even there if stuff like this happens with him regularly? Which, I realized tonight, is almost always exclusively directed at the women in the family? I don't think anyone has the right answer here because most people aren't/shouldn't be prepared to deal with this kind of atrocious situation.""

The rest of the conversation was James agreeing that we tend to just move on after Dan does something like this, that he doesn't believe it's general exclusive, and that I think he is way to old to be getting away with such hurtful things. I said that this wasn't an accidental ""bitch"" comment; he hung up on me and planned it out.

A couple hours later, Dan sent me an email. I thought he was apologizing, but nope, it was an email to all the siblings, addressing the trip as a whole, suggesting other places we could go, calling it a siblings trip that was also for celebrating birthdays. Our birthdays were the purpose of the gathering; it wasn't even supposed to be a trip..

I just don't know what to do. This is the worst thing Dan has ever said to me but I feel like if I don't forgive him, the whole trip is going to be ruined. This was supposed to be a happy thing. I mean, I said ONE thing and he *lost* it. I don't think I've ever been ripped down like that. Was what he said warranted by me saying that it wasn't all about him all the time? My brother, sister, and Mom, all think that it was totally uncalled for, but when it comes to Dan, I just second guess myself all the time...What should I do?

Tldr: Siblings are supposed to get together for me and my brother's birthdays. Other brother said some terrible things to me, is now acting like it didn't happen. Don't know how to proceed."

Felt like ranting a bit...

Ah, Another year of back to school week and new generation of aspiring newcomers to the city with all their innocent hopes and dreams.

It‘s only a matter of time before they are snatched up by a few promoters, pressured to go out every night and end up in the 'scene', or if they are lucky a free 'model' apartment where they are forced to go out nightly, partying thinking they are cool and living the dream, traveling the world with rich men twice their age doing
unimaginable things that they block out pretending that it never happened because the chanel
bags and expensive shoes they get as gifts and all the people back home commenting on their
impressive' instagram pics since they have to document the dream being lived. 

Helps to keep their minds off of what's actually happening. Start missing classes and castings, lose ambition,
have a skewed perception of reality and what's really important, only to wake up 4 years later
realizing they just wasted their best years, looking worn out like they are 40 at 23 because of
all the partying and have massive entitlement issues. 

Date a bunch of guys thinking they are amazing but in actuality they have 5 of you and are only looking to high live their boys the next day telling them the story of how retarded you are. End up taking a low paying job in fashion or pr thinking its the best way to get their life started, end up doing it all over again just in a professional"" setting so in their mind it's justified. 

Increasingly become miserable and rude being that it's part of the culture, date every wall street finance douche who sells you on the dream but in actuality you're just there to fill a temporary need till they find someone hotter, and probably sick of hearing you name drop your d list celebrity friends you partied with on a yacht
in st tropez when you were 24, and weirded out by how impressive you think you are for
knowing every doorman at all the clubs, so he cheats on you with your younger hotter intern,
leaves you even more damaged and confused. 

Dismissing every good guy you meet because they would prefer to give you a meaningful $20 gift over a $1500 bag until you wake up and you're 31, miserable. single, confused, definitely not looking like you did at 22 so you're expectations will never be met even though you think you deserve the amazing guy because
you're a good person'. 

The pressure to settle down overwhelms you because your time is running out but you can't settle for any average guy since you're used to being taken care of, your therapist prescribes you a cocktail of medications to assist with all your emotions sending you into a weekly bipolar rage until you find a genuine nice guy who you can be happy with but in the back of your mind you are settling, so after moving to long island having 2 kids and trying to live a normal life, the misery overcomes you, sends you into the arms of another married
man you met at the gym. you ruin 2 marriages at once and you are left to pick up all the
pieces... Make sure to post lots of pics..

Good Luck Class of 2018!"

I never wanted the bastard to come in, but he invites himself in anyway. Every time he brings in spoiled fish. I've struggled with this PMO for too long. But today something hit me while browsing Reddit. It was a thread created by a guy who is very similar to me. Except out of high school he went straight to the Navy, then got a Computer Science degree, then a Masters, and now an offer from Google.


As for me, I got a undergrad degree I hated and about to get a Masters in a field that isn't as exciting. Then something hit me. Like a hammer to a nail. THUD. THUD. BOOM. The times he spent improving himself in all aspect of life, I spent jacking and playing video games. Brain rot. Brain fog. It's no wonder I couldn't excel academically as I had hoped. I used to be a bright kid when little, before the porn, before the video games. (I was NOT intellectually arrogant, as I was ALWAYS willing and eager to help my peers with their schoolwork)

But there are still good things that came out of all of this though. I don't say this to brag. I say this to tell you that things are possible when you invest time into something else other than PMO. Because I haven't been PMO'ing, I've invested those times for something better: Clawed my way out out of a depression that lasted 2 years (had sucidal thoughts), got into an intimate relationship (mutually broken up now, we still talk sometimes. Hopefully get back together. I don't know). Got a shitty retail job that pays decent, finishing a Masters, got an interview for a great internship end of month. Definitely got rid of that pulverizing social anxiety. All of these events took about 2 years to accumulate. To this day I still do my best to improve every single day.

TL;DR: If you're struggling, keep moving forward. You WILL find something that will cause you to stop PMO. It's different for everyone. It's important to keep getting life experience.

31ejfv,5,2015-04-04,I fucked up in research and my lab co-workers no longer trust me....how do I tackle this? Feeling depressed..,azntrojan,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/31ejfv/i_fucked_up_in_research_and_my_lab_coworkers_no/,"Ok I do know how to tackle this, but I really would love some words of inspiration/pep talk from someone here.  This might come off long but I really appreciate if someone here can give me something to lift my depressive mood.

I've been working in a basic lab since September and I made a bad first impression because I was an immature 22 year old who was probably still in college mindset.  I treated my job as a volunteer job (well I was a volunteer..) and although I came consistently, I would come late and I would text my lab co-workers the night before if I needed to come in (the other volunteers did the same so I thought I could too..).  

I got a talk in November and cleaned up my immature act after getting some blunt feedback from them and in January I got an email from them saying they are impressed with my improvement in maturity and professionalism and that they are looking forward to working with me.  It was my high point and I felt good so I continued doing what I did helping out the best I could.  Then i started taking a biochemistry class for a prereq for a few med schools and I had to change my schedule a bit.

Today, in my talk with my PI today he told me there's tension in the lab and the research residents have told him I have trouble following simple directions.  He said they think it's because I got into medical school and I don't care enough to put in my 100% so he said that he wanted to hear my story because they are on the verge of asking me to leave.  He told me he wants to help me and that he thinks I am being thrown in a new experience where I am given responsibility and that I should know when I am tripping up instead of staying in the dark.

First of all, I admit I made one big mistake that was costly; I lost a tissue sample in a moment of carelessness that I understand took hard work to create.  I took full responsibility for my mistake, apologized profusely, and I made zero excuses for doing it.  

Secondly, this is very left field for me.  Beyond that one big mistake a week ago, I have done nothing that I thought was a big ""screw up"".  I overslept once 3 weeks ago when I was supposed to come in and that was because there was a power outage at my house and my alarm clock went kaput.  I have noticed that they relegated me to basic responsibiities and now I know why.

Finally, I was told that they were on the verge of asking me to leave. This surprises me because yes I have made mistakes.  One big mistakes and I'm sure a couple small ones I never realized.  He compared me to our high school intern who is yes, very proficient in research and very good at Westerns &amp; RNA Isolation, skills I never got to master.  But at the same time, she had her own share of mistakes, one of which destroyed our lab's several thousand dollar Leica Western Blot photo paper printer.  Perhaps several thousand dollar printers is not as bad as losing a hard worked tissue sample but the fact is, we all made mistakes yet for some reason I'm on the verge of being fired and she's....well still golden.

So now I'm drafting an email I will send tomorrow asking to meet with the research residents &amp; techs so I can get a ""heart to heart"" and at the very least learn a few life lessons from them in professionalism, maturity, and competency.  I might not regain their trust and confidence in me again, but at the least, I can hope to gain some lessons to take with me to medical school.

Can someone please relate?

EDIT: I have sent them a respectful, professional email requesting a meeting to get some feedback to become a better assistant.  I also apologized again for my mistake and made it clear I want to correct it.  At this point it's just waiting and maybe they won't reply but take me aside on monday to talk.."
31elvc,2,2015-04-04,My internship/co-op is making me miserable and I don't know what to do,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/31elvc/my_internshipcoop_is_making_me_miserable_and_i/,"Hey guys. I'm getting into a huge dilemma right now with my career. 

Currently I am a junior in college. I'm going for a Computer Engineering degree. Last semester, I co-oped (I always just say internship because for some reason I feel like some people don't know what it is, so I apologize) at a company that was my dream job. However, the experience quickly became miserable. I did not get along with my boss at all. He constantly degrades me, badgers me, discourages me, and just has the absolute worst attitude with every aspect of life. Some examples are: 

1) FIRST conversation I had with him on the job was him telling me how absolutely horrendous my thank you letter was. He held nothing back, and continued to tell me that it hurt my application instead of helping. Okay... strange, but whatever.

2) He told me that he thought I only had ""a 10% chance of succeeding in my co-op rotation"" and that he had absolutely no faith in me doing well. Well, why would a manager risk his job to hire someone incompetent? It's the real world - he didn't need to hire me if this was the case.

3) Everyone at the company is required to use Google Hangouts, so the team I'm in communicates through this. My boss will message me on Hangouts, and there are times where - kid you not - if I do not answer within 30 seconds, my boss will send me 6 more messages freaking out that I do not respond.

4) Attitude. I'm so grateful to co-op where I do, and am very happy every day (unless said person wants to bring my mood down) at work. There have been countless times where I will pass my boss and say ""Good morning, how are you?"" and get a ""Fucking awful, thanks for asking."" response. Obviously as an adult, I don't let emotions get in the way of work, but I'm sure everyone else can agree that misery loves company. 

This being said, my boss pushes me -- what I feel to be an insane amount... Especially relative to the other people co-ops I worked with. My co-worker say its because my boss sees potential in me and wants to get me to my full potential. I enjoy this sometimes, but other times, I get absolutely insane deadlines that my boss knows that I cannot meet, and everyone in my group even knows aren't realistic. I'd give examples, but I'm trying to keep the wall of text here to a minimum. If examples would help, just ask and I'll obviously deliver.

----

Now to school. This semester is a disaster. I had financial issues in my family, so I had to find somewhere very far off campus to live by myself, which I hate. It's just completely throwing me out of my routine, and my grades are awful this semester. I totaled my car the other week, which makes commuting to school even harder. I had health issues earlier this semester which threw me off with my studies... which brings me to what is driving me up a wall: my boss hounds me non stop about my GPA, which I'll be the first to admit, is not good. However, to be fair, my first two semesters of college, I got a 2.02 and 1.92 GPA. The fact that I have not made up any classes and am at a 2.6 with only 3 courses outside of engineering/math/etc makes me confident. I mean, I have a co-op at a respectable (imo) company.

It probably sounds silly that I do not care to take ""blow off"" courses in order to boost my GPA. Each person that attends college either pays for it with their own money or obviously someone in their family. Considering I am paying a decent amount of it, I'd much rather gather as much information in science/math/etc courses instead of some blow off elective. I don't see how this will help me in the long run. It may make it harder for me right now, but I am too eager a learner to really care. I've tried to take a 'blow off' course and found myself literally doing nothing for it and getting a bad grade in it, since I found it to be a waste of my already expensive tuition. 

This being said, ever since my co-op, I've become a lot better at programming and do a *lot* of it in my spare time. I'm finding that I loathe my actual programming courses.. I cannot bring myself to put effort into them. Compounding the fact that my boss is going to ""have an aneurysm"" because of my grades (he always makes this cruel joke), I'm just becoming so discouraged. I know that I am more than competent at this point in school to succeed in an internship/co-op. It's really sad that I'm considering looking for another co-op because I am just becoming so depressed thinking about going back to working for my miserable boss. I am very lucky in the fact that someone that I work with told me that I don't ever need to hesitate to use him as a referral for any job(s) in the future -- he is higher up in the company than my boss, which makes me feel somewhat content. 

I just don't get why I'm getting such the ass end of the stick. I have many friends/acquaintances who have co-oped/interned and said that they never had to go through so much torture. I know it may be difficult for myself to be credible here since no one knows me obviously, but I at least have been praised by all of my co-workers many times for my work. They are all decently blunt, so they would tell me if I was doing a poor job. 

All of this put together, I have no idea what to do. I'm beginning to hate my degree because of the programming assignments boring me. Because of this, I'm switching to Electrical Engineering (which is pretty similar to COE at my university, just more physics courses, which will help boost my GPA). However, in the eyes of my boss, my GPA is perpetual garbage, and my boss makes my days as miserable as possible. I don't think that it's fair that I'm receiving B's and A's in my math/physics courses (I'm a math major as well &amp; my math GPA is decent -- I'm also one of those people who get programming insight through math) but I know I will be torn apart for getting C's in my programming courses, even though I will be switching from COE to EE. I know that my boss will, as usual, find a way to spin the tables on me and tell me that regardless if I hated it or not, regardless of the mayhem of this semester, etc etc, that I should have gotten an A in all of my courses.

What should I do? It's literally eating me alive thinking about going back for another co-op rotation...

31fbw0,0,2015-04-04,I have a Pharma internship this summer but I don't want to work in Pharma after graduation. Need advice.,mooshsoto,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/31fbw0/i_have_a_pharma_internship_this_summer_but_i_dont/,"Okay so I've heard from various threads on here that starting in Pharma as a junior can be incredibly counterproductive if you want to move into traditional later. Here's my situation. 

I'm a senior, I will finish undergrad this December. I was lucky enough to get an internship via the 4A's MAIP program. To get into MAIP you go through a (imo) pretty rigorous application program, if you pass that you go on to an interview with a professional that is assigned to you, if you pass that your application gets put into a finalist pool and then all of the agencies participating with MAIP get a chance to choose their interns, you can accept or decline the offer from there. From what I've heard it's extremely selective.

I got picked up by a big Pharma agency in NYC, under a big holding group, for a CW role. The thing is, I don't want to do Pharma AT ALL. I have no interest in doing it, and while some creatives are turned on by having to come up with work in a tight regulatory box, the idea scares the shit out of me. That being said, I would have been dumb to turn down this opportunity. First of all, it's my first internship ever. And aside from the internship MAIP provides us with 6 weeks of webinar training, and throughout the summer we have a bunch of career development events, the network of MAIP alumni and professionals who work with the program is amazing, and of course there is a huge networking event + job far at the end of the summer, and the internship is PAID. There's no I could have said no to all of that.


My question is, do you guys think I made a mistake? Have I doomed myself to Pharma for the first couple of years of my career until I find a way to make an exit? What would you have done? What would you do if you were in my position? 

TLDR: I have no agency experience. I got got into the 4A's MAIP program to do a pharma internship this summer. But I don't want to do pharma. I need advice. 

Thank you for all your help!"

So I got Learn Python the Hard Way last summer and finished the book during my school vacation.  I couldn't really do much on my own after.  I took a java class at school last semester and learned the syntax and probably about to the level I knew python, but I wasn't capable of doing anything without instruction.

Now it's been a few months since I've done any programming and I'm starting an IT support internship in the summer.  There won't be any programming involved in the internship, but I'd like to learn concurrently and possibly use what I know to automate tasks. 

I guess my questions are:

* How do I keep learning?

* Is there anything specific I should learn for an IT support role?

* What did you do to get out of a rut of learning and keep going?



I feel lost."

31fiqr,0,2015-04-04,Convince me to buy tw3 for pc or ps4.,CrustyCheeseburger,witcher,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/31fiqr/convince_me_to_buy_tw3_for_pc_or_ps4/,"I know we've all read about a million and a half posts about if you should buy the witcher 3 for pc or Xbox or ps4. However, I still would like you guys and gals to give me some good points on what I should do.

Basically I have a desktop that is by no means a slacker which can still run dishonored/skyrim/games like that pretty decently. It doesn't meet recommended system requirements for the witcher (of course). I also have a ps4 that I do really enjoy playing on. Games like tomb raider, bloodborne, destiny, dragon age, and others. 

Here's the deal: I am super into the witcher and have read all the books and played the first two games on the pc. I know that importing your saves is not such a big deal anymore since we can just affect the outcome of tw2 in the first few minutes with the barber/bard dude. But I have to admit, 60 fps looks so fucking smooth and I want it ha. I was watching the skellig islands game play and was really impressed with the visuals and fluidity. 

The bottom line: If I play on the pc I would most likely be buying the 970x bundle with the i7 4790 and a decent mobo.  I would also need a new power supply most likely. That would probably come to around 800 bucks. It's nice that it would not only be for tw3 but for future stuff as well. I'm not too worried about money as a college student since most of my tuition is payed for and I make a good amount of money over the summer (for an intern). 800 bucks is a chunk of change vs 60 bucks for chilling on the couch with a ps4 controller. That saved money would go towards graduation and for house/car when I graduate. 

I think both options are viable and my roommate is pulling for me to upgrade my computer haha. So what do you guys think."
31frbk,1,2015-04-04,Should I use my inheritance for educational purposes?,MET200021,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/31frbk/should_i_use_my_inheritance_for_educational/,"So, quick backstory, I received 200k shortly after the housing bubble burst in 2008. I had just turned 19 and I decided to purchase a home with that money which ultimately turned out to be a very lucrative decision, I had tenants paying rent plus additional income from my job. I can pay all my bills, car payments, insurance, etc with my full time serving position at my restaurant. But I'm still living very paycheck to paycheck. Well, I've decided to remedy this by going back to school and finishing my degree. Now, here's we're it gets tricky, the only way I can maintain my current lifestyle (homeowner) is by working full time at my serving job. But engineering is a very intensive field, B's and C's don't cut it. So somethings got to give. If I continue to work as much as i'm working, I wont get the grades I need to be successful in my field. And pretty soon here I'm about to tack on an internship on top of full time school and full time work. So - to the point - I'm thinking of selling my house and using that money to float me through school over the next two years. It would allow me to focus on school full time, and make me all that much more desirable to employers when I get out. Starting salary for a Software engineer is 80-100k a year, which sure beats the 25k I'm making now. But by selling the house I would ultimately lose the (ballpark) 45000k in appreciation it would receive had I kept it. Not only that but I'm estimating that I'll exit college with 125k left in liquid assets. So is it worth it? Would it be worth it to cut my net worth by about 40% to climb to the top of my class and kick butt in my major? I can always make more money, but I can't make more time. I don't want to exit college and end up at the bottom of an application pile because I chose to guard my asset verses focusing on school."

Since then, I moved out of our appartment, bought a cat, and turned the page.. At least, I thought I had, but you don't just erase 3 1/2 years of relationship with someone. And it's even harder since I really thought he was the one before he broke things up... 

Anyway, since then I had some fun with some guys here and there, but nothing serious, I just didn't want that. And then I met this guy, let's call him Josh... we were studying the same thing at my university and it turned out he really likes me.. we never talked until 1 month ago and he told me he had noticed me at my second year at the university (I am finishing my 4 years degree this month) but never got the courage to talk to me... He's a really nice guy, cooks like a chief at some 5 stars restaurant, he's comprehensive, soft, good at sex, I don't think I could ask for more in a guy, he's just.. awesome. Makes me laugh and everything. I do feel something for him and things were getting serious so.. I decided to tell my ex. Not because I  wanted to, but because my ex is always texting me and trying to see me... I didn't tell him before because I didn't want to hurt him, but then I thought I owed him to learn that from me, and not from one of our common friends...

My ex and me tried to stay friend... The thing is, since he left me, he's not doing so great. He is meeting with a psycho-educator because life if really hard for him, and each time I try to take some distance, he calls me... he told me I was the one keeping his head off the water. He never told me he tought he made a mistake by leaving me, well not directly. But he keeps saying he needs me and calls me everytime he is down because I'm the only one he trust (his words)... It's hard for me to turn him down, or turn the page since he was my best friend, and I don't like seeing him like that...

On monday I told him I had met Josh... He didn't take it well and insisted to go eat in a restaurant because he needed to see me. He came at my appartement... cried a lot, told me he was afraid to lose me, etc, etc... I told him I would always be his friend and everything I could think of to make him feel better...

At the restaurant, he told me he was in love with a girl at his work and that she had also told him she was interested.. the girl in question has one son and is in a relationship... I kept my calm, even though it hurt and asked him if he really thought he was ready to get back in a relationship? That maybe he needed some time and space to sort things out because it didn't look as if he was alright. Seems to me he just want someone at this point, and as this girl is the only other girl he knows beside me... it just seemed convenient, like he's taking the first girl he knows, but not really choosing a relationship... (to be clear, I am not in a relationship with Josh right now, I was clear with him that I needed to take my time, learn to know him before engaging myself in a relationship with him)

Thing is... this bugged me, I came back and cried all night... Josh was there, he hugged me, asked me if I needed some space.. he was basically really great, told me he didn't want to push me to do things I was not ready to do, etc etc... I feel like shit since then.. 

I'm seeing Josh tonight and I don't know where I'm at... I think I may still love my ex, even though I really like Josh. Don't know if my ex acts like that because he still loves me, or because he's afraid to be alone. 

Also big turn off on Josh.. it seems to me he doesn't do anything to help his current situation. He has no class left to take but still doesn't have his diploma because he didn't do an internship. Been working part time cleaning in an hotel for 1 years since he finished his classes (we are in engineering), didn't find an internship, not even sure he tried. He also can't drive at 32 years old because he never bothered to take the classes, while I always get things done, am the best of my class, did 3 internships, and will do a master degree starting this summer...He also did a bankroupt because he had too much depts... It bothers me, even though he is perfect if every other aspect... I feel superficial when I think about that, but I can't help the fact that it is bothering me.

I don't know what I should do, I still have feeling for my ex, but I also really like Josh and feel like I need him in my life, he makes me feel good, I feel like he chose me, that for him i'm not just some random girl. I don't feel like he is with me because there was no one else, we do connect, we are a lot alike... So yeah, I feel trapped between the both of them. Feel I need both of them too... Please help me ? 

And sorry for the poor english, this is not my first language.

**tl;dr**: Should I try to make things work with my ex or keep things going with Josh ? My ex is a mess, says I'm the one keeping him from drowning right now... Josh is a really good guy, says he doesn't want to push me, but clearly loves me, even though some things bothers me with him. Not sure what I should do. "

Personal Issues:

I know some people say to include ""personal matters"" on your application, but I'm not sure how to do that or what to include. 

From the time I was 8 until I was 15, my mother took care of my grandparents 24/7. My grandmother had cancer, and my grandfather had Alzheimer's disease. They lived with us for nearly 4 years, and after my grandmother passed away, my grandfather moved into a nursing home and we spent probably 40-50 hours a week there with him. This was very, very, very, mentally challenging watching someone you love gradually forget who you are and pass away barely remembering you.

My parents are extremely strict, no phone, no hanging out with friends, no talking to anyone, etc. This past year someone called CPS on them for emotional abuse. 

8th - 10th grade I was extremely depressed, and felt neglected from always being pushed to the side so my parents could take care of my grandparents. I had anorexia for 3 years and self harmed for 1. This is all in the past now, but it definitely impacted my school.

Are any of these things I should include? None of them were current, and I have changed a great deal, but I'm clueless about this process...so any advice would be great!

I don't know where to look for college. I'm interested in viola performance and something STEM related...possibly Physics or Comp Sci. 

I don't know what I'm qualified for....or what type of schools to look at.

My parents don't want me to go to college, and unless I move out this summer (which I'm planning to do, as I have saved money, and a job + paid internship scheduled for this summer and this fall respectively), they will never let me apply to college or even leave the house for anything. (Does moving out impact anything?)

Because of this I'm probably going to have to rely on scholarships and financial aid. 

I don't know where to look or what to look for....or anything in fact.

I'm sorry if this is pretty convoluted...but I really have no idea what to do or where to start.

Thank you for making it this far, and any advice you guys can give - I've been lurking for a long time, and this is a really helpful sub. 

Sorry again for the length. "
31fxxf,23,2015-04-04,TIFU by getting a kidney transplant,Radtastified,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/31fxxf/tifu_by_getting_a_kidney_transplant/,"So this happened in July of last year, but I told /r/transplant that I would post this.  Name's have been changed.

Backstory:

In March of 2013, I found out that my kidneys were operating at 20% AKA I had borderline renal failure.  I was 21 at the time and asymptomatic, so it was a shock to everyone.  My main symptom was high creatinine and protein in my urine but I didn't have high blood pressure or fatigue.   On April 10th, the day before my 22nd birthday, I found out that a transplant would be my best bet.  My doctors also wanted to get it done before I needed dialysis, so we had about 2 years to work with.  This was all happening in my last semester of college.  I was job hunting, taking exams, getting ready for graduation and that sort of stuff.

One of the best companies to work for (according to Fortune) was in my area and since it was a software company and that I was about to get my Bachelors of Science in IT, it made it my dream job.  I sent many, many, many applications to this place and didn't hear anything back.

I ended up having to go back to school for the fall semester due to my last class being canceled in the summer because of low enrollment.  My lease on my apartment ended, so I ended up driving about 4 hours two days a week to get that class done while living at my Mom's.

In March of 2014, I found out my cousin was a match to donate his kidney to me.  I just really want to note that this guy is absolutely amazing.  He's in his 40's and trains prison guards for a living.  I'd only seen him maybe 3 or 4 times in my entire life before he decided to get tested.  His reason being that he wants his life to be like the ending of ""Saving Private Ryan"" where he could look back and know he made a difference in someone's life.  He doesn't have anything to do with the FU, but he needs to be recognized for the gift he gave me.

My transplant was in late June because my cousin wanted to wait until two of his sons were done with school.  One was graduating high school and the other was graduating college.  I was still looking for jobs, but I hadn't tried the dream company in awhile.  I completed an internship in the later half of 2013, so I looked at dream company's website and saw an opening for an entry QA job and applied.

The transplant went great for me!  I stayed in the hospital 6 days with very little pain.  I got extremely nauseous from my medicine at first but that was over after 3 days.  My cousin had a rougher time because he had a fluid packet that needed to be drained, so he had to be opened up again in late July (on his 25th wedding anniversary).  My parents and I stayed in the waiting room the entire time that happened.  He's all good now though.

The FU:

2 weeks after the surgery, it was time to take my bandage off my incision.  My transplant coordinator told me to call if anything looked unusual.  So I went in the bathroom, took my bandage off, and it looked pretty disgusting at the bottom because it hadn't completely healed and there was this white stuff covering part of the opening.  I thought it was infected, but I got a shower just to make sure it wasn't part of the bandage.  I got out and it still looked bad.  So I called the hospital and my transplant coordinator was on vacation.  They took my number and said that the on-call coordinator would call me right back.

Not even a minute later, my phone rings and a guy with a heavy foreign accent is asking for me.  A good number of the doctor's that saw me had foreign accents when I was in the hospital, so thinking that this is the coordinator, I start telling him that I had a kidney transplant and described my nasty incision with the pus looking substance on part of it.

He then says, ""Uh....This is Juan from Radtastified's Dream Company"".

I died.  I had no idea what to do, so I just start hysterically laughing like a hyena!  He was calling because he wanted to schedule a phone interview.  I explained everything to him and we  were both laughing by the end of the call.  I hung up and rolled all over my bed because I was so embarrassed.  I thought I had absolutely no chance of getting a job there now.

The coordinator did actually call while I was on the phone with Juan though.  My incision wasn't infected, the white stuff was healing tissue.

Anyway, the phone interview was later that day and I didn't say crap about my transplant even though I was looking for a place to talk about it.  I was way too nervous because not only was Juan on the phone, but also JUAN'S MANAGER, Angela.  I ended up making my entire ""Thanks for the interview"" email about my last year dealing with kidney disease while I was graduating, doing an internship, and dealing with an extra semester of school.

I got a call to schedule a face to face interview the next morning.  I've been working at my Dream Company since August 18th of last year and have had a very productive 7 months.  I'm currently the QA Lead on two projects and Juan says I am most likely going to be promoted next year if I keep it up.

TL;DR:  Told someone I thought was my transplant coordinator about my nasty looking incision.  Turns out it was a manager wanting to setup an interview at my dream company.  Nailed it!

In May 2012, I graduated from a private college with a Bachelor of Science and majors in Computer Science and Philosophy. Prior to graduating, I had worked as a medical transcriptionist, technology support specialist, college tutor, software quality assurance intern, and business intelligence design intern. After graduating, I started my first full-time position at an energy company as an SAP developer, specializing in SAP CRM after a year. I have designed, developed, and supported a number of enhancements and new solutions, including interfaces with and processes within other systems including Oracle databases and a billing/enrollment/EDI application.

I love what I do and the people I work with. I have enjoyed the opportunity to learn SAP and my business area deeply. However, I feel that I may be becoming too comfortable and running out of room to grow at the pace that I prefer. While I still love designing large and complex SAP solutions, the task of developing them feels less creative and more like routine. I miss feeling like a beginner. Also, I fear that I’m becoming too specialized with my technology and business area. I may want to move in a few years and would like to have skills and experience that support multiple career options. And so, I think that it may be time for a new challenge.

A data modeler from my company recently retired. Having worked with him when I was a BI design intern, I remember respecting him and being interested in his work. Rather than focus on one business area, he worked with many business areas and translated their requirements into technical implementations that supported their decision-making and actions. He did so utilizing a wide array of technologies including Oracle, SAP, and BI applications. At my company, compared to my position, data modeler is at the next, and top, technical proficiency/compensation level.

I expressed interest in filling his position and it sounds like it may be a possibility. Within my company, it would definitely increase my current and potential compensation, but does it seem that it would be a good fit for me? Provide the creative technical challenges and rapid growth that I like? Offer me the skills and experience to have a flexible career path? I discussed this with another data modeler at my company and he seems to think so. Long-term, I could see myself becoming less technical in a solution architect type position, becoming more technical in a DBA type position, or staying along the same path of a software developer should it continue to challenge me creatively. I will need more experience to know, but I would appreciate input from anyone who may have more experience or insight already.

Thank you."

Also this account is a throwaway since I believe my boss knows my main one.

Here is a little background:

-I have a MBA and MArch

-I am an architectural intern, which means I have to finish my exams to become a licensed architect. I currently make less than 40k with 4 years of experience (this puts be well below glass doors low end estimation for salary for whatever that's worth). Hours are flexible but the benefits suck, no paid vacation, very few paid holidays, minimal raises etc. This is due to lack of any other place to work within a reasonable distance.

-No debt. I do own a house but luckily I got it cheap, between mortgage, taxes, and insurance it is less than 400 a month. If I were to relocate I have a reliable long term renter that I could rent the place to that I trust. Or I could sell the house and walkaway with roughly 15k.

-I have roughly 25k in emergency funds. Could get another 10k if I needed to. 25k could maintain my lifestyle for over a year without any source of income if I needed to.   


Here lies my problem recently I have been moved from the office to the field as a laborer due to lack of design/office work. Which means I now have set hours and it is not something I am interested in doing at all so the days drag on. More than likely unless things change here soon this summer I will be laid off completely. Which brings me to a big decision.     

I want to relocate badly. I am very interested in real estate development and have been pushing hard to obtain accreditation's and various training that will help me with that. But were I live is horrible for real estate, the area is very stagnate and most people my age are leaving or have all ready left.

Here is my question, those of you who decided to change this up, what did you do to prepare and what advice can you give me?

Any advice is appreciated! Thanks! "
31gb1x,13,2015-04-04,TIFU by snapchatting my friend from a bathroom (NSFW),[deleted],tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/31gb1x/tifu_by_snapchatting_my_friend_from_a_bathroom/,"Happened on Tuesday, have actually lost sleep over how awkward this is.


Background #1: I'm a college student and I've spent a few weeks applying for internships. This is the story of my first interview.


Background #2: My long-time best friend sends me a variety of funny snapchats throughout the week, but every now and then he'll slip something positively vulgar by me, like his crinkled, sweaty face while taking a shit. That horrible image is exactly what I received the night before my interview.  


Background #3: I basically live on a diet of rice, beans and veggies. I put a little more corn in my last batch than usual.


You may have a vague idea of where this is going. 


Tuesday morning. I arrived at a fairly large accounting firm in downtown Boston for my first interview. It went very well; I appeared confident, knowledgeable about the job and even made a couple off-the-cuff remarks that my interviewer laughed at. I felt really good about it. We shook hands and I tried to make my way back to the entrance of the building. The building is huge though, and in my euphoria, I actually forgot the exact route from his office to the front. I decided I didn’t really care if I was “lost” or not and simply decided to walk around and the observe the company I may soon be working at. 


Nature struck my bowels shortly thereafter. Hard. Like “I can’t wait to get home, this thing is going to be birthed right now” hard. I was in a random hallway by this point and found my way into a small bathroom. And I gave birth. In accordance to my background info #3, this baby was delivered a bit more… corny than usual. A combination of displaced joy from the interview and a desire to get back at my friend led to the worst decision I’ve made this year.


I whipped out my phone and went into snapchat. I framed my masterpiece, even pressing the focus button to ensure the contrast of brown/yellow was as shocking as possible. But it still didn’t seem raunchy enough. I decided to make it into a video, and shouted the following phrase in narration:


“UGH! Talk about a corn-ucopia! *WOW!!!*”


By this point, I thought my creation was hysterical. I was proud of it. It made me giggle. Not just the video, but the dump itself. Well-formed, healthy looking, a nice float, and the best part - virtually no cleanup required after. So… I just left it there. No TP in the bowl, just pure log. I wanted the next person to marvel at my peak performance. I reasoned that they would be so impressed, they wouldn’t even be offended. With no need to wash my hands, I went to push open the bathroom door. But you know that weird burst of shock you feel when you try to push a door open at the same time as someone else on the other side?


It was obviously my interviewer, because there is no justice for a good poop. I was startled, as was he. I hadn’t even closed snapchat yet. It was on the contact selection screen, in my left hand.


“Oh!- Heh, hello...”

“...”


I couldn’t speak. There was absolutely no reason for me to be in such a random part of the building 20 minutes after my interview. In one flash moment, I realized everything wrong I had just done. Never in my life have I attempted to send a snap like that. Shit actually grosses me out... so I'm not really sure why I got so into it. I threw my hand into my pocket and walked past without saying anything, almost brushing up against his chest. 


""Why did I do that, why did I do that..."" on a loop in my mind. I realized he was going to find my log, that I couldn’t go back and flush it, and he probably saw snapchat open on my phone as well. I ran as fast as I could back down the hallway until someone saw me. Then I stopped running instantly and tried to transition back into a cool walk. Awkward feels 11/10 at this point and I still don’t know where I am in this clusterfuck of a building. I eventually found a stairwell and exited via the parking garage.


0-1. 2 more interviews next week. 


**TL;DR** nailed an interview, used company bathroom to take a massive dump, snapchatted it to a friend, left it in the bowl and bumped into my interviewer walking in on the way out. "

They get to basically do on the job training for someone for 2-3 months. All while paying them to put out code that is most likely subpar when compared to an experienced developer.  I guess I don't understand why companies would rather get 3 interns than get an experienced dev.
31ggf6,1005,2015-04-04,TIFU by using Adblock.,munich_man,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/31ggf6/tifu_by_using_adblock/,"So I started an internship at a big European tech company a couple weeks ago and my job was primarily the search engine optimization of their websites. Then my supervisor wanted to expand my job and showed me how to integrate adverts in websites, so that I could explain that to our customers. He sends me a very detailed text on how to do it and I try to integrate an ad accordingly on a test site. Doesn't work. So I try again, and nothing. After a full hour of rereading 5 lines of html and several other tries, I go the walk of shame and tell him I can't get it done.  Usually I am very good with this stuff, so initially he doesn't really belive me and I show him on my computer. He tries it, and it doesn't work. Changes some code and it doesnt work. He calls a colleague and they both try for a solid half hour to integrate the freaking ad. Both slowly start loosing their minds, hacking angrily on the keyboard. Then it dawns on me. I am using Adblock. Adblock blocks Ads. I am currently trying to display an ad. I switch it off and its a bingo.The ad works like a charm, leaving 3 people with cumulated computer experience of 40 years stand in front of a laptop feeling like complete retards.
So remember kids, Adblock and Online marketing don't go along well."

31gqlh,9,2015-04-04,Eddie was mute. (Originally posted on Nosleep.),OneLastSmile,creepypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/31gqlh/eddie_was_mute_originally_posted_on_nosleep/,"(Revised, edited, and added things to make this story more Creepypasta and less Nosleep. Plus a bit I wanted to add to the story but Nosleep rules didnt allow.)

Usually when your first child is born, the couple parenting the baby are overcome with joy. You both get to experience first words together, first sentences, first time he read to you, him singing 'Happy Birthday'.....

...

I never experienced any of that.

...

My son, Edward Jodie Robinson, was born with vocal cords that were half-developed. We found out the day after Eddie was born. It comepletely erased the joy of my newborn. A week later, I told myself, ""This child will still be the light of my life"", and immediately the joy was back. My husband, however, overcome with grief, drank himself to death two months after Eddies birth. My best freind in the whole world, Rick, volunteered to step up as his father figure, and I gratefully accepted. Without my husband, we experienced as many firsts as we could. Rick, who was sterile, was happy as could be to take care of this child.

Eddie had made it clear by five years old he was not interested in communicating. We had offered him sign language classes, a text-to-speech program, and flash cards but he declined and made scenes when I tried to force it on him. I eventually gave up and accepted that Eddie wouldnt communicate with me. By the time he learned to write, however, he started writing me notes and left them around the house or gave them to me when it was urgent.

Eddie clearly loved me and cared for Rick, though. He showed it by remembering Mothers Day, picking yellow dandelions and giving them to me, and letting me kiss him goodnight. I was right, Eddie was going to be the light of my life. Eddie enjoyed school and got good grades, Bs and Cs were good enough for me. I tutored Eddie as well. Eddie was content with everything I did for him, and I was the same.

Rick decided, around Eddie's 8th birthday, that he would go back to college so he could get a better job and start supporting me and Eddie a bit more. Eventually, 2 years later, 3 months after Eddies tenth birthday, he dropped out and started a paid internship for more experience, getting a better job that way. By this time summer vacation for Eddie was drawing to a close and Eddie would start fourth grade. The first incident that should have warned me or at least given me a clue happened.

------------------------------------

It was the first day of school and, we, having moved to another area of the city, were worried about Eddie and how his classmates would treat him. Our fears came true as me and Rick stood at the curb waiting for the bus. A group of children later learned to be in Eddies class walked up and started talking to him, only realizing that when Eddie didnt reply that he was the fabled 'Mute Kid' that was rumored to be in their class. Then they starting the teasing.

""Hey, mute kid, is your mother dissapointed she didnt get a better kid? If you were twins, she'd probably love your sibling more! You're just trash. Anyone who can't talk is trash, because if you can't talk no one ever knows what you want! I'm surprised you havent killed yourself or starved to death because your mom doesnt know if you're ever hungry!""

 The three kids behind the one talking were egging him on with ""Thats right!"" and ""Yeah, he is TRASH!"" Eddie remained calm throughout this, instead choosing to dig around in his pencil case. 

He picked out the sharpest pencil he could find, scarcely breathing.

""You gonna stab yourself in the neck with that, mute kid? You should!"". Eddie simply held the pencil like a knife, waiting. The torment continued on until the boy in front advanced on Eddie, who promptly stabbed the boy in the arm. Screaming, the boy collapsed. I was screaming too, as was Rick. Eddie threatened the other children with the bloody pencil, who backed up. The bus had pulled up by then, and the driver had called 911. Twenty minutes later paramedics took away the bleeding boy and cops picked up Eddie. After meeting with him at the police station, and a meeting with the cops, Eddie was put in Juvinile for a month. When he got out he was grinning, and his psychiatrist told us that Eddie was an otherwise normal boy, conclusion drawn from observing him, and the stabbing had likely been a very bad response to anger about two things: Being mute, and being teased for it.

------------------------------

Two years passed without incident. Twelve and now entering the sixth grade, we were positive Eddie was going to be made fun of relentlessly, because everyone knows how mean middle schoolers are. It didnt happen, because rumors still spread that Eddie had once stabbed the person who made fun of him, and people kept their distance. Eddie enjoyed the isolation, even writing me a full page on how much he enjoyed it. and how I shouldnt worry about it. The second incident happened around this time.

Eddie had been simply sitting at lunch, when a burly boy in the eighth grade approached him. ""You think you're so tough because you stabbed a kid, I know you do. Well, fuck that. I bet you can't even do it now. Little ----"" He proceeded to curse him out. 

Eddie slowly, carefully, rose from his seat, turned, and stared at the boy, sizing him up.

He grabbed his lunch tray, raised it, and smacked the boy across the head. While dazed, Eddie jumped on him and began beating him, severely bloodying his face. Children crowded around the two. Eddie finally finished his assault, the burly boy unconsious, and with blood on his fists, looked at the kids in front of him, who backed up, and he walked to the bathroom to wash his hands. (Told to me from another child who witnessed it all).
Eddie was arrested and put in Juvenile for 4 months this time. When he got out, his psychiatrist told me the same thing. He simply had a bad response.

There were no incidents up until Eddie moved out at twenty years old. Eddie finally bought a cell phone and began texting me and Rick (who had finally completed his college education, and was at time dating me) and eventually his friends in and out of the workplace. Two more years passed, and I, at forty four years old, decided to visit my son. I had heard rumors of people going missing in Eddie's city and next two towns over, but I wasnt worried.

When I entered Eddie's home, it was dark. Switching on the lights, I explored Eddie's house a little. The kitchen was stocked, the living room TV was on, and the bedsheets werent made. I was exploring Eddie's room a bit to try and find something to tidy for him, when I discovered several discarded notes in Eddie's handwriting in his trash bin. They said:

*Remember Linda's clothes pickup is on Thursday. She can't be naked forever.*

*The spot in the woods is compromised. You need to prepare more 12 foot holes and more dead dogs. Maybe find some empty places in that abandoned graveyard. Get Dana Lee on the dogs, and Johnson on the holes.*

*Incinerate last set of notes.*

*Truck needs gas, gas money is on counter. I'm serious this time, 
Future Eddie, dont forget. Its crucial the truck has gas, its a long drive to the 'spot'*

These struck me as odd. Who is Linda? Why is she naked? What does he need twelve foot holes and dogs for? Why does he go to THAT town? Why incinerate his notes? Who was Dana Lee and Johnson? More of his friends? All questions I should be worried about. 

 At this time I heard a noise coming from the basement.

---------------------------------

I stood at the entrance to the basement, shivering. The notes left a chill in my body, and the basement gave me even more of one. 

The banging had stopped. I quickly realized the source of the noise had been a shovel falling to the ground. I was scared for nothing, I thought... until I realized all of the hanging tools were moving slightly. I walked forward and removed the tools from the walls, and felt it. It was indeed moving, a small force seemingly coming from behind it. I felt around the wall until I discovered a loose brick. It took most of my strength to remove it. A hole behind the brick shone light in, enough to see the light glinting off something metal. I reached in, discovered a handle, and pulled.

------------------------------

There was a girl behind the door, barely older than 14. Naked to the skin, covered in bloody bandages and bruises, chained to the wall, and shaking. ""Oh god, please don't...."" She said quietly. Her eyes were shut tight. I kneeled down, maternal instincts kicking in. ""Shh-shh-shh, I won't hurt you, sweetheart. "" She slowly opened her eyes. Remembering the note, I said, ""Your name is Linda, right?"" ""How did you know?"" She asked, still shaking. ""I'll tell you later. I'm going to call the cops."" ""But... He should come back soon! He'll kill us both..."" ""The police station is less than a block away, honey. "" ""If you say so..."". I promptly dialed 911, told them my situation, and they told me the police were on their way.

There were eight rooms hidden behind the wall, no bigger than seven feet square. Seven people were found in those rooms, 3 girls, 4 boys. None of them were older than 17, all having moderate to serious injuries, most bandaged. Only one of them was found dead, a little boy later identified as Elijah Vale, age 12. 

All six children were immediately taken to a hospital where two died during treatment, Tom Underwood, 11, and Ashley Barret, 17, Tom from blood loss and Ashely from a bad response to the antibiotics. The news reported the stories for weeks before mysteriously, every single one was deleted. By this time the hype had died down and no one really noticed. The four remaining children, Linda Wilkerson, 13, Alex Mechi, 16, Jane Enderson, 10, and Lucas Xander, 15, were given therapy, medication, and TLC. None of them ever fully recovered, Jane and Lucas still having vivid hallucinations of Eddie following or standing over them, and Linda and Lucas having periodic panic attacks.

Eddie was never located, thus was assumed dead, until one night. four years later, I recieved a text message from someone claiming to be 'Eddie'.

--------------------

Transcipt of the conversation:

""Mom, its me, Eddie... I'm at the Grand Canyon.""

""Liar. Eddie died.""

""I just went into hiding. I wont be arrested again.""

""How do you know my son was arrested? Tell me how long and at what age and I might believe you.""

""A month at ten. 4 months at twelve.""

""You must have loved stalking my son.""

""Mom, its me. Edward Jodie Robinson. The man who raised me is called Rick March Karrington. Your full name is Joyce Hope Robinson. My real father was called Nicholas Robinson. I dont know his middle name.""

""You're Eddie.""

""Thats what I've been telling you. The Canyon is so gorgeous at sunset. I'm about to jump.""

""Eddie, oh my god... Call suicide hotline right now.""

""I feel bad for those kids, I really do. Do you remember all the squirrels I killed when I was 15? Must've been more than a hundred. You saw them. ""

""Eddie, please dont kill yourself.""

""Is Rick doing okay? I was at your marriage. I watched through the window.""

""Rick is fine, Eddie. Please don't jump.""

""I only texted you because I wanted to tell you something before I died.""

""Eddie!""

""You were the best mother anyone could've asked for. I'm sorry I went a different direction than you'd hoped. I regret doing it now, now that I've been in the rural areas, cleared my head. I'm so sorry. Only four kids stayed alive, right? Tell them I am so sorry. I'm going to hell, so tell the Christain ones to pray for me if they want to. I wont mind if they dont. Just tell them to pray to lessen the flames for me a little bit. Those kids didnt deserve what I did to them. It was just such a rush, hurting things like that. "" He didnt respond for several minutes after this.

""I love you so much, Mommy.""

""Eddie?""

""Eddie.""

""Eddie, oh my god!""

At this point I broke down crying. My son, the light of my life, was dead. Somehow I felt relief. Relief that that phsycopath was dead, but it was quickly cancelled out by memories of my son, which made me greive further. When Rick got home, I showed the phone to him. He cried too, because the child he raised was gone.

His body was buried in a private funeral, attended by me, Rick, and Linda, and the only pastor willing to attend such a mans funeral.

----------------------

Its been a full five years since his death and I still miss him. I have waking moments where I'm convinced Eddie will come into my room and give me a hug. I regularly put flowers on his grave. Rick has since died of lung cancer, and I do the same for him. 

Beautiful posies for the both of them.

...
I love you, too, Eddie.

...

So, so, so, much.

-----

**-Epilouge-**

I've been standing outside her house for two hours now. The side yard, the one with no windows. It was hard to find a body she'd be sure to recognize as me. Thankfully, I found one in time. She's always been gullible. Those phsychiatrists lies, that man telling her he loved her... Although, that still has a chance of being true, I refuse to believe that man loved her. 

My burial spot is always decorated with posies or roses or daisies. When that man died, gods it felt great. I hated him and could never tell her. Dear god I hated him. I hate men in general, boys in general. Too tough. I heard somewhere that boy I beat up in, oh what was it? Sixth grade? I heard he suffered brain damage. Good for him. 

I wasnt sorry for hurting those kids. I wish I could tell them my reasons. Each one of those kids were awful pricks. Linda had many times beat her own brother. Alex could have been a sailor, he cursed so much. The dead one, the one I was about to dispose of, I think he was Elijah. He was the worst of all. He regularly hit his own teachers. At 11 he had sexually assaulted a girl much younger than him. When he was five he killed the family cat on purpose. Men are awful. If I hadnt been watching the girls before I started on the boys, I would've only kidapped the boys.

I'm entering the house now. My pocket knife is flipped open. She should be with that man, she's still grieving. I wonder what kind of conspiracys will happen when they discover my body next to hers. ""Wasn't this man dead 5 years ago? What is he doing here? Was he twins?"" I can hear it now. Hahaha. Idiots. She just turned around. Her mouth formed my name. She couldnt get it out, though... I was too quick. Her neck is stabbed deep, and now... I pull out a revolver... Its my time.

Goodnight.

About a month ago, I received an internship offer email with Questionnaire for me to fill in. It said that they'll get back to me in few weeks with official offer letter and team placement once I've completed it. I completed and returned it immediately.

It's been a month since then and they haven't gotten back to me yet.

Is this a standard practice or should I contact them to make sure they haven't forgotten about me?

If anybody has an insight, I would much appreciate it!

Thanks!"

We ""rewarded"" their effort with despicable and terrible behavior.

We should not have to be reminded that death threats are unacceptable, always serious, and never a ""joke"". Threatening to publicly release private/individual information (doxxing) is not tolerated. Threatening to take action against someone and causing them to lose their job simply because one has a difference of opinion with them is unprofessional.

We had a great opportunity to ask relevant questions and gain some insight into the hiring process but we failed miserably. Not only that, other recruiters and managers that observed today's horrible behavior may be less likely to participate.

The goal or r/cscareerquestions is to provide accurate information to prospective college CS/CpE/SE/IT students and future tech professionals. To achieve those goals we, the community, must behave in a polite, prudent, and professional manner. 

Moving forward, we will moderate our behavior accordingly with the aim of restoring the goodwill of those whose guidance and information we seek and need. Thank you for your attention and patience."

31h8mi,3,2015-04-04,My life is shit and idk how to change it,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/31h8mi/my_life_is_shit_and_idk_how_to_change_it/,"Whenever I talk to someone about the problems in my life they always say ""well nothings wrong with it! Plenty of others have it worse!"" but I'm so sick of this fucking bland life. Yeah it's not hell. I have a roof over my head, I'm passing my classes, I have a good family, I have friends, but *nothing ever goes right and nothing ever happens.* It may not be bad but it's not good either. I'd rather have *something* going on in my life than just complete and utter uselessness. And when things finally start to get interesting, something has to come down and shit all over it.

* **I feel lonely as hell.** I have friends, but my closest ones moved across state for college. So I effectively do nothing with my life unless they're home. I occasionally talk to some of my friends on campus but ultimately never legitimately hang out with any of them. And even when my close buddies are home, I'm often times left out. Not because they don't like me or anything, but they're big into basketball and I'm not so they typically just don't invite me to hang when they're playing which is fine but idk still sucks cause they're the only people I get to hang with.

* **All I do is go to my classes, come home, do homework, go to sleep, rinse and repeat.** That's my life for the past semester. It's awfully bland and I absolutely hate it.

* **College is fucking stressful.** I've had days where I spend upwards of 10 hours on homework. The average for each day is maybe 5 or 6. I know you might say ""well people work 8 hour shifts at jobs everyday"" but the only problem is working a job doesn't have the stress of actually trying to learn complicated things like Calc 2, not to mention the stress of potentially losing my scholarships if I do poorly in grades.

* **I haven't had a girlfriend in like 3 years, and am nervous I'm going to fuck up with this girl.** I'm finally talking to a girl who I think is amazing looking, smart, funny, sweet, all that good stuff. Problem is, I rarely get to talk to her because she's always working or at class. And I mean she literally always is - yesterday she got up at 7, went to class till 430, worked till 2am. So I very rarely get a chance to even talk to her. This is killing me because I'm just getting to know her. If I already knew her well, it'd be fine, but right now is not the best time for her to be this busy. I've been trying to make a good impression and legitimately get to know this girl for the past couple weeks but I feel like I'm hitting a brick wall. I asked her to hang out twice now - she said she'd love to both times and I was absolutely ecstatic but both times something had to get in the way of it (Legitimate reasons, it wasn't just her blowing me off) but it still discourages me because I don't know what to do. I try to talk to her everyday but I feel like I'm just more of a pest with how busy she is and I don't even know how to ask her out for *the third time* because it's starting to get kind of weird at this point. I feel like I'm blowing my chance with her cause I feel like with a girl as pretty as herself, I need to make my impression quickly before some other guy comes around and tries to get with her. But I can't do shit because we only send maybe 5 texts a day back and forth if that with how busy she is.

* **To tag along with this, I'm still a virgin.** I feel like I'm at least decent looking but for some reason I just can't get with girls. I know everyone always says being a virgin isn't a bad thing but it's just so frustrating because I feel like such a failure. For two reasons. One because there are some fucking *weird* kids that I know who have lost their v-card before me. I feel like an absolute asshole for saying that but it's just sort of like ""if that guy can do it, what the hell is wrong with me?"" type of feeling. I feel like there's something wrong with me that nobody's ever told me or something. Second reason is because I have had probably 4 or 5 girls in my life tell me they wanted to have sex - yet every single time I managed to fuck it up with those girls. All of them in different ways funnily enough. I just feel like as soon as something starts to look up in my life something shuts it down as I said earlier.

* **I don't have any passion.** I used to *love* skateboarding when I was younger and I still enjoy it but I'm just not as invested in it. I like video games but they tend to be more of a filler for when nothing else is going on in my life. I legitimately do enjoy playing them, but if I had the choice of playing games or going out with friends or on a date I would take the other options 9 times out of 10. They tend to help me take my focus off of all the shit I'm unsatisfied with in my life but as of lately no games have really interested me so all I've done is think and feel shitty. Anyways, yeah I don't have anything I'm truly passionate about. There's nothing I feel particularly strong about at all. Everything's just sort of bleak in my mind. The only thing that I really want in life is a girlfriend that I am truly happy with and she's truly happy with me - but ironically enough, I feel like the more I desire that the more I'll never reach it.

* **I'm not outgoing.** I am very easy to talk to once someone talks to me, but I am awful at actually striking up conversation with others and it's painfully difficult for me to make new friends on my own. When I'm with friends, I am very good at making friends with their friends that they bring along, but when it's just me on my own there's something intimidating about it that my brain just doesn't allow me to do it. There's so many people on campus and so many I would probably get along with very well but I never put myself out there.

* **I don't have a future plan at all.** There are people my same age that are going out there and making connections with all sorts of people and getting internships and I'm just kind of sitting around doing nothing with my life. I don't know how to even begin with this.

* **I feel like dying a lot.** I don't think I'd ever be able to actually kill myself and I don't even know if I'd be able to self-diagnose myself as depressed. I feel like I could never do that to my family no matter how much I hate my life. But I just lay down in bed a lot and wish I could be dead so I don't have to feel. I lay there and think about all the things I've just told you and get frustrated that I don't know how to change my life for the better and then I just wish I could not exist anymore so I don't have to think about all this.

* **Worst of all, all I do is sit around moping about all these things.** Instead of using these problems to motivate change in myself, I take them and fucking loathe myself. I don't know how to change, I don't know how to fix a lot of these problems. And instead of putting forth effort fix them and improve my life, I just sit around feeling like a waste. If you leave me alone for more than a half hour without anything to do, I guarantee I'll contemplate everything I hate about my life and feel like shit. I just don't know how to let myself feel good or let myself improve. The reason for this is because I am a complete baby when it comes to taking risks. The most alive I've felt in ages is when I asked that girl out for the first time because I had absolutely no idea what she would say. But normally, I feel like when there's reason to believe something could go wrong, I can't do it. I sit here searching for the *perfect* answer to my problems without realizing I'll never find them and I need to try whatever is reasonably possible. I sit here *afraid* to take a chance and go meet new people. I sit here lacking any confidence in myself when it comes to this girl, even though she's said yes to going out twice already. I sit here and feel lost without having other people around me to make me feel worth something. I hate it.

I'm a senior CS student who is graduating next month. I've been searching since about January. I just want to break down my job search so far and see what you guys think and get some feedback about what I can do to improve my chances because I really want to get a full-time job.

Here's some things about me:

* [Resume](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=8d5162a7bb7e8c0!41788&amp;authkey=!AM4CwmajnjaR7lo&amp;ithint=file%2cpdf)
* Senior CS student (graduate next month)
* One internship that lasted one year. Currently have part-time developer job on campus (official title: web developer assistant)

So far here's been the breakdowns of some the interviews I've had:

* One ""Big 4"": Two phone interviews. Rejected (I did pretty poorly on technical questions)
* ""Big"" gaming company: Did programming test, then skype interview. Rejected after skype interview (Said they wanted someone that fitted their needs more)
* One in person interview (Felt interview went well, but didn't get a call back)

Other than that I've had plenty of those first time talks with recruiters from local companies but all of them seemed like they wanted some one immediately and told me they'd call me back closer to my graduation.


As far as my job search goes I've mainly been trying to use my school resources and some job boards (mainly indeed. some times github jobs, stackoverflow careers).

I think my job search is may be too focused on out of state companies that I probably have a lower chance of getting interviewed. A lot of times when I'm looking on indeed I'm looking for out of state companies with recognizable names.

When I'm applying to jobs I almost use the same resume. I some times add a few things if I feel like it would help me with a particular posting but that's it. I always submit a custom cover letter. 


So, with all that being said, what's your critique on my resume? What do you think of how I am job searching? What things can I do improve my job search? Please let me know if you need more info or are confused about something I've said."
31hp70,1,2015-04-05,F4M --- Roleplay based off TV/Movies. Ideas inside.,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/31hp70/f4m_roleplay_based_off_tvmovies_ideas_inside/,"No, I don't want to roleplay as a television set, apparently my name gives people the wrong idea. Anyhow, thanks for clicking! I would love to roleplay with characters from movies/television with scenes based off said media. Since you would be doing me a favor by playing a pre-established character, I feel it would be fair and fun for me to cater to your needs! Would you like a character with a big, thick ass opposite of yours? Do you crave to have a busty, eighteen year old with your character? Or perhaps you want a particular race? The only things that I *will* not do in a scene are -&gt; Animals, ageplay, blood play, feet, force, futa, scat, watersports and anything *too* far out there. Feel free to ask if I didn't cover anything.

♥ **Marco Polo**; You would be playing... *gasp*, Marco Polo in said scene. Full knowledge of the series isn't required but a general idea of the character and show would be great. I would love to see him being seduced by a woman in the Khan's harem, or perhaps a dancer sent to entertain him. 

♥ **Veep**; Dan Egan. Yep, that horrible douchebag. He's smug, an annoying know-it-all and an all around asshole. A senator's daughter getting rammed by him in a storage closet, trying to stay quiet to avoid being caught? Yes, please. Or maybe that eighteen year old girl in the gym he can't keep his eyes off is charmed and fucked by him in a semi-public place.

♥ **Suits**; Mike Ross with a cute new intern or secretary filling in for Donna. A late night case forces Mike to stay in the file room when the girl stops by for a visit before she's heading out. Of course, she can't help herself and has her hands roaming over his body, hoping to relieve him of any stress. 

♥ **Galavant**; You would be playing as Galavant in the scene opposite of many different choices. Maybe a wench at the bar? A princess who's room he had snuck into? Or the local farmer's curvy, yet gorgeous daughter who's been craving your attention for weeks. The choice is yours! ~ Singing/rhyming not included.

♥ **Community**; This is the only roleplay where I could consider playing a canon character; Annie only. I would prefer for you to play Jeff in this scene. If you watch the show, there's more than enough ideas for us to come up with a fun scene together. 

♥ **From Dusk Till Dawn**; Not the movie version. I would want you to play Seth Gecko in this roleplay, I can't say I like any of the male characters. Seth having fun with a bank teller who can't resist his looks or one of the dancers from the infamous strip club?

♥ **Arrow**; Who could resist a scene with a hot cat burglar on her knees with her mouth full of the vigilante's hard cock? Is she getting her mouth fucked in an alley, or perhaps in a warehouse after he's cleared it out? Maybe Oliver's being seduced by his sister's slutty, eighteen year old friend?

♥ **What's Your Number?**; Easy. Colin + Hot, juicy assed slut = &lt;333. This scene can go in any direction, easy to get into some raunchy hot sex.

♥ **The Cabin In The Woods**; Holden/Jesse Williams is left alone with your choice of gal in the cabin. Ditsy blonde with a killer body? Voluptuous nerdy girl who's in need of a good fuck? Open and easy to dive in to.

♥ **Bates Motel**; Dylan with someone staying at the motel, or perhaps someone who owes him money for weed. A student, a milf, so on and so forth!

♥ **Man Of Steel**; You would be playing Henry Cavill as Superman in the scene. I'd prefer for him to go up against villainesses that lead up to a rough hate fuck. Poison Ivy, White Rabbit and others would be the top picks. Also into playing other females such as Power Girl and so on. No Wonder Woman.

Those are some ideas off the top of my head. I would love to hear some if you want to play a particular character. Give me a list of your shows/movies, I watch a lot! I also have images for the no-named characters opposite of yours and I'm hopeful that they won't disappoint. Big kinks I love but aren't necessary; anal, ass worship, rimming(giving/recieving), rough sex and dirty talk. I'll get back to messages ASAP!"

Should I discuss this with them now before I sign, or afterwards, or even at all? Should I ask them what type of clearance I'll be applying for?

June 2013: I filled out my SF85 and admitted to having used marijuana sparingly from June 2012 - September 2012 (this was probably dumb to admit since it was so minor).

July 2013: I received a notice that I had an opportunity to clarify that portion of my SF85. I sent in a 2 sentence summary, basically saying the exact same thing and that I no longer use marijuana.

October 2013: Two months after my internship ended, I received a notice that I was denied the clearance.

This week, I received 2 internship offers, both from DoD contractors. I have 1 week to make my decision on where to go. Both jobs state that they will require a clearance, although I don't know which level.

Will I be able to obtain a clearance after getting denied previously? Will my employer definitely know that I was denied? Should I discuss this with them now before I sign, or afterwards, or even at all? Should I ask them what type of clearance I'll be applying for? What can I do now, 1.5 years after I was previously denied a clearance, to make sure that this is not an issue for me now? All advice is greatly appreciated, thanks.

31i79j,2,2015-04-05,Suggested certifications for mechanical and automotive,BaltimoreBirdGuy,EngineeringResumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/comments/31i79j/suggested_certifications_for_mechanical_and/,"I'm currently back in school to change careers from teaching physics to hopefully designing vehicle powertrains. I'd like to gather information on certifications or courses that would be useful. Cheap or free is obviously preferable but information is always good. 

I got the cswa certification because it was free for a month. Would it be work the money to get some more of those? Cswa-s for fea stuff or cswp or any others? They aren't super expensive individually but there seem to be quite a few so I can't afford them all. 

I saw the MATLAB certification is super expensive but signed up for a programming in MATLAB course through coursera. Do engineers generally find that coursera or edx stuff is beneficial on a resume? Is it worth the small fee to get the official certificate for the course? Any other recommended  courses similar to those?

Any other suggestions or information would be really appreciated as well. I'm married and hoping to have a kid when I graduate so I'd like to do everything possible that will help me land a good job in addition to the more ""obvious"" get good grades and do internships.

Thanks in advance!"

31idne,5,2015-04-05,Everyone in My Family Is Concerned for My Little Sister but No One Knows How to Approach Her,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/31idne/everyone_in_my_family_is_concerned_for_my_little/,"My younger sister (17) and I haven't spoken to each other for about 2 years. Recently, she's been causing some trouble for my family to the point where most people are fed up with her. 

She regularly bullies my other sister (11) by saying things like, ""Dad doesn't even want you here; I hope Mom gets custody of you.""  

Though she has a job, she continuously tries to manipulate our Aunts and parents into giving her money and everyone in the family is working hard to save money to help our sick grandparents and has little money to spend on anything else.

Lately, she's been going through a phase where she believes that she's mature for her age. This has led to her ceasing all socialization in her high school and hanging out with an older crowd. She has begun to see a 21 year old (she *just* turned 17) and though they've known each other for less than a week, she invited him over to our mom's house tonight, where she's supposed to be dog-sitting. 

Our mom is out of town for the week, and my sister is on spring break, so she has the house all to herself until our mom gets back. This guy she invited us over has already lied to her (though she doesn't believe us) by saying that he's an intern for one of the Marvel offices in the area (there are none). He's also be sending her lewd messages and like I said, they've known each other for less than a week and he's at my mom's house with her.

I want to help her be more considerate of other people and let her know that this person she's seeing seems sleazy but I don't know where to start. Her behavior has made her difficult to tolerate within the family and around her school and she's had a history of sleazy boyfriends. My parents don't know how to communicate with her, my Aunts don't want to make it seem like we're questioning her maturity (in fear of her doing bolder things to try to prove herself), and she just thinks I'm her loser brother in community college (don't argue this. I promise you, she thinks very little of me).

**tl;dr My little sister is treating our family poorly and is in what seems like a sketchy relationship.**

How can we help her? Am I overreacting? "
31ihvl,10,2015-04-05,"Potential internship at jaxa, any advice?",[deleted],japanlife,https://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/31ihvl/potential_internship_at_jaxa_any_advice/,"I'm finishing my bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering next january and I'll have about 8 months to do what I want before tarting a master in space engineering. I got interested in Japan through anime/manga and after reading through some traveling guides and websites I decided on trying for an internship at Jaxa while sightseeing before/after that. There is a very slim chance of me getting the internship but just in case; there are a few things I'd like to know before diving deeper into this.

* **Living expenses**

The Jaxa clearly states that the internship does not offer any compensation, meaning I will have to dig into my savings and work part-time in order to stay. On savings alone I will have about 30000 yen to spend each month, would this be enough to live on (excluding housing)? which brings me to my next point.

* **Housing**

Although I have not looked deep into this matter yet, as far as I've seen housing is pretty expensive. Even having a host family would cost me 40000 yen for subscription, with at least 2500 yen per night (which is about as expensive as cheap hotels as far as I've seen). I have not looked too deeply into this so I might be looking at the wrong place, is it possible to live at a cheaper rate (preferably a host family)?

* **Language barrier**

I am yet unable to speak japanese although I will start learning this as soon as my application is be approved, if not earlier. This means that I probably won't be able to speak fluent japanese when I get there (hence a host family to live with would be convenient to improve my Japanese). Will the language barrier be of much influence?

Note that there is still enough time for me to prepare for this financially and mentally and the more I know the better I can prepare for this, so any advice will do!"
31ijjh,43,2015-04-05,I made a list of a starship's crew with detailed descriptions for roles and departments. Feedbacks are welcome!,twoduy,worldbuilding,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/31ijjh/i_made_a_list_of_a_starships_crew_with_detailed/,"So I stumbled upon the awesome ship + crew generator by /u/MercuryVII (check it out [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1yiuxj/i_made_a_ship_crew_generator_called_tradewind/) if you haven't already). However, the roles of each crew member are unclear, and some of the departments don't make much sense. I love making lists of things and just happen to have some free time, so I decided to make my own version of what a fully manned spaceship would be like. This list would focus on more on the organization structure as well as the roles of each department and crew member.
Enjoy and feedback are welcome! 

&amp;nbsp;

Sorry in advance for typo and/or grammar mistakes!

&amp;nbsp;

**(I know the descriptions are incomplete. I did not save my file and lost much of my progress... Too tired to retype all that again. Promise I will update this later. Maybe you guys can help me out!)**

&amp;nbsp;

For this list we will use a warship as en example. However this crew structure can be applied to any spaceship, whether military, corporate or civilian.

* Sample Ship: SFS Hercules - Flagship of the Sol Federation 2nd Fleet.
* Class: Titan Dreadnought
* Full crew: 4576 members
* Status:  Active service as of 2290
* Commission: March 21, 2269
* Homeport: Earth

Please note however that this list a comprehensive list of all possible roles &amp; departments for all types of ships. It is very unlikely that a single ship would have all of these. 

&amp;nbsp;

**1. Command:**
Command, High Command or Executive Office isn't really a department but rather is term referring the highest leadership on board a ship. This would include the Captain, high ranking officers as well as a representative HODs (Head of Department) from each department on board the ship.

Position | Description
---|---
Captain | The Captain is the ultimate commander of the spaceship. He/she is responsible for its safe and efficient operation and ensuring that the vessel complies with state or company policies. All persons on board, including officers, crew, passengers and guests are under the Captain's authority and are his/her ultimate responsibility. For most situation, the Captain have the final say in almost all matter.
Chief Officer | The Chief Officer (CO) or Chief Command Officer (CCO) is second-in-command after the captain and also the head of the Bridge Department on a vessel. The Chief Officer assumes command of the whole ship in the absence or incapacitation of the Captain. More details on the Chief Officer under the Bridge section.
Second Officer | The Second Officer is the General-On-Board (GOB). He/she is third-in-command and also head of the Military Department. The General assumes command of the whole ship in the absence or incapacitation of both the Captain and the Chief Officer. More details on the General under the Military section.
Third Officer | The Third Officer is the Chief Engineer (CE). He/she is fourth-in-command and also the head of the Engineering Department. The Chief Engineer assumes command of the whole ship in the absence or incapacitation of the Captain, the Chief Officer and the General. More details on the Chief Engineer under the Engineering section.
Executive Committee | The Executive Committee or ExCom consists of representative Head of Departments (HOD) from all ship departments (Bridge, Engineering, Military, Intelligence &amp; Security, R&amp;D, Medical, Finance &amp; Operation Support &amp; Stewarding). The Captain, Chief Officer, General-On-Board and Chief Engineer are also part of the Executive Committee. Although the Captain have the final say in almost all matter, the Executive Committee has the power to veto the Captain's decision if all members unanimously agree on a different course of action.
Executive Admin Assistant | An administrative role, the Executive Admin Assistant act as a personal assistant to the captain, handling paperworks for the ExCom and act as liaison between high command and other departments. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2. Bridge:**
Bridge (or deck / cockpit / control room, depends on who you ask) is a rather small department, but is critical to the operation of the vessel. The Bridge is the platform from which the vessel is commanded, it is where most of the action happen. Main controls and the captain chair are located here, making the Bridge the most secured area of the ship, accessible only to a few with the right responsibility.

Position | Description | # of crew
---|---|----
Chief Officer | The Chief Officer (CO) or Chief Command Officer (CCO) is second-in-command after the captain and a member of ExCom. As head of the Bridge Department, he/she coordinates the Bridge crew and oversees operation of the Bridge, ensure smooth flight operation whether in combat or navigation. | 1
First Pilot / Flight Pilot | The First Pilot, Flight Pilot or Pilot-In-Command (PIC) is the main controller of the helm. While long distance travel are usually handle by the autopilot AI, an experienced pilot is crucial for combat maneuver, going in and out of FTL travel as well as docking / landing and taking off. Candidates for the First Pilot seat usually requires at least 4,000 hours of logged flight time in order to even be considered. | 1
Second Pilot / Combat Pilot | The Second Pilot, Combat Pilot or Co-Pilot (CP) main responsibility is to assist the First Pilot during operation. On smaller ships, the Second Pilot would be in charge of the various weapon and shield systems, hence the name Combat Pilot. However on large battle ships such as the SFS Hercules, these systems would be too complex to be handled by just one person, in which case they would be operated by the Military Department instead. | 1
Relief Pilot | Most ships will have one or two senior members of the Bridge crew who act as Relief Pilots, who can take over control of helm when necessary. | 1-2
Chief Navigator | The Chief Navigator's (CN) primary responsibility is to be aware of ship position at all times. Responsibilities include planning the journey, advising the Captain or CO of estimated timing to destinations while en route, and ensuring hazards are avoided. The navigator is in charge of maintaining the aircraft or ship's star charts, planetary maps, and navigational equipment. | 1
Assistant Navigator / Lookout Officer | The Assistant Navigator or sometimes known was Lookout Officer help the Chief Navigator with charting courses as well calculations. They operate the ship's radar, reading heat signatures, identifying nearby ships, bases, objects and potential hazards via long range scanner. | 1 - 4 depends on ship size
Communication Officer | The Communication Officers operate the PA system (for internal communication) as well as broadcasting system (for external communication). They also maintain contact with any crew members going on off-site missions. The ability to speak multiple languages is highly recommended for this position. | 1 - 4, depends on ship size
Bridge Admin Assistant | An administrative role, the Bridge Admin Assistant act as a personal assistant to the Chief Officer, handling paper works and act as liaison between the Bridge department and other departments.  | 1
Bridge Crewman | Includes all Able Crewman and Cadets reporting to the Bridge department | 5 - 30, depends on ship size

&amp;nbsp;

**3. Engineering:**
While maintenance does not sound like the most glorious of jobs, it is nonetheless of utmost importance on any starships. The Engineer Department is responsible to keep all systems running smoothly, providing repairs and upgrades when needed. When it comes to a survival situation, the Chief Engineer has as much as say as the General-On-Board, if not more.

Position | Description | # of crew
---|---|----
Chief Engineer / Chief Technical Officer | The Chief Engineer (CE) or Chief Technical Officer (CTO) oversees the Engineering Department. He/she is responsible for all operations and maintenance that have to do with all systems, machinery and equipment throughout the ship. The Chief Engineer is fourth-in-command and assumes command of the whole ship in the absence or incapacitation of the Captain, the Chief Officer and the General-On-Board. On ships without a Military Department, the Chief Engineer is third-in-command. | 1
Lead Propulsion Engineer | Responsible for the maintenance of the ship's propulsion systems including the engine and wrap drive. The high level of expertise as well as responsibility required for this role means that the head Propulsion Engineer is often second in command in the Engineering team, just after the Chief Engineer. | 1
Lead Life Support Engineer | Responsible for the maintenance of the ship's life support systems including oxygen generation, air circulation, water circulation, heating &amp; waste control. | 1
Lead Electrical Engineer | Responsible for the maintenance and distribution of the power network within the ship including main &amp; sub power generators, solar panels, backup power systems and any other alternative power sources.  | 1
Lead IT Engineer | Responsible for the maintenance of all computer systems on board, including server mainframe, user hardware, software and AI systems. | 1

Engineering Admin Assistant | An administrative role, the Engineering Admin Assistant act as a personal assistant to the Chief Engineer, handling paper works and act as liaison between the Engineering department and other departments.| 1
Engineering Crewman | Includes all Senior &amp; Junior Engineers as well as Engineering Cadets reporting to the Engineering department | 10 - 300, depends on ship size

&amp;nbsp;

**4. Military:**
The Military Department is only available on warships. These hard men and women mainly handle the combat capability of the vessel, they operate and maintain weapon and shield systems as well as any combat vehicles. Large warships like the Hercules also transport a great number of troops meant for invasion and/or force projection.

Position | Description | # of crew
---|---|----
General On Board / Chief Military Officer | On military warships, the general - while technically is under the command of the Captain - is in fact a part of the Military. As such he / she represents the Military on board the ship and report directly to a different, higher chain command, hence the name ""General On Board"" (GOB). Military orders are often classified and sometimes can even contradict with directives from the Captain. On private military / mercenary ship, this position is simply called Chief Military Officer. The GOB is often third-in-command and assumes command of the whole ship in the absence or incapacitation of the Captain and the Chief Officer. | 1

31ipa3,2,2015-04-05,Internship abroad (Belgium to USA),Gundersanne,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/31ipa3/internship_abroad_belgium_to_usa/,"I am a Belgian student IT, and currently on track for a BS in the same. In spring 2017 I'll have to complete an internship, after which I'll graduate and obtain my degree. I'd like to do this internship in the US, specifically in the Dallas/ft.worth/Austin area.

I have studied visas, organizations, scholarships etc. extensively, and contacted my college's international department, though going outside the EU isn't very common. I've also started scanning internship sites regularly.

Is it feasible at all to obtain an internship in the USA as a student? Especially if I'll have to do most of the work myself, since most organizations here focus on college education and not internships in the USA or focus on PhD students for research etc.

I also have questions concerning the timing: a lot of internships sites list internships (those that don't exclude international applicants) that take place a couple of months later. But as an international student obtaining a visa, arranging the trip and housing takes time. So I wonder if it is a good idea to contact them directly as well, since the time-frame when applying via internship sites is not very workable. Will my email/letter (including resume and stating my ambition) just get binned?

edit.: if there are subreddits more suitable for this question please let me know

I'm in the second last year of my undergrad studying comp sci and stats. Now I know that the usual advice is that one needs at least a masters to be a data scientist however I've somehow managed to secure two internship offers: one at Microsoft the other at an established startup (around 100 employees, a lot of exposure you've probably heard of them). In the past I've had a couple of software engineering internships at big tech companies.

So my questions are as follows:

* Do you think this is going to be enough to be considered for most entry level data science positions or will my lack of masters be held against me?
* As I acquire more industry experience, will my lack of graduate education still seen as a negative or eventually be ignored?
* I also have the option of graduating with a 1 year masters in comp sci (with a specialization in data science) with a single undergrad degree in comp sci. Would this be preferable over a double undergrad degree in comp sci and stats career wise?"

I am a grad student from a top school, got an internship offer from LinkedIn, and I liked the people and the project, I was happy and accepted it. 

It is 3 months long, They gave me accommodation, which would be shared ( 2 bed 2 bathroom apartment), which I thought was fine I am happy to share an apartment, I would get to know my colleagues, mix and mingle with other people in the complex, it would be good. 

Now, it turns out, we get a 2 bed 2 bathroom apartment for 4 people.... That means I have to sleep with someone in the same room. It may even be bunk beds. I don't want to sound like a brat, but I started phd in grad school after working for a while and I am 31 years old.  I have not shared a room with someone in 10 years, and this seems pretty ridiculous to me. It is also 'no overnight guests allowed', which is understandable if I am literally gonna be sleeping next to a colleague, I am not gonna bring a girl home. 

Isn't this ridiculous? I talked to people with internship at other places in SF, no one has ever heard of sharing rooms. Although I signed a contract already, I had offers from other top places and have pretty good relationships with the recruiters, I think I can get an offer back. 

I was excited for this opportunity, at the end of the day housing does not matter one's career, but I am thinking a bit bigger picture and now I am wondering if LinkedIn does not take their interns seriously...

Any thoughts?

31jcu5,2,2015-04-05,I struggle to live with my brother???,stevespringer,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/31jcu5/i_struggle_to_live_with_my_brother/,"Alright people of reddit, I need your advice on how to handle this matter. I'm a 19 year old male, and my brother is a 17 year old male. I'm a good student in a great business program, and I am also super involved with every club at university, have a large friends group, etc. I think of myself as a good kid. My brother is currently in online high school, because he essentially skipped every class in the first year and a half of traditional high school. The reason for this is because of severe social anxiety, and he has seen a counsellor a few times in the past 3 months or so. The counsellor said that he has extremely low self confidence, and he was prescribed anti-depressants. He has had these types of behaviour all his life, for example, even now he wakes up around 11 every day and then takes a nap at 3. 

Despite his apparent issues, he destroys my quality of life in ways that don't even seem to be linked to his condition. Here are just some of the things he has done to me in just the past few weeks:
-I got home and told him I have a job interview for my DREAM summer internship. He didn't even once say good job, he just said ""well, you're not going to get it.""
-I have cooked every single meal since my parents left on vacation, yet he criticizes it EVERY time. The worst part is he thinks he's being tactful ""hey buddy, you should use a little less sausage next time""
-He absolutely berated me for spending $80 of the money my parents left us on a few meals for myself and two nights out. Yet I mentioned how he refused to go on a trip with my grandpa who already booked a $700 flight for him, and he just flipped out. Or how he bought 4 $60 ps4 games on my parents credit card.
-When I almost started crying during Furious7 (paul walker was my hero growing up) he said ""ugggh don't do this, shut up""
-Literally scolds me for everything I do. I was leaning forward in the BACK ROW of the movie theatre and he tells me to lean back.
-my dad, me, and my brother went out for a nice dinner before they left. There was a fucking piece of wood or plastic in our dessert, and the waitress claimed it was a ""pit"" and didn't comp us the dessert or anything, despite the fact that we were paying $35 a plate for dinner. This was a chocolate cake, which obviously doesn't have pits. When me and my dad were complaining about the poor service to each other in the car ride home, my brother flipped out on both of us.

My dad literally said ""your brother doesn't like you, you have to realize that and stop sucking in to it."" The hard part is that even though he doesn't show it, my brother NEEDS me. I'm basically his only contact with the real world outside of my parents and his one friend. He literally leaves the house about once a week. The weird part is he is crazy hard on me and my family, yet everyone else can literally step on his shoes and he wouldn't even say a word. Frankly, I usually try to get out of the house a lot because he just bothers me. The sad part is that he is actually hyperathletic and very smart. "

Ideally, I'd like to have my github looking good by the end of 1st semester (December/January) Which kind of projects should I go for? 

Just to give a background on my experiences, last summer, I developed an Android app that had to do with image display and manipulation, so I was mostly coding in Java for the app while formatting using xml. This summer I will be primarily using C# (which I've had experience with before) to develop a web app and communicate with a GPS module, in order to add some data to a database(SQL).

I have looked into many research positions around my university, but many of them do not pay more than $15.00 an hour. Now 15.00 an hour is by no means poverty level, but I am wondering if I can do better considering that many of friends had UG internships that paid $30.00 ( engineering fields). Also from what I have seen in glassdoor (with limited research), it is hard to break that 50k without a masters or phD. 

What kind of salary/wage can I negotiate for entry level position? I can present myself as a person with high scientific aptitude, great teamwork experience, and someone committed to a mission. But as far as concrete and hard skill goes, I am not working with much (no engineering skills, no CS skills, no higher degree)

What's a good direction for me if I only have a bachelor right now? 

I appreciate any help and criticism! "

31jwvb,5,2015-04-05,TIFU by being an inept fool at my internship.,the-odd-one,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/31jwvb/tifu_by_being_an_inept_fool_at_my_internship/,"So this happened about two years ago. I was a fresh faced law student back then and I had been offered a pretty great internship in the government sector that would basically be magic dust to my CV. 
Needless to say I wanted to prove that I really really belonged there. 
So my daily work consisted of researching and a great big amount of  inputting new cases and their respective legal arguments etc into the database. Two months go by and I'm really looking like a model employee and the epitome of efficiency until this one day I go to my cubicle,  enter my password and the pc doesn't log in. I had a lot of stuff to do that day so I try twice, thrice and no luck. 
Now I'm pretty pissed that HR has changed the password on my pc already.(I was due to end my internship that week). So I tell my supervisor and she sends me to HR to sort it out. I go to HR and basically I just insult them on their ineptness. They follow me to my cubicle and tell me to log in. Again I can't log in. This happens about two times in front of them. So they send me to tech support. Again, I'm pretty curt and snarky and tech support is unable to help me. They say that they didn't change the password and that maybe I should try it with CAPS off. Again, I talk down to them for thinking I hadn't thought of that already.
This happens for the rest of the day and when I get home I'm effing pissed.
Fast forward to the next day. I type in my password and I'm signed in. That is when I realized I was using my personal laptop's password on the pc.
Now everyone from tech support to the office clerk happens to know about the whole fiasco and they are naturally curious about my ability to miraculously get the pc to work. I think they all probably figyred it out and were too kind to say anything. 
That was the last day I went to work. I took four paid leaves and never returned to the place.
TL;DR I screwed up. Was a bitch about it. Avoided the place like the plague afterwards.

31jxed,2,2015-04-05,"CS Junior Questioning Coding Skills, Internship, Life",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/31jxed/cs_junior_questioning_coding_skills_internship/,"I am a CS Junior with an internship/part-time job near my school. I've worked there part-time during the semester so far (2/3 months or so) and all I've written are a few unit-test methods. Although there is an office with hardware engineers, other interns, some admin staff, etc, the office is really new, so all of our software mentors/managers are off in a different state. This sucks. Although we communicate frequently, (often we'll have multiple hour skype sessions with our manager) it still makes it hard to develop code, especially when we end up with unclear assignments working in unfamiliar frameworks. 

Anyway, I'm a little dissatisfied. I took the job because I need to make a lot of money to pay for college, and it's near my college and pays really well. Additionally, working there during the school year is very helpful financially as well.

So here's my quandry: I'm worried that, although this internship is helpful financially, it's setting me back by not giving me appropriate experience.


I'm worried about my abilities as a programmer. I frequently worry that I've ""slipped through the cracks"" and should have been weeded out freshman year. I do okay in school. My GPA is something like a 3.3 and my CS GPA is similar (it would be higher, but I failed a Data Abstraction class soph. year due to clinical Major Depression and my own dumbassery) but I just don't feel like I'm good enough at programming. I want to work on a side project, but I have almost no free time in which to do so. I haven't written a full application end-to-end by myself since freshman year, when I wrote a MUD.


I'm worried that I'll graduate, find myself unable to get, or satisfactorily perform at, a software engineering gig, and then...well, who knows?

I came in to college as a potential English major. I've always rocked literature, and I still have professors who try to get me to switch over to English. But, even money aside, I don't want to do English. I want to write code. But I'm worried that I'm falling behind and lack some intrinsic quality that's going to prevent me from doing what I really want to.


So: how can I make the most of my situation? Should I try to find a new software internship? What should I know and be able to do at this point in my education? What can I do to get better? Should I just jump ship and go in to...advertising, or some shit?"

I am already a sophomore and haven't gotten much of a start on the degree (I just decided on it recently), so I am a bit behind schedule. 

In order to get a BS, I would need to extend my time in school by a semester or 2. So my question is, would it be worth the extra time, money, and effort (including some very high level math and physics classes) in order to get a BS? I am still not sure what I want to do with my degree and I've been getting conflicting advice from various people. I have also heard that things like a portfolio of projects, internships, grades, and CompSci ability/knowledge will be much more important than which of these degrees I have. I would be especially interested to hear from people with these degrees or people hiring other people with these degrees. Thanks for reading and for the advice!

TL;DR: Is a BS degree worth spending an extra semester or 2 in school beyond my 4 years?"

 I am currently a CS student at the University of Washington. I have only finished my intro computer science courses, which involved only java. I feel pretty strong in java though. I have knowledge in JavaScript, psql, and html from self study, and basic linux sys admin stuff through one job I had in high school. I have applied for about 20 internships in Seattle, CA and NC. I have gotten denied by Google (not surprised there), and I was denied by Blizzard Entertainment. I am not restricting myself to only big named companies. I have applied to several start ups too. I have solved entry level java interview questions at home without much struggle. It would be nice if these places would email me back with at least a polite rejection. A family friend (who is a senior software engineer) even passed my resume over to a manager at a well known company who is looking for an intern, it's been over a week and he  nor a recruiter has emailed me, not holding my breath on that one. I just don't understand why I am not even getting one interview. Maybe my resume is rubbing these people the wrong way? Lacking experience? Should I be calling these companies as a follow up or showing up to the corporations like I'm trying to get some high school job, I don't know? When is the best time to apply for internships? It looks like I will find some part time job and work on my personal web application this summer and try again next summer after I have more classes under my belt. Also, does going to career/internship fairs help? Haven't bothered going to any of those yet.

Thanks!!"

Hey Y'all. What do you think? My budget is 4000 dollars (scored an internship this summer :D), so I want this to be mainly a gaming setup but also for light editing work (I do photography) and programming/computation (mathematica). I'm going to replace the ROG Swift with the Acer predator when it comes out as I prefer IPS monitors to TN.. does anyone know when it comes out?

How do you forgive yourself when you made am awful mistake and struggle with constant rumination?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/31kfsl/big_time_regret_how_do_you_forgive_yourself_when/,"We can turn this into a discussion about how to move past your own personal mistakes and stop ruminating, or just vent about things we feel bad about doing in a moment of mental weakness. I just need to find some semblance of comfort in perhaps relating to another person over something I did that I am struggling to forgive myself for. The constant rumination is interfering with my day to day productivity. 

11 months ago, I attended a my boyfriend's cousin's wedding. My boyfriend and I had been together for 4 years at the time of the wedding, and his whole family was in attendance.

During the wedding ceremony all I could think was how I wish they'd hurry it up because I needed a DRINK. The years leading up to this incident had ""driven me to drink"", because I did not have a healthy coping mechanism in place for my depression, and I had a whole bunch of really sh*tty no good things happen in short succession (more on that below). During the reception I drank hard and I drank fast, I blacked out, and when I came to again, I was crying in the back of a cab that was taking my boyfriend and me back our hotel. 

I love dancing at weddings, I'm usually one of the first and last off the dance floor. Apparently (I was blacked out, this is a re-telling by my boyfriend's sister) what happened was that I had been talking to an uncle of the bride. I guess I wanted to dance, so we did, which my boyfriend's family got really really upset over. They described me as ""grinding"" with this person. I cringe when I think of how embarrassing I must have been. His family was understandably furious with me in the immediate blow-out wanted us to break up. 

My boyfriend is my best friend on this planet, as soon I was sober enough to process the situation, I was devastated. That was my wake-up call, and my butt was in an AA meeting not 72 hours later. I have since stopped drinking completely and have no plans to return to it. I have taken every step I could think of to make it up to my boyfriend, who forgives me, and worked really hard to manage my emotions so as not to burden him with them any longer.

His family is mostly over it at this point, too. Its has taken a long time, though. The real problem is I can't forgive myself. I think about what an awful person I am for this every single day. I think about the awful things his family called me in the immediate aftermath in their anger, and it stings. I believe those things very deeply about myself now and I find it difficult to forgive myself and to face his family.

The 2 years leading up to this incident were long periods of major depression and drawn-out semesters alone struggling to keep my head above water, sprinkled with the a few extremely traumatic events. This time fundamentally changed me as an individual. I don't wish to excuse my behaviour, but just for some context, here were the 18 months leading up to the incident. The fact that I was suffering a major depressive episode and panic attacks this whole time is just a given: 

1) I was attending school in a city 7 hours away from my lifelong friends and boyfriend (my de facto family);

2) I was struggling emotionally and financially (slowly incurring $100k in student loans, law school is expensive);

3) I'd been offered a job after working really hard at an unpaid legal internship, only to have the job offer redacted months later when it was too late to find a different summer job;

4) My mother and I stopped being on speaking terms, and after a lifetime of emotional abuse, I disowned her; 

5) In July 2013 I was camping on Lake Megantic with my cousin. We took a trip to a favourite childhood spot, Baie des Sables, QC. There was a crude oil train derailment on the 4th day of our vacation about 10--15kms away in nearby Lac-Megantic. Many people died and we could hear and see the explosions from our campsite. We could smell the oil too, and could for weeks afterwards, even after we left. 

6) In February 2014 I was involved in a hit-and-run in Ottawa and sustained a soft tissue injury, which kept me out of school and in bed for many weeks, and to this day I have days when I feel like my mobility is limited by my back. My colleague and I obtained the license plate of the driver responsible, but because he was from Quebec, and the accident happened on the Ontario side of the provincial boundary, the police could not be arsed to do anything about it. He was never charged. I don't even think they looked into it. 

7) I started to have PTSD flashbacks, and nightmares about my mother, and it felt like reality was slipping through my finger tips like sand and there was nothing I could do about it. So I drank, and drank harder than I ever have, for those 2 years. When a new catastrophe would happen, I upped the ante. Near the end of what I now recognize as alcoholism, I was blackout drunk 2 or 3 nights a week.  

*In a nutshell: I am a major depressive, have PTSD symptoms, and I am a recovering alcoholic, 11 months ago I got too drunk at my boyfriend's cousin's wedding, and was ""grinding"" with the bride's uncle, and despite making every effort since to improve myself and redeem myself to my boyfriend and his family, I can't forgive myself. I ruminate about this event every single day* "

However, on top of this, I've had to deal with depression and anxiety, a horrible apartment situation in the first half of the year, and the death of a friend. 
At the moment, I feel like a total failure because, despite my efforts to secure an internship, I've been unable to get any interviews for those I've applied to. I went into this whole process with tempered optimism and a strong head on my shoulders, but now as I apply to more I'm finding myself petrified of rejection, which is making it difficult for me to reach out to people and actually write the cover letters and resumes that would help me secure a position. What makes things even worse is that I will be studying abroad next semester and need to earn a lot of money as well as gain relevant experience over the summer to ensure the semester is a success. Because of these difficulties, I'm finding that I'm pushing away loved ones, really resenting those I care about, and that I'm just generally really down.
I know I need to regroup and refocus if I'm going to get anything done and stop ""spiralling"", as my partner put it. So, my question to you is this: Can you offer me any support or advice in dealing with these feelings of failure and uselessness as I apply for internships?"

I'm now almost done with my junior year of college and realizing that joining a fraternity in the beginning of my freshman year was the worst decision ever. Now I don't know what to do because I'm finally taking action to do something about this but I just feel like starting over with a month left in my junior year is such a daunting task...

I had some great friends my freshman year. It was a group of about six of us. I had a girl that things were progressing really well with. Then I joined a fraternity. Things didn't go badly at first but I started drifting away. I got one of my friends to come along with me but the rest joined other fraternities or remained unaffiliated. I stupidly turned down an opportunity to live with them because I thought living in the fraternity house would be great.

The comes my sophomore year. I become increasingly isolated from everyone but those in my fraternity. It seemed nice, getting closer with my brothers, but late in the year I woke up from the trance and realized that apart from smoking, drinking, and classes, what was I surrounding myself with these people for? I couldn't answer it but I was too much of a bitch to do anything about it.

I ended up doing an internship program that summer and made some great friends there. I got a girlfriend. This started my process of getting away from my fraternity a bit. And I was never happier. I started making friends through other avenues at my school. Tried to reconnect with old friends but because of already having three different social circles (friends from my internship program going to school within an hour radius, non-fraternity ""friends"", fraternity ""friends"", and my girlfriend) it was just too difficult to deal with balancing so many different connections and not ditching one too often.

Then, me and my girlfriend broke up. On the very same day, I got bombarded with shit from my ""brothers"" about it and I think that was the final straw. Yeah, a few were there for me a bit but overall, I just felt so lost, like I wasn't even valued. And I say this is the final straw because it was a whole chain of events leading to this. Anyways, I've made the decision to do whatever I can to move out of the fraternity house next year, regardless of who I have to live with.

But now comes my next problem. I've spent the past two and a half years isolating myself from everyone, supposedly forming connections with my brothers while everyone developed their own groups of friends. Well now? I feel like I'm just an acquaintance to everyone, or at least a side friend rather than in any particular group, if that makes any sense. 

So my question is... what do I do? I want a group of friends who I actually relate to, one of the biggest problems with my fraternity. But how do I do it? How do I force myself into other friend groups that have been formed over years? I'm not exactly the most charismatic or extroverted person but I get along well with people and do have friends, just not a group, which is what I'm so desperately seeking now that I have come to the full realization that I'm incompatible with my fraternity. I just need some help... do I come clean and tell friends that I'm lonely? Or will that just push them away? I really don't know and it sucks.

tl;dr: How to join friend groups after realizing the last 2 1/2 years of being in a fraternity just wasn't working when I basically have individual friends and more secondary friend groups?"

I am currently a senior Neuroscience major that will graduate this May 2015. However, the fields of work and graduate level opportunities that are the most easily accessible for my major do not interest me. I already have experience in sales and neuroscience research, and I do not like both of those fields. I also don't want to apply to Med school, Dental school, or those various professional schools just yet. 

I have always had an interest in working with computers and obtaining an advanced skillset in an area of information technology or computer science, but I have not taken any courses or work experience related to that. How feasible would it be for me to get an information technology internship or entry job without having any direct skills that apply to them? I have seen alot of information technology internships on indeed.com, but they all seem to require previous coursework experience or job experience, which is hard for me to get at the moment. How can I market my skills to obtain an opportunity in this field?"

I have anxiety issues and the only thing that's been helping me hold it together is knowing we would be together, finally, and able to move forward with our relationship, also finally, this summer.

I've saved up a couple grand. I've applied for sixteen internships. I've done every single little thing I needed to make this whole life thing work. He'd has said for the past year if he was making enough money to do it, he'd be ready this summer. 

He's got a big boy job making decent money and can afford to move out. But he says just doesn't want to live paycheck to paycheck. And I guess he doesn't understand that's how this kind of works when you're starting out.

I have a month and a half left before I have to move out there and we haven't even started looking at places. And now I'm freaking out because I might have to live with some craigslist strangers just to be able to do the internship. He breaks this whole thing on me four days after my grandma dies and I feel like I can't say anything because it will start a fight and I need a ride to the airport Thursday so I can go to my grandmother's funeral.

I'm trying to deal with all of this while also going to internship interviews which are so competitive and high pressure, finishing my research proposal, and getting ready for final exams and final projects. 

I feel like I'm about to lose it. It feels like this whole plan I had for our future is falling apart and all I can do is just watch because it's totally out of my control."

I am a foreign student doing a 5+ months internship in NYC. A couple weeks ago I moved in an house. A couple lives upstairs that I don't know. I live in a separate room downstairs and I share the kitchen and bathroom with a married couple who are only tenants, they do not own the place.

I have paid (and have receipts) for the ending of March, April, and a one month deposit. We haven't signed any agreement yet because the girl wanted time to draft it. She has drafted an agreement  ""from March 21st to August 31st"". I told her that in case one of us wanted me to move out, she should add a part stating that we would have to give a 2 months notice (to give me time to find another place and give them time to find a new roommate). She agreed to this but said she would have the agreement on Monday.

Now I'm having doubt about all this for several reasons : the couple are not very nice, they fight a lot (they're probably separating from what I understand), there is an unfixed dog that is not really easygoing (constantly tries to jump me, or bite my feet even if it's in a playful manner), etc. My question is, if I want to move out, what happens if :

* we still don't have an agreement (can they kick me out ? even if I already paid April + deposit ?)
* we have an agreement ""from March 21st to August 31st"" (can I even move out ? In which case how much of a notice do I need to give ? Will I have to pay for the whole ~6 months ?)
* we have an agreement stating that I have to give 2 months notice (can they kick me out vefore 2 months ? even if I already paid April + deposit ?)

31l4nv,6,2015-04-05,The Alaska Trip,BeyondAReason,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/31l4nv/the_alaska_trip/,"This story has happened about a year ago, but I feel that it summarizes my nmom and my relationship with her. Also, I have never posted here so I just wanted to share an interesting tale and hopefully get some advice for how I can deal with someone crazy like her or what I can do to help my brother and stop my nmom from ruining her own future so I won’t have to pay for her mistakes later.

Enter, the Alaska Trip:

Last year, in the middle of winter, my nmom received her pension money from working 10+ years at a hospital. She chose to get her pension as a lump sum, which enabled her to get a ton of money all at once, while being taxed higher. Don’t know how much she got (she refused to tell me), but I imagine it was a pretty large sum of money. 

To put things into perspective, my nmom hasn’t worked for over the past 10 years because she has been taking care of my younger brother with autism, which is what she said god told her to do. She also acquired 1 or 2 spinal injuries/disabilities, which she uses as an additional reason to not go back to work. Also, my ndad is out of the picture since he has been divorced from my nmom for over 10 years and doesn’t really give two shits about me and my brother. He is also tired of paying child support on us since he’s been paying for over a decade - and that has basically been all the income my nmom has been getting. So we are poor, on part by my nmom’s decision to basically withdraw from society and stop working because it isn’t “what God wants her to do”. 

But I digress - the first thing my nmom decided to do with the new sum of cash was to plan for a cruise to Alaska in the middle of July. Even better, the cruise features her favorite pastor that she watches on T.V. all the time instead of going to church and interacting with the community and other people like a normal human being. Only thing is - the trip is just a bit beyond my nmom’s budgetary constraints, given she were to use her pension money that was meant to be used to help sustain her through her retirement - like 3,000 f*cking dollars per person for this one week cruise. But it doesn’t matter, because she believes with all her heart that Judgement Day is nigh and that we won’t ever get a chance to go on a vacation like this ever again. My nmom wants us all to be saved and repent to god for all our sins else I will suffer for all of ETERNITY in the lake of fire yadayadayada (she recycles the same speech every time I’m around her) so that we can all go to heaven and be happy together with God and my brother’s autism cured.

She asks me through email if I want to go to the cruise (I am in college, thankfully away from her). I say no, it’s a waste of money and I need to work (since I was getting a summer internship). She doesn’t listen to me. For the next several weeks, my nmom called and texted me repeatedly on what I need to do to prepare for the trip. I told her that I didn’t want to go and not to get tickets for me, but she still tries to convince me otherwise. Nmom bugs me to get a passport and sends money for the passport. I tell her that I am not getting a passport. Several times, I have thought that it might be an interesting trip to attend to. The cruise offered other attractions too, including whale watching, zip lining, and visiting local towns in Alaska- much more interesting stuff than listening to sermons. Not to mention I have never been on a cruise before and have never traveled so far away from home within this finite planet. Minus the pastoral aspect of the cruise, since I am not religious (and I have told my nmom this before but she doesn’t listen to me so why did I bother in the first place), I would have considered going. But my nmom was literally trying to force me to go on this cruise with her and my brother didn’t get a say in the matter because he doesn’t understand my nmom’s financial situation. 

Then there was one day when my nmom walked into my job at college and told me what tickets she was going to get for the cruise and to let her know if I didn’t want to go. She wouldn’t listen to me and I literally had to yell I DON’T WANT TO GO TO THE ALASKA TRIP to her. But she still didn’t get it. Around a week later, my nmom sent me an email saying about my confirmed trip to Alaska. I replied back that I AM NOT GOING ON THE CRUISE. She then replied back, and I quote word for word [without grammatical edits either] because I have this email message thread saved to this day:
“You just wasted my money,3260 dollars for cruise,466 dollars for airplane and 120 dollars for 1 night hotel at seattle,total 3846 dollars for your share. because I have to call and  cancel on Monday.”

Her response made me swell with anger. How could my nmom be so short sighted and so stupid? And blaming me for wasting her money on buying the tickets for the cruise? Ugh. I can’t even. She could have saved all that money for far more productive things. I expressed to her back saying (word for word again): 
“No, you wasted your own money because you refused to listen to me telling you repeatedly ahead of time that I didn't want to go on the cruise to Alaska.”

Her response after my response:
“it's not a matter of listen,your problem of self centered selfish turned out you think your summer job and spending time with [boyfriend] is more important than your own family...Then,
why you are  not listening to me?  working,studying and spending time with b.f .    if these are all your life style ,go ahead ,knock yourself out. I hope you saved...God knows your heart and mind.”

I’ve been going through this subreddit and I have come to the conclusion that my mom is a nmom and is nuts and needs to go to a mental hospital. The longer I stay away from my nmom, the better my mental state becomes. I have had many other equally ridiculous incidents with my nmom refusing to acknowledge anything I say and refusing to understand me as an individual and listen to me-while she goes off regurgitating the same religious speech (because she cares about me) repeatedly for hours on end. It is all it takes for me to develop self-esteem problems through the years of living with her and for my day to go to shit.

After we broke up I had a really hard time learning to trust people, specifically men, again. I've also been working on myself over the last two years, losing weight, becoming more outgoing, strengthening the friendships I already have, etc. I never really decided to get back into the dating scene, and being gay and young really makes it hard to find someone who wants a serious relationship and not just a couple flings.

I actually met him at an internship I was at, we hit it off right away and became friends very quickly. He's 28 and I'm 23, I thought the age gap was going to be a hinderance in our friendship, but it actually brought us closer together since he was way more mature and we both had similar mindsets. I'm not going to bore you with the progression of our relationship, but we started going out on 'official' dates about a month ago and I'm loving it.

It feels amazing to have someone that loves you romantically and doesn't hold disdain towards you, or call you fat, or hold you down and force *it* into you, or gaslight you, it's absolutely a foreign concept to me.

 I'm just so happy that I found someone who doesn't treat me like shit, and who actually shows interest in me. He's the sweetest guy, we have a lot in common and the same sense of humour, and he's also my exact type.

I'm a current senior in undergrad (graduating Dec. 2015), and I'm starting to think about pursuing a graduate degree. 

I'm studying at a good school, not T1 but pretty good and we'll respected, and I've been doing quite well. I have a lot of teaching assistant positions as well as industry internships. 

I have a few concerns with going straight into industry. The first is that I do not know what subset of computer science is what makes me tick. And the second is that I'm worried that I would be bored with my work. 
My cousin works at one of the top tech companies in the world, and when I moat recently asked him about if he's working on anything interesting, he basically said that his work was quite boring. 

My professors have told me that if I get a graduate degree, when I move into industry I would work on more interesting projects and be challenged a lot more. Have people found this to be the case? 

On the other hand, I  won't have the chance to get any research experience while in undergrad. Thus, I am worried that I might not enjoy research once I am exposed to it. 

I guess my main question is this, would lacking a graduate degree block me out of upward mobility and/or interesting projects?

I'm e-filing using online free-to-file software for the first time, and I'm trying to understand how my refund's being calculated. I'm young and new to filing my taxes, so I apologize if this is a foolish question!

Background - 
- I worked a traditional job for part of the year, earned ~$22,700 as reported on a W-2

- I also completed an internship with a non-profit organization that paid me a stipend that was not taxed. I received a 1099-MISC form for my income of ~$3000 with this organization. I understand I will be taxed on this income, and from what I've read it's considered 'self-employment income' thus taxed at a rate of ~15%. 

So here's the question - when I used the filing software, I first entered W-2 income &amp; tax withheld. My federal refund was estimated to be $900. After I added the 'schedule C' reporting of my 1099-MISC, my refund estimate plummeted to $70.

From what I understand, the ~15% tax on my $3000 stipend should be roughly $450, so I would understand why my refund might be reduced by  $450. But my refund estimate is reduced by more than $800 when I factor in my 1099 earnings. Could anyone explain to me what's going on / why there is such a dramatic reduction?

Today I noticed that my computer is reporting 12gb of ram, even though I've only upgraded to 8gb in the last 6 months or so. [Speccy](https://imgur.com/JtQ41r4) however reports 8gb.

Then again this is a 4 year old HDD we're talking about so it could be dying too.


In addition, the audio port on the back of my motherboard stopped working, and occasionally (rarely) I get ""kernel power errors"", as said by event manager. That is, my computer just freezes. Mouse stops working, keyboard doesn't work, everything frozen in place. The only way to remedy it is by hard restarting the computer.


The thing is a trusty steed otherwise. Last summer I put in an R9 270x and new ram, and have no issue playing the games I want to play on mid-high settings. I'm just a little worried about this motherboard. 790x is pretty ancient as it is, and I'm stuck on old sata which means I don't get full speed on my SSD. Would you say these signs are signs of a motherboard soon to die? Are there any tests that I should run to affirm this?

1) How do hours work? Are there a set amount of hours that they expect you to fulfill every week? How do they keep track of these hours? Is it a ""clock-in"" type thing where I have to be in the office or SSH'd from 8-5?

2) Does UIUC pay for housing if I am doing research at the school? If not is there some kind of stipend?

3) Is it feasible to do 2 research positions at 2 different labs at once? How about an internship and a research position?"
31lpzl,0,2015-04-06,Do you feel this way ??,[deleted],intj,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/31lpzl/do_you_feel_this_way/,"Hello Intj's, longtime lurker here.

I don't need help over depression or suicide, it's that i get too logical about thinking and i end to a painful conclusion that both death and life are painfully logical and different things. What i suffer won't go away with death cuz i can't be sure what goes or stays after my last breath. then again there's the thought where i feel the things i'm doing in life is nowhere close to oblivion or anything, like edison created the bulb but i'm just running a factory reproducing his creation, i'm never gonna be edison.

The only thing that wants me to stay is the responsibility of my mother. She was staying alone after a 25 year marriage(a very painful and cruel one) for the last 4 years and i was all the while only carrying on with life because i knew i had to take care of her. I stay in India, and i was at a boarding school in Yercaud which was built on a hill, 7 years ago cuz i couldn;t stand the fights between mom and dad at home. and i decided to drop off there, moved to a concrete-rubmling city of bangalore, greased through college, moved to mumbai where my dad was, leaving my mom alone in bangalore, i get cautious and move to Florida, where my dad's-brothers-wife's-dad stayed, retired as you know war vet, listened to his stories, one day he told me to move on cuz i have lots of shit to take care of. i moved to San francisco 3 months later, it was the first time in life i foud like minded people in plenty and wanted to do things and act rebel and stuff, but i stayed away cuz i couldn't help but notice i was an outisider. But, i got a job as an intern at some magazine company, later found a company that had just wanted i wanted. They wanted to have an office set up in bangalore, so i walked in there, get a QA job, move to bangalore with two other folks from sf 8 months later, set up office, trained 10 ppl, managed them, a year later fired them, cuz they had to shut it down. I still work part time for them from home. All the while i was the typical intj, i never had many friends, i was the one who friendzoned women and avoided people who actually wanted to hang around. I went into a deep heroin addiction for 3 months in SF ,i had found some punk music lovers (later discovered they were pure skinheads) who i got along with very well, i got into fights, broke my lips and jaws once, got my ears scarred with me challenging someone to dip a lit ciggarette to my left-ear for 10 seconds, i still won't say that was bad, i learnt the most in life during my addiction now that i look back 2 years. but i picked myself up, had two or three visits with a psychiatrist, thats when i found i was intj. now i'm in india, where the drugs are 60% pure or laced with toxics so i keep away using this as an excuse. and my country doesn't have psychiatrists, what they prescribe is mostly things they're unsure of (good ones all go to 'murica :D)  


My dream is to be either a musician, a philosophy teacher or businessman. I'm pursuing things i need to do to get all the three while i'm working a 9-5 job. Dad, now wants to get together and honestly there was nothing too bad between him and me, it was all cuz mom couldn;t stay with them. she's ok with moving back, infact i just got back a few hours ago from meeting him. i hadn't spoken to him in 3 years. The person who handles the recording studio told me last week i'm good enough to start, last week was my first real music project i'm working on. I can beat anyone down on an arugument over philosophy, so much once i was told i resemble the guy from into the wild. I'm good with numbers, i have bought wholesale stuff like floor cleaning chemicals off markets, repackaged with a flashing packaging and sold it, i only did this for two months when i was searching for a job and had no money on me with just mom and me. But now, since i see dad doing good enough to take care of her, i find no reason in being anything, like i said, i can't be ""edison"", i can't be teaching something that's never been taught, i'm just scratching walls already built. When i shrug off my timidness in dating, i find women with prerequisites, which leads me to think somewhere someone may just fulfill all she wants cuz she's a woman, i can't be sure if i'll love her the most ever. If you're wondering, i'm 22 and you can picture me from the indian kid in Life of Pi.


More than advice on not to suicide, i wanna say, isn't this a crazy fucking world ? Does me, drinking the water thats hardly left on the planet and eating shit someone else longs for is worth what i do. agree that, i'm better off than most, but does it really matter, so equally, to anyone else but me ?

Thanks for reading guys, Think You Think Me!

To preface this the internship was looking for python which I only truly have basic knowledge, which I admitted to in my cover letter. 

After about two weeks I got an email from their head of engineering asking me to complete a coding challenge online email him when I was finished. The challenge was to parse urls into their protocol, host, and uri manually without using any modules like urlparse or urllib that did this for you. Well the short story is I completely botched the challenge, and did not submit a correct (or even near correct) solution. 

This was all unbeknownst to me until I received another email from him that said I had not submitted a valid solution but asked me if I wanted to give it another shot. I of course did, and this time I submitted a correct solution (or so I believe). 


**TL/DR:** Botched online coding challenge for internship, given second chance.   

So my long winded question is: Did I completely screw up my chances by botching the first attempt, or should I take solace in that I was given a second chance, and hope that means they are interested in me?"

I've been really busy over this past week, lots of work. Feeling lots of pressure to get an internship, get a job, do well, whatever. All that jazz. Swamped with work too, I have multiple projects due this month and an essay due tomorrow, and I really have no idea how it's going to work out. My transfer app is due soon, but I'll try to get that pounded out tonight.

I have my second meeting with a counselor tomorrow. I'm not sure if it's necessary so much anymore. I've stopped having panic attacks, and although I haven't quite reached pre-Nationals levels, I'm doing okay. I think things may be exacerbated by the insane pile of work I have on my back. Actually, that may be a good deal of it. I've finally managed to fall asleep at night, although my sleep schedule is understandably skewed after the events of the past few days.

Still feel down every now and then, although for the most part I'm reasonably happy. Still functional. Can't express how glad I am to have friends around me who make me feel like they actually like having me around. I don't even talk to Alvin or Tina at all these days. The friends who are worth having generally tend to stick around. Things will work out the way they're meant to.

I was talking with the kids in my BA324 class, and I figured out I wasn't alone. They've all eclipsed my relationship in terms of length; 3 years here, 5 years there. That's insane. I don't know how they manage to pull through, they are very strong people and I have genuine respect for them because of it. John is also a really strong guy. Stoic as fuck. He still talks to his ex, apparently. Not sure how healthy that is, but I think his judgment is better than mine, I don't have the requisite information to make that call.

I'm looking forward to next semester and what comes ahead. I think that there's still a lot waiting for me, if I get my head out of my ass. Cautiously optimistic is still the attitude I guess. Lot of tension, lot of stress, still dark thoughts every now and then, but I think I can make it through. I'll come out bigger and better and everybody who's ever turned my back on me will find that to have been a poor decision on their part. If you kick me and leave me when I'm down, well... don't expect kind treatment from this sector.

I think I can do this. I can do this because you guys are with me. Thank you so much. I won't forget those of you who were there for me, and let those who weren't pass into forgotten shadows."
31maru,14,2015-04-06,[Question] How do you go about being completely independent from your family?,nomadskills,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/31maru/question_how_do_you_go_about_being_completely/,"For the past 6 months, and for the exception of brief periods of sickness and/or depression, I've been working extremely hard; both at work/internship and on myself. I've also managed to take care of various family issues, increase income, and generally fulfill my social obligations. Unfortunately, none of this was appreciated. In fact, I've been getting the feeling that my mother is manipulatively pushing me away.

If you take out the last 3 months, I haven't even been living with my family because I lived in a different city for college for a few years. I've always preferred living away from them anyway. It was only after my father's death that I felt obligated to spend more time with them for my younger siblings' sake and to take care of things. And I'm all for doing it again but this time for good, hopefully.

I'm no stranger to living by myself. I'm aware that the transition may be harder this time because I want to go to a new city. Plus the fact that I won't be going back home as frequently as I used to back in college. I also need to address the issue of financial independence. 

I just quit my part-time, borderline-illegal job of 1+ month because I was leaving the city anyway and because of the fact the I got paid practically nothing for slaving away for hours in a terrible place. This led me to believe that getting a decently paid job that I can sustain myself with might be harder than I expected. And I worry about exhausting my very limited resources in the process of starting over in a completely new city. 

**TL;DR**: My goal is to finish my dental internship (6 more months to go) in another city, be as financially independent from my family as possible, and plan my get-out of the country in the process.


I know that it's something I have to figure out on my own but any tips or advice from people who achieved similar goals are highly appreciated.

 The interview took more than an hour and it consisted mostly of the interviewer explaining what they did and how fun it was to work there.
 I answered all the questions and they said my resume was impressive and that they would be in contact and that i would probably have to come in again because the ceo had the last say on hiring. 
I sent them an email later, explaining how excited i was for the opportunity and that i would definately want to come in again.
So far I haven't heard a word from them.

 Should i send an email again, expressing my interest in both internship and marketing position or has the ship sailed?

I'm a 27yo working on my 4th university degree, in marketing.but i have zero experience in that field, only ten years experience as a salesman and department head of a store. Has the time for internships simply passed for me?

31n295,27,2015-04-06,10 Questions you should ask every recruiter you speak with.,Pippen1984,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/31n295/10_questions_you_should_ask_every_recruiter_you/,"As a bit of background, I used to work in the university system as a teaching assistant, recruiter and administrator. I frequently had face-to-face interaction with prospective students. Invariably, I'd get questions about the required G.P.A., what test scores they were looking for, etc. Fair enough. I do think, though, prospective students need more information, and they're not getting it. Here are 10 questions I think you should be asking: 


*1: ""When was the curriculum last overhauled/updated?"" 


This should be priority #1. Most people think that universities are on the vanguard of their field. Truth is, except for a few programs, they are usually really out-of-date. Even top-tier schools. Since most of the non-professional schools have no need to keep-up with market trends, or employment statistics, they rely on a curriculum designed decades ago. Some were re-designed in the 1970s and 80s, some in the 1990s and some a recent as this year. Just because they have a course on andriod app development, or social media marketing doesn't mean the program is all that up to date. Find out. If they don't know, get them to find-out. 


*2: ""Who primarily teaches required courses?"" 


Increasingly, required courses (or ""core modules"") are being taught by graduate students and adjunct faculty. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, schools who are overly reliant on them as a source of instruction are often doing so because their full-time, tenured faculty are teaching at a reduced frequency. This can mean that valuable classes in a teacher's area of expertise are being taught by someone else. This can reduce the quality of your over-all education. 


*3: ""What kind of additional services do you offer your students? I'm thinking of counseling (academic), career planning, engagement/involvement.""


Many schools post banners for student politics, but are they engaged? Governments (State, Federal, Provincial, etc) often have throngs of summer internships, as do major corporations, NGOs, health care organizations, etc. Most people don't know how to access these resources. Your school should be actively involved in this. Most aren't heavily involved and students can go for 3 or even 4 years before finding-out about these options and how you can benefit!


*4: ""What are your meals plans like and what do they cost?"" 


Who cares about meal plans?! Well, many (if not most) university cafeterias are out-sourced to companies like Sodexo and Aramark. They can charge anywhere from $2,500 to $10,000 a semester for a meal plan. Now, what they term ""meal"" is a combination of food items priced at restaurant levels. The issue is that they usually don't offer comprehensive, well-balanced meals and focus rather on quick-prep items like burgers, fries and pre-made salads. Its often hard to find food that isn't extremely unhealthy, and since the cafeterias usually have reduced operating hours during holidays and weekends, people usually end-up eating garbage. The ""Freshman 15"" is often a direct consequence of a very rapid, and very poor, dietary change. If your school is offering an expensive meal plan, I recommend ensuring that you have alternative options. What's near the campus that you can use to augment your diet?


*5: ""Can I design my own major?"" 

Many, if not most colleges and universities, have that option. Often called ""Self-designed major"" or ""Special Individualized Program,"" students (usually outside of STEM) can elect to design a major of their own. It requires you maintain a specific GPA and meet very regularly with academic counselors, but can be an excellent option for those motivated enough. If you have a specific interest or goal, this may be the way for you to go. 


*6: ""What kind of campus medical services do you offer? Are they 24 hours?"" 


A big problem, not just for women, or for freshman, or people in very intense programs, or at-risk LGBT-Q students is mental health. Often, universities offer very rudimentary services. If you're very anxious, depressed or not feeling well, you need to see someone. What services do they offer? Is it referral-based? Do campus health insurance schemes cover their costs? Schools that offer an M.A. candidate from their clinical psych program often use this to cut costs and frequently don't run the gamut of (what I would call) necessary services.  Additionally, most students begin to regularly engage in sex, including oral, vaginal and anal. While it's tempting to push fate, a lot of people need more than just luck. Condoms, the pill, lubricant and some advice. Make sure the sexual health department isn't a bunch of students manning an office trying to tell you about sex (which, they've usually never engaged in.). Either an RN or an MD! Make sure they have decent services. 


*7: ""How are accommodations decided upon?""

People often ask what the accommodations are like, but not usually how they have a roommate decided for them. One of the single most stressful problems is a bad roommate. Often, people don't mesh, or they haven't lived on their own long enough to know how to be a functional individual. What you should do is find-out if you can move mid-semester and how they decide upon roommates. If it's a random draw, be leery. That's usually code for an accommodations team that isn't very active/engaged. 


*8: ""Who patrols the campus and how do you report campus-related crime?"" 

Even with the Clinton-signed amendment in the US and crime reporting in Canada, campus crime reporting varies widely and is not necessarily a great barometer of the campus environment. Often, the campus security is loathe to deal with petty crime, or aggressive students. A recruiter is giving you a song-and-dance about their ""community"", but read their crime statistics. If they seem incredibly low, be dubious. Many of these universities (often with 15,000 to 20,000 students plus faculty and staff) and have a crime rate that's 1/100th of a city of its size? Always get those statistics. If they seem too good to be true: they are.


*9: ""What kind of learning support do you offer?"" 


This is important for more people than we may think. As an example, I had a student who had a common learning disability. Her mother was getting stone-walled wherever she called and so I ended-up getting her. She didn't know what services existed, because no one had told them. Even if you don't have a learning disability, why not know? Many times people have to take classes like calculus or advanced chemistry and it may require getting some help. Yes, there can be student tutors, or there may be more comprehensive help. It's better to know how to access the resources *before* you need the help. I would also recommend if there are professional services, that they should be your first stop. 


*10: ""I want to be a (fill in goals here) and want to study (program). Is this a good idea?"" 

Ask. Ask. Ask. Many career counselors at the school can guide you. So, you want to be a doctor. Pre-med, right? WRONG. Lawyer. Pre-Law? WRONG. Much of what people think are great tracks to their goals are a mistake. Do you think that universities haven't seen ten thousand other political science graduates with a minor in Latin applying to law school? Don't do something because it may get you where you want to go. Figure-out where you want to go and how you can make it there. A great option for medicine may be Anthropology with a minor in health sciences (for instance). Maybe Russian &amp; Economics for law. There are lots of options. You have to figure-out what interests you and how you can best do it. Don't do something you may dislike because you think it's the best option. Because, it's usually the worst. "
31n4a7,7,2015-04-06,[Advice] I feel like I have the opportunity to do amazing things in life but I have no idea how to accomplish them,Sheehan7,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/31n4a7/advice_i_feel_like_i_have_the_opportunity_to_do/,"Right now I am 18 years old in the US and attending community college for Information Technology and plan to transfer soon and get a 4 year degree. However I just feel like I have the potential to do so much more. 

I feel like I got a late start in education and life in general. I was pretty bad at school starting in catholic middle school and throughout high school. I wasn't a bad kid never getting in trouble but I got abysmal grades (hence why I am in CC). Around senior year of HS I realized how stupid I was and how we only get one shot at life and I was wasting it. I have started to exercise more, read more books (Chris Hadfield's An Astronauts Guide to Life On Earth kind of inspired this post), and trying to be better at school. 

I have a lot of things I want to or could do. Part of me wants to join the Navy or Air Force and fly planes and then work for NASA because I have a huge passion for space, health is great, etc. Then the other part of me wants to work toward becoming a police officer like my dad. And then the sensible part of me wants to work in the IT field. Engineering was a thought but I am in pre-college math (because I fucked up in HS and didnt pass the placement test for math). My professors tell me I am doing great, I'm ahead of schedule by more than a month, and after next semester I will go into regular college math classes. I enjoy math and can understand it to an extent but stuff like physics and calculus scare me out of engineering because I have never taken anything close to that level of math. Will I be good at it? Will I enjoy it?

Another big factor in all of this is finances and timing. I have only done a year at CC which is about $5,000 but If I change majors to engineering this whole year, and that 5 grand, would be for nothing. I also am in a decent enough spot financially family wise where I don't get a lot of aid but I don't make enough to pay out of pocket so I am just barely passing by with the money I get from loans. 

I just really don't know where to turn. One part of me thinks I will be good at IT work and I can do it easily. The other part says well why not do something fun and take a chance at being a pilot or astronaut or in the police force? I just don't want to look back on my time here and think I should have done something else. However all of these things; NASA, military, IT, police, are so far apart and I am running out of time I just need some help here. 

On top of all that I am feeling really down because I just can't find a job right now and I really want to get an IT internship to test the waters but I can't find any wherever and who ever I talk to. I'm up the creek without a paddle here and I have no idea what to do. On top of that too today is the day where class signups start for the fall semester and I basically am out of time to decide what to do with life or at least it feels that way."

&gt;Dare to publish a scientific study against Big Biotech, and Monsanto will defame and discredit you. 

&gt;[For the first time, a Monsanto employee admits](http://gmwatch.org/index.php/news/archive/2015-articles/16046-monsanto-s-discredit-bureau-really-does-exist) that there is an entire department within the corporation with the simple task of ‘discrediting’ and ‘debunking’ scientists who speak out against GMOs.

&gt;[The WHO recently classified glyphosate,](http://naturalsociety.com/17-scientists-speak-out-monsantos-roundup-is-causing-cancer/) a chemical in Monsanto’s best-selling herbicide Roundup, as carcinogenic – news that is really heating things up with biotech. 

&gt;So Monsanto has been demanding that the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [retract their statements](http://naturalsociety.com/monsanto-asks-world-health-organization-to-retract-cancer-link/) about the poisons’s toxicity to human health.

&gt;The company [demands this](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/03/27/1373484/-Monsanto-s-Discredit-Bureau-Swings-into-Action) even though a peer-reviewed study published in March of 2015 in the respected journal, The Lancet Oncology, conducted a analysis proving that glyphosate was indeed ‘probably carcinogenic.’

&gt;Monsanto’s vice president of global regulatory affairs Philip Miller [told Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/24/us-monsanto-herbicide-idUSKBN0MK2GF20150324) the following in interview:

“We question the quality of the assessment. The WHO has something to explain.”

&gt;It has *already* been explained, Mr. Miller. The study states:

“Glyphosate is a broad-spectrum herbicide, currently with the highest production volumes of all herbicides. It is used in more than 750 different products for agriculture, forestry, urban, and home applications. 

“Its use has increased sharply with the development of genetically modified glyphosate-resistant crop varieties. Glyphosate has been detected in air during spraying, in water, and in food. There WAS limited evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of glyphosate.

“Glyphosate has been detected in the blood and urine of agricultural workers, indicating absorption. Soil microbes degrade glyphosate to aminomethylphosphoric acid (AMPA). Blood AMPA detection after poisonings suggests intestinal microbial metabolism in humans. 

“Glyphosate and glyphosate formulations induced DNA and chromosomal damage in mammals, and in human and animal cells in vitro. One study reported increases in blood markers of chromosomal damage (micronuclei) in residents of several communities after spraying of glyphosate formulations.”

&gt;In a recent talk attended mostly by students hoping to get decent paying internships in their field, a student asked what the company was doing to negate “bad science” concerning their work.

&gt;Monsanto’s employee, Dr. William Moar, who gives talks on Monsanto’s products to reassure everyone that they are safe, perhaps forgot the event was public when he openly revealed that Monsanto had:
 
“An entire department” (waving his arm for emphasis) dedicated to “debunking” science which disagreed with theirs.”

&gt;Likely, this is the first time a Monsanto employee has publicly admitted that they have immense political and financial weight to bear on scientists who dare to publish against them. Of course they don’t list this discrediting department anywhere on their website.

&gt;The company will stop at nothing to discredit and devalue the contributions of unimpeachably respected Lancet and the international scientific bodies of WHO and IARC, among others.

&gt;The stakes are high – after all, an entire industry of GMO seed (for which they currently hold more than a three-fourths monopoly share) is based on being Roundup ready. Glyphosate is their hallmark product, and it accounts for billions in sales when you account for the seed they sell to go with their best-selling herbicide.

&gt;In a single publicly made phrase, Moar has admitted that the Monsanto-funded science is sheer propaganda – essentially that they indeed have dozens, if not hundreds of employees out making sure that no science which tells the truth about their cancer-causing products ever garners any credibility whatsoever in the information age.

&gt;Monsanto has also held up the findings of regulatory bodies, particularly in the United States where the revolving door between agrochemical corporations and government seems never ending."
31n9bm,6,2015-04-06,How did you choose your PhD program?,PHDPHDPHDPHD,IOPsychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/31n9bm/how_did_you_choose_your_phd_program/,"This subreddit has a wealth of good information and has given plenty of good advice in the past, so I'm writing to see if I can get some help as well. I am currently sitting on 2 funded IO PhD programs and am having a lot of trouble deciding between the two.

School A: Located in a large city. Very good networking connects, with most students going into consulting due to the relationships the school has with businesses. Decent stipend. I really liked the overall culture here amongst the other graduate students and faculty members. Most students are finishing in 5 years due to working internships and getting jobs, slowing down their dissertation process.

School B: Located in a smaller college town. This school is ranked more highly than the other school academically. Better stipend than the other school, too. I did not really get a good impression of the culture there after talking to the graduate students and faculty. Most of the students coming out of this program finish in 4 years.

I am pretty interested in the research being conducted at both places, probably more-so in School A than School B. However, I am more interested in doing consulting after finishing school, which makes me lean towards School A. But I just can't seem to mentally get past the lower ranking and lower stipend as well. I would also rather live in the larger city, but that seems like kind of a trivial thing to decide concerning such a major decision. I would probably be happy at either place, it's just a big decision to make with large repercussions.

How did you all make your decision? Was it solely based on research fit? Or were other factors more influential? Were you happy with your decision?"

The problem seems to be that there are zero django jobs in the city I live in and the jobs that are here are usually working with Ruby on Rails, Node.js, Android and PHP.

I've created personal projects with both Node.JS, Android, and Django, in an attempt to show that I am versatile and pick up new workflows quickly but I still can't get anyone to give me a chance in any of those fields.

I'd REALLY like to not have to move(and not work remotely).  Any tips for a guy in my situation?  I've been applying to a few Ruby on Rails jobs thinking that I can make a smooth switch from Django to Ruby but no dice.  What more can I do?  Are Entry Level jobs and internships my only option if I wanted to work in something other than Django?

I've also worked with Recruiters in the area but most don't contact me after the initial meeting/phone call. (I'm not a weirdo I promise)"

31ng8a,8,2015-04-06,Please give any advice on my 6 year dating dilemma..,fentons911,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/31ng8a/please_give_any_advice_on_my_6_year_dating_dilemma/,"It's all a bit complicated to explain but I'll be as concise as possible. So about six years ago I left school. I was in a long term relationship with a girl who I loved and who wasn't very well. Following school I started my first job aged 18.  Unsurprisingly I met lots of new people joining including a girl (lets call her GIRL X). We got on like a house on fire. 

We flirted a lot, bad of me but hey I was 18... At first I thought it was just a bit of a laugh but then it became obvious that she actually quite liked me and was hoping something would happen. 
I'd been crashing at her place after work socials/xmas parties etc because I lived outside the city and no way of getting home that late. My girlfriend obviously hated this but it never went beyond flirting between me and Girl X. 

Eventually I got sick of my girlfriend having a go at me, the arguing and sadly being a bit of a drag, so I broke it off. Horrible at first but definitely the right choice.

Girl X by this point had gone away travelling after finishing the internship. But we kept in touch and have done ever since. 

When she came back we both went off to different universities, enjoying our respective lives and catching up every couple of months when we weren't in term time. Unfortunately during these occasions most of the time I had a girlfriend, and she definitely had a boyfriend all of these times. But it was still the same old flirty us. The chemistry is awesome.

At a party last year I ended up getting with one of her best friends. I liked the girl but I also knew that it would have some sort of effect on Girl X. After a few dates with the friend, Girl X was acting a little peed off and eventually she said she didn't like it because she liked me and had always hoped that eventually when we both ended up leaving uni and worked in the same city, that something was going to happen between us, and it was just that the circumstances hadn't been there so far. Which is fair and true. This was unprecedented from her, she'd never let her guard down like that about us to me. It turns out her friend knew she liked me so bad form from her too...So I told Girl X that I felt the same and stopped things with her friend. Bare in mind however that she has a boyfriend at this time, so I'm turning away someone I liked and she shouldn't have sent those messages whilst in a relationship. Then she also tells me that her mate thought we would be a great couple together (amusing because that person told me the exact opposite at the party, and told me to stay clear).

We are now finally living and working in the same city and we're a tad more mature than in our teenage years. I'm also pretty sure she's single. The flirting continues, lots of teasing banter, touching and she makes comments like, ""how come I haven't met/you haven't introduced me to your family. Haven't been to your family home. I need to meet your dad, he'll love me, why havent I met your friends, you've met mine. We should go away for a weekend"". But then she'll call me buddy... 

The dilemma is that she has always been like this with me, and is also a very confident girl anyway so I don't know if she means it or not. 
This also goes against anything she has ever been like. She never takes relationships too seriously and so meeting parents would seem like that the last thing she would chose to do. 

On top of this, anytime I suggest going for a drink in a casual way or grabbing food, she always tries to evade, play it down which is even more confusing. It's like she doesnt want to let her guard down.

So that's the general picture. Harder to write the miniscule details of the 6 year story but hopefully its enough. 

So being a bloke I haven't got a clue how to play it. 

Go in strong?, just continue as I am?, am i being messed around and actually she isnt serious at all?

Bare in mind that I love this girl to bits, spending time with her is awesome, and I reckon we'd be great together. 

I cant tell whether she wants something serious and is scared to commit/holding back until I commit first, protecting herself. 

Or whether Im being mugged about.
This has been playing with my mind for sooo long.

Any advice greatly appreciated. 
Thanks

31ngzk,6,2015-04-06,Accepted an REU - now I'm getting a lot of interviews,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/31ngzk/accepted_an_reu_now_im_getting_a_lot_of_interviews/,"I was a little late to the internship game. I started applying back in February. I wasn't getting any interviews, so I decided to apply to a few REUs. I got into one and accepted the offer. Since doing that, I've gotten 4 interviews with different companies. I'm not sure what I should do, since I am graduating next december and I've never had an internship before. But I know that it is unethical to accept and then decline an offer (especially in the case of an REU, because it's smaller and they're counting on you being there). They've already paid for a plane ticket for me, so I think I'm past the point of no return. And I'm actually interesting in the work that I'll be doing.

How badly will it hurt me to not do an internship? Or, how many companies offer fall internships? Should I be applying for these right now? Maybe I can do one of these to gain experience."

Usually, some functions are disabled unless you pay for the software, but you can use a few key functions without paying. Sometimes called 'crippleware'.

A great software like this is a Mac application called 'GraphicConverter';
Its a graphic editor/converter, but its best usage is that you can open and convert more than 250 formats! When you launch it, you wait 15 seconds, and the launch window encourages you to buy it, but once you wait 15 seconds, you can use 100% of its function unimpeded, for free if you wish.

So I get a service call for a new intern: He wants to open/convert  a batch of old .pct files.
Of course I am gonna install GraphicConverter, and tell him about the 15 second wait.

So I install it, and demo it as I am preparing to leave, and I tell him:

""Just launch it, wait for the 15 second countdown timer, then use it fully, as the software is no longer crippled, its not crippleware""

***Guy is wheelchair bound.*** 

2 seconds after words come out of my mouth, I turn around and walk out.

Last year I decided to take a semester off and transfer from an expensive private uni to a cheaper one. In doing so, I have had to live with my mother. Hate is a strong word, but I feel like I severely cannot stand her. She is ghetto, negative, reacts rather than thinks rationally, financially incompetent, and just overall a fucking idiot. Growing up with her was a living hell. Every day she came home from work, I was yelled at or hit. Everyday. among other things. Going away to college was the best thing that could've happened but I wasted away my first two years by having a shitty negative attitude, which I realized was inherited from her.

Since figuring this out I have tried my hardest to be a positive happy person and changes the things about myself I didn't like. Everything was going fine until I started to live with her again, after two years of freedom living in dorms. Even after transferring, I have spent my first semester at my new school being a commuter. I was talked into it by my sister who said the refund check I got could be used to buy a car, and with a car I'd have more freedom and job prospects and then after that I could live on campus and work, or work and have an apt with a roommate. 

I listened to her and used my refund check for a car, but I honestly regret everything. I wish I just lived on campus, got a shitty job, and just saved up over maybe a year or so to buy a car. Not only do I have more in student loans, but my car is an absolute piece of shit. It is a salvage title, and they sold it to me without telling me all of the REAL problems it had. I've paid 2.3k on the car and have spent another 2k on repairs, and will have to spend another 1.6k on repairs that may or may not fix the problem that needs to be solved so I can pass a special inspection and get a refurbished title and license plates. I have been illegally driving to and from school with a car I'm technically not supposed to be driving. If I get pulled over from the cops, my car will get impounded and I will be fucked. 

Not only has this been looming over my head, but I am sleeping on the floor of my mom's apartment on a shitty blowup bed in her ""office"" space. My mom acts old and helpless and makes messes and doesn't clean up after herself, and gets mad at me and expects me to clean up after her. I buy my own groceries and clean up when I cook. I never make messes, and keep to myself. She can be home for days and not clean the kitty litter or take out the trash while I'm at school all day. I am not financially dependent on her in anyway, except that she keeps a roof over my head for me to sleep, poop, shower, and eat. I paid her almost 800 dollars for the last few months her her letting me stay here, which I admit isn't much but its something. I'm in fucking college.

She now wants me to buy a bunch if things for the apartment and give her rmore money because she didn't go to a job fair and is working as a substitute teacher and may not afford rent anymore because her unemployment ran out. Yet she buys wine and chick fil a and lottery tickets and I don't see her applying for jobs or cold calling people, just waiting for teacher job fairs to show up. She woke me up very early yesterday yelling and freaking out at me that we need to clean the apartment because it smells. This reminded me of when I was younger, she'd basically beat me out of bed and yell at me and force me to church EVERY Sunday because I am an atheist (which is basically social suicide for black people). If I use the oven, she freaks out about the bill. I started staying out more because I have a car, and damn it if I'm gonna stay home with her ass if I didn't have to. I'm also a STEM major taking hard classes, so there's no way I'm studying at home. Well after a while if this, she tells me she needs me home more often to help out. Well what the hell is she gonna do when I go back to living on campus? Also, whenever I'm sick she jokingly asks if I'm pregnant, but I don't think she's joking. I have a nagging feeling in the back of my head that she wants me to fuck up like she did, and like my sister did midway through her time in college. I don't think she takes me seriously when I talk about grad school or my career plans. I'm sure she doesn't even know what they are because I usually have to tell her things 59 million times. I just found out that until two weeks ago, she thought I was fluent in Japanese. Because my grandpa bought me a book as a kid and I used to speak words and watch anime. Like, she has told dozens of fucking people that I am fluent in Japanese. How the fuck do you not know your daughter doesn't speak japanese until she is 20 years old and has to tell you. 

I have a month left of this semester, and I feel like I'm going to have a nervous breakdown. Between the car and living with her again, I feel like something's going to make me snap. I can go years without seeing her and be the happiest little snowflake. I have no emotional attachment to her. I just want to leave. I've even considering living in my car and just showering and stuff at the school gym.  I'm afraid she's going to ask me to commute again next year to help her out. Would I be a horrible person to tell her to fuck off? 

I want to live my life, and I'm fucking sick of dealing with her. I want to cut her out completely. Actually my whole entire family. It's like no one has motivation. When I told my sister (who I love more than anything) about part time job ideas that I had that were related to my intended field (allied health) she suggested I take the easy route and just go back to my shitty management job at a food chain that paid 7.75/hr because the manager said he'd take me back anytime. Why the fuck would I do that and not challenge myself? 

I'm sick of being around my mom. I don't want to stay with her during breaks, I don't want to be physically near her ever again after this semester is over. 

Next year I'm going to have to do STEM full time, internships for grad school exp, two extracurricular activities (one sports and one an organization), and part time work all at the same time, and I don't think this will be possible livi.g with her. So that's more student loans to live on campus. 

I don't know what I'm asking, I'm just fucking mad. I've been getting increasing depressed. I haven't made many friends at my new school to hang out with, and my friends at my old one transferred and went back to their home states (old college has a high transfer rate unless you're rich and white). For obvious reasons, I can't have boys over, and anyway I've only recently realized this past few years that I'm a fucking awesome, gorgeous person who could get a boyfriend because guess who never taught their daughter how to look pretty and groom and do her eyebrows and makeup and hair? And guess who told her daughter all throughout her life the ""truth"" that men are bad and only want one thing? 

I have 2,000 dollars left of my refund check. Every month, I pay a little over 300 for my bills and groceries. After my last final in may, I have two weeks before summer classes and work. I plan to take a vacation out of the country by myself and tell no one until I am on the plane halfway there. Why? Because someone will convince me not to, that it's a waste of money, dangerous, what if I don't get financial aid for the summer, blahblahblah. And they might be right. But I could die in summer school. I could die next year. I'm sick of taking advice from family and not doing what I want in my heart. I'm sick of bad things happening and being around negative people. I'm sick of just existing and blaming my mom and living a boring life. I could use that 2k to fix my car. But then I'd only be able to pay my bills for a month, if I'm lucky. So fuck the car, I'll fix it later. And if I get pulled over, fuck it. 

Tldr: 20-something incoherently rants about life. Depression so bad she's beginning to yolo. Sage advice needed."

It started shortly after a uhhh, huge ""blister"" inside the lower lip finally started to go away and heal (I accidentally bit that part really hard weeks ago).

Ever since, my four lower front teeth have been ""pulsating"" on and off, today my upper left wisdom tooth is aching a bit too. I've also been having a metallic/blood taste in the mouth on and off too, especially if I'm swishing saliva around the teeth.

It sounds like an infection, but nothing looks wrong in my mouth and well, thankfully, the pain is rather minor, but due to having other health problems, this is yet again another annoyance somewhere on my body.

Due to being in an unpaid internship, I'm unable to pay for it until end of May... And that's when I START getting paid, so probably longer (And I have no cash either) and parents won't have any of it either. Is there something I can do to control the infection (or whatever it is) so that it won't become worse than it is?

I'm a college junior in computer science and will be in the Bay Area this summer as a software engineering intern. I am really excited about machine learning and data science, but I didn't have very many significant projects for me to land a data science internship this summer. I am currently working on some Kaggle competitions and going through some tutorials on machine learning algorithms on the web. I'm hoping that I can get a part-time job before I apply for full-time data science roles. I'd really like your advice on steps I can take to achieve my goals for obtaining a data science job."

31nyz5,2,2015-04-06,I'm curious: does anyone know of a Crucifixion scene showing Christ in ecstasy?,[deleted],ArtHistory,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtHistory/comments/31nyz5/im_curious_does_anyone_know_of_a_crucifixion/,"There's a beautiful, relatively Realist-styled, 20th-century Crucifixion painting at a small museum I intern for.

One reason I find this painting especially interesting is because Christ appears still alive, with his head thrown backward, mouth ajar, and eyes almost all rolled back, but fixed on a source of divine light, Heavenward. He clearly looks like he's in the midst of an ecstatic death. 

This rendering is particularly unusual to me, as every Crucifixion I can think of (aside from the purposely abstract/obscured styles) depicts Christ with his head dropped downward or to the side, and eyes nearly or completely closed, as if he's already dead.

Can anyone think of Crucifixion scenes (prior to the ending of WW-II) that reveal Christ in ecstasy? Wouldn't Christ experiencing an ecstatic death be a contradiction in itself?"

I just recently applied for and obtained a position as a Content Developer for the digital signs around campus. I will be using python, php, vbbasic, MySQL, among others for the duties in my job. I hope to have this position for the next 1.5-2 years that I am going to be attending here. 

The problem is, is that before I had accepted this position after I had already started talking to my professor about being a TA for our schools Data Structures and Algorithm course. I want to do that, however I feel like it would be quite a bit to work as a developer, TA, go to school full time, as well as try and work on some side projects that I've been planning. I need the money and the developer position is $15 an hour and extremely flexible schedule wise. However, I recently spoke to the Google Rep for my school, a current student who has interned and been offered a position following their graduation, and they stated that almost 70% of hires by Google are former TAs for various CS classes. 

So my question is, does anyone know which would be better? Should I try and go for both or would have 2+ years of experience as a developer be a huge bonus already when I apply for my first full time position. I'm hoping to get internships with some big name companies in the distant future. "

I expect to attend an MBA program this fall. I have already set my 401k to max out in the first 5 months of 2015. I used Roth 401(k) because I'm only going to have an income for the first half of the year.


Is there anything I can do to take advantage of my student status in the coming two years? I expect to get a summer internship in 2016, but should have no income beyond that. 



I was thinking I might do a Roth conversion for traditional 401k. Does it make the most sense to do it this 2015 tax year (half year of pre-MBA salary), next year (2016, internship salary), or in 2017? I will also get married in 2016, and late 2016 would be the when I could potentially sell my home under the primary residence tax exclusion (two years of ownership).

31odw3,1,2015-04-06,A rather annoying situation,strugglefordayz,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/31odw3/a_rather_annoying_situation/,"Last summer, I interned for a company but the internship was primarily industrial engineering based (I'm an electrical engineering major, junior). At the time it was the only internship offer I had, and they offered me another internship for this summer. I asked the HR department before I left if they could try and place me in a more  electrical engineering based department and they said they would do the best they could to try and make this happen. So they sent me an offer letter a few weeks after my internship ended and I signed it and returned it by late August. 


Around early January during Winter break, they called and told me that I would be placed in the same department I was in last summer. As a result, I applied for a couple other internships, one of them within my university in a research lab because the research seemed very interesting.


Now, I'm currently researching with a different professor but the lab I applied to is giving a paid internship. Both labs/professors want me to continue research into my senior year, and ideally I would love to do research for both. The only problems with the lab I am in now is that the PhD students I am working with have a difficult time explaining things to me because their english is limited, but I feel like this is a common issue since many PhD students are international. I've somewhat lost interest because of this since I feel I am doing things but not understanding why I'm doing them, but I am more than willing to give it another try in my senior year. The lab I would be working in for the internship would be better in this regard because I know the PhD students since they were the TA in a few of my previous courses and I feel I can gain a lot from spending a summer with them.


I just don't know how I would be able to continue volunteering as an undergrad research assistant for both labs, and I feel like the professors would want me to devote time to just one lab. I don't want to ditch my current lab because they really do try and help me and I feel it is very wrong to leave a lab after just one semester, but at the same time, I do want to join the lab with the internship since I really want some relevant internship experience (relevant as in, electrical engineering) and I feel I can gain a lot from that labs since I know a few undergrad students who have publications because of that lab. The internship I have from last year with the company would once again be industrial engineering based, and while I would rather work elsewhere, I did sign the letter...

So, what would you do in this situation? Am I just overthinking everything? Sorry for the very long post, and thanks for reading.


TL;DR - had industrial eng internship last summer, (i'm EE) and got offered internship by same company for this summer. Asked HR department for EE internship (and signed offer letter in August) but got same internship (found out in January). Applied for research internship with a professor and got it, but currently doing research with another prof. Don't think I can do research for both at same time during next school yr, and don't know if I should say no to company since I signed the offer letter."

There were several other emails they sent me recently, but nothing more than inconsequentail spam. These emails below I had my best friend send to me because I wanted to snark at them myself. I give you, RBN, a steaming pile of horseshit! (lucky you):

This first email is about a week after I closed the joint account with my tyrant father. And it is loooooooong.


&gt;[Did I mention I don't use this name, ever? I think I might have mentioned it severalmany times.],

&gt;We love you very much and want to do everything possible to help pay your way through college.  You have to do the hard part (studying and getting good grades) but we want to help with the expense.

So the letter begins with a big ol' plate of absolute lies. They love abusing me, they want to use college as leverage to get more Nsupply. And they do nothing but complain about expenses, be it shoes because my old ones made my feet bleed, food costs, or now, college.

&gt;So, we are partners in this effort.  In partnerships both parties contribute in some areas and both parties compromise in some areas.  Some areas are flexible, others less so.

If by partnership you mean dictatorship, then yes. They could be quoting any of the major bad guys in Burn Notice right now, I swear to Todd.

&gt;You contribute very hard work to get the great grades.  The university controls the grading process and the course content as well as the amount they charge each semester. 

No shit the university I go to grades my work. I'm confused as to why this sentence is even here. Do they honestly think that I am too dumb to realize that college grades things, or are they trying to put blame elsewhere for the future?

&gt;We'll help with paying the bills and by being flexible in supporting whatever plans you have for summer internships, seminars in Pennsylvania, jobs, projects, or other activities to further your career. 

For the record, I never went to a seminar in PA. It was in fucking Ohio. I am so glad that they are so involved and care so much that they manage to get the state wrong when they threw an absolute fit over winter because I didn't remember if the hotel the seminar was at served breakfast or not.

&gt;You have done an absolutely wonderful job of getting scholarships.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!  It's fantastic and Mom and I thank you very much.

They are failing spectacularly at lovebombing. Once, there was a time where all I wanted from them was to hear that I had done a good job, and I was willing to take any abuse they gave in order to hear it, but the praise just never came. I shut down that part in me. I find healthier things to do with myself now. I spend my time with kind people who don't abuse me to begin with. 

&gt;Bills in our household come from many, many sources.  Over our 30+ year marriage Mom and I have have learned to juggle payments from: house mortgage, house insurance, 2 car payments, car insurance (for 3 cars right now), medical insurance, medical/dental co-pays, unplanned dental surgery, prescription costs, retirement plans, electricity, water (yes, even on a well), internet, Netflix, propane for cooking and heat (costs more than $1000 for a single fill up), pellet stove, home maintenance, 4 credit card payments, clothing, college tuition, books supplies, a laptop computer, dorm, art supplies, food and a monthly amount in cash for you, transportation for everyone, food, home appliance repair and replacement, and probably a few others I just can't think of.  In the very near future we're looking at having to spend probably $8000-$11,000 to replace our home heating &amp; A/C system so we're carefully budgeting all our spare money to save for that soon-to-come expense. Today my car is going into the repair shop for a brake repair expected to cost $1500-$2000.  The car repair was completely unexpected so we have to figure out what to cut to be able to fix the car.  The roof on the house is losing shingles each storm, so we need to have the roof repaired very soon, I think that's in the range of $15,000.  We aren't planning on a vacation this year at all because of the tight budget situation.

I was wondering if they'd ever send me an invoice of the cost of raising me. Most of this shit is their fault. The house has needed work on the roof for years. And including netflix? Seriously, *I* could afford Netflix. Why is that even a thing on there? And that monthly cash stopped when I closed the joint account. I'm actually on my own now, thanks.

Too bad they didn't mention my tyrant father's airplane habit, his taste for precious gemstones and equipment to cut them (two full sets in the basements!), his beehives, his skiing and paragliding phases, Nmom's ""glamping"" trip at a rock festival and planned age-50 midlife crisis, her ""art"" retreats at five star hotels, her antiquing trips in which she drops $100s of dollars at a store, her literally shelves of unworn jeans from thrift stores (she takes up 3 closets, two of them are walk-in). None of those expenses are taken into account, but the one-time cost of a laptop for me for college was included. Funny, huh? It's only a luxurious burden on my rich parents if it involves me.

&gt;There is a lot of juggling needed to make all those monthly payments match the pay checks that we get.  We're good at it only because we know how much to expect, when to expect it, what our paycheck will be, and what we should be planning for in the future. 

So sometimes they didn't buy me food. Trust me, I get it. They get gourmet fancy diet shit that I'm not allowed to touch and I get to decide what I can do with potatoes and a 5 year old bottle or Worcestershire sauce.

&gt;Sometimes the timing of a bill due date vs. the paycheck is very, very close.  A day or two could result in a late house mortgage payment, a finance charge/penalty, or other similar (bad) results.

Good.

&gt;To get all these moving parts to work properly to be able to afford to send you to college Mom and I have planned, saved, and set up our finances for more than 30 years, learning along the way how to make the system work.

Luckily, I have taken a very wonderful hammer to this system in the form of a dependency override.

&gt;Delays in moving money from here to there could mean late payments, extra late fees, penalties, bad credit, bad credit scores and the resulting higher interest rates, or in the worst case if our whole household budget system failed we could get foreclosed on our house mortgage and lose our home.  That isn't going to happen anytime soon, we'll make other choices before we let that happen.

And that is my problem....how? I know, I'm cold, but seriously- it's not my problem. I have no siblings to worry about. The only one in that household that I care for about at all is their poor, abused dog and I've accepted that I can't save him.

&gt;Quick note on taxes and college savings.  Mom and I saved our entire marriage into a ""tax exempt"" college savings plan.  It's titled in my name, I fill out the form and sign approval of any withdrawals from this savings account.  If the withdrawal is in my name your tuition payment gets taxed between 35-40% by the federal and [State] taxing authorities.  We pay about 35-40% tax total between the two, it varies a little each year depending on what deductions we have available when we do taxes.  So, to save unnecessary taxes, and per our 30-year long financial plan, the tuition payment has been in your name except for one or two checks where I goofed up and didn't fill out the form correctly.  Boy, am I kicking myself for the checks that I didn't check the correct box on!  Learned that lesson good.  Also, if the government takes 40% of each check, then you won't have enough money to pay for school, you'll have 40% too little.  So far a school year costs roughly $10,000, so you'll be $4000 short.  We've known how the government taxes such things for 30 years and we planned the withdrawals to minimize the taxes by using your name where possible.

So they admit that they want to use my accounts to evade taxes. Cool. I'm so keeping this email.

&gt;I know the university won't accept 35-40% less tuition just because I checked the wrong box and the wrong name was on the withdrawal check, so we had to juggle yet more other plans and bill payments to find the money from that goof up.

I'm so sorry that you couldn't eat your artisan deli meats for a week. You must suffer so much.

&gt;A critical part of the system necessary to make all this orchestrated chaos work each month includes having a checking account in both your name and my name that I can move tuition payments into and out of without delay.  One of the recent tuition transactions I made was deposited and moved all in the same day.  The bank where we have our accounts is USAA.  We don't use other banks since USAA has such great service.

They figured out that I closed that joint account. I was wondering how long it'd take. And it also sounds like they know I have another account elsewhere. Good thing I've already put security measures in place. I like how they command me by saying ""We always"" and ""we don't."" It's so like them. I lived in their alternate dimension long enough to know just what they are doing there, and it's not gonna work any longer.

&gt;Here's the flexible part of our ""Pay For [     ]'s College"" family partnership:  Open or close any and all the bank accounts you want.  You are an adult.  We're excited and happy that you are an independent person. 

Somehow I feel that none of this is actually true. Wait for it- they're gonna demand something and follow up with a threat.

&gt;At the same time let's both remember we are in a partnership to pay for college.  You do the hard work through studying, getting scholarships, and we pay the remaining bills.  But please also remember our household budget is fragile, complex, requires careful critical timing, and one late payment here can result in a past-due penalty there.

GOOD. I wish neither of them happiness.

&gt;Here's the not-so-flexible part of our partnership that is needed to make the whole jumbled, chaotic, household finance budget juggling-act work:  You and I need one shared account where I can deposit checks in your name, and then move them into the family household budget quickly, easily, and without delay.  Delays can result in this house-of-financial-cards falling down.

Called it. Demand plus threat.

Can you and I agree to call this new account ""Dad's account where he can deposit money for both [    ] and for [      ]'s college expenses""?  It's what I need to make our household finances work.

Let's agree to NOT. Let's not put tyrant father in a position where he can avoid any more taxes. Let's not give him ANY control of MY finances anymore because the pair of them are incredibly toxic and abusive.

&gt;Happy to work with you anytime to open a USAA account where we both have access to help me processing your tuition, room and board, and related school expenses.  USAA is very helpful on the phone and we could do it with a short conference call.

Just went to my bank and asked how I can prevent fraud. 

&gt;Call if you get a chance. 

No.

&gt;Love,

&gt;Mom and Dad

So that's the first email. Holy fuckballls, that was an adventure. I'm not falling for it, though. I've got my makeup on and a swishy skirt. My hair is up in some shiny hairsticks.

&gt;My car looks to be in the shop for a number of weeks.  There are only 3 parts available in the entire USA and they're not sure the car company will send one to us.  Interesting situation.

Also not my problem.

And other general advice, please!",seanthelonghorn,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/31ogm3/what_is_some_general_advice_for_undergraduates/,"I'm a second-year undergrad at UT-Austin, and my goal has been to publish a paper before I apply to grad schools. I've been in a machine learning and data mining lab since last fall. 

I spent most of the fall semester learning what I needed to learn to be somewhat competent in understanding what was being talked about in the group meetings. This spring semester, I've been doing a lot of the same, but I've been hoping to work on a project that might eventually get published too. We have two projects coming in, but we're still waiting on funding from the grants. 

But so far, I've mostly done stuff like manage the group website, and playing around with different libraries on my own: things that don't directly lead to helping out on a paper. I mean if these projects end up coming through soon, that would be great, because I could at least work on it before this semester ends. But I wouldn't be able to work on the project long, because I have an internship at Google this summer, and I won't be able to do much research until I come back.

I really want to try and publish before I apply to grad schools, because I think it will be really helpful on my application. I'm looking at schools like Stanford, Berkeley, Caltech, MIT, Cornell, CMU, and Princeton. 

I still have all of my junior year to try and do that. And maybe instead of returning as an intern, I could maybe do an REU? But it'd be pretty hard turning down a return offer from Google if I get one. But since I want to go to the grad school, it might be a smarter option to do an REU. Maybe if I publish before next summer, I'll still have the edge of a publication and I can still do the internship after my junior year.

Can I get some general advice? I've been thinking about this a lot, and I could really use some advice from someone who's gone through the process. How can I work toward being maybe second or third author or something on a paper as an undergrad? Should I do an REU instead of the industry internship after my junior year if I haven't published by then?"

She seemed pretty adamant about being friends and even mentioned that she thought of me as one of her best friends. She's had a previous history of bad breakups, ours was mutual and partly due to the fact that she's moving away for six  months for an internship and isn't sure she'll be coming back to the city we live in after it. She was worried that since we're a pretty intimate couple we'd miss each other too much after not having seen each other for a while, and she didn't want a bad breakup to ruin our otherwise good relationship. 

I said I felt the same, and I do, but I'm having a really difficult time imagining what being her friend will be like, especially since it'll pretty much be a long distance friendship, and I don't really see how that's any different from a relationship. It would be the same amount of messaging/talking/skyping, only without the ""I love you""s, in my opinion. I also don't think I could talk to her about other girls/guys she might be seeing or how great her life is going without me in it. I'm also concerned about how our friendship might go and if it might just end up ruining the relationship between us anyway.  

But I don't want to cut her out of my life either, because I care about her a lot, so I told her I'd be willing to do the friends thing if she forgave me for some inconsistency in the beginning while I got used to it. 

So I'm hoping to ask for advice from people who've done the friends-after-breakup, maybe anyone who's had experience breaking up because of distance and if/how they stayed in touch? Anything would be super helpful :)"

31otqf,1,2015-04-06,No Outside Projects During CS Degree,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/31otqf/no_outside_projects_during_cs_degree/,"I'm going to graduate in a semester with a CS degree from UTD and a decent GPS (I think at or just above 3.3) and yet I feel like I know very little about programming as a whole. I have only done one internship at a very small company where I wrote a couple basic PHP scripts to work with HTTP Requests, set up a WAMP, and assembled a server rack. I haven't pursued any outside projects. I go to /r/programming and I can hardly keep up with anything. I shifted from an English degree two and a half years ago and that was my real start into programming/computer science, so I haven't been programming since high school like a number of my peers have. Overall, I just feel out of my depth. Is this a common feeling? My main worry isn't necessarily that I won't get a job, but rather I won't know as much as skilled software developers and I won't be able to catch up to skilled peers.

I apologize if this is a common question."
31oudt,11,2015-04-06,"Hey computer people, UNT System is hiring for part-time student positions",abs01ute,unt,https://www.reddit.com/r/unt/comments/31oudt/hey_computer_people_unt_system_is_hiring_for/,"Howdy everyone! I wanted to share with you that my team is hiring some students for part-time positions. My team is Central Web Services for UNT System and we are responsible for hosting all of UNT's websites (in the very high hundreds). It's nearly all Drupal, and a handful of other PHP frameworks, served up by Apache. Our support infrastructure is lots of Python, Jenkins, and SaltStack, all running on Linux. We have a couple positions open at the moment...

**Helpdesk**: You'll be working with site admins all across the university to assist with updating and maintaining their websites. There is a ton of work to be done here, and Linux experience is a major plus here. Sure, some experience with a Linux desktop environment is good, but I'm specifically referring to experience working on the terminal using things likes ```ls```, ```grep```, ```rsync```, ```chown```, etc. If you have experience running a web server like Apache or know what a virtual host is or how to setup redirects, that's also good. No one here expects you to know everything about everything – you're a student, you're allowed to learn, but don't expect anyone here to hold your hand the entire time. Good people skills also nice since you'll be replying to tickets.

If that all sounds like your type of thing, apply on Eagle Network\*. We'd like to have you for a while, so freshman, sophomores, this one's for you (not sure whether the job is visible to juniors/seniors – let me know if that's the case). The job ID is **117935**.

**Web Development**: You'll get the opportunity to work on various projects, from website administration tools to tuning up/polishing various websites. We have two really great student web developers right now that we're about to lose to graduation and they both got great experience working with us that helped them land some great full-time gigs in DFW. As I already mentioned, we're a Linux shop, running Apache, serving up PHP. So, PHP knowledge is greatly desired. That website administration tool I mentioned earlier? You'll need to know how to work with REST APIs. I'm actually kinda jealous that a student worker gets to do this and not me. That tool is going to be very important going forward with web hosting at UNT. Other things that we'd like to see are experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – not Java. I don't know why so many people think JavaScript is like Java. It's not. At all. For CSS things, we started using Twitter Bootstrap on some projects and it's really fantastic, so please know a bit about responsive CSS frameworks.

If web development is more your speed, apply on Eagle Network\*. Again, we'd like you to stick around for a while, so freshman and sophomores, here's to you. Juniors/Seniors still feel free to apply if the job is visible to you. The job ID is **117933**.

You don't *have* to be a computer science or computer engineering major to apply (though, huge perk if you are: Central Web Services is located at Discovery Park). If you can show us that you've got the chops necessary to get the job done, then who cares what your major is. Oh, forgot to mention! I don't know how it works for other majors, but if you're computer science, you can also earn internship credit for working here. I think it applies to other majors as well, but your mileage may very.

Questions? Comments? Outbursts? AMAA.

It quickly became clear that the job had been falsely advertised as my duties were not marketing related whatsoever and did not match those given on the job description. I left the job after one month as it was not the position that had been advertised and I did not have enough time to be dong work that would not better my knowledge of marketing.

I got the job through the university recruitment agency. Those who advertise through this agency agree to pay at least minimum wage to their workers. i contacted the agency about the situation and they said it was completely unacceptable of the company to trick students into a position that they did not want. The agency contacted the health place to arrange paying me for my time there. The health place told me to send them my bank details and I did.

This was 20 days ago. I have received no money from them. They ignore every attempt at contact that I have with them and have also been ignoring the university. the months work took place early febuary - early march, its now april and I have received NOTHING. 

how do I make them pay?? I need the money

also is it legal to threaten them...... I had an idea that I  could write a piece about my terrible experience and publish it on a news site that my friend works for, gets a lot of readers. I thought I could threaten to do this to make them pay but i dont know if thats legal or not?

I managed to score the internship after my freshman year, which is pretty damn rare for the company to give an offer to undergrads. It's gold on my otherwise unappealing resume.

I applied (to a different department within Company A) and interviewed again with them for this summer, but fell flat on my face during the interview and got a rejection. I was really bummed out, but I did have an offer from another company (not as prestigious but still a very big company on the opposite coast) for the summer anyway. Unlike Company A where I had 5 - 7 rounds of interviews, I only had 1 interview with Company B before receiving an offer... they're not super picky about hiring, I guess.

I accepted the other offer after my rejection from the Company A. Set up housing, flights, met my summer roommates. But I just got a call from my manager at Company A today telling me his department was ""looking to hire an intern for this summer again and he wanted to see if I was interested, and to let him know so they can consider me for the position.""
 
So I don't want to get my hopes up too much, but is it basically just an informal offer? And if it is, I'm actually having trouble deciding which one to go with.

I am now getting the following errors when querying the user JSON:

    XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://anilist.co/api/user/matachines/activity/?access_token=Wo33djfy6cdpnQEvbSAEqVK1bDwJ5QV1806aLGNN. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://juansoto.me' is therefore not allowed access.    

I know this has to do with CORS or whatever... but why did it stop working tonight? The API docs have not been updated or changed in any way, so I don't think the admin changed anything. Moreover, if I copy and paste the URL in the error code in any browser, I get the data I want! So why is it not working in the AJAX request?

Also, to even make the request that fails I have to make a [POST request for authentication](https://github.com/matachines/anilist-collage/blob/master/assets/js/main.js#L236)... and that obviously seems to work. So why is the GET one not working?

The code for the failing request is [here.](https://github.com/matachines/anilist-collage/blob/master/assets/js/main.js#L79)

I've tried setting my apache config to allow all access and even making my index file set allow all access via PHP... but it's not working. I've also tried other applications that use the same API and they are working, so it's my problem. Can anyone help me out?

Sorry for the bad writing, kinda freaking out since I need this working to apply for internships!

31pbhy,13,2015-04-06,Prediction: Opie's radio career will come to an end quite soon,[deleted],opieandanthony,https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/31pbhy/prediction_opies_radio_career_will_come_to_an_end/,"Opie is a house of cards, and this will be too much for his fragile psyche. If he doesn't acknowledge the TACS show, he's an avoidant coward. If he does acknowledge it, he turns his fans onto it (good call making it free, Ant), who will then see how much of a lying manipulating cunt he is. I don't think anybody can sympathise with somebody who snaps his fingers at interns. He can't win.

Now that Anthony has put his cards on the table, Opie is going to look to Jimmy for validation and sympathy. Jimmy will likely be forced to side with one of them, and it will probably be Anthony.  Not because he's a beacon of integrity, but because he's a sycophantic whore and realizes siding with Opie makes him look bad.

Once Ant gets his studio in NYC up and running, Jimmy will be on the TACS show much more often, and will make way better radio than O&amp;J. Opie will inevitably notice this and feel threatened. He will decide he wants to move on to something else, and will claim this was his plan all along. That's if he even makes it that long, of course.

I recently graduated from college, and I am interested in going into public health. I interned at a harm reduction center during college and discovered that I could be great at running a center. I've always been interested in management/administration as well. My wish is to work as a health administrator in a hospital but running a health promotion/outreach center would be awesome too.

I looked into several programs such as MHA, MBA, MPH, etc., and MPH seems like the best option since an MPH will give me the flexibility to go into management as well as head towards another concentration if my interests change. Please let me know if I am misguided here.

I submitted my applications to MPH programs and selected the policy and management tracts. However, I know that I submitted my applications prematurely. I am unsure if I will get into any programs.

If I do not get in, what can I do to strengthen my application? Of course, internships and work are great, but I don't know exactly what jobs I should be looking for. Do I do outreach stuff, try to work in the administrative departments in hospitals, etc? I'm stuck here.

Advice would be awesome!

Thank you."

I handle allot of mixed sensitive data and try everything possible to keep it secure.
So I set up LastPass and still am unsure how I feel about leaving all my passwords in the cloud. 1. Does LastPass only hold the hash? or the plain text password? I did not let LastPass save my master password because I figure its the only one I really need to remember anymore. I also enabled google auth. Now every password I is LastPass generated to 10 - 25 char's and unique. Of course I don't know any of my passwords but I can view them on my browser, phone, tablet so its not much of an inconvenience. 2. Does this sound secure? Any tips to improve security?
As far as my Mac goes it also has a unique 10+ char password from my iCloud account and is encrypted. My security questions are very personal so I don't think social engineering or good research could leave me vulnerable. 3. If I have a strong password what are the chances of someone with physical access to my laptop and a lot of time seeing my data?
Lastly while browsing I use an extension to disable scripts. I then enable only the scripts that are needed. Also I disable flash mostly because I despise flash almost as much as IE. I am also using a VPN that keeps no records as well as SSL whenever possible and I encrypt and many emails, attachments, etc. Any suggestions to my current setup? 
The guy's at work look at me like I'm crazy but they are still using 5 char passwords from the 80's and that seems reckless to me for the type of data we handle. I may just be an NetSec intern but honestly it fascinates me to learn about anything NetSec and I also would never want the embarrassment as being the NetSec guy who caused the leak. Also I do take other people's data very seriously as I would want mine to be treated (although I know thats not the case for most companies).  "

then a few weeks later, we hadnt had too much interaction between times, i asked if she wanted to carpool again, since my current ride was no longer available. she said no, that she had to, ""depend on herself right now"" and ""cant have others depending on me or me depending on others"" i asked her what was wrong, cause she seemed to be acting strange. i kept asking her for a little bit if anything was wrong, but dropped it soon after.
fast forward a few weeks, i asked her in class if she wanted to maybe ride together next week. she said she would let me know. later tonight she texted me, saying she didnt want to carpool and had never been comfortable with it and never wanted to again.

""The community has been asking for recolors for a long while, but despite testing and experimenting with a few internal ideas, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a way to build them that satisfied our high standards. The current price reflects the work we put into crafting them.

Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to do a quick and dirty overlay, or shift a slider left in an editing program, but we think you would call us on that bullshit real quick, and as players ourselves, we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be satisfied with such a hacky solution.""

You were right, Riot. This is in fact bullshit.

I&amp;#039;ve done my own recolours before, both the base skin and the particles. I wish I could find screenshots. (Update, see below)

It looked just as ""professional"" as Riot&amp;#039;s provided screenshots, and you know what? It took me an hour to do. And I&amp;#039;d never done it before.

Riot are showing their greed. You could sit down the coffee intern who has no art training at all at a computer with photoshop and all the skin textures, come back in a week and he could have _easily_ made three recolours of each skin in the game.

If they made it unlockable through champion mastery, which is currently terrible (CHAMP SUMMONER ICONS. RIOT. ARE YOU DEAF.), it would be a good feature. Or even IP.

But charging money for a level of effort equivalent to changing the name of a folder? Yeah no, Riot.

Updated: I went into Photoshop and messed around with a random skin (happened to be Foxfire Ahri, in hindsight I should have picked someone with more... visible clothing like Twisted Fate for example, or even Anivia or something), like literally scribbled here and there without caring too much. 

They can claim it takes effort all they want but the simple fact is that I have no training in doing this, spent less than half an hour, and basically made a ""chroma"" which they want to charge us for. 

I picked completely random colours, I can do the particles too if you&amp;#039;d like. They take even less time than the actual skin itself, literally all you have to do is use the colour replacement tool and scribble all over it.

31qa6o,0,2015-04-07,I [26 M] have trouble regaining my trust towards my girlfriend [23 F] of 3 years after she went on a date with someone else and can't decide what to do,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/31qa6o/i_26_m_have_trouble_regaining_my_trust_towards_my/,"Hello Reddit! A long text incoming and at first I would like to apologize for my grammar as it may or may not be correct. I've found that I'm in trouble with my relationship and believe my world is slowly falling apart. After crappy moves from both of us I no longer have any idea what to do in my relationship and I need help.


Some background: I come from a family full of hate, which made us all distant from each other when I was a kid. In both family life and school life I endured a lot and managed to avoid total depression by believing in my future. It has impacted my life in both positive and negative ways. I always have a plan towards the next years and my thinking has gotten analytical and logical which got me into excellent masters program in one of the best universities in my country. I also feel a great deal of empathy towards anyone and it helps avoiding conflicts a lot. On the other hand, my mood towards life got pretty grim and dark and I lost sight of anything except future as an emloyed adult. I started hiding my feelings and thoughts to my own brains and never let anyone to see how I felt in different situations. Today I am a perfectionist who hates losing and feels disgusted of myself whenever I don't excel at something. I also avoid human relationships as I believe I fear losing them as soon as I start enjoying them. I have trouble trusting anyone, even if that's my best friend.


During the first year in uni I found my girlfriend. She was beyond my expectations and I never would have required so much in any relationship. She slowly made me trust people again and changed my mood towards life. I started to feel that there was more than just a job and computer games in my future. To my own surprise, she even made me want kids in future. 


Fast-forward 2 years to the time I got out of six months of mandatory military employment. During the military employment I had promised myself I would get a job for 6-9 months before continuing studies with some more money. To my surprise it was super hard to find any jobs in our town and after few months I had only gotten myself to a low paying part time job in an animal shelter and a no-pay internship in a mobile game company. I had also injured my leg in military which forced me to quit my favourite hobby: jogging. I slowly started losing my shape and all of this made hate myself a lot. To my understanding my girlfriend saw me as angry and hateful towards anything for almost a year. She never said a thing about how much my mood hurt her before it was too late.


During last christmas I finally had time to rest after my long streak of military employment, crappy jobs and huge pressure in school. My leg was finally feeling OK and I started working out my body again. I felt happier than ever and it made me see that there was something bad going. My girlfriend was looking at her phone all the time during christmas and our sex life had started dying before this. After a few days of thinking I finally got convinced that she was going to see another man and against all my principles I reached for someone else's phone for the first time in my life. My fears became real and I found that she was indeed starting a relationship with another guy. At first I was confused why this happened and I tried to make things right without mentioning that I knew about her secrets. We talked about how we had gotten distant from each other and both agreed to make things better. 


After our discussions there was still one night when I knew she was going to see her new guy. She of course claimed that she was going to have a girls night with her cousin and I almost cried as I begged her to spend the evening with me. As she left our apartment I felt empty, betrayed and I was in a complete shock. During the night I literally banged my head to the wall and shouted bad stuff to myself. I never slept at all and when I finally saw her in the morning I had to open up to her that I knew what she was doing.


This led us to talk, cry and open up to each other for days or even weeks. She never said that she slept with the guy but she did mention going out on a date once. After she had told me how much I had hurt her during the last year, I finally started to understand why she started to drift away from me. For a short period of time, this realization made me really depressed. Our talks opened something like a lid in me which made it easier than ever before in my life to tell about my feelings. Against all logic I trusted her that there was nothing else than this one date and we both agreed that we would fix our relationship. 


Things started to work out: we felt happier with each other, I started going to the gym with her and she stopped texting to her new guy. We had lots of good sex again. Still, I never truly regained my trust towards her in this short amount of time. I got overcontrolling and observing towards what she was doing and this made her feel bad again. In 2 months I caught her texting to the same guy again. I contacted the guy myself and he started insulting me how bad things were going between me and my girlfriend and even called my girlfriend easy. This devastated me and of course I showed these messages to her too, which finally made her quit her ""crush"" towards this person.


Another talk happened and we started to seek help from the outside. We took an online course in relationships which made us understand each other better and our relationship started to shine even better than two months ago. We even got a new, bigger apartment so that we could leave some bad memories behind us and start a better life together.


Today we seem to be OK but I have started to feel that I am not getting enough of this relationship. I have done everything I can to be even better than I was before my time in military. I am slowly but surely getting my body back in a good shape and in some ways I am now happier than before but exhausted and I fear that I am alone in this relationship. Even small things as getting turned down from sex hit me hard and every time I have even a small bad thought in my mind, I go back to the night she left me alone and think to myself that she did cheat on me. I can sleep well during nights but I have hard time focusing on anything during the day. 


I now see myself as a complete failure regardless of school going well and a ridiculously good summer job waiting for me. The lid my girlfriend opened up for my feelings is starting to close again. I think I have lost my trust towards everyone again, even worse than before meeting her. In one month, I am going to leave town for my summer job and I'll be separated from my girlfriend for one month. Even thinking about this is killing me and even as I believe she is not going to see anyone else, I fear that one night I'll find myself out of my relationship. 


I still love her more than anything and I want to graduate and have kids with her but my logical side is stopping me from regaining my trust towards her. During the last year I have not managed to make a single new friend, I have lost contact with my old friends and even my best friend dropped out of school and moved away. If I leave her, I know that I will be completely alone and I know that with my past this will destroy me and my ability to see anything good in life. I no longer have any trust towards my own plans of future and my mind and overanalytical thinking is starting to rip me apart. I am not sure if either I am clinging to her too much or if she is not showing her feelings towards me enough.


TLDR; Relationship of 3 years had one bad year during which we never opened up to each other about our feelings, she went on a date with another guy and I can't regain my trust towards her and it is destroying me even as I dream about our future together. I want to stay with the woman I love and have kids with her and leaving this relationship will leave me completely alone and unable to make contact with anyone else ever again for sure. I have no idea what to do and I need your help Reddit.

i worked on a new list for my group intern tournament. First i build some scum lists, but nothing worked out for me, so i got back to rebels and build this list:

**Han Solo (46)**
*C-3PO (3)*
*Gunner (5)*
*Millennium Falcon (1)*

**Corran Horn (35)**
*Push the Limit (3)*
*Accuracy Corrector (3)*
*Engine Upgrade (4)*

**Total: 100**

[Yet another squad builder](http://geordanr.github.io/xwing/?f=Rebel%20Alliance&amp;d=v3!s!36:-1,-1,63,21:2:-1:;75:18,107,-1,-1:-1:3:)


Han is the everyday fat han with C-3PO and the titel. The Gunner and Hans abilty should help to get a hit every time he shoots. I wanted to put Engine Upgrade on him, but the points man... the points...
So Corran should be the next pilot on this list and he is the star. Every imperial player freaks out about the accuracy corrector on the Tie Advanced. But how would it work on an E-Wing? Is it worth it? So hear me out. Corran Horn with Push the Limit and Enginge Upgrade is really maneuverable. So if he is in the firing arc of the enemy, he can boost + barrel roll out of it. If he is in the firing range he can focus and evade. Just like our good friend Sontir Fel (of course, not as good as he can do it). His Target Look doesn't matter, cause he will get two hit symbols out of his attacks anyway. The alternative would be Fire-Control-System and a R2-Astromech. But i think this way he is tankier with an ""ok"" output. And even if he gets to Range 1. Just shoot, look if you can get a better result with your focus token and use it. If you roll miserable, use your Accuracy corrector.


What do you think of this list? Could it work out the way i think?
And sorry for my english."

I have always had issues with studying and time management, as I didn't learn good habits in high school. I have some goals for the future which revolve around managing my time better:

* Publish my novel as an ebook. My coworker is going to edit but I'm having trouble sitting down to work on it when I am tempted by activities that don't involve thinking after a long day

* Find alternate income to quit job for more free time (ebook revenue? Fingers crossed.)

* Get involved at school, preferably a sport. I did a lot of sports in high school and miss them terribly.

* Do some work or internships to further my degree.

* Get good grades!!! Currently just below a 3.0 :(

* Date-obviously if I cannot manage my time dating would be difficult. Well it already is difficult...But that's another issue.

Volunteered for our campus' political party and international outreach groups

I've sent out probably a hundred applications thus far. USAjobs, private sector, and all in my field of work but have only gotten a handful of online interviews/none in person

31r5s4,2,2015-04-07,What's the best way to tell my boss I've got another offer?,Sionn3039,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/31r5s4/whats_the_best_way_to_tell_my_boss_ive_got/,"So I'm employed at a very small company, 8 people, where I am the only one doing dev work (the rest are accountants and support). I've recently won a pretty big award at a hackathon, and had a huge web application go live I proposed, developed, and tested for the company. I do good work for them, and they pay me quite well. 61k a year, a 6k annual bonus, and they sent me to a 5k conference this year. No benefits other than vacation and flex time. The work they have me doing when I'm not doing application development is VERY boring and kind of beneath my skill level, I'm doing that maybe 30-40% of my day. 

So I get through an interview with a bank downtown, and they are very interested. They give me a number at the end of the interview. Start me off at 70k a year, plus health, fitness allowance, rrsp matching, employee shares (dollar for dollar), and bonuses (5-10% of salary) when projects finish. He estimated I could easily be making over 80k with those bonuses. This would also be working in a software dev environment, which I haven't experienced yet other than a short uni internship, and this was the main reason I was looking elsewhere for work. The cons are it adds about 40 minutes to my commute (have to take the train instead of my vehicle, unless I want to pay 500/mo for parking). 

I could really use some second opinions. Love the people I work with here, some of the best bosses I've ever had, short commute, relaxed environment. But I'm leaning towards what seems best for me, and go with the bank, which is clearly offering me a better deal.

If I do decide to go with the bank, what is the most professional way to bring the offer up to my boss to see if he'd counter it? I really don't want to burn any bridges here.

31r7r0,0,2015-04-07,Being Honest with Resignation,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/31r7r0/being_honest_with_resignation/,"I’m a senior undergrad who is graduating this semester. I was hired in November as a full-time programmer while still in school and am being allowed to work under full-time while finishing my last semester. This brings me to about 25 hours/week and my pay is hourly and the idea is to switch me over to salary once school is finished. I was hired under the pretense that I intended to work here for the foreseeable future and that this wasn’t an internship nor was it a job only meant to get me through to graduation. Basically, they hired me while trusting that I’d stick around and I feel like that’s the only reason I was ultimately hired (I work for an insurance company and they’re having a hard time finding developers).
  
Here’s the thing, I’m gay and live in a not so tolerant state and have landed a job in a much more LGBT friendly city in another state. Is it appropriate to mention that this was my biggest motivator for finding another job when I put in my two-weeks to my boss? I’d like to be open and honest with him because I don’t want him to think I’ve been lying to his face for the past 6 months about sticking around. I feel grateful that they afforded me the opportunity to work while I’m in school; they’ve been very flexible with me and I didn’t have any internship experience before this job.
  
Edit: I want to add that harassment hasn't been an issue in the workplace but none of my coworkers know I'm gay in the first place. Telling my boss my motivation for leaving would be mostly to ease my conscience as well as give him a little PSA about the fact that discriminatory laws do in fact chase away much needed talent. "
31rdgw,9,2015-04-07,Me [34 M] at a major crossroads. My wife [32 F] has put all her chips on the table,throwaway2342a1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/31rdgw/me_34_m_at_a_major_crossroads_my_wife_32_f_has/,"My wife and I have been married for 7+ years now, we've had ups and downs but all in all we do love and respect each other.

We have no kids. She is a wonderful person and I love and care about her. While our relationship may lack the passion we both seek at times, all in all we are a good team in terms of supporting, loving and respecting one another.

I have developed a very solid career. She earned her bachelors degree before we met and, while I supported her through two different specialty certification programs she wanted to pursue, she has struggled to develop the career she wants.

Also, while I have not suggested she should, she has expressed that she isn’t interested in being a ""stay at home mom."" We didn't talk a ton about kids throughout our relationship, we had just said that we both wanted them someday and left it at that. It’s hard to get on the same page with kids if you aren’t on the same page with other aspects of your future together (where you’re going to live, timeline, etc.).

She grew up in a big city; I grew up in a college town. Now, we live in a mid-sized town (350k people). Last summer, we separated for a couple of months as she was feeling frustrated and trapped on account of not being able to develop the career she visualized. As a ""city girl,"" she wanted (and felt she needed) to be in a bigger city in order for her career to flourish, based on the nature of her degree (international relations).

We were both burnt out on the pressures of the relationship and, while we love and respect each other, we rarely saw eye-to-eye on ""future"" things.

During our brief time apart, she found a program that really interested her in one of her favorite cities (in California). Now, she has told me that her plan is to move to the other side of the country to pursue her masters degree in hopes of kick-starting her career. This isn’t something she dropped on me out of the blue, she told me she was interested in it, she went through the application process, she has been accepted, and now she is set on going.

She has made it very clear that she wants me to come, she is being very sweet to me, kind, and loving (as she always has been).

Notice this was not a joint decision. She has said, ""this is what I'm going to do,"" as she says she will live with resentment if she does not follow this dream of hers. Her proposal is to move to Cali for 3 years (1 for the program, and 2 for an internship thereafter), with the idea that we will move back to where we currently live (NC) afterwards.

I have a few concerns with this. First of all, I am happy here where we are. I have a great career here, my family is close, and I have friends, projects I am working on, roots here.

Secondly, I don't want to be the one living in resentment if I decide to ""tag along"" and move out to Cali when this is really what she wants, not necessarily what WE want. In her defense, perhaps she needed to use this all-in tactic because she had tried to convince me to move before and (aside from agreeing to live abroad for one year, which we did) I have not been receptive to the idea of a longer term resettlement.

Thirdly, being the practical type, I am still feeling the financial sting from moving abroad as we still haven’t gotten back to where we were financially before the move. So I am concerned about doing the same thing and taking another hit financially by moving across the country only to move back in a few years.

Fourth, as much as we’d like to, we can’t predict the future. Who’s to say she doesn’t have trouble finding a job in NC upon completion of her program and decides she would rather pursue the next step in her career by moving to yet another location? I do not want go through all this again and again. Her official stance is that after the 3 years we would move back to NC and start a family. It’s not that I’m in a rush to start a family, I am just aware of the biological clock considerations and trying to keep these things in mind.

I understand that relationships are about compromise, but given our ages, and given the fact I’m already feeling some concerns over the timeline, well… I think you can see why I’m at a crossroads.

Making matters worse, I have some lingering concerns over my own position in the relationship in the sense that I feel certain “external factors” played a role in us getting together and, while I now take responsibility for my choices, I do feel those question marks coming up again as I approach the prospect of having to make this decision.

On the one hand, I feel she has placed a major burden on me by putting “all the weight of the relationship” on my shoulders. On the other hand, I understand her desire to follow her dreams and I don’t think she’s being intentionally manipulative. Thanks for any insight.

**tl;dr**: Have been through ups and downs in my relationship with my wife. While we were briefly separated she decided she wanted to pursue a masters degree on the other side of the country and now wants me to come along. I’m not so sure."

31rkuk,1,2015-04-07,Recertifying through NASM as a personal trainer seems like a rip-off.,jiggysuave,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/31rkuk/recertifying_through_nasm_as_a_personal_trainer/,"I work as a personal trainer at my university's gym. I absolutely love it, but I am starting to think about what I will do when I need to recertify in a year. I absolutely love my job. Working with my clients and seeing them improve and progress is one of the most rewarding things I have ever experienced, especially in a work setting. 

A little about me: I am a junior studying Nutrition. After I graduate next year, I want to complete a dietetic internship and become a registered dietitian. My hope is to personal train part-time in order to finance this internship and then hopefully start a career in which I will be able to combine personal training and nutrition counseling. 

Now, about my situation:

I work VERY part-time (usually only 6 hours a week) and only make $11/hour. I have been working here since September and in that time I have not even come close to making back the $700 I spent on my certification in the first place, let alone making a profit. By this time next year, I will need to fork up another $400 at least on continuing education credits and a $99 recertification fee. If I know I am going to recertify, this summer will be the time to do the CEU's because I will not be taking classes, so I need to decide relatively soon. 

I am having such a hard time seeing the value in recertifying. NASM is as much of a business as any other. They charge so much for their programs because they want to make money and they know people will pay. When I am working, I do not feel like I use my formal training very much at all and mostly call on knowledge I have gained through experience and personal reading/research. It seems like the only thing I will be gaining from recertification is a really expensive receipt. On the other hand, if I ever want to be employed at another gym (like when I'm in my dietetic internship), having a current certification will likely be a requirement. 

I'm hoping some of you might have some advice for me. I feel like I just need to hear some other points of view so that I can get a better grasp on my situation and what will be the best financial decision for me. 

TL;DR: Being a personal trainer is costing me more money than I am making, but that might change in the future. Is it worth spending the money to recertify?"
31rled,0,2015-04-07,"Possibly moving to NYC for the summer, need neighborhood and apartment advice please!",eeisner,AskNYC,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/31rled/possibly_moving_to_nyc_for_the_summer_need/,"Hey all! So it looks like I am going to secure an UNPAID internship in the city (East Village area) this summer, starting around the 3rd week of May and going through at least all of June and possibly (hopefully) July and on. Considering I'm from LA (about to graduate school in Tucson, AZ), and the most time I've spent in NYC in the past 8-10 years was in an airport hotel, I need some serious advice. And since I don't see much on here about summer moving, I'll ask some questions....

So a bit of background on myself, as it will probably help you friendly people advise me... I'm 21 (22 in May), I'm pretty introverted and not the kind of person to go clubbing, but going to concerts is one of my favorite things to do. I love indie/alt rock and folk/rock, and I play guitar. I also love sports - college basketball and football, the NBA, MLB, etc (being from LA I don't have an NFL team). Craft beer is my favorite drink of choice, and I love spending time in beer bars and sharing beer.

Alright, now that you all can silently judge me, I have some questions about moving to NYC...

1) What neighborhoods should I look at? I know Manhattan is going to be way out of budget (can't really afford more than $1500 a month, and would prefer cheaper. In fact, my roommates and I pay 780+elect a month per room in a 4bed/4bath apartment). I hear Williamsburg is a trendy (please don't say ""hipster""... i hate that word. its just like saying something is ""gay"" or ""retarded"" in its ambiguity and demeaning nature, but not in its offensive nature) young place to live, but overpriced. So then I hear that Greenpoint is a solid spot and easy to get to concerts and what not in Williamsburg, but getting to the city is a pain in the ass from Greenpoint. So, help?

2) Where are the best places to find short term, monthly leases? Especially since I won't be able to look at places in NYC before I apply for a lease. So everything is done online. Is AirBNB a good place for monthly rentals? Any places that are aimed for recent college grads or summer interns that aren't crazy overpriced? or best ways to avoid craigslist scams/these absurd broker fees I keep hearing about? Obviously as this is a temporary move (for now - hopefully it becomes a real job!), furnished is a necessity, and it would be great to move in to a place that someone just needs a roommate, so that dishes and all that are already there.

3) What are red flags I should be aware of? Or on the flip side, what are things I can see that are instant great signs?

4) Anything else I should know or look for? Any questions I forgot to ask that you can answer for me?

Thank you all so much!"

31roio,17,2015-04-07,My quick story with Anxiety: How I got better and how I relapsed,Buttwallaby,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/31roio/my_quick_story_with_anxiety_how_i_got_better_and/,"I had my first panic attack in 2012.  I remember the moment vividly, because it changed my life.  I was watching The Machinist with my girlfriend at night and had a bad heart palpitation.  My heart raced for hours.  I thought I was going to die.  My father has had anxiety his whole life and was able to talk me down so I could sleep at night and go to the doctors the next morning. 

They ran all sorts of tests and I even wore a heart monitor for a week.  All tests came back perfectly normal, but I was CONVINCED they were missing something.  Or I was just crazy.  Crazy... this had never occurred to me before.  How could I be crazy? ME!  CRAZY!  

This had a huge effect on me.  I stopped exercising.  I stopped watching movies for fear of another panic attack.  I avoided any social situations that I could, because I didn't want to have a panic attack.  I kept calling out of work.  My life was spiraling out of control and this depressed me.  Depression made my anxiety way worse.  My next panic attack happened at work, but luckily I had a great boss who understood and let me leave.  This was extremely embarrassing though.  I felt like I couldn’t work.  How could I live if I can’t work?  I was hopeless.

I started to develop a sort of psychosis in which I feared there was something wrong with my health or my body and it would usually come true (or at least I thought it did).  Heart trouble, stomach trouble, breathing issues, etc. I would worry at the slightest stomach ache, the smallest heart palpitation, or the slightest feeling of not taking a full enough breath.  I even “developed” a weird stomach virus that lasted for weeks and hurt like a bitch.  Felt like my gut was stuck and bloated.  It eventually sent me to get my stomach CAT-scanned.  I say “developed”, because I knew it was fake.  How did I know this?  After my CAT-scan results came back negative my weird stomach virus went away alarmingly fast.  So my stomach fears were gone, but my breathing and my heart were still on my mind.  This made me take constant trips to my primary care doctor.  

He tried prescribing medicine (SSRIs), but I was fearful of the side effects/withdrawal if I missed a dose so I never took one, until he convinced me to try a very low dose of Lorazepam (not an SSRI).  I want to say it cured me, but it didn’t, because I cannot take it forever.  It did feel like it put a damper on my anxiety.  I knew my anxiety was there, but it felt fuzzy and repressed.  It made me tired, but I was finally able to work again!  I always kept a pill with me.  I gained confidence.  Confidence is HUGE in struggling with anxiety.  Confidence that you can overcome it or deal with it.  

I started to exercise and meditate again.  I could handle social situations.  My girlfriend wasn’t worried about me all the time.  I started doing great in school again.  I made the fucking dean’s list for fucks sake.  God damn, now I was happy.  I was full of confidence.  I could do almost anything….

I finished the best semester I’ve ever had.  Christmas was right around the corner, I was about to go on a trip to Peru with my girlfriend, I even nailed an interview for an internship.  Shit, I was even losing weight and looking good.  I started going to parties, I felt like I didn’t need to exercise as rigorously, I stopped meditating, I didn’t even prepare for next semester.  Why should I?  I’m fucking golden, man.  It will be easy.  I even took up smoking marijuana again because it made me feel even better.

This would end up being the worst mistake I’ve ever made in my entire life.

My brimming confidence made time fly by.  Before I knew it I was training for my internship that I was totally unprepared for on the first day of classes I didn’t prepare for either.  I didn’t even know what rooms my classes were in.  I also caught a pretty nasty cold.  This was my final semester.  I would have to get a professional job in the fall.  The perfect storm was brewing.  My first day of my internship would set in motion the worst anxiety I’ve ever felt. 

I couldn’t breathe.  I couldn’t eat.  I couldn’t sit still.  I felt nauseous.  I had constant diarrhea.  I couldn’t even see my girlfriend, because her mere presence made me anxious.  I couldn’t make her upset.  Not now.  Not like this.  I decided to quit smoking.  This made everything worse, but I had to do it.  It gave me worse panic attacks.  Never again.  I quit my internship.  I couldn’t handle it.  My depression came back and I was put into therapy by my doctor.  I’m still not over my anxiety and depression, but I am getting better with each day.  I just need to grab ahold of that confidence and never let it slip away.

Do not brush away your anxiety.  You have to treat it with respect.  It can come back at you at any moment.  I don’t want to scare anyone, but I do want people to be aware. 
 
You CAN get over it.  You probably WILL!  Just remember to try.  Try. Try. Try.  You’ll find something that works and once you do you have to do it for a long time.  Once you can accept this I believe you can live normal again.

31roti,0,2015-04-07,Internship Interview Questions.,[deleted],sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/31roti/internship_interview_questions/,"Hi all,

Not sure if this is going to be too specific for this sub,, but I figured it was most related to this sub, but here I go. I have an interview coming up tomorrow for a ""Distributed Systems"" internship. I was trying to figure out which skills I would need to brush up on before the interview. The position is with a regional insurance company in NYS. Unfortunatley the intership posting has been removed since I applied so I can't link it. 

When I originally applied for the position, they only listed that I needed at least a 3.0 GPA and be enrolled as a junior or senior in a related degree program. I fulfill all of those requirements.

I also had to answer whether or not I had a working knowledge of the OSI model, which I do, but I will be sure to study it in depth before I go in tomorrow. It also asked me if I knew what ping and trace route were, which I do.

As a final note, I looked up my interviewer on linkedin, and it says he is the distributed systems team lead and the only skills he has listed is Windows Administration, VMware and Citrix.

Based off of this, can you guys give me some ideas of the types of questions I should be prepared for?

Thank You!"
31rt1q,7,2015-04-07,How can I successfully move away as soon as I get my college degree? Assuming my parents won't help me at all after I come out to them.,Gaythrowaway454,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/31rt1q/how_can_i_successfully_move_away_as_soon_as_i_get/,"Here's the deal. I live in the Midwest. I hate the cold winters here and how everything looks so dead for half the year. I basically go into a depression every winter and come out of it every spring. I don't think I could be happy here like that even if my family situation were perfect. 

I'm also gay, and my parents are very homophobic. My dad  reminisces about how he used to beat up gay kids in his high school and laments that kids don't do that anymore (I'm not exaggerating).  My mom would probably be more accepting, but she also is against gay people and really wants me to have kids. My parents told my sister and I when we were 11 (gay marriage was becoming a hot social issue) that if we were gay they would kick us out. 

I ended up with a full ride scholarship to a state school so I thought it was sensible to stay instead of moving then. I'm really starting to regret that but I have too many units to transfer. As soon as I get my degree I want to move to Los Angeles. I've already made some pretty good gay friends there via Facebook. 

I'll have a biology (another reason why I hate everything being dead looking here for 1/2 the year) degree after 3 more semesters. ~3.6 gpa. 

I've never lied and said that I was straight to anyone, but hiding that I'm gay has basically consumed my life. I have extreme anxiety talking on the phone or even going in public for fear that people are going to figure it out and it will get back to my parents (small town). So I don't have any work experience yet except for 1 (maybe two if I get one of the ones I applied to this summer) internship. 

I think this is going to get better once I move and am out because I can talk to the few people who I've told I'm gay on the phone and even FaceTime them. So my main problem is that I'm going to look really bad on paper as far as my résumé is concerned for awhile. I will force myself to deal with the anxiety and at least get a  job at a store or something this summer if I don't get an internship. This will help me save money because I have virtually no expenses. 

Can someone just give me more perspective on the things I need to do to make this work? How much money to you think I should try to save before moving (obviously more is better but a reasonable figure would be really helpful)? How do people get jobs in new towns without in person interviewing for them? I'd ideally like to have one before I commit to moving. 

I really have to make this work, because I feel so trapped and unhappy here. Moving to LA is the one happy prospect in my life, but I don't think I have enough worldly experience to make a good enough plan to make it work. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks"
31ru8f,12,2015-04-07,First post-- introduction and my story,Amberglas,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/31ru8f/first_post_introduction_and_my_story/,"I've been a lurker on Reddit for a while, but just made an account and decided to introduce myself (and probably spill my guts for a while).

A lot of the memories I have from when I was very young are of my mother.  I remember her playing with me and teaching me.  I also remember her getting mad and yelling at me for not doing my chores, or not answering questions correctly.  When I started to cry, she would scream at me to stop, and I learned to hold my breath and choke down tears.  Later, she'd say it was all my fault, that I started yelling first.  As I grew up more, this translated into being yelled at for bad grades or for using the Internet for non-educational purposes.  Even today, I have a reflexive urge to hide non-work things when somebody walks into the room, and to pretend I'm doing better than I am in my classes when somebody asks.

Growing up, I thought this was all normal.  There were a few big blowups-- being caught playing Dragonfable in middle school, stuff like that-- but I thought each of those was my fault in the first place.

Things came to a lot more of a head with the last few years of high school.  I'm still untangling what parts of my goals were genuinely mine, and which were heavily influenced by my parents.  I do think that I wanted to apply to prestigious universities.  I don't think I wanted to spend every day for months working on the essays, getting panic attacks, and sinking deeper into depression.

My parents-- especially my mom-- really really wanted me to 'succeed'.  I don't think any of their actions were based in malice.  But a lot of the things I did in school-- AP classes, a smorgasbord of extracurriculars-- were things that my parents suggested.  When I started to think about a college major, I realized that I didn't know what I liked.  I didn't know what it felt like to really enjoy a subject matter.  I just knew what it felt like to have a desire to get a good grade or face the wrath of my parents.

I also didn't go out a lot in high school.  I had people that I talked to at school, sure, but I rarely hung out with them outside of school-related stuff.  To do anything like that, I had to present convincing reasons and promise that I would do extra work to make up for the time spent.

Paradoxically, at the same time, I was always told to make more of an effort at social things.  Sometimes when she was angry, my mom would berate me for having no friends.  I hated shopping for clothes because it was so stressful-- my mom would pick out things and get mad if I didn't want to try them on.  If I tried them on, she'd say how good they looked and then get mad if I disagreed.  She was always pushing me to wear more girly things.  These days, I sometimes feel the urge to get cute things, but there's always stress about it.  I hate mirrors.  I hate doing anything fancy to my hair.  My mom would always want me to curl my hair, straighten my hair, braid it.  The one constant was that I had to have bangs.  These days, even the feel of hair on my forehead is unpleasant.

During this time period, there were a few people that, looking back, I appreciate an incredible amount.  One guy always made an effort to include me in plans, even though I would usually have to say no.  One of my best girl friends had a sort of similar situation with her parents, and I could count on her to understand.  Another guy was very affectionate (to everyone, not just me), and in a very non-pushy way, he offered hugs and the like.  It's probably thanks to him that I'm now comfortable with physical contact.  Not to mention all of you guys-- I spent a lot of last year lurking on RBN, reading your stories for support.  Thank you.

Things eased up in the second semester of senior year, thankfully.  Now, in my second semester of college, I've gotten to a reasonable place with my parents; we talk pretty regularly, but I have space.  In retrospect, I don't think either of my parents is a full-blown narcissist.  I think that my mom has some FLEAS, and that my dad has gradually become increasingly enabling.  I don't think they're bad people; they're just people that I honestly don't have a huge amount of affection for, not anymore.  I'm probably going to maintain contact unless something significant changes; they've gotten a lot more reasonable now that I'm at university.

When I came to university, I was uncertain about what I wanted to do.  I ended up in a dorm that I love, and on a floor of people that I've come to consider my family; maybe more my family than my parents.  At any rate, they're part of the family that I chose for myself, and they're very important to me.  We take care of each other.  It's incredible to me that, with the small amount of information I had coming in, my choice turned out to be a really good one.

The same is true for my major.  I thought I wanted to major in computer science.  My first semester, I couldn't take one of the classes I'd planned on, and I ended up taking a course that generally funnels into electrical engineering.  From that, as well as doing some independent projects and talking to upperclassmen, I've essentially decided that I want to study electrical engineering.  This semester, I took a few more courses in that direction, and I couldn't be happier about my choice.  The classes are hard, but I'm really enjoying them.

A year ago, I wouldn't have dreamed of things being as good as they are right now.  I'm happy.  I have a room filled with things that I love, that nobody can force me to clean or organize.  I have friends that I spend tons of time with, and that I trust with everything.  I tie my hair back in a ponytail.  It's now back to its natural curly state, and I love it.  I don't have any mirrors in my room, and I spend very little time worrying about how I look.  I'm studying subjects that I love, and am working on getting less stressed about internships and the like (specifically, dealing with bosses).  I'm more confident than I've ever been, I'm learning a lot, and I'm not afraid anymore.

If you're in a bad situation right now-- I promise things get better.  There are many wonderful people in the world, even if we weren't lucky enough to have them for parents.

TL;DR: growing up wasn't great, things are better now.  Thanks to you guys for sharing your stories; it's part of what kept me going during the dark times."

We made plans around the future, were living together, and here family had begun to talk about when I proposed, being a part of the family, etc. Then out of the blue, she dumps me citing reasons such as she's holding me back, she's not good enough for me, she loves me and wants me to wait, etc. It was shocking and devastating, but after we broke up and I moved out, she went no-contact, so there wasn't much to do besides move on. This was over six months ago which leads us to today...
(Cheers for reading this as it's a wall of text and a little bit outside the norm for posts on r/relationships)


So fast-forward 6+ months and I'm doing fine. I've got a great internship, I'm graduating from a tier-one university within the year with a good degree and have job offers abroad, moved into an even nicer apartment then the one we were sharing, hit the gym, got a new girlfriend who is amazing, got a dog...in summary life is good. I still think about my ex from time to time and wonder how she is and why she ended everything as she didn't really offer any concrete explanation besides her insecurities, but life goes on.


Or so I thought. Yesterday, I caught lunch with a mutual friend (Lets call her Phoebe) of my ex (Lets call her Monica) and myself. The conversation turned to my Monica and she asked if I had heard. As we have been no-contact and I no longer follow her on social media (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc.), I explained to Phoebe I really didn't know much of how she was doing. Phoebe proceeds to explain that she has dropped out of school, and begins showing me pictures from her social media. Monica has not only dropped out of school, she has also began drinking quite a bit, has gotten back onto certain drugs that she quit when we started dating, has gained quite a bit of weight, and is dating this guy who is 300+ lbs. with hippie-hair down to his waist who has no job, doesn't go to school, and is living with her. Needless to say, it was a bit of a sickening feeling seeing someone I care about making the decisions she is, but she's an adult and it's her life and these are the choices she is making.


I am very concerned as when I first started seeing Monica, she was a bit of a mess. Suicidal, Anorexic, abusing drugs and alcohol, struggling with issues of self-esteem, abandonment from her parents, etc. Throughout the course of our relationship, we got her professional help, worked through her issues, helped her kick anorexia and get to a healthy and happy place, physically and mentally. With my help, she started community college and was blossoming into a confident, beautiful, healthy woman and was happier then ever...and now it appears she is sliding backwards.


As I mentioned earlier, it is sickening to see this happen to the girl I once loved and still do care for her well-being and health. I don't understand the decisions she is making and am very concerned as maybe this could be stemming from her mental health issues (She is bi-polar) and because very few people know she has these issues, they see no problem? I guess I'm just looking for anybody who's been in a similar situation or understands her thought process to weigh in and give me some advice on how to handle or move past this.


TL;DR; Ex-girlfriend has gone back of the deep end, confused as how to proceed?"

Hence my confidence isn't the highest right now.

With the end of school in a few weeks, I'm scared that I won't find an internship. Therefore I really need to NAIL this interview. 

I have received a ton of feedback from this community, which has led me to getting interviews. Now I need to sell myself as the best candidate.  I know you guys can help my situation, thanks!

EDIT: To be more precise, I would like advice on good ways of coming off the the interviewer. In essence what would someone asking behavioral questions like to see in the applicant. What would someone asking technical questions like to see in the applicant?
I usually come off as an excited and eager to learn type of person, who may be too apologetic at times and I sometimes interrupt people.

Hey guys,

I've had a look in the wiki and past posts but couldn't find any posts that are closely related aside from [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Brogress/comments/21s9kj/m18510_140_to_170_30lbs_13_months_395x1_squat/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2cz87v/progress_m2954_from_skinnyfat_to_aspiring/).

I am 22, 5'10 and currently weigh around 68 kilos. I was severely overweight when I was 12 (probably around 70 kilos at 12, when I was a lot shorter) and basically lost weight through starving myself. People often come up to me and tell me I'm skinny yet I have not taken my shirt off in public in 10 years.. something I want to change. Here's a picture of me currently.

I am motivated and I have been training since September but with very little results. At the moment I'm on an internship in a big (and expensive) city so the only real option I have available to me is the work gym, which sadly doesn't have a power rack so don't have the option of Starting Strength.

What I am looking for is some tips on diet / workout routine. I've been eating the same thing every day for awhile in order to hit macros but even though I feel like it's the right thing, perhaps I'm completely wrong. Here's my diet:
**Breakfast**
Half a mug of oats (around 50g) mixed with a whole mug of full fat milk

**Lunch**
2 full-size bagels with 40g of pb and 40g strawberry jam

**Dinner**
White rice (100g), chicken (100g) and broccoli/usually like 3 other vegetables mixed in and some Extra Virgin Olive Oil to make up calories

**Shake** (have this after work out)
Instant Oats (126g)
Impact Whey Protein (50g)
Whole Milk (400ml)
Banana

This adds up to 3052 **calories**, 394g **carbs**, 101g **fat**, 146g **protein**

The workouts I've been doing for the past 2 months is the following, as advised by a personal trainer at my current gym:

**Workout 1** (Monday and Friday)
* *5 min warm up by rowing*
* *Smith's Chest Press 4x8*
* *Incline Dumbbell Fly 3x10*
* *Dumbbell Chest Press 4x8*
* *Shoulder Press Machine incremental reps, 8 &gt; 10 &gt; 12 &gt; 15*
* *Dumbbell Lateral Raise 4x6*
* *Barbell Bicep Curl 4x8*
* *Cables Tricep Pull-down 4x8*
* *Push-ups 3x10*

**Workout 2** (Wednesday)
* *8 min warm up doing moderate cardio*
* *Leg Curl Machine 3x10*
* *Leg Extension Machine 3x10*
* *Dumbbell Lunges 2x16*
* *Dumbbell Bent Row 3x12*
* *Lat Pull Down 3x12*
* *Plank*
* *Sit ups*
* *Russian Twists*

Is what I'm doing completely wrong? I feel like my weights haven't increased that much even though I'm trying to push myself. I am open for any suggestions as I feel like I've been stuck in the same state for so long, and I see people posting progress pics here of looking very different after 2 months. Can I get a normal body with just dumbbells / machines or is it necessary for me to find a different gym?

Sorry for the wall of text, please let me know if you need any other information so I can provide it. Thanks!"

	From my childhood, I have always been passionate about machines as well as structures. As a result, I therefore developed an interest of understanding the sophistry behind all this. Time and time again I always found myself disassembling whatever I could lay my hands on just to satisfy my curiosity. With time, out of many questions here and there, I came to learn that the mind that was behind all of this was referred to as engineering, and there I made my mind that one day I will be an engineer. To live my dream, I am looking forward to join (institution) where I believe my dream will be realized. 
	After various enquiries here and there, I have come to decide with certainty that (name of institution) is the best place for me o achieve my dreams.  I have also looked at the academic requirements that the university requires for a student to be admitted in an engineering course and given my performance, I am guaranteed that  my A-level result,  which will be out by May this year will guarantee may the necessary points required to join this institution. 
	Apart from school education, I have been engaging myself with engineering work. One such involvement was an intern with Al Jaber Engineering Cop for a period of two weeks as a trainee site engineer. Additionally, I have participated in more than one engineering seminars which have all increased my desire and admiration of engineering as a profession. 
	My main goal in life is to open my own engineering company, and I am therefore not only looking forward for an undergraduate degree in civil engineering, but also a masters as well as PhD of the same. This is necessary if I am going to realize my dreams of becoming an established engineer.
	In conclusion, I believe that (the name of institution) is the best place for me if I am to live my dream. This is one of the major reasons as to why I want to join this institution, for it is only through good education in a good university that can ultimately enable me to be what I want to be in future.

Endless fatigue, feelings of hopelessness, going from an honors student to missing so many classes and assignments that I barely graduated. Then when college started, I began to have off and on periods of hypo-mania. I switched majors so many times, they would seem appealing to me for a short period of time and I would get really excited, applying for as many internships as possible and then lose interest really fast. I dropped out of school 3 times ""to figure things out"", the 3rd being the most recent and permanent. I guess figuring things out means working food service industry to get by and going out drinking every night.
Last summer I was hospitalized during a mixed episode and put on an anti-depressant (Effexor). I became sober and tried to get on track to stabilize myself. The medication really fucked me up, my psychiatrist would not listen to my concerns, I finally stopped cold turkey back in January. 
The side effects of the withdrawal has worn off, and I'm now on Lamictal after being diagnosed with bipolar II from a new psychiatrist. The new medication has helped SO MUCH, but I feel more lost than ever on what my next step is. I started massage therapy school in March, but again dropped out (partly out of fear of getting halfway in and losing interest and more money, partly because I realized if I'm in an episode my anxiety and irritability would me not to want to touch anyone) To be quite honest I have no clue what I want in life, or what I enjoy. For me, my hypo-mania manifests as irritability, rarely a pleasurable experience. I want more out of life than this, even though I'm gaining strength and awareness about my mental health, I still have no idea on what my goals and passions are.

I'm a statistics major, who's an actuarial science minor and has taken lots of business courses (which I mentioned in my resume *and* cover letter), I've passed P, and I am *very* good with programming, Excel, SAS, R, et cetera.

I completed one internship successfully, but this was in high school almost 9 years ago.  So I have 7+ years of history of having a job, but none of it is directly relevant to the positions I've been applying for (lab technician/research assistant, etc).

I applied for a position as a QA Packing Inspector just shy of a week ago, and received a call back from the recruiter that posted it (didn't realize it was him at the time).  The position offered an hourly rate starting at $17/hr.  However, instead of discussing the position that was listed, he asked if I might be interested in an entry level job as an environ. lab tech.  I told him yes, and he said he'd contact me next week regarding an interview.  Problem is, the position he offered me is one starting at $10/hr.

I completely understand that I'm new in terms of entering the laboratory sector and don't have as much bargaining power as a result, but I'm coming from sales and serving jobs where I was able to consistently net ~$14-$15/hr when averaged out.  The area that apparently is known for offering lower wages, but is it worth it to take a pay cut that drastic just to work in what I studied in school?  Mind you, they prefer candidates with a BS degree.

It sucks that despite the debt I've taken on attending school to try and ensure some modicum of success in life - in a scientific field no less - is being rewarded with what feels like more debt and less pay.  I've also heard that I might be limiting myself for pay in the future - essentially my next employer might not be willing to bump my pay up to something closer to market rate if they view my salary history and see that I was willing to work for something much lower.

Here's a C/P of the listing from the recruiter:


We are currently seeking an Environmental Lab Technician:

BA/BS degrees preferred (Chemistry, Biology, Microbiology)

AS Degree or HS Diploma with 2+ years of experience will be accepted

*Any experience with water testing or working in an environmental lab is a major plus.

*This is a long term contract position

Position Requirements:
pH
Turbidity
Titrations
HPLC
Wet Chemisty
Water Sampling/Testing




tl;dr
new grad sans recent experience has potential job offer in scientific field.  Job pay is considerably less than pay in non-scientific/retail field, despite requesting B. Sci. degree in posting.  Worth it to take job just to start gaining experience in field?"

I have been admitted to U of I Business for Management with concentration on Entrepreneurship. I am still waiting on IU, applied for entrepreneurship and corporate innovations.

I am pretty positive that I will get into the Kelley Business Program, but if not I would just go to U of I.
However, if I do get into Kelley, I will have a huge dilemma because of the rankings.

Here are the breakdowns.
 
1. Global Rankings UIUC #29 vs IU  #100~150 
(Shows international brand name)

2. MBA rankings in the nation UIUC # 45 vs IU #15 
(This is important because if I go to IU and do well over there, I am automatically looking at schools above top 15, but if I go to UIUC, I have to crush it to get to IU level.

3. Undergrad Business rankings in the nation UIUC #25 vs IU #10
(I would not care if it was #50 vs #60, but 10+rank difference is huge when it is on top)

4. Major Rankings. Management at UIUC #25 in the nation, but Entrepreneurship is #3 in the nation for IU.

That is my dilemma. I am Illinois resident, but the money isn't much issue since there is not much of disparity. And I am pretty sure I can pay back all my tuition after graduating from either school because either school has good business program. 

Thus, my questions are as follows.

1. I am also planning to get MBA after couple years of working. Would IU give me slight advantage into getting into M7?

2. Is it easier to get internships at Kelley than U of I?

3. Would Kelley School of Business have significant amount of exposure to consulting firms over U of I since the rankings for the major is higher and the rankings for business in general is also higher?

4. How is the social life at IU? U of I is pretty insane. 

Thanks. 

WOW. Not sure why all my comments are down voted all together holistically especially within 30minutes. I assume that this situation is caused by one person, who has been irritated by my post. I was being respectful and genuinely asking for insight.

Please help me find some closure.,dudebro2000,AskVet,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/31sve1/angrydepressedconfused_please_help_me_find_some/,"My cat recently died and although I feel like I shouldn't blame anyone, I'm having a hard time not blaming the vet and/or myself for what happened. I'm hoping people can weigh in and help me get through this.

Backstory: I adopted my kitten when I was away for my summer  internship in 2013. I had one semester left of college, so after my internship I had an 8 hour car drive to get back to school. The vet prescribed Alprazolam to ease her anxiety/stress for the trip. I gave her 1/2 tablet and it completely knocked her out and she slept the whole drive and had an easy time.

After I graduated college the company I interned for offered to bring me back. I had some left over Alprazolam from the previous prescription so I gave my kitty a full dose this time (1 tablet) since she had grown quite a bit. It didn't put her to sleep, and instead it seemed like she was fighting it, and the entire 8 hour drive she was crying and afraid and very high stress. 

Fast forward to two weeks ago, I had another job opportunity and decided to move back home closer to friends and family. I didn't want her to stress out like she did the last move, and I wanted to make it easy on her, so I asked the same vet if it was alright if I gave her a higher dosage of the Alprazolam - since it didn't seem to do the trick last time. 

Instead she suggested Acepromazine, and suggested that I do a trial run with the drug before the actual move. So two weekends ago I did a trial run at home, and it seemed like she responded OK to it, but it didn't put her to sleep like I was hoping. She simply walked around ""drunk"" and acted out of it. Because the trial run wasn't even in a high stress situation and it still didn't put her to sleep, I asked the vet if it was ok to give her a higher dosage of that (the Ace).

Instead she suggested I combine the two drugs - I thought this sounded scary so I asked if this was safe and confirmed it would be alright. When I went back to the office to pick up a new prescription of the Alprazolam I asked the vet again, to confirm it was safe to give my kitty both. She said yes it was perfectly safe.

So, this previous Saturday - about an hour and a half before I was going to leave, I gave her the Alp and then 30-45 mins later I gave her the Ace. When we were about to leave my girlfriend checked on her (she was in her pet carrier) and she desperately wanted out the cage and looked really scared. My girlfriend opened the cage to let her our and literally as she was trying to crawl out she seized and/or had a heart attack and died in my girlfriend's arms.

We rushed her to the vet and they got her heart beating again but couldn't get it to keep. The vet said she probably had an undetected heart condition and that the mixture shouldn't have been the cause, but I don't know if I believe her since she might have just been covering her own ass.

I'm just so frustrated and heartbroken because I am pretty sure the mixture of the two drugs is what did it. I confirmed with the vet twice that it was safe because it didn't sound right to me, so I'm angry at myself for listening to the vet and not going with my instinct.

This cat meant everything to me and got me through some rough times, and she was just taken from me like that with no warning. I've been unpacking at my new apartment and she is not here to annoy me or get in my way, and I keep finding her things in boxes. She was such a good friend and companion and I just can't get over the fact that she's gone now.

I keep finding ways to blame myself, like maybe I should have fed her more before the dosage, or maybe I should have tried to do it without drugs. It's just so indescribable how frustrating this is and how much I miss her.

Does anyone here think it was the vets fault or that she gave me bad advice? Or do you think my kitty really had a heart problem?

31svnf,1,2015-04-07,Is going to Audio School Worth it?,erniepotts,audioengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/31svnf/is_going_to_audio_school_worth_it/,"With so many people creating music today, I'm asked on a almost everyday, is going to audio school worth it? As a graduate of The Conservatory of Recording Arts and Science, I definitely feel that education is important to your career, but does being educated mean you need to go to school?

So before I attempt to answer this question. I'd like to share my experience at CRAS.

CRAS was an awesome experience, from day one they put us in an INTENSE program.  CRAS is not just some school where you can just pay money and you ""earn"" a degree when its all said and done.  They are very strict.  You must meet their attendance and G.P.A. policy.  Plenty of people failed out of CRAS and if you think it will be walk in the park you are definitely wrong. CRAS IS FOR SERIOUS STUDENTS.

While at CRAS you will learn how to be a great assistant engineer.  This is really what the school is all about. Of course you will learn signal flow, recording, mixing etc. But the two fundamentals of CRAS is how to  land your internship and then becoming an assistant engineer.

After CRAS my career path was unique. I got a great gig right away that led to me become the head engineer at a small studio within 6 months of me being out in the industry.  I also landed a big gig with a major label and was even offered a production deal during that time too. But that was just a blessing, most people coming out of school don't see those type of advancements right away. So please do not assume your result will be similar.

A lot people come to CRAS or any of the other audio schools but they really don't want to be an engineer, mixer, mastering engineer, live sound guy etc. All they want some kind of edge over competition or a certificate proving they know what their doing.   Those type of people usually don't make it pass 12 weeks. If you are not serious about working in a recording studio or in live sound Audio School is probably not for you.

So now that I've given you my experience, let me dispel some myths about audio schools in general.

School will not help you land your first gig.

In most cases people assume that coming out of school they will be able to get a job, however that is just not the case. Especially in audio where major recordings are shutting down left and right.  Not to mention that a huge portion of recording studios require you to intern for free for at least 18 months with no pay before you ever step foot in the studio.

People do not value degrees from audio schools.

After getting my degree, I thought I would be easily get a job over applicants who didn't have degrees but I was wrong. People are still managing to land internships as major recording studios with out any formal training.  But you gotta be the best of the best.

It doesn't matter what school you go to, once you graduate you will be an intern.

With so many schools popping up left and right another question within it self is what school should I go to?  Of course I love CRAS but it doesn't matter if you go to a university, community college, CRAS, or Full Sail.  Anyone looking to get a job in audio will be an intern first, if you're not willing to intern, audio school is not for you.

So what is the benefit of going to audio school?

Going to audio school will give you connections that you can not get anywhere else.

My buddy is currently working down in nashville with a major recording artist as we speak. He finally got his big break but cant handle the load. So who do you think he called to give some work to????? He offered to split the gig 50/50 with me because we built a great relationship over time.

Build relationships are definitely important if you want to work in a pro studio such as the record plant, east west, capital, paramount etc. Some of these studios only take students from CRAS. So having someone on your side like an intern coordinator, who has built a great rapport with studio managers is always a plus. I have landed plenty of gigs just based off the relationship the studio manager has with the school.  In fact some studio managers are grads so that makes it even easier.

Another great benefit of going to an audio school is the FREE studio time.

If you are going to an audio school, you need to spend as much time as you can in the studio. Having the time to practice in a professional studio will improve your skills drastically. It will also give you an idea as to what gear you should buy.  If you could find one dedicated artist while in school you could really put together a quality album for no money.  Think of all the experience you would gain.

There are a lot of great resources out there to help you.

Today there are so many resources to help you in your career.  You have Pensado's Place, the Recording Revolution, and even my website www.myaudiotutor.com.   With all these resources you can educate yourself without going to school.  Education is key but no one said it has to be from a school. Buy some gear and do free work.  That experience alone will help you improve your skills.

In closing, I still feel like going to school is the best way to land a job in audio. However if you just want to get a better understanding of audio then I would suggest reading more blogs, youtube, and practicing your craft.  If you continue this path for two years and still have the desire to go to school then by all means go. Just make sure you know what your getting into. Its not for everyone!

31sw1o,0,2015-04-07,I [23/F] caught feelings for close friend of several years [29/M] but have a boyfriend [24M] of a year,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/31sw1o/i_23f_caught_feelings_for_close_friend_of_several/,"Throwaway because they both use reddit on occasion.  I don't have anyone to talk to about this, so if anyone wades through the wall of text, thank you.

**Boyfriend** and I met online a little over a year ago and hit it off.  I wasn't initially looking for anything serious, but he was a quality guy and we stayed together even when I left a couple months later for a summer internship.  My parents even like him, which is a first.  He's smart, has a decent job, we get along.  But lately I've been feeling insecure and wondering where our relationship is going.  We have trouble communicating, and often our conversations just peter out after we finish talking about how our days went.  He gets frustrated with me being indecisive and not planning things -- I worry about choosing something he won't like or talking about something that is boring to him.  E.g., tried talking to him about my concerns with my sister's new boyfriend and he cut me off with ""sounds like she just needs to grow up.""  Or, wanted to go ice-skating with him this winter, but every time I suggested it, he had something to do or said he didn't feel like it.  So I figured he didn't really want to go and stopped suggesting it.  Then a couple weeks ago, he asked me why we never went!  But the first time I really got upset with him was about a month ago when my parents visited the area for a weekend.  I'd told him about it a week in advance, invited him to dinner on Sunday, and reminded him a couple times the week of.  The day of, he texts and says he isn't coming and is going to clean his apartment and maybe see a movie instead.  My family (especially parental approval) is very important to me and I thought I'd communicated how much I wanted him to be there.  The next time I saw him I asked why he hadn't come, did he not realize that, and he replied ""because I didn't want to; I knew you would be upset, but I knew I could get away with it.""

He said ""I love you"" pretty early on in the relationship, and after some initial hesitation (I had recently ended a bad relationship) I said it back, too.  The last time he's said it to me now was a month or more ago after he'd had a few beers, and before that I can't even remember.  I asked him why a while ago and he said ""there will always be a part of me that loves you, but"" - then cited communication issues and my indecisiveness.

I had been able to see myself being with him long-term, even having kids with him - and I don't even really want kids.  But now I don't know where it's headed.  I'm currently in the job market (will be graduating from a grad program next month) and I can't tell if he says ""go where you want"" because he doesn't want to bias me or because he honestly doesn't care if I move away.  When I asked, he just said ""If it's meant to be, it'll work out"" which really doesn't say anything.

**Enter friend.**  We met at an internship in 2012, I was kinda dating someone else (..it was complicated) and he was celebrating his first anniversary with his wife.  We got along great, hung out a lot with the other students.  After the internship we kept in touch and IM'd a lot, talking about grad school or just sending stupid internet links.  We only saw each other in person twice after that summer, and both times with our SO's around.  To make a long story short, he developed feelings for me by the next summer, I ignored the signs, kept ignoring the signs, etc.  Until February this year when he sent me a letter declaring his love, at which point I couldn't very well ignore it.  I avoided him online for a week or so and talked to my sister and boyfriend about how upsetting it was that I'd have to lose one of my few friends, and the one that I was closest to, at that.  Friend and I eventually talked and it turned out he was getting a divorce, but regardless, I was still dating boyfriend.  So we tried the whole not-talking thing, which lasted all of a week before we agreed that it sucked and tentatively started sending each other stupid internet links again.

I got a job interview at a place several hours away from friend last weekend and told him.  He booked a hotel room in the same hotel, and we met up and spent an evening and afternoon hanging out.  Nothing scandalous - just got dinner, laughed about stupid TV shows, and walked around in a park.  He was so clearly into me just in the way he looked at me, and I liked that and being around him in general.  In the park we ended up sitting and talking for over an hour, getting progressively closer until we were shoulder-to-shoulder.  I was surprised by how much I wanted him to kiss me -- he didn't (which is probably for the best), but did kiss my cheek quickly right before we stood up to walk back to the car.  The day after I got back from the trip I couldn't stop thinking about him.  We've been texting a lot and both want to see each other again.  I hadn't thought about him that way before when he was married and thus off-limits, but I clearly have caught feelings now too.

But, right, still dating boyfriend.  I saw him last night and felt miserable the whole time.  It was like the spark had gone out.  He could tell I was upset and stressed, but assumed it was from school/jobs and was trying to cheer me up, which just made me feel more guilty.  And after having such a great time rambling with friend a few days earlier and feeling like I could talk to him about anything, it was almost painful to see our conversation problems in contrast.  Boyfriend still has the same good qualities that attracted me in the first place and is probably the better choice, objectively speaking, but I just don't have the same sort of feelings for him as I do for friend - not as excited or hopeful or even as comfortable.  I know it's not realistic to expect butterflies all the time, but after a year I'd like to think I could at least talk to him easily about things and we'd be making plans for the future and all.

**wtf am I doing, reddit?**  I find myself wishing that either a) I get the job I interviewed for, I move near friend, and then know for sure what boyfriend thinks; or b) I was single so I could see what happens with friend.  But nope, I am c) dating someone and unavailable for trying anything.  So ... I could stay with boyfriend and maybe he'll start saying he loves me again and we'd get married and even my parents would be happy, except friend who is now heartbroken.  Or I could dump boyfriend for no good reason and try dating friend, which maybe it'd work out but I don't know how I'd explain it to anyone I know, or it would end up like one of my previous relationships where he loved me more and I just liked the security of being loved more than anything else, in which case both of them are now screwed, or it would just be awkward and never even get off the ground, in which case everyone is screwed.  Or maybe I'm just a terrible person who shouldn't be in any relationships at all??

**tl;dr**: I don't know if my relationship with boyfriend is going anywhere after a year, and I have developed strong feelings for a close friend who is in love with me.  What now."

I am unemployed at the moment and have not been able to get a help desk job at my college (doesn't have one) nor an internship in Boston so that's not working out like I wanted. 

My long term goal is to work as an IT director, systems admin, or something along those lines at NASA or SpaceX (space is a huge passion of mine and I love IT best of both worlds) and I would like to jump start my career as best as possible. So far I have built my own PC, achieved an IT Essentials CISCO cert. and have done some IT stuff but those are all really minor things. I am going to start to do some programming next semester and I may boot Linux onto my chromebook or PC as NASA and SpaceX and a lot of other places use it and I have no experience doing so. 

Anything else I should be doing right now while I have all of this time to get a head start on my IT career?"
31t3yo,2,2015-04-07,I'm having a really hard time convincing myself to keep going.,hcats,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/31t3yo/im_having_a_really_hard_time_convincing_myself_to/,"I'll try to keep this brief. About 10 years ago I decided to try and turn my life around. I went back to school and moved to another state to return to school. While there I lost 100 lbs, decided to pursue a professional degree (i.e. like an MD), made some wonderful friends and had a couple of very meaningful relationships.


Fast-forward to the end of my time there and I had been accepted into the top schools in the country and was just finishing up my studies. I decided to end my relationship of ~4 years with a girl for both good and bad reasons, but ultimately I've come to regret that decision. Without going into details I have a hard time forming connections with others so being able to get that close with someone is something very special. I decided to go to the school closest to my home because I was feeling homesick at the time due to being away for nearly 7 years. 


When I arrived I was lonely and a little out of shape, but excited to start school. Things were going well until midway through the first year a classmate of mine nearly attempted suicide himself (he had brought a gun into his dorm and was going to shoot himself). I convinced him no to do it and went with him to the counselor the next day. For whatever reason this had a profound impact on me and sent me into a depression. I started seeing a therapist myself and hired a private trainer at the school gym to try and get myself back in shape and address my feelings.


Things were going OK for the most part going into the second year of my schooling. I was very lonely and somewhat disappointed with my choice in school, but otherwise I was looking forward to the future because I was cultivating some interesting hobbies (I was enjoying working out, rock climbing, guitar, drawing and kayaking). During the Christmas break of that year I fell and injured both of my wrists snowboarding for the first time. I didn't think much of it at the time, but after a month they still hurt and felt unstable. I got diagnosed with a torn ligament in my wrist and a couple other complications. I was unable to workout like I normally would due to this injury. I refocused on school and spent my time there. I also got a highly coveted internship at a local hospital. When I wasn't focused on my studies my mind dwelled on my wrist. I decided to try and rehab my knee (I had slightly injured it the summer before I started professional school) but I ended up injuring my wrist further doing an exercise the PT had me do. Frustrated, I gave up trying to rehab my knee.

At the start of the third year in pharmacy school I had worked during the summer and also done research on the side. My health had deteriorated due to not working out and some stress eating. The school I chose proved to be a massive disappointment with a disconnected administration, filler classes and a seemingly glaring neglect of fundamental concepts. I slogged through the year, my health concerns continuing to to weigh heavily on me; my TMJ became particularly worse and I injured my other wrist. I decided in December to leave my internship which was upsetting me and to try pilates as an alternative workout. Now I've found that due to a defect in my hip I have torn cartilage there as well (in addition to knee and ankle problems). The surgical outcomes for my hip seem more optimistic than my wrist, but I'm scared of surgery because of past experiences and I'm losing a lot of faith in modern medicine. I've tried pursuing relationships during school, but as I said earlier I have trouble with trust and I also feel myself pulling back because my health concerns might limit me. It also depresses me that the person I end up with will see me as this broken thing, and not the driven, hard working, capable person I was and was trying hard to improve.

In addition to my health problems I am having difficulty finding more interests to pursue. Writing/drawing hurts my wrist, as does playing guitar. I had wanted to hike and backpack more, maybe even run, but my hip is making that unlikely. I also developed a condition known as slipping rib syndrome which makes certain actions very painful/difficult. I feel like I tried so hard to change who I was 10 years ago and that it's all going to be for nothing. I cultivated new interests that I can't do, I'm stuck at a school I hate taking on debt for something I've lost the passion in, and I am having difficulty romantically because I feel like I can't form a relationship with someone that I'd want to because I don't think my health will allow a future with them.

In a nut shell, I feel like I've lost my identity and died. I've tried several alternatives to try and pick myself up but I seem to keep hitting roadblocks. I went from an active person to nearly completely sedentary and my health seems to be deteriorating at a rapid rate with no definitive answers. I think of killing myself multiple times a day, but what stops me is that I keep hoping I'll get better. It has been over a year since I've injured my wrist and no doctor has given me a definitive treatment answer that I am satisfied with (they just seem to go through treatment algorithms rather than think of mine case as unique). Now with my hip/knee/ankle injury I'm rapidly losing hope that I'll ever be able to enjoy my life when I'm done with schooling.

Thank you for reading this. I'm sorry it was so long. I just feel like I need someone to understand how hard I have tried and how desperate I'm starting to feel. I feel so lost and overwhelmed that I can't pull myself out of this, I wish someone was there just to feel close to."

Some backstory, my dad is a very emotional guy in the sense that when he gets angry he will throw a fit or send me on a guilt trip until he is aware that I am upset for upsetting him, and he then storms off. After a few hours he cools down and acts like it never happened. 

For example, at the beginning of last September I was planning on heading back to school with my current girl friend (as at the time she was going through really heavy personal/ family issues and I felt that I should be with her to comfort her). 

Dad assumed that he was going to drive me too school (I live ~2 hrs from where I go to school) and when I told him otherwise he turned the question around asking ""So what you're saying is you don't need me."" and stormed off. I understood that this would upset him as we do like to road trip together &amp; he has taken me to school for the previous 2 years, but it made me feel like shit for doing that to him.

Catch up to now and I was offered a great internship in NYC for the summer. My Dad told me that him, my mom, and I would head to NYC a week early to vacation a little bit, and I told him sure thing (this was back in November). 

However, I had assumed that my gf would be able to find some work in NYC over the summer too, but has had no luck so far. I want to tell my dad that I don't want to leave early so I can spend more time with my gf before I leave (which I realize is being selfish to my family, but we would change our week long trip to maybe half a week) but I'm deathly afraid to tell this to my dad. 

I feel like he will resent me and say that I'm choosing her over him (or something to that effect). Any and all advice would be appreciated!!



   
**tl;dr**: Afraid to tell my dad no in fear of disappointing him and being guilt tripped to feeling like shit."

First of all, I do not have any experience in this field so I am not sure how much it is worth learning Microsoft dynamics and other related technologies as a software engineer (I will be applying for full time in July, as I am graduating this december, hence desperate to get any type of experience). This will cost me tickets to India (1K) and but I will stay at my parents in the summer, which is better than living alone here for three months. (No one in USA)

The other option is that I stay here in US and work with any professor at my university in Android or Data mining related research. 

Which option should I go for? Is experience in software dev. using ERP/CMS is considered useful for a software engg.?



**TL;DR** My dilemma -
Either I get an experience in ERP/CMS software Development in India (Small company, no payment, I stay with my parents for three months)

Or

Stay here in USA alone, work with any professor in Android/ Data Mining related research for the whole summer.

I feel that certain aspects of marketing, analytics, etc. restrict my full ability and feel like my personality is best suited for sales (naturally competitive from sports, confident, willing to engage, can deal with rejection, want to 'work' for my money). I've been reading a couple of books on sales, browsing this sub often, and trying to gain as much info as possible. 

I'm in contact with an employer of an experiential marketing firm for a marketing and sales position.

Any tips on succeeding on selling products face to face? (Essentially the company 'strategically' places themselves at locations to push their client's products)

Any insight on pursuing a career in sales (versus marketing)?

Any resources / tips / personal experience with tech sales?

Thanks for the read. Excited to hear back from you salesmen / women!"

***

The now 82 year old James Alix Michel, President of the African Coastal Federation, rose out of his armchair in the presidential estate. He had endured many years at the helm of a growing nation, and had led the members of the Federation to peace, prosperity, strength, and a position of leadership in Africa. Now, he grew frail and weak. Knowing his days on Earth were numbered, he prepared to give a speech, that would break the hearts of some, and please a minority.


&gt; My fellow country men, I come to this podium today with news that is both bad and good, news that will remind us of our bountiful past and our fruitful future. I, James Michel of the African Coastal Federation, have past the stage of my life where I see myself as fit to rule such a thriving and diverse nation. However, I know that my partner, and long-time friend, Danny Faure, the current vice-president of the African Coastal Federation, can lead the way as intern president. I hope he will be the man to guide you on the path that the future has laid for you. He will be the man to help eradicate poverty, hunger, and disease in our nation. Please welcome him to the podium now.

The 64 year old Faure steps up on stage, looking both confident and pleased at the same time. He starts off his speech with a breezy and light-hearted welcome.

&gt; Hello! I am pleased to see every one of you tonight. It is truly a pleasure to be in charge of a nation with so much support for their government, and to be in charge of a government with so much support for its people. I am pleased to announce that it will be I who will lead this Federation into a golden age. With help from our allies to the North and South, Africa will blossom like never before, rising in peace in stark contrast to a world embroiled in war, like our own Kilimanjaro rising against a blue sky. As my first action as intern President of the nation, I appoint Peter Sinon as intern Vice President! Elections will also be held immediately.Thank you, and have a good night.

As the new President walked off the podium, Ex-President Michel could be seen with a tear in his eye, clapping Faure off stage.

***

The following week, elections were scheduled for the people of the African Coastal Federation to come out and vote. After vote tallying, the official results have been released. They are as shown below.

Name of Party | Seats in the Cabinet | Leader | Views
---|---|----|----
People's Party of the Federation | 226 | Danny Faure | Left, Democratic
The Nationalist Party | 108 | Ravile Wakhamenon | Centrist, Social Liberalism
The Republican Coalition | 64 | Jean Beaumont | Right, Strongly Capitalist
The Democratic Party of Progress | 51 | Emmanuel Doricio | Centre-Left
Ethnic Freedom Movement | 37 | John Lucifer | Greater Recognition for More Ethnicities, Specifically in Mozambique
The Arab Recognition Coalition | 34 | Ali Wa'yaad | Greater Recognition for the Arab people
The Marxist Alliance | 3 | Juma Anjuan | Far-Left, Communist.
The National Socialist Coalition | 2 | Rene Claudet | Far-Right

As the data shows, the new President of the African Coastal Federation is **Danny Faure**, and his Vice President **Peter Sinon**.

The pair's first action in power was to finally finish the bill that had been going through the cabinet for quite some time, a new, and freshly-written constitution. This will represent all of the Federation, combing elements from each constituent nation's constitutions into one document.

31thti,35,2015-04-07,I [23/M] am going on a trip without my SO [23/F]. and she's freaking out.,DankSagan,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/31thti/i_23m_am_going_on_a_trip_without_my_so_23f_and/,"Honestly, where do I start.

I'm from Europe, but I got a great internship offer in Texas. That means I'll be leaving my SO for 2 months. When I found out that I got accepted, she took it really hard. We had a couple of heated arguments where she was constantly reminding about my previous time in the US 3 years ago. Basically she thinks that back then I've acted inappropriately by taking too many pictures with other girls and having too much fun.  I worked on a summer camp, these were my workmates, and there was no kissing or anything sexual in the pictures. I wouldn't even think about cheating on her. She knows I didn't fool around over there, but somehow it still hurts her a lot or something.

So, when she recently heard that I was leaving for that internship, she brought up that previous trip many times. I've since learned that I'll be going with 3 other people (a guy and two girls, I don't know any of them yet).

So, the 4 of us got in touch via e-mail today and I casually proposed that we could rent a car and take a week-long road trip after the internship, before we go back home. When my SO read that, she burst into tears. She said that she doesn't matter to me at all and I'm putting everything else above her. She said she doesn't want me having fun with other people, especially girls, without her. She suggested I'll end up sleeping with them or other girls I meet on the road trip. And all those other extremes. 

To me it all sounds ridiculous, and I'm a bit hurt by her remarks about me. She thinks I just become a mindless sex-seeking monkey when she's not around. I just want to see the west coast on a budget and have some fun.

Right now she's looking for an internship here with not much success yet, which is probably contributing to her stress. I told her we will talk over Skype every day while I'm gone. Ideally I'd love to go on that road trip with her, but money is an issue when buying a ticket to the US for just a week. We have planned a vacation in Europe right after I come back.

An hour ago she asked me if I think that ""it's alright to just leave your SO back home and go have fun with other people"". I said yes. She took her ring off (did I mention she's my fiancee?), threw it on the table, left the house and drove off in the car. I haven't tried to contact her. A while ago she came back and now she's sleeping on the floor. I don't have the strength to argue the same stuff with her anymore, as her views on this matter are settled, and I know I don't share them. She says everyone who thinks like me ends up single and unhappy.

I love her, her sense of humor, she's not religious at all and a wonderful person, but I feel her view of a relationship is very restrictive and backwards. She frequently says she'd kill me if she found out I had slept with another woman, and sometimes I think she really would. I'm not scared of course, but she's actively trying to scare me and I think that's not healthy. 

I'd like to point out where I think her insecurities come from. Her father left her family when she was 14 for a younger woman. Her mother has been single ever since, she's suffering from depression, she's pretty bipolar, religious, and she calls my SO very frequently to ask for life advice. 

My SO is a totally different person than her parents, but she still carries some of that baggage. I don't feel any jealousy with her and I've never restricted her in any way.

I just don't know where to go from here. I have to go to sleep now since it's 3 AM. I'll try to get the SO to come to bed now. I'll check back here in the morning. Night."
31tjfj,0,2015-04-07,University of Delaware vs. Rutgers University (School-To-School transfer involved),[deleted],ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/31tjfj/university_of_delaware_vs_rutgers_university/,"This is an x-post from /r/college. Prepare for a wall of text.

____

So am a high school senior hoping to study Mechanical or Civil engineering (although Mechanical seems more than likely) and work in the aerospace industry. I have narrowed down my choices for college to two schools. Here it goes.

First is Rutgers University... or so it may be it.

I was accepted to the pre-engineering program at Newark. I will have to study there for a year or two and then transfer to New Brunswick. I got rejected from SOE and SAS in New Brunswick. I lose the connections I will make the first year in SOE and will have to make up many classes once I get into SOE. I will be commuting all four years too. This year, most of my expenses will be paid so I will not have debt, but I am not sure if that will happen after my second year at Rutgers, especially since I will be going to New Brunswick. I hope that not being in an engineering school will drastically affect my chances at an internship, as I hope to get as many as possible and keep a high GPA (aiming for a 3.5 so that I have a good chance at transferring, although that will be very hard).

Oddly enough, the University of Delaware was MORE than glad to accept me (Civil) and with a decent $4,500/year merit scholarship. I feel that this school best fits my needs, however I can't afford it at the moment. My parents have an unpredictable source of income so it might go from 60k one year to 28k. This year, they got an EFC of 0 which means that we will get a max amount of aid. I am one of two kids in my family that will start college next year, with another sibling who will enter university in two years time. 

My parents fear about the income affecting my FAFSA. I tell them about tax credits, scholarships (got one for $1k already) internships, co-ops, and work-study that can help levy the costs of the price to study. Also, I intend to work in the public sector as an engineer for NASA, which will allow me to qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Being first gen and Latino, it is difficult for us to take out a loan as we have many fears about what we will gain from this.

I've discussed this matter with my principal, who has been along the ride with me since he came into my school sophomore year. After further reviewing the matter and possible reasons for why I wasn't admitted to the School of Engineering at Rutgers University, he believed that taking out the loan and going to UDel would be the best option. I have also talked with many people, some saying to go where the money is, but others saying the loan is worth the hassle of not transferring.

I have also been told to consider community college, however there is simply no use in this as my options **will** stay the same and I will be able to afford in state universities next year as well. I was also accepted to NJIT, however I have felt that it was not a good option whatsoever that didn't met my needs and offers less aid than Rutgers, while being slightly expensive.

I am stuck in this loophole where my parents don't understand any of the options and are going where it is cheap. While the cheapest route looks good, it might hold a large mess of problems. If I were admitted to SOE, I would have accepted the offer over UD immediately, however I was put in this awful position and must face the consequences. Being 17 until September, my parents can still do whatever they want, but I still need to help them understand what is going on and guide them to a good solution. I hope to bring my principal and parents together for a chat about this, but I need more information to tell my parents about what these choices involve. Your advice would be greatly appreciated.

**TL;DR** Is it worth taking out the loans and going to UD to start engineering from day 1 or go to Rutgers, deal with a crazy transfer, and go out with less than 30-40k in debt?"

I am currently a senior Neuroscience major that will graduate this May 2015. However, the fields of work and graduate level opportunities that are the most easily accessible for my major do not interest me. I already have experience in sales and neuroscience research, and I do not like both of those fields. I also don't want to apply to Med school, Dental school, or those various professional schools just yet.


I have always had an interest in working with computers and obtaining an advanced skillset in an area of information technology or computer science, but I have not taken any courses or work experience related to that. How feasible would it be for me to get an information technology internship or entry job without having any direct skills that apply to them? I have seen alot of information technology internships on indeed.com, but they all seem to require previous coursework experience or job experience, which is hard for me to get at the moment. How can I market my skills to obtain an opportunity in this field?"

I am seeking some advice with how others dealing with depression are able to face rejection and criticism without letting it consume you.

My rejection and criticism steals from my job.  I am an attorney at a law firm.  At the firm, each young attorney basically acts like an independent contractor, trying to get partners and more experienced attorneys to give them assignments.  If these attorneys don't want you do work for them, you won't be able to do the required amount of work that you are expected to produce.  

Now seven months in, it has become apparent that the attorneys I work with do not that I am an adequate attorney (at least enough to do projects for them).  I've even found out that some people there didn't even want to hire me after my internship.  

I am feeling like such a failure every time that I don't get selected to work with someone.  I know rejection is part of life, but I am feeling so low knowing that people I am surrounded by daily do not have any faith in me.  

Have any of you faced situations like this, and if so, how did you try to block out all of those reiterating that you ""aren't good enough"" in some way or another?  I feel like this situation, combined with my already present depression, has me feeling worthless, even when I should't let it. "

My boyfriend got into a pretty serious car accident about four years ago. Thankfully, no one was hurt, but ever since then he has dreaded driving and hates it with a passion. 

We're both in college now and go to school several hours away from home, and him not wanting to drive is kind of affecting my life negatively now. He will still drive to the store or to class but he will be anxious the whole time and I can't touch him or talk too loud. He won't drive if it's raining or rush hour or if it's too dark or he just doesn't feel safe. It's gotten to the point to where he has actually forbidden me from driving and visiting him this summer (he will be at an internship 12 hours away) because he doesn't want me driving either. Even if I had my own car, it wouldn't make things any better because even in high school he wouldn't let me drive us 20 minutes to the movies, and we live in a very small town with no traffic. 

I never ask him to go on dates anymore because he hates driving so much. Sometimes he'll ask me to hang out and then take back the offer because he doesn't want to come pick me up. I don't really know what to do at this point because I don't know if I should say something. Am I being crazy? I'd really appreciate some advice. Thanks guys. "
31tz10,11,2015-04-07,"Me [23 F] with my boyfriend [27 M], and I'm exhibiting toxic relationship behavior. Help.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/31tz10/me_23_f_with_my_boyfriend_27_m_and_im_exhibiting/,"My SO and I have been together officially about one year now. This is my first serious relationship with little-to-no experience with having a relationship beforehand (think high-school level type of crushes). We just started dating and I practically lived with him and we got along great. We rarely argued and we figured out a great routine (but I will also give credit to the 'honeymoon' phase of the relationship where everything was new and fun).

Fastforward to now and we are both living at home in order to save for a downpayment on a house. My SO will come and stay over at my house on the weekends. During the weekdays and on the weekends there are some various problems that we encounter. We are both very busy (he works full-time, and I work 30 hours at my regular job, intern at a small company where I go in twice a week and do the other work remotely, and also go to school full-time), so we have little to no time to really talk throughout the week. The weekend is where we spend most of our time together.

Now that we are both living apart and only see each other on weekends, I find that we are arguing more and more frequently about the silliest things. However, I am known for being short tempered and I get frustrated very often. My favorite phrases in dealing with arguments are: ""Whatever"", ""Fine"", and anything sarcastic or with an attitude.

Most of the arguments are not too terrible and we usually get over it in a day. However, I'm afraid that if I continue this behavior, it will take a turn for the worse. I do love him and I do want to plan my future with him but sometimes it can be so aggravating. I recently read about Gottman's Four Horsemen of Relationship Apocalypse and I feel like I exhibit some, if not all, of them...

* Whenever my SO and I argue on the phone, I have a tendency to stonewall and stay silent. Sometimes I even hang up on the phone and cut him off without saying anything. After moments of fuming in silence, I will proceed to send a passive-aggressive text along the lines of ""why aren't you talking to me now""? 

An example of this would be a couple minutes ago. I'm currently on Spring Break and I took the week off expecting to go on vacation with my SO. Instead, he's swamped with a project at work so he can't go anywhere and I am stuck sitting at home. He was busy the whole day so he didn't text me or anything and that was fine. He gets home, has dinner, then watches a movie and doesn't respond for two hours even though I'm sporadically texting him to see what he's up to. After he finishes watching the movie, he calls me and wants to talk. 

However, at this point, I'm upset and I'm giving him very curt responses. I tell him why I'm upset (aka, we didn't talk the whole day, I'm feeling neglected and like he chose a movie over me) and he just responds, ""What, so I can't watch a movie?"" and by this point I am LIVID. So I just don't say anything. He gets upset because I'm not saying anything, so he responds, ""We can just text because I didn't call you to argue"" and then I get pissy and hang up on him.

* My SO will always ask what the issue/problem is when I am upset and try to coax me to talk about the situation. I will mostly deflect and say ""forget it"" or ""whatever"".

* On the weekends, I will get upset that we have no plans. We will basically wake up, I'll ask what there is to do and then he'll list a couple things and I will turn them down. We will spend maybe hours on this before we get upset. 

I'm very picky. He'll then ask what I want to do. I'll respond with ""I don't know"" because I actually have no clue...Then my SO will get upset that I expect him to think of what to do especially when I have no idea what I want to be doing. We'll go in circles until one of us is fed up and just like, ""let's just stay home!!!!!""

* I get frustrated because I often feel like he's not listening to me. I have to repeat things 2x or 3x and I get upset and snap on him and call him annoying. I know it probably hurts him but honestly it really upsets me when I have to say things more than once.

* I don't know if it's normal but whenever we fight, I always think about breaking it off with him. Does anyone else do this? Is this a red flag? 

**tl;dr**: This is my first real relationship and I exhibit toxic behavior towards my SO during arguments (contempt, stonewalling, passive-aggressiveness, etc.). Advice on how to deal with this?"
31u1jd,2,2015-04-07,Need some advice for what to do with school ending soon,whattodo216,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/31u1jd/need_some_advice_for_what_to_do_with_school/,"For my school I had to do an internship in order to graduate so I applied for a job my friend has and recommended (he also graduated BS in CS) for an easy-in to get the 240 or so required hours.

They said they don't really do interns because a lot of training is required but would hire me instead. I was late in doing my internship and couldn't find another place in time so I just agreed to their contract (typical NDA, NCA, etc.). I also had to sign a 2 year contract saying that if I left before then I'd have to pay tens of thousands of dollars (all my savings) to compensate for expensive training to happen (hasn't happened yet).

I've been at the job for 6 months and don't really like it. My friend said there was a decent amount of coding but it's probably only like 10% of the time and they're 5-10 line long Javascript files. It's mostly just documentation, meetings, a lot of nothing/idling, flow charts, learning very specific technologies that will be outdated in 5 years, etc.

I just feel like I'm wasting my potential. I was a bit of a nerd and I've read 50+ books on programming, know all kinds of algorithms, prefer statically typed languages, etc. I know all of this programming and I don't get to use any of it. Also I'm paid decently (between $20 and $30 an hour) but I know I'm worth more and can do more.

I could get out of the contract by just getting fired but that just seems wrong. They're a good company and it'd be good to have it on my résumé, I just find that type of work doesn't really suit me, although I'm likely being naive. I should probably just stick it out for another 1.5 years but that's still 3,000 hours of work and I feel like that kind of commitment so early on in my career could waste a lot of time, considering this job has so much IT stuff and doesn't really help build my career in any way.

What should I do?"

[LDR, 1.5 years]",ThrowAwayneke,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/31u5e7/how_do_i_23_m_overcome_my_current_insecurities/,"Throw away account here. Sorry for the length D:

***The Relationship***

I’m in a long distance (international) relationship right now with a beautiful, funny, creative and intelligent girl that I met two years ago during an internship abroad. We have been dating for a year and a half now and visit each other with relative frequency (about 2-3 weeks every few months).
 
***The Visit***

This visit was planned for three weeks. During the first two weeks she had work while I took language courses at a local language school (we both speak English and I am learning her native language) and the last week we traveled back to her family for vacation and her birthday celebration. I was looking forward to a really great continuation of our last adventures together around the new city she moved mid last-year, sadly, it wasn’t going to happen like that. From the day I arrived she seemed cold-- lack of cuddling,not having much to talk about, exchanging I love you seldomly, and some pretty uninspiring sex (and also having advances being rejected). 

At the end of the first week I made a huge mistake and left a burner on in her apartment while we ate and started an oil fire that burned a part of her kitchen wall and gave her a panic attack. We fixed it together but it put an even heavier damper on us than before. My attempts to talk with her about it were met with resistance and so I just pushed it all down. I’ve felt so guilty about the damage I caused and every time I had been around her I felt worse. 

We both communicate very differently, she is a person who needs space and time to cool off when there is conflict while I am somebody who needs to confront it and talk about it. When I feel like I haven’t had an opportunity to express myself and feel empathy/understanding then I dwell on it and I become really neurotic.

After two days of awkward interactions and my uncertainty about how she’s actually feeling, she made a gesture that took me by surprise-- she came to cuddle with me and as we were lying down she was the one to initiate sex. The whole situation turned out to be really frustrating for me because I was just glad to be receiving her affection from cuddling and the fact that she was moving all the way to sex was too much for me to handle emotionally, we did it anyway but I didn’t last very long and I was hit with overwhelming guilt afterward, both from wishing the connection had been longer and the feeling that I did not pleasure her at all. We tried cuddling again afterward but she eventually turned away and I felt like the biggest piece of shit ever. Fuck. 

The rest of the trip became a rollercoaster for me, I was caught between trying to stay cool/distant to try avoid seeming desperate for attention and affection and trying to stay friendly and initiating cuddling or hugs on occasion so that I don’t seem irrationally upset with her. We celebrated her birthday with her family and with her friends, just a nice brunch and no night party-- she went out with some friends two times over three days just before I came to visit her and was out until 5 a.m each time, during the time that I was with her and I had wanted to go out and party she said she didn’t have the stomach for alcohol and while she agreed to come out with me and a few friends to a bar once, she only ordered sodas, which I felt really disappointed by.

It wasn’t until I was off on my own with old friends in her hometown that she texted me saying that she knows she hasn’t been very nice or relaxed this trip, that it was bad timing from stress and the accident that caused her to not be as friendly as she usually is. She let me know this and I told her it’s okay. We talked about it again in person and made up. When I left to fly home she told me she loved me, she promises she’ll be in a better mood next time, and we kissed and hugged for a long time before I took off. 

***Returning Home***

Transatlantic plane flights can be the worst. You are sitting on your own in an airplane for at least 9 hours with nothing to occupy yourself but your own thoughts. Throughout this time I was replaying all the scenarios in my head and feeling resentment and fear. When I landed and texted her, she was out at a bar with friends, she responded back once every 1.5 hours or so while I had a four-hour wait at the airport for my connecting flight. It was incredibly lonely sitting there at the airport knowing that she was out drinking with friends after an entire trip not wanting to go out and do stuff. She was got back home at 4 AM her time and was asleep before I landed. 

One side of me wants to give her the benefit of the doubt and to understand that she may not be intentionally doing these things (such as not wanting to cuddle, going out and partying only when I’m away, and seeming disinterested) for any malicious reason. Another side of me still feels incredibly hurt about how things have been going, and my insecurities are leading me to imagine that it’s more than just stress that’s making her act this way. I have no reason to think she is lying to me or hiding anything from me, but I also know that she isn’t the kind of person to say exactly what she feels. 

***Self-Doubt &amp; Anxiety***

Over the course of the trip, I felt really depressed. After the first week I was considering leaving to go back home early because of how bad things were. I didn’t do so because I didn’t want to jump the gun and destroy the relationship/ditch out on her before her birthday in case this was all a big misunderstanding. In my head I’d be bombarded by my own thoughts forming commentary about the situation:

* “You fucked up when you caused that fire, idiot, she’s never going to trust you with anything again”

* “She’s not attracted to you anymore, if she was she’d want to cuddle; she only had sex with you so that you’re satisfied, but she’s not into it anymore”

* “She doesn’t go out and party with you because you’re so boring” (every time we’ve gone out for drinks in the past there is one reason or another why she chooses not to drink and it feels like every time I am absent she has no problem staying out until early morning)

* “She no longer feels love for you”

It feels pathetic writing these thoughts out, because I know that there is a degree of irrationality that I’m bringing in and I feel like a nutcase. It’s a stupid downward spiral where I know that by possessing these thoughts I would make them become true even if they were not, and that’s why I recognized I had to act.

***Taking Action***

I started writing this submission two days ago and stopped because I knew that the biggest piece of advice I would get it is to get out of my head and actually talk to her about it, so I did that instead. I’m not sure if I chose a bad time to do it (late at night, her time) or used the right words but here’s what I did:
She was on her train ride back from her family when I sent her a text seeing if I could ask her a question. She said sure and I said, *“I don’t want this to sound heavy, but do you still like me?”*  

She - *“Umm.. That does sound heavy”*

She - *“Yes, why?”*

I - *“Well, these last 4 weeks felt different from our time together before. I know you’ve told me it was bad timing but you really didn’t explain much beyond that and I don’t know if it’s just me or if something is different.”*

She then went on to say that she did explain that the bad timing (recently moving, exams from school and anxiety about personal finances) was a part of what she said about stress, that it’s really nothing more, and that if she needs to explain anything else to me then I should just ask. She had to get off the train and get into a taxi after that and it was very late at night her time. I told her I would reflect on it and talk to her about it later, and that it might just be me being insecure. Before she went to bed I apologize for unloading that question on her and she said it was okay, but now it’s making her think about what I said. She seemed pretty annoyed and said she needed to sleep. I responded back that **I’ve just been feeling down and a bunch of thoughts have been in my head, I appreciate the response she gave me and that I guess I’ve just not felt very awesome lately, and that I want to bounce back.** That was the last message sent as of right now, and I hope that we’ll be able to talk more about it tomorrow. 

I know that text exchange doesn’t really give you much to work with, especially since we don’t know yet what her reaction to my last message. She is a very level-headed person, the nice part is that she is not a drama-queen, the downside is that she is not quick to comfort. We will see what happens next...

***In closing***

* How do I get over my own insecurities?

* Does this sound like a rough-patch or does this situation have doom written all over it?

* Would you stay or would you leave? 

To bring it back, this is a long distance relationship, it’s harder to solve problems like this when you know you will not see them again for at least another month (my next planned trip is in early July, but it could be sooner than this). If you were me, would you cut your losses and not risk repeating this last trip again or would you work on fixing things up both mental wellness-wise and relationship-wise?

**tl;dr** - Visited girlfriend for 3 weeks, had a shitty time. Part of it was caused by me burning part of her apartment down and the rest of it was a general air of coldness-- little affection, bad communication. Insecure, neurotic thoughts. She apologizes and explains it’s just stress days before I leave. I leave and lapse into more feelings of insecurity and decide to confront her about it. I ask if she still likes me and her response is “yes” but little more than that. I come out about my feelings lately and have not heard her response yet.

Thanks for reading, your input is really appreciated.

We live in a small room, so very intimate and basically sleeping next to each other.
He has previously been very depressed and is on medication (some SSRI) for it. I was working on a volunteer project with him for about a year ago when he was feeling very depressed but he has been feeling good and very active for what I think has been a long period after that. I am no expert here, but I get the notion that it's some kind of mano-depressive cycle. I met his parents once efter the previous episode and his dad took me aside to tell me how much they had appreciated me and one other guy being there for him - and I don't even feel we're *that* close.

He worked hard to get an internship at a big company recently. He got it, and will start in some months. When he got accepted, things took a 180 turn and he's now feeling very bad about pretty much everything.

So he recently got a higher dose of his medication just a week or two ago.
He keeps bringing up how bad he feels. A lot of regret about life-choices, which was also the theme last year. Things like if he really should have moved to the city he lives in city, started the education he's taking, tuned down some job offer, signed up for this internship, even coming to Tokyo to visit right now, etc. Lots of guilt for things that he can't change.

He talks about this, and other extremely negative feelings, a lot. I can tell that he's really suffering and sometimes he looks like he's just about to cry. He never mentioned suicide, but I wouldn't be super-surprised if he comes to the point of thinking or talking about that in the future.

On one hand, I guess it's good that he's talking about things. On the other hand, it kind of feels like a record stuck on negativity-repeat with the same thoughts and thought-patterns just reinforcing themselves, so keeping talking about the exact same thing day after day (and several times a day) feels like it's leading nowhere but down.

The thing is, I am feeling pretty stressed in school and life in general and don't feel like I can commit to him as much as he might need me to. And I am not in a super-stable point in my life myself, so his constant talk about how all these negativities are making me concerned, stressed and kind of feeling like I have to push him away to keep myself sane, which I obviously don't want to do since I care about him. I told him before he got here (and before I knew about his current state) that I will be pretty busy and not have much time for hanging out, which is true.  He's mentioned a couple of times what a shame it is that we can't hang out so much, which also adds to my own feelings of stress and responsibility for him.

He has his cheerful moments too, here, even if they feel a bit.. manic. We have been partying a little bit, and I have tried to introduce him to friends and have been encouraging him when he talks about trying to hook up with people to hang out with on Tindr.

I can see that he's trying to be nice and appear happy. He's brought small gifts back to the house when he's been out, etc. But it's a very crumbling facade.

I guess my **main question** is how I should respond when he starts talking about these negative thoughts he has? I know that it's important to just listen, which I feel I am not very good at. I kind of feel like these two weeks might turn out to be a sudden part-time job as a therapist whenevrer I am not in school, which I am not by any means prepared for. I feel that if I follow up with questions and respond openly when he brings it up, it will be constant talk about negativity and regret and how bad everything feels, which I fear will make not only him but also myself even more depressed. At the same time I don't want to make things worse for him by making him shut himself in.

Like the title says, as the summer gets closer, I am starting to feel very nervous about my internship. I feel like I am nowhere near good enough to work there, and that I will get fired right away. Also, a lot of their code-base is in Java, and lo and behold, I have never learned Java (I'm more of a C and Python kind of girl!). 

I got the offer in the fall semester, and I had planned to learn Java over winter break, but was unable to, and now I feel like I am running out of time. 

I really feel like I won't be any good. Is there a way I can prepare in the next month or so to be better equipped at working there, and perhaps feel a bit more confident in myself? Is it even possible to get confident in your abilities in such a high stress environment?

Thanks!"
31una1,4,2015-04-08,Second Bachelor's Degree or a Master's in Computer Science? Looking for advice on how to move forward.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/31una1/second_bachelors_degree_or_a_masters_in_computer/,"Hello everyone, I'm in the midst of figuring out how I want to move forward and the mix of responses that I have received over the past year has influenced me to write this.  I graduated with a BA in Economics from an Ivy League school in 2013 and started a job at a decently well-known/venture-backed startup in Silicon Valley, albeit in a support role.  I enjoyed working at the company, but I definitely aspired to do engineering or development work.

I spent the greater part of my free time outside of my day job mastering Android development and eventually working on preparing for technical interviews.  I came across a great community in San Francisco that helped armed me with the skills necessary to begin building great mobile applications.  After one of my apps gained a lot of traction and I became comfortable with my own abilities, I began applying to junior-level Android developer jobs.  

I was able to land on-site interviews with Facebook and LinkedIn, among others, but could not earn an offer from either of those places.  Two particular interviews at other companies struck me in particular.  I was internally referred by fellow Android bootcamp participants to a company in Seattle they were working at (I had heard through their manager that they put in a good word for me noting that I was one of the strongest students at the particular bootcamp).  

The interview with their VP was particularly revealing.  ""So, you have a degree in Economics?""  I said, yes.  ""Well, I guess that's better than Sociology or Art.""  I said something to the effect of, ""Well some people with those degrees are quite good.""  I didn't get an offer after getting flown out for a full day of stuff on the whiteboard, among other things, but that could have been due to various reasons.  Needless to say, that exchange was an eye-opener.  

I was also internally referred by a friend to a well-known ebook startup in SF that was looking for at least an Android developer.  Couldn't even make it past the initial conversation because the CTO made some assumptions regarding my background (he had thought that I had recently begun programming and that my efforts were admirable for an Economics major), even though about a year ago they were happily willing to take on people who didn't know Android development who were willing to learn it on the job.

I eventually landed a job as an Android developer in a pretty sweet shop out of state.  Coincidentally it offered the most positive interview experience, a development team in which most of the employees held long tenures (4+ years - I find that to be pretty nice because it's an indication of job stability), and perhaps the most skilled and knowledgeable Android people that I had interviewed with outside of the folks that I met at LinkedIn.  For comparison's sake, the people at Facebook that I interviewed with seemed to have had a very shaky knowledge of the platform, but Facebook's interview process was pretty pleasant so definitely no complaints from me.

A part of me thinks that my own background is holding me back.  I know that this subreddit promotes the idea that your degree doesn't matter, but everyone that I know who has a gig at the much talked about Big 4 or trendy startups has ""Computer"" in their Bachelor's degrees.  I know an individual who helps out with a different Android bootcamp in SF who went back to school for a second Bachelor's in CS in his 30's, and that seemed to have worked well for him, resulting in an internship with Amazon to jumpstart his career pivot.  

I actually applied to the OMSCS program with Georgia Tech primarily because there will be quite a few classes that I want to dive deep into.  However, from a career perspective, I'm wondering if a second bachelor's might prove more robust as insurance against...people who might be quick to judge.  There was a thread from a recruiter a few days ago indicating that people can and do throw out resumes that do not list a Bachelor's degree in CS.  I am very happy with the job that I have now, but this is just incase I find myself in one of those job search situations again.  I found [this](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/7686/does-having-masters-degree-in-computer-science-help-your-career) post to help a bit with my decision making going forward, but I would like to hear everyone's thoughts here as well.  A bachelor's seems to be more robust, but a master's is far less time consuming."

Here is a small update. Hopefully the last. 

I wrote an e-mail to Dad and Claudette explaining my side of the story and why I didn't think it would work out. 

---------
*E-mail*

*I am unable to take Ariel on as a roommate, due to my increase in work hours and my internship this summer. I am doing well financially, so I don't need the additional rent I know Ariel would insist on paying. Here is the number for [Helpful Handicapped Student Center.] You will want to talk to Amelia H. She will put you in touch with the right people.* 

*Best wishes,* 

*Sophie.*

----- 

Claudette must have shown Ariel the e-mail, because I got a call two hours after sending it. Ariel had her rebuttal worked out. 

- ""I will be more than happy to wait at campus for you to get off work."" 

- ""Your mom is really helping you out, so you should extend the same hand to me. You should sacrifice for family."" 

- ""We shared a room before."" 

- ""It would be embarrassing to be a handicapped student on campus."" She wanted to be independent. 

- ""[Claudette] has been really mean to me lately, saying I am not normal. I just want to prove her wrong. You understand, right?"" 

- ""I thought we were closer. It is you are healthy and I am not.""

I ended up simply telling her--

""My mom has asked me to pay her back for the apartment when I have the chance. I do not want to share a room with you and I do not feel we are close at all. On top of that, your mom ruined my parents' relationship, so I am not going to do her any favors."" 

Ariel hung up.

-----

A bit later, I got a Claudette flavored e-mail from my father. 


&gt;I thought I raised you better than that. With everything we have done for you, I am hurt you won't consider helping out your handicapped sister. What happens when we die? Will you just leave Ariel and Sebastian all alone? ... We know you will be the successful child and we hope in our old age you will remember who helped you become the woman you are today.

I replied telling them no. 

I got a text from Claudette telling me to lose her number and that I was blocked.

I haven't heard from my dad. I am not sure if I will. I am just kind of glad it happened.
I have removed everyone from my FB and have their numbers tagged to go to voice mail. I am tired of playing games like this.

  
**tl;dr**: TL;DR-- I got an e-mail from Claudette. I told her no. She told me to lose her number. Thank you for your support everyone. I feel much better now. I don't have the emotional stability to be around Claudette and Ariel for long periods of time. I also realized I need to stop fearing my dad's hissy fits."

They change the human mind so drastically in such a short time. The effects can definitely feel good, but what if you experience the complete opposite? An adverse reaction. I'm talking about a Bad Trip. An extreme psychedelic crisis.

I want to make something clear today. Physically, they may be the safest drugs out there. 
But what's even more important? Yeah right... Psychologically. 
Other drugs... all drugs really (Amp, Coke, H, Meth, Weed, Downers) are way more safe mentally than psychedelics, because they don't have such a huge potential to fuck your mentality up in just one go (besides addiction maybe)

I'm now speaking from experience that I still don't feel right in my head after a bad Acid Trip almost 2 years ago.
I took 3 tabs of potent LSD and within the peak I experienced anxiety that was so enourmously fucking strong.

Never in my life had I experienced such a terrible, soul crushing anxiety. It was the most traumatizing and terrifying anxiety in my whole life, it definitely felt on par with the anxiety of being kept hostage in a plane hijack or being gassed in chambers in a holocaust.

For several hours, I experienced extreme mental and physical looping. Repeating same actions over and over again with more intensity every time. In my case, I feared being stuck in a time loop experiencing that one Trip over and over again for eternity. And I had phases where I would relax and recover from the anxiety...

just for a short moment and then experienced an even more terrifying intern anxiety spike that made me scream out my lungs, collapsing in tears. 

And these actions were played over and over again for hours until a point where I collapsed in a foetal position, being rendered catatonic.

I felt like a fucking rape victim. The drug had raped my soul. 

Never have I experienced effects that are so mentally harming on another drug. Imo even Heroin is more safe because at least it won't fuck up your psyche like a Bad Trip will.

Just read this section of Extreme Psychedelic Crisis OF how enourmously dangerous a Bad Trip on psychedelics can be:

https://drugs-forum.com/forum/showwiki.php?title=The_psychedelic_crisis:_bad_trip#The_extreme_psychedelic_crisis

Just my 2c, a drug that can cause states like these is NOT safe. Period."

31vcop,1,2015-04-08,My life is falling apart.,failure26,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/31vcop/my_life_is_falling_apart/,"I don't know what to do anymore. I'm not exactly depressed or just became somewhat depressed recently due to the situation I got myself in.

I failed completely. In the past two or three years I made some of the worst decisions of my life. 

I used to be a college student, engaged in a student organization, in a working relationship and little worries. I always had trouble with procrastination, focusing on important tasks and staying motivated. At the time I should have finished my Bachelor's degree, I still had one class to pass, an internship to complete and my thesis to write. Nothing unmanageable actually. This was in the summer of 2013 and the beginning of when my decisions spiraled into the disaster I'm living with now.

My first mistake:
My then boyfriend returned from studying abroad. We have grown apart as a couple, although we still cared for each other. I still insisted that we move in together. I had previously lived in a tiny, inexpensive dorm room. But I was ready to move out and we got a beautiful apartment, that was bigger and somewhat more expensive than I had wanted. I thought I would figure out a way to afford it.

2) I almost failed that last class I had to pass for my Bachelor's degree. When I passed at the last attempt, it should have been my wake-up call. But all I saw was just a few more credits to go: internship and thesis.

3) I got a crappy unpaid internship. But it was only 3 months and I got along well with the coworkers. My actual mistake was that I postponed writing my report that would give me the credits. I haven't finished it until this day. I'm ashamed. But still can't find the motivation.

4) The relationship with my then boyfriend put me down. I had gained a lot of weight since he had been back and we were growing further apart although we were living together. 5 months after moving in we eventually split up (on good terms). I wanted to keep the apartment and share it what a roommate. Although I don't regret staying here, I have to admit that the apartment is too expensive for a student with nothing but a side job. 

5) Which leads me to one of my biggest failures: I stayed with a job in the service industry instead of looking for something related to my studies (Business). I got really into the idea of starting my own business, but I chickened out - finances, commitment and always the thought in the back of my head: ""You should finish your Bachelor first!""

6) So while I was working unregular hours at the job, I never found motivation to write my bachelor thesis. It wasn't until last spring after my exboyfriend moved out that I even started looking for a topic to write about and a supervisor. I got my favorite topic and a nice supervisor and got started, but still my motivation never lasted long. What did I spend my time with all this time? I worked the job on occasion, met friends and partied, dated (numerous guys), spend the day in bed, slept and browsed the internet or watched series. To be completely honest, this is what I have been doing since December 2013. For almost 1 and a half years I haven't accomplished anything. 
Past December I stopped communication with my supervisor, because I couldn't deliver any results. The longer I waited the harder it got to get back to her. All the work I had once put into the thesis is waste now. Not that it was much.

7) At the beginning of last semester I was motivated to get started: I wanted to take a few classes for my Master's while finishing the thesis, because this way I could eventually catch up some time. I missed deadlines and it threw me back and demotivated me. 

8) I think all the academic mistakes would be manageable to some extend if I hadn't messed up on a financial and bureaucratic level: 
- I have no valid ID because I was always to lazy and cheap to get a new one. I was only able to keep working at my job, because they were sloppy when setting up my new contract. Now that they realized, I don't have a valid contract, I can't work anymore.
Not having a valid ID makes it impossible to find another (legal) job. This - besides my comfort - have been the reason I stayed with this job. 

- My job is quite unregular. Some months I could work a lot and make some money, others it was hardly what others get for pocket money. I managed to tag along this way. But recently bills weren't paid and just piled up. I am at the point where every bill I pay, leaves another bill unpaid. I worked 6 hours last month and will be completely broke by the end of this month. Meaning I won't have any cash to buy something to eat. Well, broke would be manageable. I'm in fucking debt. I don't even (want to) know how deep. My credit report is negative and it will forever affect my life. I just don't see a way to get out of it at this point.

- One of the bills I wasn't able to pay was my health care. I missed one bill ($80) in November (when it all started to escalate) and because of this the health insurance wanted me to pay upfront until March ($400). Of course, if you are not able to pay small amounts you're able to pay five time as much. Who came up with this? A simple call might have made them reconsider and let me pay monthly again, but I just gave up. I probably weren't even able to pay it. 

- No health insurance means that my university exmatriculated me. There was just no way I could bring up that money in addition to the semester fee. So now I'm no longer a enrolled student and haven't told my parents. They keep asking when I will finish my thesis/Bachelor. I started studying in the fall semester of 2010 and so all this time has just gone to waste. I don't know what to do with my life or with myself. I was a thesis away from a degree and I completely fucked up. 

9) When my roommate announced that she wanted to move to a place of her own, I should have moved out of this apartment. I can't afford to live here. But there was no way I would go back to my parents. I love them, but at 26 I just can't move back to the middle of nowhere without a car and friends. So in a few weeks a new roommate will move in and I feel bad, because he has no idea how messed up my life is. I just hope I won't get him into trouble.

10) I recently met a guy I felt really comfortable with. To cut a long story short: I gave up and was so careless that it's quite possible that I'm pregnant. That's all I needed now! 
I have no idea what his reaction will be if I am actually pregnant. He know about the possibility, because I had previously told him that I don't take birth control. I'm not sure if it even matters.

I had given up long before. I'm was just waiting for the day I could not bear it any longer. I wanted to get pass my mother's and brother's birthday and the Easter holidays. I know it will hurt them, but they can't help me. I just don't know what to do anymore. I have around $150 cash left. When this money is gone, I won't be able to afford necessities. There is no more money coming in. I don't even see a way to make any. 

I'm posting this anonymous. I don't think my family or any of my friends have an idea what is really going on. I'm just hoping for somebody to read this, who will be able to help others in a similar situation. I would have needed more guidance. Everybody expects you to be an adult at some age. I felt like I shouldn't be asking for help any more. I was always the independent one. I used to be 'always happy' and 'worry-free'. Even until November I was still positive that everything happens for a reason and will work out.

I probably will get back to this post... to let you know, if I'm actually pregnant (I would be curious, if I had read a post like this) and to let you know what else happens while the cash lasts.

I'm a freshman computer science and statistics major at a fairly highly ranked public university in the US, hoping to build my skills to prepare for an internship next (between sophomore and junior year). I am a bit ahead as far as my university goes in terms of courses (if I wanted to, I could complete the CS core requirements by next spring), but know this does not compare to many individuals at top tier schools like Stanford, UC-Berkley, or MIT. I am wondering what I can do to improve both my marketability as well as my actual skills and knowledge in things particularly relevant to a career at Palantir, because though I am not sure I want to end up there, and am fairly certain that whatever I do, it will still be rather unlikely, striving for that goal would put me in a far better position to get a good internship or job at a different company. 

If there are any resources or particular topics that you would recommend studying to make myself more competitive, that would be greatly appreciated. I have taken calc 1-3, diff eq, lin alg, discrete math, data structures, and a few random stat classes to give you an idea of where I'm at. Other than that I have very little experience with real-world, non-academic programming and problem solving."

I'm looking for a decent-sized room (furnished preferred), with sensible and grown-up  roommates who do not smoke in the house. I pay bills on time, cook, play videogames, ride rollerblades, go to various social events but never bring the party back home, and use the Oxford comma. Even if it's just for two months, I would like to find something that's better than just a place to crash.

Reasonable price derpends on what's on offer, but over $1000/mo is unlikely to be worth it for me. Places near the internship rent for 600-650/mo (and I'm considering it, but getting to Boston proper is a pain, so trying to check out all possibilities before resigning myself to living in the boondocks for two months).

31vr7n,1,2015-04-08,Should I aim for a more theoretical degree or a more practical one (with work experience) ?,dysoco,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/31vr7n/should_i_aim_for_a_more_theoretical_degree_or_a/,"**Wall of text incoming,questions at the bottom**

I realize this question might seem like it has been asked hundreds of times, but it does have some peculiarities in my case, and given how much of a decision is to do a degree, I'd rather be really sure.

**I'm currently a Senior High School living in Argentina, almost 18 years old; been programming since I was 9-10 and always wanted to study Computer Science or something similar.**

**First, I have two options, either I graduate with 18 years old with a High School diploma, or I stay one more year in High School, graduate with 19 and get some sort of ""Software Technician"" degree** (basically it's like a sub-bachelors degree on software engineering).

I have this option because I've been going to school for about 10 hours a day every day, which basically allows me to graduate with a double degree, the usual High School diploma and a Technical degree.

This degree is no big deal, but at least it allows me to show employers that I have at least 5 years of experience programming and studying software development practices.

First, let's clarify: **College here is completely free, however I'd have to move to another city (possibly Buenos Aires) so I'd need to pay rent, food and the usual stuff.**

Anyways, back to college, here the usual consensus is: ""If you want to study computers, go with** Information Engineering**"". Everyone assumes this is some sort of the CS of the United States (working with computers and programming), where, in reality, it's much more of an Economics degree. Sure, it has software development, but it also has a lot of subjects on** time management, cost analysis and such, which sounds utterly boring to me.**

Now, we also have a **Computer Science degree, which isn't really well known**; it's **much more theoretical and math-based than the usual CS program in the US** (Although it depends on which college). But I've heard it creates much better engineers and programmers than those in the Information Engineering degree, which is more intended for management positions.

However, as I said, it's also less known, and here ""Engineer"" carries an important connotation, I'm worried that employers will be looking down at me for not being an Engineer and being a ""scientist"".

I must say though, that **I want to get out of here as soon as possible, hopefully US/Canada or Europe**. I guess the CS degree has much more renown over there than the Information one.

Getting to the bad news,** the usual degree here is 5 years**, given that I'd be graduating with 19 from High School; I'll be 24/25 by the time I finish my Bachelors. However, **the CS degree is 6 years**, and I've heard it's actually pretty demanding and it's not unusual to finish it in 7 or even 8 years. Which means **I'd be graduating with 26/27 if I'm lucky**.

That sounds incredibly old for getting into the real world, I know people from IRC who are 19 and already had 4 or 5 internships.

I also heard that **the CS degree is so demanding (about 8 hours of class a day, morning/noon) that it doesn't really let you work part time; whereas the Engineering degree is a bit more soft, and you can easily work while you finish it**. This would allow me to get some work experience by the time I've finished my degree, and also would mean that I don't have to have my parents pay me everything, which I guess feels bad by the time you're 20+.

**I've always wanted to work on complex stuff**, i.e. Compilers, Operating Systems, Computer Graphics... any area that is remotely interesting and it's not just writing Java for a big enterprise. Given my preferences, CS seems like the obvious choice, but maybe it isn't given the cons I've listed before.

Also **I don't dislike the idea of going into Academia** (which would be much easier from CS than from Engineering), but I'm worried about wages, at least in Argentina, I guess that's a completely different question to ask in another moment, and I still have a lot of time to decide, but keep that in mind.

**So my questions are:**

1. Should I finish my Technician degree? (even if it means losing one more year)
1. Given my case, would you rather study CS or Information Engineering?
1. Do you think 25-28 is too old to get in the industry?
1. Would you rather have a better degree or work experience by the time you graduate?

**Also I might be wrong about some stuff, so if anyone's from Argentina and wants to clarify, be free to do so.**

Thanks."
31vsct,1,2015-04-08,"My superiors, please come save me! MOV files importing into Premiere CC as audio only. Windows 7",saturday186,editors,https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/31vsct/my_superiors_please_come_save_me_mov_files/,"**TLDR: Just like the title says, my mov files are importing to premiere as audio only.

The files giving me a problem are the ones using the Apple ProRes codec.** 

**TLDR #2: So I literally have no idea how it fixed. I fell asleep for about 45 minutes with my laptop next to me. I opened up premiere, the only thing it looked for was render files this time, skipped and everything was working just fine. If anyone has more info on this please contribute. Tomorrow I'm going in to internship #2 where this problem arose, so not fully sure if completely solved.**

So first of all, I know a better option would be to convert the footage, that's the option I'm seeing all over the internet but since the hard drive I'm working with has about 12tb of footage, converting it all seems problematic. On various message boards I've found that the reason the files are being importing incorrectly is because the codec might be missing which makes sense since the files that are giving me a problem are the files running the Apple ProRes codec. But the weird thing is I've been working with ProRes MOV files, no problem, for the past 3 weeks.

I changed my scratch disks on the project to see if Premiere would run much smoother so that could have been the start of the problem, but before changing it my program and laptop did freeze and crash, so it could have started from there.

I also restored my computer last night, just to help it run faster and remove all the unnecessary stuff I've had on it, so it should be a fresh computer running windows 7 pro fully updated. 

Please help, I NEED my laptop for both of my internships and I have no money to buy another laptop, let alone a mac. Also, recommendations on other subs that might be able to help just in case I can't find a solution here.

31vvhp,5,2015-04-08,"[NeedAdvice] Everyone is constantly worrying about me, and the added pressure is giving me a seemly impenetrable mental block. How can I get back to working again?",iruhlman,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/31vvhp/needadvice_everyone_is_constantly_worrying_about/,"I'm a second-year student at my university studying engineering, where I will soon serve the role as the President of our Electrical Engineering Society, the Director of Technology for our student body, and fulfill my first internship in a prestigious energy company.

However, I feel an unfathomable amount of pressure to perform flawlessly from my outside audience, and its blocking my abilities.

I've had a rough few semesters in the past, but I was able to recover to an acceptable level. But it seems as if everything I do needs be completed perfectly. My parents are constantly worrying, being that I'm an only child, and I'm the only child to break the cycle of being in the military. My advisor is stressed that I don't get another bad semester, and my activity counselors know that anything that is done incorrectly will be put on my blame.

I know that it's impossible to be perfect, but I feel that that's what I need to be not only to calm the outside, but to feel confident in myself. The stress has gotten to the point, where I don't even bother working on some days, spending an uncountable amount of time on the internet, and having the strangest sleeping patterns. My friends nearly don't see me as much, and going through 2 recently breakups doesn't help that much either.

I'm going down a slippery slope, but I need to get back. I just don't know how.

Girlfriend of almost 5 months has completely pushed me out. She has clinical depression, and can go weeks where everything is normal, then a dark pit of herself for what seems like a good couple hours or a day. I feel awful, but it usually passes. This one hasn't....

It took me a little bit to understand when she is sad or mad, it's not generally at me, and I do my best to hold her and just listen &amp; be as compassionate as possible. 

Her father is dying (slight chance of survival) and she's about done with college so she is terrified of the future. She has stated all she will do in the end is hurt me, but I told her I won't allow her words to. As myself loosing someone extremely close to me a few years back, I understand the stress and sadness that comes along with a life threatening illness. 

What happened was she went away for a few days to take care of her dad and see some old friends. For the whole trip, I heard absolutely nothing from her. She didn't think of it as a big deal, and when I shared my opinion, she told me she was seeing someone else when she went back home. 

I asked a few of her friends who were down there, as she has almost no time to be seeing someone else as she lived with me practically/ only goes to that place once a month tops (and we have an open phone/Facebook policy). Her friends said that she has said things like that in the past with no validity to try and push people away. If it is true, and she affirms it later on I'll let her be, but I don't think that's the case. 

She is super stressed out with an internship &amp; her dad, so she wants space. My thinking is that space for a depressed woman is the last thing she needs; to feel all by herself. I'm torn, as one day she will say I am the perfect solution to when she is feeling down, then I will be why she is feeling down. Or she's unhappy when she is not with me, but she gets sad about other stuff when she is with me. Very confusing and all over the place. 


Tl;DR

Girlfriend has depression. She wants space, but in the past that is a cry for me to help her, but will say two completely different things in 2 days. "
31w3i6,1,2015-04-08,"Me [22M] with my gf [22F] 7 months, broke up, should i be jumping ship?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/31w3i6/me_22m_with_my_gf_22f_7_months_broke_up_should_i/,"So my gf (22) (lets call her sam) and I (22) broke up last night.  We have been dating for 7 months. This is my first real relationship and this is her 3rd maybe but shes had some hookups in the past couple years.  I left school 4 months ago for a new internship and she is still at school.  We have sort of broke up before, 2 other times, both from me while I was away.  This time it is more real cuz last time it lasted a couple hours only.  We are both miserable.  She is more miserable than me but that is because she is more emotional than me.  I feel like I can't even be at work right now cuz I just want to cry and don't know what to do.

I broke up with her because we fight often.  Since she is at school, she has a really hard time being without me.  Its no picnic being without her but I understand that there isn't much we can do about it right now so I try to just go about my day, texting her and stuff, call her at night for an hour or so before bed.  In the fall it will be the same thing.  I will go back to finish school and she will be home graduated.  She just makes it so hard to do anything besides focus all my attention on her.  She needs me all the time.  I like that she needs me sometimes but I just wish she could handle some things on her own better.  When she tries, she just shuts me out and gives me like one word answers and just is short with me.  So I ask her whats wrong and she says ""nothing"" and then I ask again and she says nothing cuz she wants to be better on her own for me.  I tell her shes going about it wrong cuz she should not be like a teeter totter where she either completely needs me or she wont talk to me.  

So to avoid fighting all the time, we try to see each other every weekend.  Either I go up there or she comes down here, we try to alternate.  Things are good when we are together.  I miss some of my other friends but most of the time they seem insignificant compared to how much I love spending time with her.  But then when we are apart, its like none of that matters to her cuz we go right back to fighting when we are apart.

So eventually I just got tired of it.  We were great this last weekend, we are always great together.  I have hurt her in the past and I am trying to be better but I don't see her trying to be better for my sake.  We fight about the same things all the time.  Her saying that I don't love her.  That she thinks I should date other people cuz I have not really dated anyone besides her and she doesn't want me to miss out on anything.  But I always tell her the only thing she is doing is trying to make me miss out on her.  And eventually all of this kept building up and I just couldnt hold it together anymore.  She has been hurt in the past by her first boyfriend badly and a short ones shes had in between.  But I try to tell her that they should not affect our relationship but should be a learning experience and should make ours better instead of pushing us apart.

Her trying to tell me I should be with someone else just to see what it is like is what really gets to me though.  It is her being insecure about herself.  She has been cheated on before.  So she thinks that it is her fault that she couldn't keep them happy.  So they left to be happy with someone else.  I have dealt with it for months and she still doesn't believe that she is all I want.

I don't want to break up with her but I don't know what else to do.  If she can't change then everything is going to stay the same and we are going to end up breaking up somewhere down the road.  Am I jumping too fast or am I right and just need some time?
   
tl;dr broke up with my gf cuz i couldnt handle her insecurity but i love her so much and dont know if i made the right decision.

Edit: forgot to mention LDR: 2 and a half hour drive each way.  We were best friends for 3 years before we started dating and have many mutual friends.  So that just makes it harder also."

21/M Currently I'm finishing my first year of my masters program on a full assistanceship and I make ~35.5k gross over the year (stipend + internships)

Grad School is all paid for but I have some loans left over from undergrad. Current situation is as follows:

- Loans - 4.5k (subsidized, will not accrue interest until after I finish grad school)

- Savings - 11k

- Investment Account - 7k


On top of that I have good insurance covered by my school, and summer rent is ~1250/mo while school year rent is ~450/mo

I generally move 1.5k/mo into savings which is well over a car payment assuming 4-8k down.

I want to get a nice car to be able to commute cross-country for my internship and it would be nice to have something I can hold onto for a while. Current thought is a WRX, but I'm sure the insurance will be an absolute killer due to my age. I'm sure my parents will put it on their policy If I ask, but I'd like to have some second opinions as the car runs ~26k for a year or two old model at ~11k miles.

So the questions are:

1. is this reasonable? How much should a down payment be? (Credit ~730)

2. What constitutes a 6 month fund? 6k for 6 months? less? more?

3. if the answer to (1) is no, what would you suggest? AWD/4WD is a must and I'm rather interested in cars, but I just can't seem to find the second best to a wrx having owned a subaru in the past.

After I missed out on a sale in /r/frugalmalefashion, I wrote a script for myself to email me when another one popped up. For my Computer Science class this semester, I developed my script a bit more and created a website out of it.

I made a subdomain to search freeEbook sites (primarily /r/freeEBooks), and then emails you when the trigger / key word you input is found. The algorithm is a bit smart so it can reason decently (i.e. an apostrophe won't make you miss a deal), but I'm definitely working on it more!

Check out the website: http://www.damnimissedit.com/ebooks

I'm into graphic design, so I made a logo and what not. I tried to make the site look clean, and am hoping to get some users! This isn't a monetary venture (I lose 4 dollars a month), just wanna help people out, and gain a talking point for interviews for internships.

Also, the site says ""We"" when it refers to the program finding a deal. That was artistic license to make it seem more friendly. It's just me. I send u deal. (automatically)
Thanks! Would love feedback from anyone and everyone!

 Also, I can PM you guys code / how this thing works specifically if anyone is interested."

Runs slow at times but it does it's justice. I just started my 2nd internship and now I'm working with projects WAAAAY bigger than I'm used to. Since I don't have money for a new laptop I'm thinking about just adding some more ram to see if that holds me off until I can afford it. I was doing some research online and I saw it mention how mixing ram can be a pretty bad idea if not done properly. Would the stick I'm trying to buy work well with the one I have?

31x1o8,2,2015-04-08,I have no idea how to handle my parents,seasonsshifttoolate,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/31x1o8/i_have_no_idea_how_to_handle_my_parents/,"Hey guys, sorry in advanced for the wall of text that's about to happen. Part of why I'm posting this is to vent, but if you have any advice too, that'd be awesome.

For a bit of background, I'm 21 and about to enter my last year of college. Currently I'm out of classes doing a 6-month internship (which is part of my school's program -- so I'm still a full-time student). I am paid, luckily, although I live in an expensive city so it's hard to actually save any money.

Anyway, I'm stressing out pretty badly right now over my parents. My mom definitely seems to be an N -- not quite as bad as some parents here, but she has some serious problems and refuses to go to therapy. I always thought my dad was the sane one in our family, but I'm realizing quickly his loyalty to my mom outweighs everything else.

So my dad was going to be in the state at the end of this month for a work conference, and offered to bring me some stuff I had from home (mostly vinyl and signed music stuff that I wanted since I collect it). From talking to him, I thought this was going to be a ""hey here's your things, gotta go to this conference thing now"" -- not a big deal.

I get a text from my mom yesterday saying ""we're coming at the end of the April!"" My dad knows I don't like my mom, basically. I've told him she treated me like crap as a kid (he apparently didn't notice that?). At the time he said ""i'll talk to her"" and it didn't seem like he was mad at me for it, but his attitude has been changing. Anyway, after I get that I have this text exchange with my dad:

Me: ""Mom told me you’re coming at the end of April -- I thought you were just dropping my stuff off? Like that you both are, not just you""

Dad: ""She's going to conf. With  me. We will spend night in [city], leave next morning for conference in [other part of state]""

Me: ""So you’ll only be there for a day? depending on when it is I’ll probably have work and [my boyfriend who I live with] will be in the middle of finals.""

Dad: ""We are driving so we'll get in at night.  Leave next morning.  Maybe dinner if you can stand it and have time.  If not, fine. We don't have to go to [city] at all, but you wanted your stuff.""

Me: ""'if I can stand it' doesn’t have anything to do with it. I thought it was you going to drop my stuff off on the way, so I wasn’t planning on more. But when mom texts me that she’s excited to see the cat, it makes me feel like you’re making bigger plans that involve me without my input.""

Dad: ""Thought we'd drop by that night.  Not a big deal, I'll tell her to drop it.""

Me: ""It’s not a big deal. It’s not unreasonable to want you guys to keep me up to date on your plans. If it’s just dinner that’s fine, but I can’t promise anything else because we have other things going on.""

Admittedly, I might have jumped the gun too quickly -- but they tend to just tell me ""we're coming to visit!"" and I have to tell them no, I have finals, or work. But I didn't think it was a big deal, since I said it was fine to get dinner, I just don't want to take off work since I'm trying to save for rent for the next year (so they don't have to pay it...)

Anyway, I got this essay of a text from my mom today:

&gt;seasonsshifttoolate my intention was to drop your things off see your apartment meet the cat and leave. I didn't even know your dad was thinking of supper. I was looking forward to being with [dad].  I miss him very much. It's been a hard year for both of  us. The only reason I'm going is to be with my husband with out interference from Juli or kids. We can send your things if you want or your dad can just drop them off if someone will be home. You know there are times that me or your dad don't want to drop what we're doing or rearrange our life for a night when family needs us especially when it's something that can wait but we do it and we don't resent it. And we do because we do it out of love and respect. Now I know you don't want to see me. You have made it clear but don't ever talk to my husband that way again. He has given up more has done more for you than you will ever know. How many times has he stopped work just to help you?  seasonsshifttoolate something is wrong here. We expect you to change when you go to college. But you have lost your happiness, humor you push people who love you more than life away from you. We are both worried about you. So when your dad gets back to [where they live] we want to talk to you. We need to figure out what's wrong and how we can help. And you will answer the phone.

This is not the first time she's sent me a massive text like this. I asked her to stop sending me group text messages (because I get them at work or when I'm trying to sleep and quite frankly, they generally have nothing to do with me and get on my nerves) and she was mad because I ""didn't want to be part of the family"". Honestly, I'm getting sick of getting walls of text about how awful I am.

I don't know how to deal with them. I'm worried they'll stop paying my tuition and I won't be able to finish school -- which I guess sounds pretty awful that I worry more about that than having a relationship with them, but I've been dealing with them for years and realize that's just never going to happen. Part of me wants to just apologize and play nice until I'm done with college, but then I feel like a shitty person for basically using them to pay for my stupidly expensive college education. On the other hand, at the time my dad said to not worry about price and he was also relatively sane and knew why I wanted to get out, but being alone with my mother seems to have changed him. I could just say ""screw it"", cut them off, and then figure out how to pay it myself but I have no idea how to do that, since I think FAFSA would still count his income (and I barely get any aid).

I don't know RBN. Am I being a jerk? I didn't actually expect them to bring my things, my dad offered to since he'd be in the state anyway. Honestly, I haven't felt this bad/hopeless since high school when I still lived with them."

31x5gr,6,2015-04-08,I never realized how bad I had it until I met other families. I was raised by a whole family of 6 with narcissists. And for the first time I would like to vent.,Na-nogram,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/31x5gr/i_never_realized_how_bad_i_had_it_until_i_met/,"Okay, I don't even know where to begin. You know, I've been taught not to complain. Ever. Doesn't matter what happens, you can't complain because someone somewhere has it worse. And I agreed with that at first. So, every time something bad happened or if I felt bad I thought ""You selfish prick, be happy."" Which, in turn, made me feel more unhappy. But after seeing all these posts and other families I realized how fucked up mine is and how they screwed me over. For the first time I would like to actually say the things that come to mind. I think it'll actually help me put things in perspective. 

But, where to begin? I come from a family of 7 and I'm the youngest of 22, still living at home. Myself, mother, father, three sisters and a brother. Let's start with the most 'normal' and go up from there. I'll tell how they played a role in my life till now.

My father. I don't even know much about him, really. I know he worked in a factory, I know what he likes to eat, but that's about it. When I think of him I don't regard him as a huge part of my life. Just bits and pieces of him driving the car but no lessons he taught me or games together or something like that. I do remember him asking me to toughen up and help with his taxes. I was 7. I mean, what did he expect? He made me feel bad about it. I said I couldn't understand all those words and he tells me ""What the hell are you going to school for then?"" I saw myself as a failure because I was 7 and couldn't do my father's taxes. I grew a bit older and went to middle school. He gave me a dollar a week. Which I didn't mind at first. But then I realized, a dollar a week for a 14-year-old kid isn't enough to get lunch. But I blamed myself that I didn't work and if I wanted money I needed to work. So, I just starved instead. My lunch consisted of a Snicker or an apple because those were the cheapest. And as 15-year-old you want to see more of the world, new friends, new places, new experiences. Well, my father disagreed. I stayed home late at a friend. I came home and he started hitting me. He smacked me so hard on the ear I heard ringing for days. He told me to never go out again. I didn't understand what was going on. But again, I blamed myself. ""What the hell was I thinking? Going out with friends? You make me sick. From now on it's school and home, that's it."" I said to myself. Then when I started growing up more and earning money with backbreaking, shitty work in retail my dad started noticing I had more money. He says to me: ""Remember all those dollars I gave you when you were a kid? Yeah, I want you to repay me."" I couldn't believe it at first, I thought he was joking but no... he was serious. So, there goes half my salary. The other half I was saving for college, because God knows they didn't save shit for that. I didn't even know parents did that for their children until later in my life. Then I finally got into college and got an internship at a good company. Now he starts asking me for more money. But also, it seems he has loosened up. Now he asks ""Are you happy?"" and I say ""Yeah."" I would love to say ""Yeah, no thanks to you, I did this all myself."" But hey, it's my dad. Still he's not really something to me.

My sisters thought everything I did was annoying for some reason. Playing? Annoying, stop that. Talking? Annoying, stop that. Sitting on a chair? Annoying. Breathing? Stop it! God, I actually thought all I ever did was being annoying and I hated myself for it. Turns out they're just obnoxious themselves with pent up rage they unleashed on me.

My mother. You know, she can be a sweet person but other times I don't know what she's thinking. It's like she doesn't want to let me go. She hit me when I was a kid, don't know why. When I started going through puberty, she didn't want to let me experience life. I wanted to go to a friend's house. She wouldn't let me. I wanted to go with a girl downtown. Absolutely not. I wanted to go to the movies. Nope. I didn't understand why. She just yelled at me. Now that I'm older and I make some money. She says she wants some money from me too. Because she doesn't work and she needs help. She tells me that everything she did for me when I was a child was for free. Nobody paid her to do it. And I actually agreed with her. I thought ""Oh man, nobody paid her. She just did it."" Until I realized ""THAT'S HER FUCKING JOB AS A PARENT."" Who in their right minds expect money to be re-payed from their kids because they raised them? She can't let me go, I think. She worries too much. I asked her once if I could sleep at a friend's place and she said no way. I once went out till 2 AM, I get 19 missed calls from her. She'll call every hour. With college we went abroad for a week. I was the one who got called every hour. We went to a museum and had to turn our phones off. I turn it back on 32 missed calls. My mother calls again in fucking hysteria. I thought ""Dear god, is this normal?"" That's where it began, where I began to question my family.

And then there's my brother... Holy shit, my brother... the worst of the whole bunch. But this post is getting a bit long. I could make another post about him, he really is that worthy of a whole post but if there are people interested I'll just do it in the comments. I feel like I really need to let you know about him.

But despite all of this, I turned out okay. I could've turned out better. Maybe if my upbringing was different I'd be more socially outgoing, other than that I don't have any issues, thank God. Other than feeling depressed when I go home.

31x9m6,4,2015-04-08,My parents aren't Ns but our relationship is dysfunctional in basically the same way. I need to vent and clear my head.,CoQuickAg,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/31x9m6/my_parents_arent_ns_but_our_relationship_is/,"Hey guys. I wanna start off by saying that I don't think my parents are narcissists. Their emotional maturity didn't stop growing at two years old and they can be happy for other people's happiness. They never hit me. Spanking wasn't a thing. They'd put me in time out when I was a brat. I can only think of two times punishment was weird, and it was hot sauce on my tongue. Which was in response to something pretty bad, although I don't remember what kind of dumb hijinks I got into. 

I don't want to make claims I don't think I can substantiate. I don't think my parents are narcissists. 

However, I'm seeing behaviors in myself that make me think there's been some problems in my relationship with the both of them, or at least my mother. A friend of mine has an Nrent and was very insistent that I answer their questions. ""Why am I on RBN all the time?"" ""Why do identify with the ACoNs on this subreddit when I claim I had a perfectly normal, boring childhood?""

And I'd tell my friend that I'm probably just on this subreddit too much because it evokes strong feelings. Maybe it's like fight club where he goes to different support groups to find a way to release his tears. Maybe I just have a hard time allowing myself to cry without some sort of crazy reason. And that I was just raised by helicopter parents, not abusers. 

But today is the day I finally let loose. A new stressor popped up and I hastily texted my partner. I told them that I got a text from my mother about my car insurance, and that this is the beginning of part two of ""CoQuickAg's adventure of grief and the court system."" See, I was the perfect driver everywhere but the highway. Up until I got that speeding ticket, I would drive way over the speed limit. And, hey, I'm sorry I acted like a dumb kid even after years of driving experience under my belt. I'm sorry the thought ""I won't get caught speeding because I'm just keeping up with traffic"" even went through my mind. If I really didn’t want to get caught speeding, then I should have been WAY more careful. Nobody cares if you go ten over and give more than adequate stopping distance and you’re in a long line of cars doing the same thing. But I wasn’t thinking about that. I was thinking about the friend who died while I went home for holiday. I was thinking about how we fought and we never were able to make up and choose a new way of interacting that was more positive. I was somewhat relieved that I missed the funeral (the emotional state of everyone in the room SLAMS me when it comes to funerals) but felt bad that I missed an opportunity to get SOME kind of closure.  And my velocity kept increasing. Police siren, pulled over, court date, terrifying.

I won’t bore anyone with those details. I managed to not cry until I paid my ticket. I’m glad the judge only saw me upset, not ugly crying. That’s embarrassing. There, end of story.

But when I get the text from my mom today “Will talk later but your car insurance bill wasin [sic] the mail yesterday.”, I’m in panic mode. I’m expecting my mother to be screaming and yelling at me, since now she’s going to know I got a speeding ticket, the story I’m telling her. Heaven forbid she finds out I also got my driving privileges revoked for a small period of time and would have lost my license for the time period too if I already switched to this state’s license. I don’t wanna know what she would do. 

I understand the severity of what I did. I spent the weeks up until the court date agonizing over making the mistake and terrified of the kind of punishment I was going to receive. I lost my dignity while paying the fine and am horribly embarrassed about the whole thing. I’m a grown ass adult who doesn’t deserve to be yelled at about a mistake that I paid my penance for and corrected to prevent its reoccurrence. That’s what being an adult is all about-taking responsibility for yourself and your actions. 

This is what she does. She treats me like I’m still a child and cannot take care of myself. I feel bad because I let this go on for so long. Now small things that should be second nature are foreign and they cause me stupid amounts of anxiety. I’m uncomfortable doing basic tasks, like anything outside of the norm when it comes to my own banking, sending mail and writing checks, correct letter format. Don’t even get me started on how bad I am in the kitchen. I have two chicken recipes that I can follow, that’s it. I eat way too much pasta and not enough vegetables. 

I feel like I have to predict her every move because I don’t know how she will react. I don’t want to treat her like an input-output machine but the stuff she says sometimes hurts. I also feel like this spills into other people, and then *I* look like I’m projecting. I expect the worst out of my peers sometimes and am inches from pulling out a sharp retort to whatever ridiculous thing I’m afraid they’re going to say. The only people I don’t do this to are my close friends, and lately I’ve had to ask over and over if I still belong and am wanted and loved for being me, despite being told those things a zillion times. I shouldn’t have such a hard time believing these things, but everything has come to a head and I’m currently a little shaky in the whole self-worth department. 

Here’s the kicker: I can’t pin down specifics. I act like someone who’s been gaslit but nobody in my life repeats an untruth over and over until other people give up or believe in it. The only thing I can easily recall is them treating me like a child. Even then, I have a hard time figuring out which arguments of theirs *kinda* make sense and which are total bullshit. I only really started to see a different parenting style when I got to know my ex’s family and saw how his parents and sibling both let their kids make mistakes and figure out solutions on their own. His sibling’s kid is still a kid and I can tell already that the child is doing way more exploring than I was at that age. That child is has pretty good odds of being a well-adjusted adult, imo. 

But without specific examples, how do I address any sort of behaviors? I’m not even sure what behaviors I’m looking for, since they never did the awful things I read on here all the time. OK, I can point at maybe one discrepancy: I feel like they positively reinforced my grades too much growing up but they claim they always praised me for trying my best. I dunno. Did I turn myself into this grade whore or did they cultivate a monster inside of me? I feel awful about myself unless I can produce results and if I do poorly in school, I feel like a failure as a person. But I don’t want to pin that on them if it’s not their fault. I just can’t figure out where that came from because I don’t remember much from when I was younger. I got bullied and had a hard time connecting with the kids my age. Basically my whole life I’ve been friends with people older than myself. I’m pretty smart and I think that has something to do with it, on some level, but I’m not the golden child (in the context of that one student in college who looks fucking perfect: 4.0 GPA, leader in the clubs that matter to get useful contacts, multiple PAID internships, extra scholarship and research money. I’m steaming and envious just thinking about it. Ugh). I didn’t get straight As. I got some Bs and strove to keep up with the 36s, (It was ACT in my area, not SAT), and with her. So I try not to think back too much on grade school because there wasn’t a lot there to be happy about, aside from being healthy and at least able to go to nice public schools with advanced classes. Those are two things I appreciate more now, sure, but that’s about all I got from before high school. I can’t tell you what actually happened because I just can’t recall it.

So that’s where I stand. They don’t treat me the way I’d like them to and I’m not sure what to say to change that for the better. I’m going to call my mother tomorrow about the car insurance stuff with responses pretty much pre written, in case I end up emotional and upset. I can paraphrase from a script to keep answers succinct, to the point. I can see reminders in my own handwriting of what matters and what I care about. My long term goal is to switch insurance and get the title in my name. Once the car insurance bills and phone bill is separate, I’m completely financially independent from them. I can’t trust them to be supportive when I need them to be so I might as well only tell them positive things and keep my private information to myself. I don’t wanna get burned so let’s take away the fuel.

Sorry for ranting for so long. And sorry it’s not cohesive. But my life doesn’t have an overarching theme. It doesn’t have some greater purpose, just the meaning I assign to it. 

What I’m asking from you guys is feedback. If this isn’t the right subreddit, can someone let me know where this should go? I do want to have a sane dialog, free from the bias I lug around. I also want to ask for some patience and thank you guys for that in advance. While my life problems may seem very simple by comparison, right now I’m struggling. The years of anxiety really kicked my ass and I’m trying to take steps to stop the self harm and keep with the coping strategies I’ve developed. Yes, I’m getting help. It’s just very slow moving to get myself back on track to being healthy so I can pursue the rest of my education. Please please be patient with how monumental these tasks seem to me. I can catch up with the world but I just need more help for me to finally be OK again.

Tl; dr: My mother and I have a dysfunctional relationship and I think that's the reason I empathize with the stories I read here.  My parents didn't hit me or ignore me but there's something wrong and I just can't figure out what it is."
31xd0o,1,2015-04-08,Should I accept an unpaid internship for the summer?,throaway4815,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/31xd0o/should_i_accept_an_unpaid_internship_for_the/,"I'm really having a hard time about making this decision, so any help is appreciated. Just a little background about myself, I'm an Junior student studying Computer Science in the USA since last Fall in an exchange program to study here for two semesters. One of the requirements of this exchange student program is to find an internship (paid or unpaid) or work in a research project with a professor in the summer. In this program they pay me for my housing + meal plan + $300 to any other expenses we may have (this will be relevant later).

Knowing of the amazing opportunities to CS students here in the USA, I started working on my resume and applying to summer internships online. So I found this company on the career fair of my university that was interested in exchange students from this exchange program. Last week I had an interview with this company and they presented what the interns would be working on the summer and also asked a few technical questions about Java and programming in general, but nothing difficult.

A day later I received an e-mail from the company with an offer to work for them during the summer, but the recruiter didn't say anything about payment in the e-mail, and that's when I realized the offer was for an unpaid position, not for a paid position as I was expecting.

When I sent an e-mail to the recruiter, he said that by his understanding I'm already being paid via my exchange program for an internship (the $300 that the program pays me, but the company isn't going to pay me any cent).

I understand that this is an opportunity to get experience in the software development industry and maybe get a letter of recommendation in the future. But I can't deny I got a little disappointed after his response, after all, they are a big e-commerce company, and I'm pretty sure they could pay at least $15 per hour for their interns. 

I would be working with Java and doing unit-tests to test the code produced by the programmers of the company and working 40 hours a week. 

I know it's April and it's really late to keep searching for internships, but my plan in case I declined the offer would be to keep sending resumes everyday, and try to talk to professors from different universities about research since doing something in the summer is a requirement of the program.

I know how much people criticize unpaid internships (that they're illegal, bad for your career, etc), but that was the only opportunity that I've gotten so far. I have experience with web development JS/HTML/CSS and also comfortable dealing with data structures in Java and C. I though that would be enough to hear back from companies, but this offer was all that I got so far. 

Any suggestions or advice of what should I do? Is this a good opportunity for my career or working in a research project in a university would be better? Any advice is welcome, thanks.

31xflk,3,2015-04-08,Intern in final semester...TIFU,[deleted],Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/31xflk/intern_in_final_semestertifu/,"I apologize in advance, I'm an emotional wreck and im exhausted so hopefully this makes sense. I'm an intern in my final semester with two weeks left until I graduate. I work 5 nights a week and I intern during the day fro. 7:30 - 4:00ish. Lately I've been feeling like I'm not doing so well and I've become very frustrated. Well everything came to a head today when my collaborating teacher basically aired any frustration she has had with me to my supervisor. She had never told me the things she told my supervisor and told him I said a bunch of things that I have never said. For example, she told him that I said I have 3 allowed sick days during my final. What I told her was I had 3 days where I was either completely absent from being sick or I came in late (drove across a few states 20 hours for a wedding, got in at 3 am on Sunday and slept through my alarm Monday. Got into my internship at 9:50). 

Another issue we discussed was the time I showed up in the mornings. My contract says I have to be there by 7:30. From January until now, there are probably three or four days where I signed in at 7:35. My collaborating teacher told my supervisor that she shows up at 7:15 (not all the time) and that she didn't know if I'm considered tardy if I show up later than that.  Well long story short, my supervisor told me that if he had know I was showing up after 7:15 (but before my contracted 7:30) we would have gone to the board of standards. I didn't feel like showing up by my contracted hours called for such drastic action so of course I started crying, feeling like a failure and that I wasn't going to graduate. He told me that he believes I am capable and that he won't fail me but that I need to give 110% for these last two weeks. He said he knows I am great at what I do and that he believes I am one of his top interns, but now this is a sort of set back. 

I guess I'm feeling like this was blown way out of proportion and that I wasn't given a fair chance to explain my reasoning and thinking. There were some other issues brought up to me by my supervisor in which my collaborating teacher took something I said and misconstrued it completely. I tried my best to explain what I actually said to my supervisor but my teacher wouldn't really let me try to explain so I ate shit and apologized. There were some actual issues my teacher talked to me about that I did agree that I should work on but I wish she sould have told me when she had those issues instead of waiting two weeks before my graduation. I'm feeling frustrated, overwhelmed and like I'm failing. I also feel like this internship had turned sour as I am my teacher's first intern ever and she tries not to be confrontational, which has helped lead to this blow up. She tries to play my side and my supervisor's side so that she doesn't have to be the bad guy. I'm feeling like I'm not going to get good letters of recommendation because of this which is stressing me out.  I'm really wondering if this is a large threat to my ability to get a job or if this is more of a ""get it together"" kind of talk. 

TL;DR: there has been a lot of miscommunication between me, my Collaborating Teacher, and my internship supervisor. Feeling like I'm a failure and that I was bombarded by issues I didn't know existed. Is this a threat to my ability to get a job or should I not take this personally?"

31xme7,4,2015-04-08,Would a double major in computer science and statistics be beneficial in my case?,Indusco,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/31xme7/would_a_double_major_in_computer_science_and/,"Come next September, I will be attending James Madison University in Virginia. Thanks to the AP courses I took in high school, I will be able to skip at the very least 16 credits. These credits will allow me to get a double major in Stats and CompSci without putting me over 120 credits in college, meaning that I won't need to take more than 5 classes per semester. It does however mean, that I will not have time for electives and I will have a very difficult course load come junior and senior year. I'm hard working and I enjoy challenges, but I wouldn't want to waste so much time if the double major wouldn't be beneficial. Given the above information, would you recommend getting a double major in the two fields or simply getting one and doing something else like research with my extra time? I still plan on getting internships over the summers, considering the fact that I won't need to take summer courses to get the double major. Also, I might choose to get ahead by taking a few summer credits  in my freshman year if I fail in finding an internship just in order to relieve some pressure in the coming years. Thanks for any help!"

Storming ahead in the polls, long time government official /u/remnance627 has had a perfect election run, easily taking the first seat without contest. His reaction to the news has been quoted to be *'worried laughter'*.

Following close behind, relative newcomer /u/DBCrumpets surpised some bookies by taking the highly prestigious seat. On being approached for a statement by our unpaid intern, he declared *""Heresy!""*, stole the reporter's bag of freshly baked muffins, and ran off.

Next, /u/luuklilo's strong campaign tactic of sitting in his office doing nothing at all has seemed to pay off. On being asked for an interview, he replied *""I am honored to accept this position. I am also honored to serve along such dignified periwinkles as these. I would like to thank all those that voted for me, I am very grateful for their support. I would like to extend a special thanks to a person who saw me through this and supported me all the way through. They and their support meant a lot for me. I will do my best to represent the Periwinkles that voted for me to the best of my ability. Thank you.*

Despite a shaky start, /u/cdos93 pulled through, nosing ahead in the final hours of voting to claim the fourth spot, despite public reservations about his departure from international politics last time he was voted in. On being asked about the secret behind his success, the new councillor simply replied *""You can't stop the dank memes, bro.""*

Finally, after a neck and neck contest with fellow candidate AllStarrBand, /u/myductape inched ahead despite having the equal number of total votes thanks to the vital role of weighted voting. Unfortunately, he could not be reached for comment at this time

**Disclaimer**

This is a subreddit with amazing potential. I know that I wish that I could come here for advice as a student. Especially one who is considering grad schools. I thought it was a good place to post resources and advice for those considering history degrees. I see the same posts all over Reddit asking the same questions and I thought that students could use a general resource.

I don't know everything about history degrees. I am still going through the process of getting my undergraduate degree, but like any good historian I researched the hell out of the benefits and negatives of pursing this path. 

For example, yes there are a lucky few who are able to find history-related jobs with a BA, but it is not very likely. This is why a professional degree is almost always necessary. Even after earning their degrees, most professionals take other jobs to support themselves. It is a tough field and I, myself, am counting on using internships and volunteer hours after I get my MA to get me into the business. 

History is not about what you know, though knowledge and education is important and not knowing your subject well enough will do you no favors. However, these jobs are about networking. Count on using this network to your advantage, which will probably be built up in whatever city or region you attend graduate school in.

This may not apply to everyone, of course. And unfortunately, I know little about art history and conservation, which shows in the lack of information. I am in the Public History field, but tried to also provide information on the traditional history field. "

I am 26yrs old and live in Torrance, CA as I have my entire life under my parent’s roof. I graduated from California State University Long Beach with my BA in Psychology in May of 2014. I went through college with an ignorant mind in terms of how the job market would be figuring that I would have many immediate options upon completing this degree, and am currently paying dearly for this mistake. Regret, shame, depression, you name it, the works. 

My work history involves restaurant, retail, and some data entry from circuit board schematics and an in-circuit test machine operator (placing circuit boards on a machine to test for pass/fail), for my dad’s business. On my resume I also have that I am an eagle Boy Scout and that I succeeded in rebuilding my 1989 Toyota Supra engine/suspension with no previous knowledge from the ground up. Since graduating from college I have only worked at a corruptly run Home Depot location for 4 months as a delivery puller which I was unethically and unjustly fired from due to immature management that I will not put on my resume or pursue in lawsuit which I’m sure would be a waste of my time.  

Why I graduated with a Psychology degree? I do not know. My only answer is that it seemed interesting and I just followed through with it. I figured I would be able to score a marketing or human resource position towards graduation, and with no experience, boy was I wrong. I am currently lost on what to do and unemployed. Due to my love for the outdoors I applied to numerous locations in CA and began training for a seasonal wild land firefighting position. I over trained vigorously due to time constraints, injured my knee, and have been to a doctor who refused an MRI and sent me to PT which did not help. I currently cannot run more than a mile without severe pain in my knee that forces me to stop, and the pain lingers for a week. Medi-Cal has proven not to be very lucrative so far and therefore I am contemplating taking a loan out to see a sports doctor or knee specialist in order to get some proper diagnosis and treatment.  Anyways, wild land is obviously on the backburner, if and when my knee does heal, I might pursue wild land firefighting again. The reason I and my girlfriend want to move to the Pacific Northwest anyways is because we love the outdoors and want to be near the forest. 

My girlfriend moved in here about a year and a half ago from El Paso, TX and we have been given a generously low rent agreement by my mom. My girlfriend also has been dealing with depression ever since I have known her and right now it is incredibly difficult. So difficult that she has lost her cashier position at a grocery store due to calling in and basically cannot function normally. So her dad has offered us a “reset” on life. He works as the main IT guy at a major defense company back in El Paso, TX. He has offered my girlfriend and I a three bedroom place to stay WITH him, all expenses and food paid, a Human Resource internship for me at said major defense company, and most importantly psychotherapy for my girlfriend, all paid for by him. 

I am hesitant because he hasn’t been the greatest of character toward my girlfriend but has improved drastically since she moved here. Over the past year he has done such things as actually acknowledged her depression, researched and bought critically acclaimed self-help depression workbooks for both of them to do and actually listens(huge for this man) and supports her mentally. This progress of his makes me feel he will stick to his word, but at the same time living with him could be awkward. I still cannot dismiss the notion that this COULD all be ploy on his part to get his daughter back, despite the fact that he and the family on her side are very fond of me. On the other hand moving forward with this would push me and her out of our comfort zones, add much more responsibility, and be a sort of training on how things will be when my girlfriend and I do move to the Pacific Northwest when we are financially stable enough to be able to afford rent and a few months’ time to secure jobs. Regardless if the internship happens or not, this could be good for these reasons alone. It’s not as if much changes anyway, we are both currently unemployed regardless. It would be a dick move of mine not to go since if she decides to since she dropped her life over in TX to move in here with me, so there’s not really much of a choice, she needs me. 

Things to add to this are that I am decent with computers, have been building my own gaming computers for decades, and do enjoy working with them. My girlfriend is 21 and looking around to start online classes as she does much better academically in her own environment and has a gifted intelligence. The question that remains is what the best route is for me given my circumstances to becoming financially independent for the long-term. 

Thank you all, and very much so in advance!

31xwzv,2,2015-04-08,"Going to be cut off from parents in ~2months. Need advice (21, College Junior)",Esculented,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/31xwzv/going_to_be_cut_off_from_parents_in_2months_need/,"Hey Personal Finance, this is my first time posting in PF because I'm in a little bit of a predicament. I HAVE read the FAQ on the sidebar but I feel as if this situation is a little unique. This post will be a bit all over the place; skip to the TLDR to get a good summary of it. Here's the deal:


I'm a 21, almost 22 year old attending a University of California school. I will be graduating (hopefully!) in June 2016 with a degree in Biopsychology, hoping to maybe go to professional school after undergrad. The first two years I had a job, which allowed me to pay for most of my expenses myself, including car, half of rent, with very very little left over. Now, my parents give me a monthly allowance in order to cover food and little other expenses. They will give me my May+June allowance (roughly $500) then completely cut me off. I only have about 1.5k-2k in savings as I recently had a large car repair bill. 

I DO get financial aid for college, which does cover a large portion of my tuition costs. Roughly, I pay ~$500-1k per quarter. How can I survive for the next year, with little to no income? 

**Here are the facts laid out:**


1) Cut off after June 1st.

2) Currently applying to jobs around campus and off campus, looks like I should be able to get a part time (10-15 hours a week at $10/hr) starting June or July of this year

3) Currently holding a hospital internship which forces me to not be able to work full time


**Here are the costs I am facing:**


1) Lease for new apartment starts July 1st, ~$800 per month, through July 2016

2) School tuition + books roughly ~5k until July 2016

3) Car insurance + gas + 1k for unexpected costs ~3k until July 2016

4) Food costs: $200 per month

My parents suggested I get a loan from the bank, but there seem to be many options and I'm not too sure what the best would be. My parents have offered to help me a bit with this but want me to do most of the research as they want me to be independent. Note: my parents DO have enough money to support me fully, but are cutting me off so I can get a good feel for ""what the real world is like"". Whether you agree with them or not, this is what's happening, and I need to deal with it ASAP. (Just throwing that in there to let everyone know that I won't starve to death if I can't get money for whatever reason)


What are some suggestions that can help me out? I know this whole post is very convoluted but I only had a quick break in between classes and wanted to post something now to get the ball rolling; I may edit it later to be more cohesive.

TL;DR: Parents cutting me off after May 1st. On that day, I will have approx. $2k to my name. All my major costs added up until June 2016 (rent, school, car, and food) total to about $20k, though it will probably cost closer to $25k-$30k with all the little expenses added up. It looks like I will be able to find part-time work (10-15 hours at $10/hour) for this next year. What are some good loan options, or other ideas, to keep me alive until I graduate?


EDIT: Also I forgot to mention that yes, I fucked up. I should have been looking at options a few months ago, but I wasn't told I would be cut off until this week. And yes, I should've saved more money whilst I was working, but since I had the means to pay for myself back then, my parents decided to let me do that.


Thank you so much!"
31xxep,3,2015-04-08,Help! Barely able to function socially,thehegelian,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/31xxep/help_barely_able_to_function_socially/,"Hi guys! I've been a lurker here for awhile now, and now that my new job situation has pushed me to my highest levels of social incompetence yet, I decided I'd post here for some of your insight.

The Obstacles:
1. I am an introverted person. I am content socially interacting with people a couple of times a month, and more or less interact with people outside of my immediate circle (fiancée, roommate and fiancée's parents) at this rate. 

2. I also am painfully shy. I'm 99% sure this is genetic, as my birth mother and birth sister (I'm adopted) are painfully shy as well while my adoptive family is completely comprised of social extroverts barring me. 

3. I know everyone says you're supposed to ask questions and get people to talk about themselves, but I never can think of any appropriate questions to ask. My palms and underarms hardcore sweat and I get so nervous that everything in my mind goes blank or in a loop. I'm so worried about what I'm going to say next that I have a really hard time focusing on what people say to me, and consequently have a hard time responding to them and carrying on the conversation. It's full-on panic mode, people. 

4. I am extremely uncomfortable in a group setting and never can figure out how people can all contribute and get their voices heard as if in some well-orchestrated symphony. I'm sitting over in my corner occasionally tinging my little triangle without the sheet music and getting completely drowned out by all of the other instruments. 

The Assets:

1. I'm actually really good at conversing with people one-on-one once I've gotten over the first meeting. If I can get someone alone and social pressure is off, I'm relaxed enough for my mind to not freeze up. 

2. I do really well in ""business mode."" I can act and sound like a competent, professional adult if we are expected to talk only about work (in a meeting, for instance). 

All that said: 
I'm in a really prestigious internship for 10 weeks. I need to make the best impression possible so that I can get good reccomendations and *hopefully* a job offer down the road. I need to network and, three weeks in, I have made a decent impression on only three employees (and one is a fellow intern who started with me). 

What can I do to better my internship connections and make more of them? 
Do you guys have any tips to help me break out of panic mode?
Group situations?  "
31xyo0,3,2015-04-08,How to best use one extra quarter of undergrad classes?,TheDudeFrom94,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/31xyo0/how_to_best_use_one_extra_quarter_of_undergrad/,"Hello!

I'm currently a junior-year finance and economics double major with a 3.45 GPA, shooting to graduate with honors when I hit 3.50. I have had one internship, non-finance related at a F500 and have an internship in the trading department of an asset management company with $250B AUM. I've worked the entire time I've been in college at internships or on-campus job.

 I currently have three classes available for electives or that I can take whatever I like.

My best options are:

* Add Entrepreneurship Minor - easy classes
* Add more math - I've only taken calc, trig, 2 stats classes, and econometrics - this will likely hurt my GPA, potentially not being able to reach 3.50, but I've been thinking of Econ grad school and this would be needed for that
* Take electives that can be related to business (eg: comm, management)
* Take more finance/economics 
* Take whatever I feel like - easy
*  Take the quarter off and hopefully do full time at the asset management internship
* Take the quarter off and work 2 jobs



What would be the best option? I'm open to anything else as well. Please let me know if I can clarify anything, thanks!

31y2bx,30,2015-04-08,Life Is A Desert,mitch_murder,lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/31y2bx/life_is_a_desert/,"Longtime lurker, wanted to share my own story today: 

I grew up in New York state in a small city called Schenectady, roughly three hours north of Manhattan. I attended public schools from K-12, spent my senior year of high school as part of an internship program with other students from neighboring cities working at the city hospital, and was accepted later that year into college. 

During these formative years, there wasn't a great deal of consistency in key areas--whether it was stress at home, or health issues, I was never really healthy on any level, and looking back on it, feel quite lucky that I was able to make it through that factory-style system. 

After graduating college, I was immediately accepted into graduate school (top-10 for my field, which to be quite honest, isn't saying much--though the reasons why aren't important for the here and now), and spent 3 years in New York City. 

Then I joined the Peace Corps. 

Somewhere along the way, I was brainwashed into the practice of public service, the ultimate sacrifice. While I'm aware of said brainwashing, it does appear to be a main pillar of my very being...and it's difficult to put some distance there. 

I say this because I spent the first quarter of my life essentially self-sacrificing for the idea of a greater good, whatever the appropriate context was. After returning home from Africa, my expectations were very high--having two degrees, with international experience, and the ability to pass a federal background check, I was set. 

Until I wasn't. 

Even now, it's hard to say why. It could be a combination of different factors. The economy. My personality. Competition. Bad luck. Regardless, I found myself living at home for almost a year while sinking into an awful pit of depression and angst as my job hunt lead to nothing but failure. 

Failure and rejection, while being forced to confront the demons of youth--daily. I don't recommend it. 

So, in October 2014, I decided to relocate from my childhood home in New York to Tucson, Arizona--I had family that lived there/here for many years (no longer), and calculated that I could leverage the remaining connections I had in the city while also living as cheaply as possible (as the cost of living in Tucson is rather low compared to the state/country at large). 

Two months after moving, I was able to wedge my way into a local hospital in a contract position at a pay rate of $15.00/hour on the business development team. 

It lasted two months before the contract expired. My boss was fired, unrelated. Politics. 

In order to stay employed, I took what I could get as a full-time employee. 

For the last month, and for the foreseeable future, I've been a transporter. I make $10.00/hour. I work 60 hours a week out of necessity.   

I owe roughly $250,000 in student loans with $13,000 collecting in interest. I try not to pay attention to it, as I've already consolidated everything into two superloans, deferred them, and will eventually sign up for a 10-year public service payment plan. 

In short, I'm 28 years old. I have two degrees. I've served in the Peace Corps. I've lived in two major cities on the East Coast, and moved myself to the West Coast on a desperate whim, now making less then what I made when I had the same job at age 18. 

Yet, all of that being said...I feel incredibly lucky. I'm able to pay my rent. I'm able to survive. I feel like the struggle will eventually pay off--though in some respects, it already has. 

My advice would be this: if you find yourself living at home working a job you despise in a bad market, go Southwest or South. Get out of the winter. Avoid the cold. Go to where the economy is doing relatively well but the cost of living is still relatively low. Hell, come to Tucson. 

Life is a desert. Or a mirage. "

I start my new job soon, but have another interview.",RAP93,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/31y5r3/looking_for_interview_advice_i_start_my_new_job/,"Hello! I'm going to try and give you guys as much detail as possible while remaining clear.

So my issue is I recently accepted a position with a smaller company. However, when I applied for this position, I also applied for a much more well known and larger company that aligns with my career goals much better. I have an interview with this company on Friday, go through the weekend and then begin work on Monday with my job.

So what I'm asking is, do I mention in my interview that I recently got hired? At the time of my application, my resume stated I was still interning. So I plan on giving them an updated resume which will state that I left my internship. I figure my two options explaining why I left my internship are ""I have accepted a full time position with another company and I begin Monday"" or ""I am no longer eligible to intern because I am no longer a full time student."" (this part is true as I graduated in December, however the internship would only allow me to stay 6 months after graduation).

I really want to emphasize that the institution I am interviewing for is an ideal place for me. They posted the position back in January and I did not meet the requirement because I was missing one certificate. I went out and got the missing certification specifically because of the job posting, and with luck on my side, the position reopened (hence why I got an interview this time).

Sorry again for the giant amount of text, but what would be the best course of action (refer back to paragraph 2 for my original question)?

I'm a sophomore in college and I guess I was just in denial about my depression.

I hate it because I've had so much handed to me and I still manage to feel like shit.  I go to a pretty prestigious university in the US and study a really difficult subject (which I'm doing ok in).  I have a prestigious internship this summer in new york also.

But I have no friends at all, and probably never will.  I'm gay, and my parents think I'm going to hell.  I'm not religious, but sometimes I feel like I'm going to hell too.  College has made me so cold and narcissistic.  I lost everything I liked about myself from high school.

I honestly don't give a single fuck about my studies anymore.  I don't care about anyone else at all.  I couldn't get close to someone because I refused to date them and insisted on FWB, which blew up completely.  I have sex with tons of random guys, and sex is the only thing I find interesting anymore.  I've lost all of my interests besides having sex with every guy I see and generally just being an asshole.

I used to be intensely emotional, but now I don't feel anything anymore.  I thought it was just growing up, but it's not.  My life is so empty and I've thrown away everything I was given.

I recently was in a position of responsibility and let a lot of people down and I'm feeling really bad about it.  You all probably hate me a little bit too.  

I always tried to push it down, but for a while I've felt like killing myself.  I don't do it because it's irrational and I know I should just walk away from everything.  But I still fantasize about it a lot.  Everyone would be better off if I were just dead"
31yho8,1,2015-04-08,12 Month Internship vs. Full-time Position?,ohThisUsername,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/31yho8/12_month_internship_vs_fulltime_position/,"I am graduating at the end of April and I recently got a job offer for a 12 month internship at a company. I also recently had an interview at another company for a full time entry-level position which I'm fairly certain I will receive an offer based on the feedback I received from the interviewers.

Assuming I get an offer from both companies, I would have a hard time deciding between the two.

I think the full-time position at a large international company would look \*much\* better on my resume, but reading reviews online I saw there is not much opportunity for growth/advancement in the company. 

The internship on the other hand interests me more based on the company culture, employees seem friendlier and I would be doing a more variety of work which sounds slightly more enjoyable than the work I would be doing at the full-time position at the larger company.

I'm currently leaning towards the internship for a more enjoyable job and company culture, but I feel that the full-time position would look much better on my resume so it might be worthwhile to stick with the full-time position.

Any thoughts or recommendations on this?

So I'm a computer engineering student in Montreal Canada, and I've been on the hunt for a summer internship since February, I've published games and have been developing independently for close to two years now, I have a ton of non-professional experience in three programming languages, however my last internship prospect just dropped me today and I don't know what to do, I don't know any one in the industry and i really want experience in my field. 

Have you guys ever felt like you were out of job prospects? How did you deal with it and what resources are available? 

Personally, if I don't end up finding anything I kind of feel like devoting my summer to building a quality game or some sort of software project and see how it pans out. My only fear is that I need the money from the summer to continue my studies and if I don't get revenue from this it could jeopardize my future. What do you guys think my options are? 

Thanks and I hope to contribute more to the community in the future!"

I am a college accounting student, and I have been looking for low level accounting/bookkeeping jobs (or internships). I have a solid resume and have a good work history. However, all of the jobs I'm looking at require QuickBooks experience! I talked with an accountant friend and she said I could either come in to her work and she could show me how it works, or I could purchase a copy of QuickBooks and learn it on my own. Also, I wouldn't mind doing some freelance or PT bookkeeping for companies in the next few years.

TL;DR - Is $150 a worthwhile investment in a copy of QuickBooks?

31ytvg,2,2015-04-09,Advice About College Major,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/31ytvg/advice_about_college_major/,"I am currently in my junior year pursuing a BS in computer science. My entire college experience has been me trying to find a career path. This is my third major. I started as a freshman in engineering. I wasn’t really liking what I was doing and I decided I wanted to do something with medicine, so at the end of the year I changed my major to biology. I spent at year in biology and after a year struggling through intro biology, and organic chemistry, I decided maybe I wasn’t cut out for the subject. I have always really liked Psychology and I started working on a minor, that I will finish this semester. I thought about a major in psych, but couldn’t decide on a career within the field that interested me, nor was I prepared for the amount of graduate school. I ultimately chose to change to computer science based on my interest in using computers, the little bit of coding I had already learned, and the high job prospects.

During the summer I took the first computer science class, it went well and I was excited, but the past semester I started to think I made the wrong choice. The stuff wasn’t clicking, and still isn’t. My grades aren’t bad, but I don’t feel like I am understanding the material, and my programming skills are not good at all. I toyed around once again with changing my major to psychology, and even saw a career counselor about it. I took a career test and my number one match was Health Information Specialist, followed by multiple computer professions, and a few medical professions such as radiologic tech, pharmacist, and medical technologist. From the results, he also seemed to be lobbying for accountant or the military. I thought about enlisting for about a week, but decided that might be a little brash. After some thought, and knowing this was try number three, I decided to stay in CS.

I went to the career fair a little while back to try to find an internship to gain some experience this summer and maybe a little insight into what I would actually do with a CS degree. After talking to multiple companies, with questions like ""what are some of your personal projects?”, and “why did you choose this major?”, I realized I had no personal projects, and no interest in pursing them, and I didn’t know why I was in the major anymore. I never had a deep passion for the subject, and now it’s starting to show. After the career fair, and some online applications, I had a couple of interviews but have been turned down.

I am about 21 credits shy of a psych degree. I have been going back and forth on doing it for about 2 years now, but I've been too afraid to do it, because of the lack of jobs. I really like psych, and it has always come easy to me, but I wonder if I like it because it's easy or it's easy because I like it. I currently work in a library and I have spent time in libraries my whole life. Both of my parents have masters degrees in library science and I've considered that route too, after finishing a psych degree, but it's job prospects aren't that much better. I’ve always been torn between picking a career because it’s something I love, or picking it because it is practical and will put food on the table. I’ve never really had a passion, so I thought I would go with the latter, but I am not sure I made the right choice. However, with 3 years into school, I’m wondering if I should stick it out with CS, because after 3 tries not finding what I love, maybe I’m not going to find it in college.

Tldr: 3 majors in 3 years, want to change again due to lack of passion, but I'm not sure if I'll ever find it."

* Jessica (19 F)

Pt. 1: Brianna
-
---
So I arrive a jaded young adult to college, new to serious relationships but not to the world of sexual misadventure. The first person I meet that steals my heart is someone who I really only imagine existed. A cute, programming, weed-smoking, short-haired, video-game loving, adventure having, down-to-earth, grown-ass lady. I'll refer to her as Brianna.

Absolutely perfect for me in many ways, but I turn down her early sexual advances because I didn't want to rush things and fuck up what could have been my first real loving romantic relationship. She takes this as me rejecting her, and she ends up failing out, moving home, and getting back together with her old boyfriend (Bill) in a long-distance relationship. The fact that I didn't be proactive and actually do something is a regret I still have.

Fast-forward a few months and I have gotten over the whole Brianna situation and moved on with my life. I figure I was just unlucky and unprepared. I have also arranged plans to transfer schools and move to another state with my friends Mandy, Conner, and Ellen this upcoming Summer for various reasons.

Pt. 2: Allie and Rina
-
---
One drunken night I get to know and make-out with a lovely, intelligent, and eccentric bisexual girl named Allie. This is important later on. 

Another drunken night I meet a girl named Rina who eventually becomes my girlfriend and currently spends all her time at my dorm. The first time I have sex with anyone since moving to this state and school was with Rina and I'm really not sure why it panned out like that. She later tells me that she thought I would dump her the moment she told me she was once molested/taken advantage of here at our school. She thought she was ""damaged goods"" which is exactly what Brianna mentioned she thought she was once. I'm not sure if it's worth mentioning but she lost her virginity as a freshman to a senior and one of my first friends at college who I still hang out with.

Pt. 3: Drugs, Group Sex, and Open Relationships
-
---
I've always been someone who enjoys recreational drugs. All of the young adults involved in this whole thing at least enjoy a bowl every now and then. I sometimes partake with my roommates John and Conner. Rina, Ellen, and John's girlfriend Jessica also partake with us every now and then. 

John and Jessica have an open relationship and at one point my roommate Conner sleeps with Jessica and it's weird but somehow okay?

So we start doing *other* things and it leads to a lot of weirdness but Allie and I are having a lot of fun and not really getting into any drama. We get to know each other really well but we can't be too affectionate because of my girlfriend. It's strange because she's also attracted to girls, this includes Rina. I like Brianna, Allie, and Rina a ton. I love Rina and Allie. I'm very attracted to all three. 

In the midst of all this: My neighbors had an orgy, my other neighbor is polyamorous, another neighbor has a boyfriend, girlfriend and fuck buddy, and my future male roommate sees me as some strange wise man and is weirdly sexually attracted to me? Not to mention Brianna and Bill came back to campus to visit and possibly have a three/foursome. Rina and I were approached but subtly declined.

There was also a moment where Allie, another dude, and I tripped on an island in the lake and had a very interesting time. We also once sat wrapped up in blankets debating whether or not we could make out without hurting Rina or causing a bunch of bullshit. John is also attracted to me and I can't figure out how to make that right because I'm pretty heterosexual most of the time.

In the end: Mandy, Conner, Ellen and I will move out of state, I'll break up with Rina because of the distance and our futures, Allie comes to visit and we come to terms with what we have as our lives diverge. But she also got an internship in the city I'm moving to so maybe something will work out. The great thing is that we don't need to be together as independent adults, she's more into girls anyways, we are just two drifting lives with similar stories and a great interest in each other. To just kind of sum up how I feel about her: She's a satanist and listens to Echo &amp; the Bunnymen and snorts lines of MXE with me and she's also a legitimate scientist and has dark red hair that used to be blonde and a lip piercing and does physics research. I don't think I'll ever meet anyone like her anywhere else and I don't ever want to lose her to time like all these other people will be. I don't want to lose John or Rina or Brianna or even that one senior dude I mentioned earlier. But my life must progress and I gotta get dem degrees, change the world, make the money and all that jazz.

31zhib,1,2015-04-09,Long Term Acid Suppressant Medications (ppi’s): Concerns and Care,Sanjivh,surgery,https://www.reddit.com/r/surgery/comments/31zhib/long_term_acid_suppressant_medications_ppis/,"Maintenance antisecretory acid therapy (PPI’s) are used in many patients, particularly those with gastroesophageal reflux disease(GERD). With the long-term use of any medication, drug safety becomes an important issue. Acid (HCl) is normally secreted into the gastric lumen, where it serves to both digest dietary protein and maintain a sterile environment by removing ingested bacterias. [Proton pump inhibitors](http://gisurgery.info/) (PPIs) are strong acid suppressants, and thus long term usage has raised several issues which shall be discussed in this article.

The three main concerns regarding the long-term usage of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) include :

1. Risk of infectious complications – including Pneumonias, Cl difficile diarrhoeas 
2. Malabsorption of Iron, Vitamin B12, Magnesium and Metabolic bone disease 
3. Hypergastrinemia, Gastric carcinoids and Atrophic Gastritis 

Other concerns include acute interstitial nephritis (kidney disease) and drug interactions particularly reducing the effect of Clopidogrel, which is used in coronary stented patients to reduce the risk of stent blockage.

Infections

A concern with any form of gastric acid inhibition is an increased risk of enteric infections since gastric acid normally protects against these infections. In addition, a reduction in gastric acid secretion permits bacteria to more easily colonize the upper gastrointestinal tract, which may predispose to pneumonia.

Clostridium difficile and other enteric infections

The best documented association of PPI use with enteric infections has been with C. difficile diarrhea, even in patients not exposed to antibiotics(1-7). C. difficile is an anaerobic organism that sporulates; acid-resistant spores are presumed to be the major vector of disease transmission. Three meta-analyses of observational studies have demonstrated an increased risk of C. difficile infections in patients treated with PPIs(8-10). A 2012 meta-analysis of 42 observational studies that included 313,000 patients found that PPI use was significantly associated with an increased risk of both incident and recurrent C. difficile infection(9).

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a safety alert encouraging providers to consider a diagnosis of C. difficile-associated disease in PPI users with persistent diarrhea(11). Given the potential risk of C. difficile infection, the FDA has also recommended that providers prescribe the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.

Associations with other enteric infections, including Campylobacter and Salmonella, have also been reported(12-15), but the risk is uncertain(16).

Pneumonia

The risk of pneumonia in [PPI](http://gisurgery.info/) users may be increased due to a reduction in gastric acid secretion, permitting bacteria to more easily colonize the upper gastrointestinal tract. The increased risk has been seen with both community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and health care associated pneumonia (HCAP)(17-19). A meta-analysis of 31 studies found that patients taking PPIs or H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) were at increased risk for pneumonia(20).

Malabsorption

Concern has been expressed regarding the effects of long-term PPI use on iron and vitamin B12 absorption, though any effects are generally mild, clinically insignificant, and addressed by supplement therapy(21). On the other hand, magnesium and calcium malabsorption may be bigger problems, predisposing to hypomagnesia and metabolic bone disease.

Magnesium absorption

Hypomagnesemia due to reduced intestinal absorption has been described with PPI use(22). In March 2011, the FDA issued a safety alert warning providers of the risk of hypomagnesemia in patients who have been on PPIs long-term (generally longer than one year)(23).

Hip fracture and calcium malabsorption

Long-term use of PPIs may influence bone metabolism. Hypochlorhydria could theoretically reduce calcium absorption(24) and inhibit osteoclastic activity(25,26), thereby decreasing bone density. A case-control trial suggested that long-term use of PPIs was associated with a slightly increased risk of hip fractures in those older than 50 years of age and that the magnitude of the risk increase was proportional to both PPI dose and duration of therapy(27). A meta-analysis that included 11 cohort and case-control studies examined the risk of fractures associated with PPI use(28). The 11 studies included 1,084,560 patients with 62,210 PPI users, 71,339 patients with hip fractures, 161,179 patients with any-site fractures, and 5728 patients with spine fractures. The risk of hip fracture was increased among PPI users compared with nonusers. There was also an increased risk of spine and any-site fracture. The FDA has mandated revised safety information on all PPIs about a possible increased risk of fractures of the hip, wrist, and spine with the use of these medications(29). The FDA also recommends that healthcare professionals who prescribe PPIs consider whether a lower dose or shorter duration of therapy would adequately treat the patient’s condition.

Vitamin B12 malabsorption

Long-term therapy with omeprazole has been associated with vitamin B12 malabsorption(30,31). Thus, it is reasonable to assess vitamin B12 levels periodically (eg, annually) in patients who are on long-term treatment with PPIs(32).

Iron malabsorption

Gastric acid plays a role in the absorption of nonheme iron, and the use of PPIs has been associated with decreased iron absorption(21,33-35). However, in most cases the decreased absorption does not appear to be of clinical significance. One exception may be in patients who require oral iron supplementation(35,36).
Hypergastrinemia
An initial concern with omeprazole was the induction of hypergastrinemia and gastric carcinoid tumors in rats, changes also demonstrated with chronic ranitidine exposure(37). While patients treated with omeprazole for up to 11 years have shown some enterochromaffin cell hyperplasia, no dysplasia or neoplastic changes have been observed(38).

The clinical significance of other theoretical risks related to hypergastrinemia (such as colon cancer) has not been established. One study found no increased risk of colon cancer in long-term users of a PPI(39).

Atrophic gastritis

Patients receiving maintenance therapy have a propensity to develop chronic atrophic gastritis. Although the risk of atrophic gastritis in this context remains unclear, it could theoretically lead to an increased incidence of gastric cancer. In one study, for example, atrophy developed in over 30 percent of patients after omeprazole therapy for a five-year period(40). However, since the omeprazole-treated patients developed atrophy only in the presence of a concomitant H. pylori infection, it was suggested that only the H. pylori infected group was at risk. We do not routinely test for H. pylori in patients who require long-term therapy with a proton pump inhibitor since the risk of atrophic gastritis is small and, in the uncommon patient who develops it, the clinical consequences are uncertain.

Acute interstitial nephritis

PPIs have been associated with acute interstitial nephritis (AIN)(41-44). Drug-induced AIN is not dose-dependent, and recurrence or exacerbation can occur with a second exposure to the same or a related drug.

Drug interactions

Clinically important drug interactions with PPIs are rare. However, some data suggest decreased activation of clopidogrel when used in conjunction with omeprazole on the basis of a shared hepatic metabolic pathway. Other mechanisms by which PPIs might negatively impact cardiovascular outcomes have also been proposed(45). In 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded that patients taking clopidogrel should consult with their clinician if they are taking or considering taking a PPI, including over-the-counter PPI preparations(46-47). PPIs, with the exception of pantoprazole, have been associated with reduced effectiveness of clopidogrel and a resulting 40% increased risk of coronary stent occlusions(48).

DISCONTINUING PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS

Many patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and dyspepsia are maintained on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), but some concerns have been expressed regarding the long-term safety of these medications, as well as potentially important drug interactions. As a result, some asymptomatic patients who do not have other indications for being on a PPI may be candidates for having their PPI discontinued, though many relapse once the medication is stopped. Previous studies have demonstrated rebound gastric acid hypersecretion following the discontinuation of PPIs in patients managed for prolonged periods of time with these agents. As discussed below, no specific method for discontinuing the use of PPIs has been proven effective, and no approach is universally accepted(49,50). Moreover, despite the definition of “prolonged therapy” being likewise unclear, patients treated for a period of six months might be considered candidates for dose tapering. The following are general guidelines that may be employed when stopping a PPI:
Patients with GERD or dyspepsia are considered for a taper after being asymptomatic for a minimum of three months. 

Patients treated for acute duodenal and gastric ulcers or as part of a course of treatment for H. pylori for four to eight weeks do not require a taper. 
In summary, several health related hazards have been identified with a prolonged use of PPI’s, and the the key is to use PPIs only when clearly indicated, and to reassess continued use, so that long-term therapy is used judiciously(51).

So my idea was that I can complete said internship this fall (Aug to Dec) and add this to my resume for a big Silicon Valley internship next summer. So among the interviews I have gotten, there are 2 banks, one being BOA. The role is technical and software development oriented. Does having something like this look good on my resume to a big company in the Valley next year or is it better to intern at a tech company itself?"
31zlcu,4,2015-04-09,I wonder why so few people are mentioning Ernesto.,Tyrannosaurus_Rez,betterCallSaul,https://www.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/comments/31zlcu/i_wonder_why_so_few_people_are_mentioning_ernesto/,"They introduced his character a few minutes before the end of the finale, and they put so much focus on him. He’s just running errands, right? No big deal, right? But the camera follows him out to the car. There are long lingering shots of him, especially from a perspective where we only see the profile of his face and glasses.
Doesn’t he remind you of anyone?

Tbh I kind of think 99.99% of viewers were like, “Oh shit! Ernesto looks SO MUCH like Gustavo Fring!” but then they’re afraid that if they point out the similarity, people will call them racist for thinking any black character with a Hispanic name might possibly be connected to Gus in any way, just based on that similarity.
But it’s not based on that similarity at all. They don’t have the same skin tone. They don’t have similar facial features. LOTS of people in ABQ have Hispanic names. If my hypothesis of him being somehow connected to Gus were based on those things, then I would truly have no case…

What I’m really focusing on are the intentional choices made by the showrunners. The lingering shots show the side of his face, like a profile angle, in order to emphasize the things that they DO have in common visually: his glasses, his shirt, his tie, his haircut. These are all things designed by the showrunners. If it was a facial resemblance (which they do not share) then it could mean nothing. The fact that it is intentional choices makes me think that the resemblance is… INTENTIONAL!

Let’s talk about what he’s like too. He’s smart. He doesn’t need to take notes, but when Chuck condescendingly suggests that he does, does he start a fight? No, he respectfully gets out a notepad and begins to take notes. (What would Gus have done?) He’s professional and focused, but when he sees Jimmy, he is charming, warm, and friendly. Remind you of anyone? Maybe someone who was intensely focused and professional but would also hold family barbecues, smile warmly, and never let his own ego get in the way of his business.

Ernesto… Gustavo… Marco… Pollo?? Okay, I'm sorry, maybe the ""pollo"" thing is a bit of a stretch (it's ""Marco Polo"" not ""Marco Pollo"" lol) but we’ll see. I’m amazed that almost no one seems to be mentioning the eerie similarities (not just resemblance) between the two.

Let me also emphasize once again that I’m not talking about their resemblance in facial features or skin tone, because those are actually the two ways in which they differ the most. It’s the details of their costumes, their demeanors, and the strange amount of focus and screentime that was put on a character who seemed to simply be an intern running errands. The showrunners were DEFINITELY deliberately evoking Gus, no doubt about it. All I wonder now is, why? Is it just a tease or will Ernie become influential in introducing Jimmy/Saul or Mike to Gus?

Edit: I would also like to point out... Ernesto ends in -O, Gustavo ends in -O, and the big pattern this season has been all episode titles ending in -O. Maybe it was a sign that we should keep an eye out?"

I had a paid internship doing database and webapp work over last summer where I learned a lot of C#, some basic HTML, and some SQL stuff. Now I'm in AP Computer Science my senior year of highschool, but I haven't learned many new concepts in class, it's mostly stuff I figured out on my own over my internship. I'm struggling to figure out where to go next in order to make myself a better programmer. I feel like I understand many of the core concepts, but I am unable to elevate that into the clean, fancy, modular code that I see other places. I feel like I have the stereotypical convoluted, confusing code style that inexperienced programmers have. I think I'm looking for resources for ""Advanced Java"" or ""advanced"" something, but then I feel like I'm not advanced enough for that so I just have no idea. Any insight would be really helpful."

I'm employed by a close friend and mentor and work full time (part time during college semesters).  He owns a small business and we do a lot of machine shop work and engineering work.  I've been here for two years and while the pay and hours are great, I'm worried that I'm not ""branching out"" like my peers are to other companies.  I'm becoming pretty good at what we do within in our company, but recently we haven't had much new work and I'm starting to feel like a burden to the company even though I try my best to be productive.  Also the possibilities for moving up are good but somewhat limited, and there are no benefits or anything like that (just hourly salary and flexible vacation/sick days).

I've been recently offered two interviews at two different companies that have found me through the grape vine (references from other places I've worked/ school job fairs) and I'm beginning to think that finding a new internship for this summer is well within my capabilities.  

However I have a moral dilemma.  I don't want my boss to think I don't like working for him, and I don't want to leave him without any replacement if a lot of work starts coming in (we only have a few employees but I work the most hours).  On the other hand I don't want to be permanently constrained to this job if I have the possibility of finding a higher paying one, or one with different opportunities.

Do you guys think it would be better to just stick with my current job or should I try to ""branch out""?  Should I talk to my boss about this?  

What's the professional, moral thing to do here?

Thank you for your help."

I know it's late to get the ball rolling on a summer 2015 internship, but I figured I would post here and see what happens. I was planning on working on my thesis this summer, but it's coming along much faster than expected, and I could pause school for a summer session for a stats/ML/data internship. I am more than comfortable temporarily (and permanently, post-graduation) relocating.

320k50,2,2015-04-09,I don't know what to do with my life and it's starting to drive me insane.,catsorbats,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/320k50/i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_life_and_its/,"As a child, I was continuously praised on how bright I appeared. Adults felt like they could carry fluid conversations with me effortlessly. I was commended on my comprehensive writing frequently. My parents and teachers would often scold me for not striving to reach my full potential. I surpassed my schoolmates in reading and writing. Before I entered school, I learned how to read fluent sentences at the age of three. Because of this, I was able to  skip Kindergarten and go straight to grade school. I always struggled with mathematics, but I could get by with vigorous studying and tutoring. I've never had a tremendous memory, especially towards subjects I didn't care for, but I would learn a little bit of everything so I could at least carry conversations. I told myself that I was going to be a journalist and no matter what it took, that's what I was going to be. I romanticized the idea of being a starving artist. Maybe not starving, but comfortable. That's all I've ever wanted.

I truly flourished intellectually and socially in my mid-teenage years. My days spent reading obsessively finally came to use. Still, my grades were never fantastic. I wasn't a straight A student. I was often too lazy or distracted to study for hours. Starting my junior year, I began to take AP History and English classes against my counselors recommendations. I wasn't the best student in class, but I had a voice. I had confidence in what I wrote. My English teachers always saw and spoke highly of me. They had full confidence that I would do well in college, as did I. Nothing was going to stop me from achieving my dreams.

Then, everything went downhill after graduation. I started dating a great guy and stopped hanging around people who I feared could be a bad influence. I went through years of taking classes and dropping classes. I was given opportunities for internships that I should have taken for journalism. Even the ones I did take, I quickly withdrew from due to fear that I wasn't good enough. This was also linked to my every-growing alcohol addiction. At first, it was just a part of my daily routine. Throughout late high school/early college, I had a great group of friends. They were all highly intelligent in different fields. Some medical, some engineering, some histrorians, some artists. We all varied in skills and also addictions. We joked with each other that we were just functional alcoholics/drug addicts and went with it. We all suffered in our own way, but we came together on the fact that we could handle it. After a while, I just couldn't seem to keep up. I began to quickly spiral out of control. I spent the majority of my days in bed, drunk, basically catatonic. I would get better, slow down on my drinking, and quickly pick it up again. I turned into a despicable version of myself. The worse version of myself. Understandably, after a while my boyfriend couldn't take it anymore. We split and I got even worse. My alcoholism got so bad, that I almost killed myself, purely by accident, several times. I've woken up in places where I had no idea how I'd gotten there. Spent hours trying to piece together the few shreds of memory my brain tried to retain. My behavior became so erratic and troubling, that I lost several friends in my self damning process. I dug myself into a very dark and deep hole that I couldn't find a way out of. 

On February 22, 2015, I decided to get sober. I quit drinking and smoking cigarettes, cold turkey, that morning. I've since been on an emotional roller coaster, but for the most part, I'm okay. I go out every once in a while, but I don't feel the need to drink. The thought of me being drunk again, terrifies me back to sober thoughts. I'm trying to make it up to my friends and family for my previous behavior. I'm in school again, working daily, eating healthy. 

On paper, my life looks fantastic compared to how it used to be. Everyday I wake up, wanting to feel ecstatic towards my current condition, but I can't and I don't. I don't know how. I used to thrive on my intelligence. I was an articulate writer, speaker, poet. Now, I have nothing to fall back on. I can't even go on about Shakespeare or Vonnegut anymore because I don't remember half of what I used to read. I can't form proper sentences while speaking because I have the vocabulary of a tenth grader. When I speak to people, I see them blankly stare at me while I stand there, mouth agape, gasping to grasp words to fill the air. Halfway through sentences, I find myself not even knowing what I'm saying. I then get upset with myself, revert back to behaving like a petulant child, and sulk while having a mental breakdown. Daily, I'm surrounded by all of these intellectuals, who I used to be up to par with. Now, I'm beneath them and I see it written all over their faces. 

As I previously said, I'm back in school now. It's coming to a point where i have to decide which major I want to go for and I have no idea what I want to do. I don't have the personality, nor the vocabulary, for journalism anymore. I've never been smart enough the grasp the accuracy of mathematics. I have the memory of a goldfish, so science and history are also out of the books for me. I can barely focus on one thing to the next. I sit back daily, sick with worry, of what will become of me. I don't even need an extremely lucrative future. I just want to be happy. Every day that I sit here, lost in thought, is just another day wasted. My ex wants me to join him in being a STEM major. As much as I would love to, I don't think I'm mentally capable of prospering in that career. I want to stay with my Communications major, but I'm not creative enough for a creative major anymore. I used to love conversing with people and forming bonds with them. Now, I loathe almost every moment where I have to speak with someone new. I've finally gotten my mental and physical health stable enough to pursue whatever future I'd like to, and I don't know what the fuck I want to do. 

I didn't mean for this to turn into a short story, but I don't like to talk about it with my peers. I'm sorry to whine and complain, but I feel so lost all of the time. I don't know if advice will necessarily help, but I'll take anything at this point. Thank you all."

320l9b,23,2015-04-09,Graduating in less than a month from a highly regarded public school with a decent GPA. No job offers. What should I be doing?,stressedoutcsgrad,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/320l9b/graduating_in_less_than_a_month_from_a_highly/,"I'm currently a senior who is about to graduate next month. I just feel that everything is hopeless right now. The stress of trying to find a job has been mounting on me ever since the start of the year. I have been able to get a steady stream of interviews, but I haven't gotten past the initial technical phone screen for most of them. 

There have been two rare cases where I have actually been asked to come onsite for the final round. I completely bombed the first one. It was probably the most embarrassing experience I have had in my life. I was given a few programming problems to complete, of which I partially completed only one. Even the one that I answered did not give a completely correct solution. I take full responsibility for being totally unprepared and unqualified. That was a waste of time and effort for the company.

The onsite interview with the second company went much better, but I definitely do not think I aced the technical portions of the interview. I feel like I made a decent impression on the hiring managers, and I am still waiting on a decision. I feel like this opportunity might be the best chance that I have of landing a job. If I don't get the offer, I am not sure what I am going to do.

To give a bit more background, I had no prior experience with programming before I got to college. During my freshman year, I took an intro to programming course that kinda sparked my interest. After taking that class, I decided to declare as a CS major. However, as I continued to take the upper level CS courses, I didn't really do anything to help nurture and grow my initial interest. I have done no side projects, and I have basically done no programming outside of the classes that I have taken. I did do a summer internship last summer with a small startup. It was supposed to be a developer role, but I did little to no coding. Additionally, although I have done well in most of my classes, I feel like I came away with a superficial understanding of what was taught. There have definitely been some project-based classes where my team members have carried me. Furthermore, as I started taking upper level classes, I started to get the feeling that my peers knew a lot more than me. 

Technical interviews? I am absolutely terrible. Like I said before, I have done no programming outside of my classes, so I think that definitely has attributed to my inability to do well on technical interviews. Whenever I am given a question, it feels as if my brain just turns off. I have tried going through CtCI problems, but I feel like I struggle through even the easy problems. I took my data structures and algorithms course 2 years ago, so I think I have a high level understanding of most of the concepts. But when it comes down to applying those concepts to a particular question and spitting out some code, I fail miserably.

I am just at a loss right now. At this point, I feel like it's all or nothing with the company I am waiting on. Obviously I'll keep applying to places, but my confidence is at an all time low as I keep struggling with technical interviews. Has anyone been in a similar situation? What have you done to improve your interviewing skills other than ""doing as many practice problems as you could""?

I have had lingering thoughts that I might have chosen the wrong major, but at this point, it is much too late. I am also an out-of-state student, so once I graduate, I will have a considerable amount of student debt to pay off. I am sorry for the wall of text, but I just felt like I needed to get some things off my chest. Hoping I can get some advice from people who have been in a similar situation. Thank you for reading!"

http://bu.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2tyfjn/my_23_m_gf_23_f_of_3_years_including_6_months_of/

After I posted the previous post on reddit, we went no contact for two months. First monht was really hard. I used to wake up at 4 am everyday completely covered in sweat. Gym and no contact helped. I thought i was getting over her and I broke no contact almost a month back.

She started crying and begged me to get back with her. She told me two months back she was still furious with me for pushing her away and she was convincing herself she didn't love me. She also told me she was emotionally vulnerable when she kissed the other dude and there was nothing before that and there has been nothing after that.  I initially told her I didn't want to get back with her but I knew I had lingering feelings. 

So almost a week after flirting with the idea of getting back together, we decided to finally go all in. She seems all excited about getting back. She is currently interning close to my city. She visited me last week just before the start of the internship. I picked her up at the airport.  We spent a night together and then she went back to the city where she was supposed to start her intern. We had decided to meet each other on alternate weekends.

We have been together for almost 3 weeks but it's been kind of very hard for me. Though she tells me she didn't want a break to make on someone else or there was nothing before she asked for a break. It feels to wrong to me that she was rebounding when all she asked was some space to figure out if she wanted to be with me. okay, i won't say it feels wrong. I just dont like it and it's kind of stuck in my head that she gave up because someone else was giving her all the attention.

In the last three weeks we have had a lot of fights. A lot of times when i wondered whether i truly want to be in this. Atleast 3 or 4 times, i must have told her i am not sure if i want to be in this and  yesterday we decided to break up for good and go no contact again.

I know I am obsessing over a kiss that happened months back when we were not officially together. But things she said when i wanted to get back with her are stuck in my mind. She was telling me things like she didn't love me. She no longer felt connected to me. She liked that there was somone there who was attracted to her and she liked hanging out with him and stuff.

I want to be with her but I know I can't be happy if i dont erase these things off my mind. I am kind of stuck between letting her go and letting these bad memories go.
   
tl;dr: we were on ""break"" during nov - december 2014. She told me she made out with a guy during the break. She felt horrible about it but she told me she wouldn't have done that if she loved me and we broke up after that. She wants to get back together now."

I recently accepted an internship offer at NASA Langley Research Center (dream come true) in Hampton and I am looking for furnished apartments to rent for the summer (Jun 1 - Aug 7).

Here's my approximate commute:

That being said, if anybody has or knows of a furnished room for rent this summer in Hampton or northern Norfolk, I'd love to hear about it. Cheers!

Most of the rental places (PadMapper, CraigsList, etc) only have 6-12 month rentals, and I'm looking for a 3 month rental beginning in the middle of May. I'd rather not get a shared room, rather a studio on either a monthly or a 3 month lease (I might be willing to spend a bit more for that).

What I need:

* Pre-furnished (I'm only going to be there for 3 months, rather not buy furniture)
* Refrigerator/Microwave at least (Preferred to have a stove/oven/dishwasher, but I can do without)
* Safe area (Not looking for excitement)
* Easy access to downtown (I'd like to have a single bus ride or walking distance).

I'm hard of hearing, so if I can get a place in a noisy area (near hospitals, train, airport, etc) for cheaper, that'd be excellent.

Huge THANK YOU to this community--you are all amazing. 

Hey, all; I've recently started my journey to sobriety (again) and wanted to stop by and share a little bit. I'm a 20 year old junior in college, and this will be my third legitimate attempt at quitting drinking. I'm cautiously optimistic about this go round, but am admittedly still tentative about and intimidated by attending an AA meeting. I'm certain this unyielding positivity won't persist, but I feel emotionally prepared to deal with life soberly. 

First and foremost, if you go through my post history, you'll see that I stopped by here just about 2 years ago--I was 18, and I had just put up a 1.2 semester GPA, was firmly in the clutches of depression and ready for a change. I had experienced a family tragedy in December of 2013 and had tried my best to drown any and all feelings relating to the incident from that point on.  

That semester was the second of my freshman year, and I had picked up quite the taste for CVS brand rum--$8 a 1.75--that was severely compromising both my nighttime studying and daytime attendance. I had been just a beer guy in HS/Fall 2012, and managed school, sports and other extracurricular just fine as a weekend binge drinker for quite some time. Two stout rum and cokes slowly replaced the weekday late night ""just one Natty"" and those two rum and cokes quickly transformed into two full Solos of just rum. 

2 years ago the week after next (our spring concert) I quite literally tried to drink myself to death. I don't know what happened after about the 13th shot of the hour but one of my roommates happened to forgot something in our dorm and found me passed out on the floor, bottle still in hand.  I woke up in the hospital nearly 2 hours later, hooked up to an IV, stuffed with anti-nausea pills and still blew a .34--I don't know what I peaked at, but I'm eternally grateful to my roommate for keeping me on the good Earth. That was and still is my rock bottom: I couldn't hide from my friends (I had managed to wait until they slept to start drinking on weekdays) or my family (they had a hospital bill coming from their son who ""only has 4 or 5 a night once a week"") anymore. 

I returned home completely ashamed--I wasn't the hot shot with a rocking GPA anymore, and I felt absolutely worthless for wasting my time and more importantly my parents' money. I started seeing a therapist with a specialty in alcoholism, and with his help I reached 95 consecutive days of sobriety--still the longest since I was a sophomore in high school--and managed to put to rest the demons of our family crisis. 

I headed back to school Fall 2013 optimistic as hell, genuinely energized by my sobriety. To this day, I don't know what I was thinking, but my roommate had an eighth and some fresh West Virginia moonshine and I couldn't resist. I have 3 roommates, all of which were infinitely more supportive than I deserved--I begged and bitched and moaned that first day back, took a hit and a pull and couldn't strong together more than 3 consecutive sober days.  I didn't start drinking every day until the spring semester, but fall Thirsty Thursdays bled into Wild Wednesday into I need a drink Tuesdays. I drank at least one drink every day of every week the entire spring semester, bar none. 

At this point, I had rallied in school and made Dean's List both semesters of my sophomore year and landed an awesome summer where I had the opportunity to pursue two of my passions. I swore to myself I was going to dry out for the three months, and the first half went exceptionally well, as I worked ridiculous hours with people mostly 20+ years older than I. 

The second half, though, I shipped up to Maine to volunteer at an alternative school to teach kids at risk of dropping out of high school. Ironically, I was harboring more internal strife than a lot of those kids. The staff was young, outdoorsy and liberal, and while I went two more weeks without drinking I was back smoking marijuana daily: on hikes, at picnics, in the garden, everywhere. We went on a camping trip the next weekend: the inception point for another 8 months of heavy daily drinking. I wasn't even pretending to mess around with beer anymore--it was too slow. 

Here I stand now, 3 real days sober, nearly 5 months removed from pot (I've got an amazing internship and even my dumb self couldn't risk 
jeopardizing that) and ready to legitimately face the music. I'm out of excuses: it's not the summer, it's not football season, basketball season, or even World Cup time. I drank on Tuesday nights (only after all my roommates are asleep) because I have a problem with alcohol.

I don't regret anything to this point other than not medically withdrawing spring of my freshman year, for all of these experiences have led me to where I am now. As I poured my last drops out I felt simultaneously strong and vulnerable; I know it will be exceptionally difficult, and I know I can't be perfect. I'm tired of facing the world with bloodshot eyes, and I'd like to thank anyone still reading for sticking through. This is the first time in quite some time I've verbalized all of this, and it's remarkably cathartic reliving the reality (not drunken memory) of my lows.

I have started to save up for a move to get out of Kansas. I want to know, well, which would be a better option, and what the possibility of being able to support myself on minimum wage. Until I can get a job to start my career. Any information about either area or any suggestions would be appreciated. **TL;DR at bottom**

Currently I am working PT as a delivery driver at the local Dominos in town. This makes my pay variable between 600-1000 a month. I'm thinking a BARE minimum of 3000 is needed to move out (let me know if I'm off). I am going to my best friends wedding in the middle of May. Most of my money up till then will be towards that. Afterward I am going to save back every penny towards moving out. It should be around the end of the year when I have enough.

&amp;nbsp;

As a background I have a BS in Computer Science for KU, no internship, an in major GPA of 2.88, and some small projects on codewars and github. The only experience I have is on my own and in class. I would like to do some openGL, DirectX, general game developing, but I'm currently working on a eMachine E725 laptop. I can do webGL and sprite-base rendering, but the graphics card can't handle much more than that. I have run Blender, Unity, and Unreal3, but they tend to run too slow for usefulness. It also cannot handle VMs. That means, much to my dismay, I cannot test applications for android or apple devices. 

&amp;nbsp;

Sidebar: I am volunteering as a tutor for Adult Basic Education(ABE) GED students and self-studying Japanese(still very beginner). I think I'm going to quit tutoring pretty soon due to the apparent lack of organization and guidance. They pretty much threw me to the wolves with no training, and the person in charge has barely any communication with the people that are actually administering/teaching the GED. On top of that I want to spend more time on developing and self-studying.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR STATS**

**Currently Living:** Central Kansas

**Degree:**BS Computer Science

**In-Major GPA:**2.88

**Programming Languages:**Plenty but best in C++, C, Java, Javascript, and Python.

**Interships:** None

**Experience:**Retail, Help Desk, and Pizza

**Current Occupation:**Delivery Driver Dominos

**Desired Occupation:**Game/Application Developer

**Current Income:** 600-1000 a month

(She's between undergrad and grad school at the moment, and we're on pretty good terms. She's also a massive chemistry nerd.)

&gt; GeoChem\*: Hey, can you come over and help Intern2 with his timesheet password? He can't log in. He tried the default, but it isn't working.  
&gt; Me: Is this the first time he logged in?  
&gt; GeoChem: No, he logged in earlier in the week, I think.  
&gt; Me: So it should have prompted him to change from the default. Okay, gimme a couple minutes.

She leaves, and I think about the situation. The timesheet is no longer operated by the company, so it's a completely separate system and therefore a separate password from the domain logins. The ""real"" helpdesk probably wouldn't be able to help out in this situation if Intern2 is unable to reset his password himself.

I walk over and see him sitting at his desk, IE open to the timesheet - the parent company seems to love IE - and Intern4 and GeoChem standing around his desk. I have him try to log in, and it fails of course.

&gt; Me: Okay, let's just make sure you've got the right UserID typed in. Go to the intranet and search for yourself in the directory.  
&gt; Intern2: Well, it saved the UserID from before.  
&gt; Me: It did? Okay, so it's probably good. But let's just double check.  
&gt; Intern2: *types last name and first name in respective fields*  
&gt; Company Directory: *no user found*  
&gt; Me: Uh... Huh. Try just your last name.  
&gt; Intern2: *types last name in field*  
&gt; Company Directory: *no user found*  
&gt; Me: Well, I guess the company just doesn't like you. Okay, we'll assume it's right, for the time being. Go back to the timesheet. What happens when you go through the ""forgot password"" link?  
&gt; GeoChem: It brings up his security questions, which he answers correctly.  
&gt; Intern2: And then it brings me back to the login screen.  
&gt; Me: Okay, well, let's just go through it anyway so I can see the process.  
&gt; Intern2: *goes through password reset process*  
&gt; Me: Okay, go ahead and type in the default password. *watches keyboard to make sure he capitalizes properly*

After hitting the Enter key, the timesheet site loads properly, with the expected prompt to reset his password.

&gt; Intern2: What the heck?  
&gt; Me: It's PC Technician Aura. It's related to Auto Technician Aura. Simply being in the tech's presence fixes the problem.

As I walk off, I glance over at GeoChem.

&gt; Me: It's a scientifically documented phenomenon.  \^_~

321hgb,1,2015-04-09,Just accepted an internship- employer has changed what department I would work under twice already...,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/321hgb/just_accepted_an_internship_employer_has_changed/,"Hi guys I need some advice on what to do in regards to my internship. 


I went through three rounds on interviews, where I originally applied for a position working with a division in the company that creates small business tools (Lets call this A) in VB.net that use their databases to manipulate/view information. HR told me I would be better suited for a position that was a little more hardware related (POS systems, lets call this B) and less software based on my experience. I agreed, but during the last interview I was told I was being considered for another position that was even less software and pretty much no hardware (pretty much running SQL queries and sending the data to whoever requests it, lets call this C).


I was given an offer on the spot for the internship and I accepted. After we started talking more I was told that I will find out what position I will be in next week.


My issue is that the position has changed so much and I feel like this new position (C) is pretty much a waste of my time. I would rather do A but B is a solid backup and I feel like I could contribute and learn a lot in it.


What should I do if I am called back next week and told I will be starting in position C. I am pretty busy so I have no qualms rejecting the internship all together, but I really would like the experience to put on my resume.


Should I take whats available or discuss my concerns with HR when I get the call?


**TLDR:** Applied for position A which was mostly coding and dealing with SQL tables, was told I would be better for B which is little coding mostly hardware. I was ok with this, during last interview was told I was also being considered for C, which was pretty much running SQL queries and sending them to whoever wants them (waste of my time IMO). What should I say to HR when they call me back and I am given C instead of B?"

321kne,14,2015-04-09,"[Career/Vent] Got caught in the oil downturn, am considering enviro geo to stay relevant",Malemocynt,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/321kne/careervent_got_caught_in_the_oil_downturn_am/,"So a couple weeks ago, the oil downturn finally hit my work and I was laid off in anticipation of the dearth of jobs my division can secure.

After a week of collecting myself over the suddenness of the change, and weighing options on where I should continue, I came to the decision that I wasn't quite ready to abandon my geo degree (BSc. Geology: General @ UTA) and attempt for something high-status, high-risk, and high-reward such as studying for med school, become an actuary, or the sort.

One thing I am certain of is that I am done with oil and gas. The inherent boom/bust cycles doesn't jive well with my philosophy of work and now that I have experienced it unfolding in real-time as opposed to in abstract and from reading history, that sector has left me disenchanted.

At my previous job, there was great promise initially as it was with one of the leading service companies for monitoring and analyzing hydraulic fracturing. The atmosphere was congenial, the benefits fair, and the active learning culture was all present, so I had hopes professional growth would be achievable in the following years. Not so long after, the company got acquired out by a larger service company, and with it came the values that tend to come with an acquisition, which meant more adherence to the bottom line, many more layers of accountability, and the general attitude of throwing more bodies to a problem to get results out on time. The increased interest in fracking also meant more attention was paid towards getting as many bids as possible to gain more revenue which cut into much professional development tracks. Promotions were also highly political in motivation and strongly correlated with how well management skills were for certain divisions. I was contemplating jumping ship, but the nature of my work kept me so chained to the business that I was pretty much actively working up to the minute I got that phone call.

Now with the layoff I am given the time and space to gain an opportunity, but I am still unsure if I am approaching it correctly.

I've read around this sub and other forums about the nature of environmental consulting work, and I recall the interviews with a few companies I applied for not too long after I graduated college, so the nature of the work aren't that mysterious to me, and I sense the profession for people with a geology background seems more ""grounded"". If it means more stable scheduling and better sense of professional development, I'm for it.

One thing I fret over is if my work experience carries over any relevance into the new field. I get the foreboding sense that the nearly 7 years I worked in microseismic would be worthless compared to some fresh graduate with the relevant courses, undergraduate research, and internships. However, I've been told by some that this isn't necessarily true, and that ""any experience trumps no experience"".

Also, I see credentialing is a significant aspect, and that is something I'm fine with working towards. One thing I regret not having done immediately after graduating was taking the ASBOG FG. Having that done with out of the way would have been a good first step for any direction, but now I'm hitting the books to review my learning so I can take it within the year. If I can land a job in enviro and hang on enough to take and pass the PG, I feel that would be a significant milestone. Also, many job listings put HAZWOPER 40 as a requirement, but that can usually happen in the beginning after hiring for most companies, right?

Also from reading job listings, are the usual field duties for entry-level geos. Some seem to ask for 1-3 years experience with well samples and using the tools of the trade. I'm not sure where one would have learned that unless one specifically studied hydro in college and interned for a bit during. How open are consulting companies with on-the-job training?

Another path to take is to apply for grad school, as most jobs in geosciences (and most of STEM in general) pretty much require an M.S. to get started into the industry. I was pretty burned out from academia after getting my BSc. that I wasn't all too willing to go to grad school then, so I was lucky to have found work at the level I'm at. Even now, I'm still iffy on the idea because I am still petrified of the process of figuring out what school would make sense, what advisor and specialty I should pursue, and being creative enough to figure out a subject to base a thesis on when there's so much in the body of knowledge I risk retreading old ground. Of course there's also Professional Masters degrees depending on what area I want to work on, and that could also be a decent intermediate level to further strengthen my foundations. Of course, many affected by the downturn probably have the same idea, and that may harm my chances of acceptance to a grad program I would work with.

To be frank, I majored in geology mostly as a cop-out from studying something ""harder"" like engineering because I am more a fan of studies that synthesize various fields into a larger work as opposed to focusing intensely on one aspect of a thing or overly abstracting concepts beyond reality. Plus, it was the one subject that wasn't taught as a standalone course when I was in grade school (this was before Texas enacted legislation to add geo as a course in grade school), so taking them in college was something of a dream come true, and various disciplines used in tandem with the study never fails to amaze me. This is why I believe I want to get as much mileage out of this degree before I think ""welp, that's it"".

So do I have my head on straight here, or is ""grass is greener""-ism getting to me in an unhealthy fashion?

Is there anything else I should know to better prepare myself for getting into enviro geo work, and how are the prospects in general in light of the oil downturn and mass layoffs? Am I expecting to be jockeying with other former energy geos for a spot in the door?"

[Any new releases coming up that you could tell us about? Also, how did you get your foot in the door in this business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6vqlq?context=5)|I'm really excited about Tyler's new album. He's actually literally asleep in front of me right now in my office (he didn't sleep since he announced it and launched his app and did his only interview on Dash Radio this morn with Shane). He's been working his ass off and it is going to be sick and put a lot of people who were sleeping onto him. Love his app too (check it now- Golf Media).
 |I got my foot in the door through a couple people; my father introduced me to someone who wrote at Hits magazine (the it magazine back in the music biz heyday) who connected me with people, stretch armstrong who kind of took me under his wing, and steve rifkind who gave me a job when i was a 16 year old kid in MN.
[Why is your audio watermark so loud on your free mixtapes? And often in the middle of a song. I can understand putting it at the beginning, but halfway through the chorus, I'm not a huge fan of the loud, stuttering ""d-d-d-d-DJ SKEE"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6v50z?context=5)|GREAT question! Back in the day, we did that so other dj's couldn't steal songs. Today it's a lot less prominent (and I always tried to do it less than others) but has 2 reasons;  1) to promote the dj/brand/station breaking it (if it isn't there, everyone will take credit for it) 2) to encourage people to buy/stream the real version instead of bootlegging the free one for artists.
[No offense intended, of course. I love your music, I just want to be able to hear it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6v50z?context=5)|When I do, most of the time, i try to make it add energy and make as least annoying as possible. But when I get that new Kanye song or whatever first, I have to do to promote our station and brand or everyone else in the world will take. I worked hard to get the opportunity and to the point where I can break these records (not to mention everything behind the scenes to get it) and that's the only compensation I get.
[I figured it was to avoid stealing music, but never understood how prominent / effective it is.  Since you've been doing music with the likes of all sorts of different artists, (Kanye, Game, etc.\), I just wonder what the difference is between working with huge, mainstream artists like them and working with independent artists (like Tech N9ne's Bad Season\)?  And, in regards to Bad Season, what did you think about all of the controversy surrounding that mixtape?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6wm79?context=5)|I don't really look at the difference- i think a dope artist is a dope artist no matter if they are huge or underground. As for Tech, in general, he is amazing. Strange Music has a bigger &amp; better infrastructure than any record label I've ever seen and those guys are smart and have done it on their own the unconventional way. [plug= they also have a station on Dash Radio]
[Had to step out for a few hours, but thanks for the replies! I really enjoyed hearing your work combined with Tech's. You two go together real well. I'd love to hear your unnecessarily loud watermark on more Tech songs ;\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq780ff?context=5)|Me too- stay tuned!
[What up Skee, big fan of Dash Radio and was into the whole BlackWallStreet movement Game had going, my question is, what was the energy like working with Game on that 300 Bars Mixtape? That is probably one of the top 10 best disses of all time in my opinion.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6uyyb?context=5)|Man it was incredible... and one of those rare moments in life where you just know everything is about to change. I actually ran into Game on the street before we did it and he told me he wanted to diss 50 and had 5 mins already recorded and gave me the CD to hear. It was cool, but all over one beat. I went straight to the studio and did a 'jackin for beats' type mix and sent it to him to say you should try it like this as listening to one beat- especially the one he had- for 15 min would have been brutal and his message wouldn't have come across. He loved it, called me, and came straight to the studio. 3 days later we had an entire mixtape done &amp; my life changed forever.
[What made you disillusioned with mainstream radio ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6upa5?context=5)|The same things that I think frustrate a lot of people. Beyond almost every station being controlled by a few companies that force profits over anything, it just isn't good. Lack of variety, repetitive playlists, too many commercials, and the shady side of it from payola to radio promoters and so on. The final turning point for me honestly was one day when I was speaking to kids at a high school- when I said I was on radio they looked at me like I was so uncool. More knew me from my sneaker videos and they all said radio was corny and sucked. I knew I had to step out.
[Do you like the direction the sneaker collecting game has moved in the last decade?  Also do you like the direction the Nike has taken with its basketball line the last few years focusing more on technology?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6v0d5?context=5)|I can't knock it as I made a living as a teen as a reseller back in the day... even though it sucks not being able to get something you really want because everyone is buying to sell. at least back then you could still get something if you got their early, now with bots etc its insane! I have a network of connects I have to tap into to get stuff now and I only get that because of who I am. As for the direction, i love the tech side. That's what it should be all about for basketball shoes, let lifestyle kicks be for off the court.
[What's your favorite pair of shoes? How do you think that all of the celebrity endorsements that Adidas has been gaining recently is affecting the sneaker atmosphere in general? Can you shoot me a pair of yeezys? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6usw8?context=5)|I had saying it and being cliche but concord XI's... they are the shoes that started my addiction off as a kid and still classic. I never was a huge Adidas guy but i LOVE what they have been doing recently; beyond Ye's (and sorry i only have one so can't send you some), the Tubular's are awesome and I love the boost+ stuff. They are killing it now and offering some much needed competition to the swoosh.

And yes you can survive without a car if you don't need to be all over and work close to where you live, and live in a district with a lot of stuff in walking distance... but it wouldn't be easy.
[Why are you on fuse and not on Axis TV anymore?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6ynxm?context=5)|Just made sense business and goal wise- better offer &amp; bigger network with more of our focus. Had a great time over there and am still close with Mark Cuban. I reached out to him before I made the move and he encouraged me to do it and has always had my back- i'll forever be grateful for him for the opportunity.

Never was interested by drugs- the real world is crazy enough for me. For alcohol, I grew up with an alcoholic so it scared me away.

More for sentimental reasons... I remember being in studio at Hot 97 as a teenager when Stretch Armstrong  (who helped introduce me in the biz) broke those records first.
[SDE!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6vexr?context=5)|Yup!

However I have managed to get to final round interviews with a very small startup that right now is just the cofounders. They said they are hoping to hire a bunch of interns for the summer as well as several full time employees, but I'm kind of concerned about this. The founders have tons of industry experience and come from top schools, but I'm still worried about how my experience interning in such a small company may be. I don't want to end up in a situation where they expect the interns to be as capable as full time employees, especially considering I don't have too much experience of my own and really just want to learn.

So, has anyone had experience interning at very small startups like this? I'm certainly interested in what they're doing, but I'm concerned that I may not have a good experience considering they don't have many full time developers"

I have an Associate degree in Networking, but after working in IT for 2-3 years I've realized that I want to move into software development. A couple of months ago, I left a position because of the way I (and my coworkers) were being treated.

To make a long story short, I didn't have another job lined up because I needed the break and was planning on going back to school for a BSc in CS. I applied and was accepted into a state university's CS program and will be starting in August.

I'm living on savings right now, so I thought short-term contracts or part-time gigs (server install/decom, system deployments, etc) would be perfect to support me not only over the summer but throughout school until I can apply for internships.

I had been talking with a couple of recruiters at contracting companies, but it seems like they stopped contacting me after I mentioned that I'll be going back to school in the fall.

What gives? Did I show my hand too early? Do I have bad breath over the phone/e-mail?

Beyond that, are short-term contracts/part-time IT gigs even an option at this point?"
321zde,0,2015-04-09,Research vs practice as an undergrad,weazelsniff3,nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/321zde/research_vs_practice_as_an_undergrad/,"I'm one year out from graduating nursing school (BSN), and have some options for how I spend my last summer break before I have to be a grown up.  Last summer I did an internship at Vanderbilt doing cerebrovascular research, it wasn't paid and was mostly administrative (not my niche), then came back up fpr school. I have family in Nashville, and more plan to move there in the future.  I'd like to stay close to them because I don't have anything pulling me anywhere else, so this internship was a good foot in the door at Vandy's hospital. During this school year I've worked as PCA in float pool (not a fan, I have to sit a lot), but have gotten hire offers on different units I've floated to.  

Originally, I was planning on trying to get a Full-time PCA spot on one of those floors, and then continue that into the school year and be a part time student. In the midst of being totally content in this plan, that same internship called me and said they wanted me back and would pay me this time around.  They also said I'd have more responsibilites, would be taking on some of the trials they have running, and could also be a contact person for the nurses and MDs on the floor. But at the end of the day, I didn't love that internship.  I loved the city and my family, but admin isnt my scene.  So here's where I'm at:

  Benefits of staying as PCA: If  I work full time, the hospital will cover my tuition; I get more experience on the unit; get out of the float pool and actually know who my coworkers are; spend my last summer working three days a week and hanging out with my friends who I may very well move away from in the near future; I don't have to find someone to sublease or a place in Nashvillle; scrubs instead of office attire; can travel in my off time

Benefits of that internship:  research is cool, right?; connection at Vandy on a neuro critical care (my favorite to float to anyway); time with family and a chance to make friends in the city; I've become strangely apathetic and down about job/school/life and a change of scenery would be good; not wiping poop; Nashville is my kind of city, big fan; resume booster (if anyone would actually care?); potentially get published which is just a cool thing to say

Thoughts?  Ya'll know what the real world is like, so what is the best move for me?"

[Hi, Lauren! I absolutely love the show. Do you have any particularly memorable stories from working on the set?

322dg8,2,2015-04-09,Choosing between two internship offers,[deleted],finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/322dg8/choosing_between_two_internship_offers/,"Hey /r/finance, I'd like your opinion on a decision I have to take for my summer internship as a second year uni student.

I am currently facing 2 offers: analyst in a small PE firm (about 3B AUM), I would be working closely to a few people there and would probably learn a lot and have quite the busy and interesting workload OR, intern at a huge PE firm (think Blackstone/Carlyle/KKR), probably rotating between a few departments, not sure how much I would learn or how tight and caring the environment would be. 

Basically the tradeoff is knowledge vs reputation here. I have a good feeling about the first firm and the people working there even if it is not really well-known and I know I'll have an interesting role (probably PE Analyst). The second firm is huge and extremely well-known but I am not exactly sure of the specifics of the internship yet, probably some sort of analyst rotating between their few divisions (all related to finance/PE/investment of course).

I still have one summer ahead of me before graduation and am planning on getting a IB internship at a BB next year, that's why I'm leaning towards the big name at the moment.


What do you guys think? Thanks in advance."

I really like both campuses but I'm slightly leaning towards UCI since I like their dorms way more and they also have all you can eat dining commons whereas UCSD has their dining dollar system. I chose Revelle based on a teacher's recommendation and deeply regret it after visiting the campus. The GE's are bearable. I'd feel more at home with Warren though. I don't know how much weight this has though since I will most likely only be living on campus and using the meal plan for my first year. I like the campus at SD slightly better because it has in my opinion, more beautiful architecture so it kind of offsets the dorm situation. I'd like to note that I feel a bit more at home at UCI's campus though. For that reason, I am also at a loss there. So I guess my decision comes down to:

1) Which CS program is better in terms of preparing you for a career after college? Most of you are probably Irvine students so maybe give me the likes and dislikes that you guys have experienced? The only thing I know that differentiates the two schools is that SD begins with Java and Irvine now has a Python core. Does this matter much? One of my friends told me that Python is not really marketable in internships and that businesses are looking for students with more Java experience. During my visit at Triton Day, almost all of the student panel had received internships freshmen year. I don't know if that is the case with UCI because their ICS presentation is on the 18th. I assume that these students were handpicked though.

2) Continuing with that, which gives the better internship/job opportunities? From the websites, I've gathered that major companies go to both schools such as Google, Apple, etc. but I'd like to get some student insight because I can only assume schools tend to generalize those things for marketing purposes.

3) I noticed there were several nice restaurants across the street at UCI. Is there anything else to do at UCI? For example, something along the lines of hiking at the trails near UCSD or any other cool dining/hanging out areas.

I finally have a bit of free time so I don't mind making a post. Other than my back constantly hurts and my boobs swelling up if I don't pump every hour, I don't have much to update.


My niece is back with her mom again. I had to break my NC and the restraining order (is it even possible for me to break the restraining order?) to deliver my niece's stuff to her house. I have a key to her house and purposely went at a time I knew she would not be there and she ended up showing up. Btw I checked their spare bedroom and it no longer has cribs for my daughters and names on the wall that she came up with. There is a crib and clothes but they're all gender neutral. My sister ran to me and hugged me and apologized and said she loved me and missed me. She also begged me to get rid of the restraining order so that her new baby (oh yeah she's pregnant again) can be in her niece's lives. I didn't want to piss her off or push her over the edge, so I calmly explained to her how badly she's hurt me and my family and that I will never forgive her or give her another chance to hurt us again and that we want nothing to do with her. She started hysterically crying and I started to feel bad, then I remembered all of the nights she caused me not to sleep because I was terrified, so I gave her her key back and walked out (my dad dropped her daughter off a little while later).


The babies are doing great! They're doing great for preemies and smile so much, although I'm pretty sure its still just a reflex. We will be leaving for our two week getaway in Hawaii and I am terrified of taking the girls on a plane. I'm thinking about making little bags with earplugs and candy or something for the passengers we're sure to annoy. When we get back we will be moving out of state (meaning I will loose my scholarship and internship, but its for the best) and hopefully never have to deal with these ridiculous people again."

Many other good things are happening too. Plus, I'm a good looking guy who has a great sense of style, and I seem to have a general charisma with people.

That being said, I have never had a girlfriend. I won't count high school because I didn't want that. In first year I met (well, actually introduced myself) to this cute girl, and we dated for a bit. Never my girlfriend though, because she has a crazy family (I stopped talking to her). I met some other girls along the way, they were interested but they just don't really have anything in common with me or SEVERAL OF THE GOOD ONES HAVE BOYFRIENDS. UGHH.

Of course, I do have some female friends who would be willing to date me, but I am not remotely interested in them so it would never work out. It seems like 70% of the girls I am interested in are in relationships. Or just other unfortunate stuff.

So yeah, the truth is I hate being single. It's not even about sex, I just want someone who I can be with romantically and basically be my best friend. I met this girl who I am crazy into last week, but it turns out she has a god damned boyfriend. People say that these things work themselves out naturally. But I'm afraid I'll live like that and find myself 7 years from now no further ahead and lonely.

I am currently 20 and have learned from my mistakes and hope to run into no other issues regarding my immaturity of exchanging explicit pictures. I have been kept up at night lately as I am in fear that this will hinder my chances of becoming a police officer.  Has anyone exchanged/sent nude photos and everything worked out for them?

I'm currently not going to school (Graduated early, school doesn't start until around August) and I am currently a Registered Pharmacy Technician. So I don't have a degree related to IT and have a job that's not related to IT at all. 

Should I get some sort of computer science degree before applying to any help desk jobs, internships, etc? I just find CCNA so fascinating and I want to help myself out as much as possible so I can eventually have a career involving it.

My doctor gave me Mirtazapine (15mg), mainly because I told her I do not want the decreased-libido side-effects that all those SSRIs have.

The first couple of weeks on it were pretty good, however the last 2 weeks everything just started to go downhill. For the first time ever I was having serious suicidal thoughts, which felt totally coherent and logically inside my head (which is totally weird because actually I really do not want to die). I am sure this is caused by Mirtazapine.

Well, now I am scared to continue those pills. I talked to my doctor about it, and she advised me to stop them by taking a pill every other day for two weeks, and then stop completely. However the stories about withdrawing from this medication I read online are horrific. I am extremely scared, especially because I really can't fail on my internship again (this is my second try, first time failed due to my depression and anxiety), but I'm seriously scared that if I take those pills again, the thoughts will come back, so I am even considering stopping cold turkey.

My question is if anyone has any experience with stopping that drug? My dose was not that high and I didn't take them for THAT long, so I am hoping it won't be that bad. But somehow I still gotta manage to go to work every day while going through withdrawal."

I hope I explained everything well. Please let me know if you have any questions.**

My GF and I have been in a relationship going on 5 years now. The last 3 years or so have been LDR while she is in Grad school and I am working. We're about 1000 miles apart most of the time.

I have a decent job, and it allows me to fly up there and visit every couple of months. (I should add that she flies down to see me as well, so it's not a 1-way street by any means.) Obviously I can't take off the time / don't have the money to fly across the country all that often so we see each other for a long weekend every couple of months usually. However this Summer, she got an internship in a city near me so she would be closer.

So now that I have established some context, time to get to the point. We have had issues communicating for a long time. A lot of it is definitely my fault, as I have always had a hard time communicating my feelings, even to her. We have had breakthroughs in the past and I am definitely much more open with her than I have ever been with anyone, and I feel like I can trust her with sensitive topics. But I still have a hard time with it expressing myself and instead bottle up a lot of those feelings and I feel that the level of expression that I am able to provide is not enough for her.

For example, I am very optimistic (to a fault) about our relationship (Once we are back together, we will feel just like how we do on our weekend trips/when she's on break from school and we're together, etc). I also tend to be very passive about things that happen in my life (everything happens for a reason,  I can work around/through this issue instead of dealing with it, etc) which I recognize isn't a healthy thing to do. Since we're in an LDR, it's easy to lose focus on the other person when they aren't around and I am definitely guilty of doing that too. I would like to think that I am not a horrible boyfriend, but one that cares deeply but has a hard time expressing these feelings verbally instead of through actions (which are also hard to do in a LDR). 

Whereas I am an 'optimist', she is more of a 'realist' as she puts it (focuses on the problems in our relationship and can't move past them until we fix them). She has tried to communicate issues with me in the past, but I am sure that I glossed over them and did not give them the attention that they deserve. I now recognize that it is a shitty thing to do, but only recently did I realize how often I do this. 

We have talked a lot about this difference between us lately. Like I said, I am beginning to recognize how often that I am doing this, but it's hard for me to recognize when I'm doing it still. I keep questioning myself about every little thing, to see if I am glossing over 'problem areas' and only focusing on the good. I'm not sure how else to go about this.

I have also taken to writing a journal, in order to record my feelings and emotions on things that are happening on a day-to-day basis. I find it to be helping me with my empathy problems and helping me to focus on the problems/situations around me so that I don't just put them behind me without dealing with them. I am now trying very hard to confront these issues head on.

 I'm more than willing to admit that I have issues communicating, and it is causing some major friction in our relationship. I have been trying to stay focused on improving my communication skills and to be more considerate of her feelings on things, but I'm having a hard time with it and I'm not sure if I'm doing it right. So I'm trying something new/different and asking for help from others. Reddit, can you please help me figure out how to communicate more effectively and try to not be so dismissive of my GF's feelings? I love this woman and want to do everything that I can to keep from losing her. Maybe it's already too late for that, but even so I would like to make a positive change in myself because this problem affects every relationship that I have, not just the one between me and my GF. 
   
**tl;dr**: GF and I are in long-distance relationship. I find it hard to communicate my feelings, especially when she is so far away and has been for so long. Looking for advice on how communicate more effectively others (not just her) and not just be passive and dance-around important issues like I used to."

I'm new to the finance game, and am one of those MBA career-switchers, going from the film industry into the business world. 

I just landed my summer internship at a large technology firm in Portland (where my school is), working as a Finance Analyst, and I'm slightly terrified if I don't start preparing for it now I'll be super bad at my job. 

I'm so green that I literally just heard of capital budgeting for the first time last week, am just now learning how to value stocks and companies myself, and generally just feel underprepared at the moment. For the internship interview I created a 7-page outline of the company, finance definitions/ideas, and basically memorized it all to have something to say, but now when the real work comes in 2 months I need to be 100x better than I am now.

I would love to hear any recommendations for how I can prepare - I'm currently in a Financial Management class where we're doing a lot of modeling, valuation, and NPV problems, so that's a start, but I need to be doing more - especially with Excel. If anyone has an end-all best ever Excel tutorial as well I'd love to hear recs.

You all helped me once before and I'm hoping for some more help again.  Wall of portly written text coming at you, so I'm sorry.

I got a random group of text messages, out of the blue from a really good friend of mine Wednesday nights and I'm not quite sure what to think.

Scenario:  I've been friends with Sarah since we started Uni.  We met the summer before at a campus event and hit it off.  I know her family well, her dad and I chat often.  We have the same major so often times would be in a majority of the same classes and would hang out on our nights off.  However, I started Uni in a relationship (I know, I shouldn't have) and she was in limbo with her LTBF.  When they would have problems, I was there for her and vice versa.  We did an internship in Orlando together, working for a large company, for 6 months.  We would hang out every day after work, go to the parks, etc.  We were close.  However, through my own stupidity I put some other things in front of our friendship and we had a falling out.  Once back at Uni we went our different ways.  I stayed in my apartment while she moved off campus.  We would see each other now and again but nothing major and we grew apart.  We didn't hang out like before the internship, nor did we talk like before either.

The Problem:  I was at the Firestation Monday night when I got a text from her referencing something from our internship.  We got to talking a bit, and this is how it went;

* Me-'Sorry for being a terrible friend and that I shouldn't have put things ahead of our friendship.  I was such an asshole to you, and you didn't deserve it.  
* Her- It's fine, I understand.  I just miss you' 
* Me- 'I regret leaving the program early.  I'm sorry' (I left early due to my now exes Grandmothers funeral). 
* Her- Me too.

Texting some more we decide to grab lunch this coming Sunday.  I happily agree and owe her this much at minimum.  But then she asks if I'm okay; mentally.  She says I've just been distant and away it seems like and she wants to talk;

* Her- In all seriousness.  Are you okay?
* Me- What do you mean?
* Her- Are you okay?  You've been away forever.  Just tell me what's going on. 
* Me- *Answer that doesn't have a place in this thread*
* Her- I wanna talk to you.  Seriously.

The conversation goes back to joking around and thats it.  However, and this is critical, I know she is with her roommates drinking.  She never actually mentions being drunk, but still.

Turn to Thursday, we see each other at school and she mentions how she mentioned lunch to her friend on Sunday and that she might come along.  I have no problem with this, I didn't think lunch was a date.  Reason being, she is an 11/10 and I'm a 4, maybe.  Like, I'm not even kidding here, she is amazing both inside and out.  She's a homerun, I'm barely hitting it off the tee.  

So I have come to you Reddit.  Am I reading to much into this?  I asked a friend of mine what she thought about the whole thing, and she told me that she doesn't think Sarah views this as a date, but the fact that she went out of her way to text me even when drunk means something.  Further, her asking our mutual friend to come along is a buffer (Some kind of girl speak) but her initiating the lunch and such means there is something.  Honestly, I'd be over the moon just to have my friend back.  She's made my time here bearable as I hate this place, and don't have many outside friends here.  So, what says you Reddit?

Tl;Dr:  Old friend texted me out of the blue asking to meet up, wants to talk; Am I looking to much into it?

Thanks everyone,

I know no one and bf is interning across the country, how should I go about this summer?",strandedinsf,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/325wr3/me_19f_with_my_boyfriend_19_mf_in_an_ldr_of_25/,"TW: suicide, self harm 



============================== 

A close friend of mine killed herself by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge 2.5 months ago. I became severely depressed afterwards (going on medication recently) and have been having increasingly number of suicidal thoughts, as well as a self harm (cutting) relapse. 

Last year I accepted an internship in SF for the summer, before she died. I still feel like I should continue with the internship since I already found housing and doing productive work will probably be better than being alone in my hometown. 

I don't think I would act on suicidal thoughts (mostly guilt from hurting people close to me), but I can foresee the summer being miserable.  I don't know anyone from my school who's going to be in the area (apart from someone who's going to be at Stanford, which is somewhat far away), and I don't foresee myself making close friends with anyone from work or the small group of other interns. 

BF had two competing job offers: One with [large tech company] that provides mostly uninteresting work to its interns, and [smaller research company] that presumably has more interesting work, which is located in NY. The first makes significantly more, and one of the prospective internship locations was in SF. BF didn't look into that though, just accepted the second one (which ironically I recommended him for, before everything went to shit).  (Also, this sounds really petty but he'll be living with his friends while I'll probably be a shut in.. bleh) 

Initially I thought I would be okay with scenario and was really gung-ho about looking at different things I could do alone in SF (eating out and such), but recently I've realized that I would be even more depressed currently if I didn't have my support group of friends who I see on a daily basis and can talk to. 

So I'm fairly concerned with my mental state this summer. In addition to going on medication, I'm taking the precaution of finding a private therapist (have been going to a counselor for the past 6 months) in SF. But I realized that nothing I can do to prepare for this is going to help as much as the thought of seeing my BF every day (that's like automatic happiness). 

I've mentioned this to him but at this point, it just acts as a guilt trip which I feel bad about. But the impending thought of the summer is also stressing me out. It's very difficult for me to feel supported by long distance messaging and video chat when I want to hurt myself. And the fact that we're in an LDR where I don't get to see him very often already just exacerbates my frustration with the situation. 

I guess my question is, how do I proceed from here other than the precautions I've taken so that I don't end up seriously hurting myself over the summer? And, how do I mention things like this to him in the future (bringing up how I feel) without making it seem like a guilt trip?

**tl;dr**: Friend committed suicide in city where i'll be living alone for 3 months. BF will not be there. How do I deal with this?  And how do I bring up the general issue of ""making sacrifices for the sake of the relationship  / other partner's mental health"" in the future? "

3269ak,2,2015-04-10,Are macs really worth it? In need of a new laptop.,saturday186,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/3269ak/are_macs_really_worth_it_in_need_of_a_new_laptop/,"So my reason for needing a new laptop is because my laptop crapped out on me during one of my internships. I was archiving about half a tb of footage on Premiere CC and it froze on me 4 times. About an 1-2 hours wasted trying to get my laptop to work again. After one of the workers there left, I used their ""SLOW"" mac which had about 2gb of ram and it worked WAAAY better than my computer. Slow on start up but once inside of Premiere it blew right past my computer performance wise. I've never been a fan of macs, but at that moment I started to actually believe that macs are actually better for creative work. 

[My current laptop](http://www.amazon.com/HP-g6-1d60us-15-6-Inch-Screen-Laptop/dp/B006OEL8J8)

I know it isn't ideal for video editing but it was given to me after my last laptop saw it's final day. And it works just fine for me with MUCH smaller projects.

I currently have the opportunity for a family member to actually buy me a new laptop at the moment but that's around the $900 max range so I found these laptops [ONE](http://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-15-6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop-59418264/dp/B00K6ZIKYW/ref=sr_1_8?s=pc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1428704759&amp;sr=1-8) - [TWO](http://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-17-3-Inch-Laptop-Drive-80FG0037US/dp/B00SB4B330/ref=sr_1_4?s=pc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1428704759&amp;sr=1-4) that, to my knowledge, should be more than enough to handle my workload for a fraction of the mac price. But if the conversion to mac is fully worth it above all, then I also have the opportunity to borrow some money and be able to slowly pay it back from family, but since I'm not in the best place financially (just graduated from college in december) with a bunch of bills and student loans coming up, I'm not sure if I should commit unless I know for sure it's the better path. 

If Macs aren't worth it, I'm going to post to a laptop recommendation sub to see what is the best choice PC wise. 

So what should I do? Sorry ahead of time, I know it isn't exactly a filmmaking question. I do have a desktop that works beautifully, but for my internships at these production houses, I need my own laptop. 


Edit: I already have a Windows desktop that does me justice, I just need a laptop at the moment."

I know this has probably been asked before but I feel like this question is important enough that it warrants its own sidebar FAQ link or something...


Ok, so I understand the process is: 

* Step 1: Acquire skills
* Step 2: Apply for jobs
* Step 3: Wait for H1B


And I get step 1 and 3 - learn RoR, and 50% chance, respectively - no problem. 


Step 2 though. What's the story? What do employers and recruiters look for? And what are the chances, the percentages?


Apparently there's a lack of relevant skills in the states, that's why companies are willing to sponsor a visa. Does that mean anyone with webdev skills (or any skill that shows up regularly in job requirements) can just apply online and something to the order of 1/10 companies will be all over him? ""All over"" meaning: ""Please work for us, I'll pay for a flight for an interview and maybe a H1-B too."" (Can't currently pay for those things myself, so that's important to me).


Is this something worth trying? For reference, here's my personal resume tl;dr: CS sophomore thinking about his final 2016 internship (hoping it'll be in the states), has several side projects including android apps and rails apps, and has one upcoming big 4 2015 internship (would favour **any** american offer vs even an optimistic return to this big4, that's how bad the pay disparity is)"

I've been searching around to find an answer to my question, but have been unable too. So I just have a few questions I'm hoping you guys can answer through experience!

I was wondering when do accounting firms typically hire for the Winter 2016 (January to May) internship period? Would it be later in 2015, such as September, Oct, and December? 

How would you guys recommend me approach them, should it be through their recruiter or do I just wait for postings to come up?
Keeping in mind, I'm interested in mid-small tier firms, and big 4 as well, but with my qualifications that would be stretching it.

Finally, do you guys think its worth it to delay a study term to do a internship or should I just do them in the summer (that is when I am off school)

Thanks guys!"

I would love some insight into either of these. For the rest of this post, I will be discussing what the school actually offers.

ChemEng has a couple of focuses that can drastically what type of classes I take.

-Material Science and Engineering

-Process and Energy

-Environmental Engineering

-Biomedical Engineering

Now, the school I am going to actually combines Computer Science and Computer Engineering into a single major.

Opportunities:

-Competitions

--Mars Rover Design and Build

--Chem-E Car

--MicroMouse

--Hackathon

--Water Treatment

-Clubs

--Association fpr Computing Machinery

--American Institute of Chemical Engineers

--Technical Engineering Club

-Internships

--Both majors seem to have a decent amount of internship opportunities at my school. CompSciEng seems to have maybe one or two more.

Within the past year or so, my life has slowly went from being happy and being able to work for hours straight to being a miserable person and being unable to stay awake for three hours without feeling like I need to take a nap. I’ve had multiple mental breakdowns, fell behind on multiple assignments and lost friends because of this.

Exhaustion has taken over my life.

Because of this, every day feels like the last. They now all almost go the exact same way and can be broken up into three parts:

1. Wake up exhausted, prepare for work or school, sit or lay down for a moment on my couch and fall asleep until 1 p.m.
2. Wake up again, feel even more exhausted, take my medications, eat, lay down on my couch and fall asleep until 6 p.m.
3. Wake up again, eat, finally feel energized, take my medications, work on something I was supposed to do hours before and fall asleep at 2 a.m. until the next morning.

If I’m lucky to get out the door to go to class or my internship, I usually feel exhausted. I feel tired, irritable, frustrated and usually just want to go home.

It wasn’t like this before.

I used be happy. Despite my Asperger’s Syndrome, I was becoming pretty sociable with my classmates. I had a near-perfect GPA in Year 1 of my journalism program, won eight awards for my stories and had been named the co-lead for the school’s news radio show for Year 2 along with two others.

Everything was looking up. Then everything seemed to come crashing down.

Within a course of a year, a lot of things happened.

First, my Grandmother died. She was the only person I could speak to about anything on my mind. I also had enough of my Mother, who was (and still is) a two-faced narcissist who got mad if anyone didn’t do what she wanted, and moved into my Grandmother’s old house. My Mother was (and still is) the landlord. Each of us own about 50 per cent of the property.

The house then started falling apart within a week of moving in. The phone, internet and cable lines, washing machine, dryer, refrigerator and the air conditioning unit all needed to be repaired or replaced. The hot water tank also exploded, ruining most of the carpeting and furniture in the hallway and living room areas. Along with that, multiple bills started coming each month and I was (and still am) always in overdraft because of this.

When I eventually started the second year of my program, everything started to get to me. Before the semester started, I was weaned off my medication. I had been on Risperdal, an antipsychotic medication which I was prescribed with to deal with anxiety and anger issues in Grade 8. By college, the medication had stopped working.

That was a bad decision. I became very hyper throughout the day and couldn’t handle social situations. I also started to have sleeping problems and would sleep in most days, which led to me missing assignments, classes and stories. During this time, I had an internship which required me to work long hours some nights after class.

Soon, I was having constant mental breakdowns. I was smashing things around my house due to stress every few weeks. By October, I had to take time off of my internship and resign from my co-lead position. By November, I started going to the hospital due to my breakdowns. Those visits weren’t much of a help. By December, I had been in the hospital three times during the semester.

After the third visit to the hospital, I was put on two new medications called Risperidone and Teva-Venlafaxine, both of which cause dizziness. Due to my situation, I had no choice but to accept the prescription for these two pills if I wanted any hope of feeling better.

Since I’m writing this, the medications didn’t work.

I can no longer get through the day without taking a nap at least twice a day. I’ve failed assignments, skipped classes and claimed stories only to never show up because of this. As I mentioned before, I can’t talk to anyone in a conversation anymore without feeling tired and losing interest.

I’ve been told by multiple classmates that I was doing better in Year 1 because my medications seemed to be working back then.

With an aching back and leg problems along with the mental and energy issues, I don’t know how long I can last before I fall asleep for good."
326wcr,2,2015-04-10,"When my girlfriend (F/22) and I (M/25) broke up, we agree to maintain minimal contact for a length of time. Now that time is almost up, and I'm not sure how to address things I've learned about since then.",ShortWhiteFriend,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/326wcr/when_my_girlfriend_f22_and_i_m25_broke_up_we/,"I was very much in love with this woman. We fell for each other very quickly when we first met at college; we had been dating for a year and a half when I graduated, and I managed to find a job in her home town. As *her* graduation came closer, we talked about marriage quite openly -- musing about possible locations, casually browsing engagement rings, etc. However, her parents expressed a strong desire for her to ""live life"" for at least a little while before settling down. While we were a little bummed and the prospect of more waiting, eventually we agreed.

Along those same lines, she decided to take a sort of...paid internship with a college outreach organization (host retreats, small groups etc. for college students), a two-year commitment that would more or less randomly ""place"" her at one of their sites across the country -- anywhere from New Jersey to Arizona. She felt it was something she *should* do, but when she called me to announce her intention, she was pretty distraught. I assured her that I would support her in whatever she believed was the right thing to do, and was willing to do whatever I could for our relationship -- even if that meant waiting for a couple (more) years before marriage.

Fast forwarding a bit: she got assigned to a site a few states over, and the training took place in *my* hometown, pretty close to where we went to school, but a few hours away from her hometown where we both ""officially"" lived. Naturally, I drove down to see her the day before she left. On the way, when asking her where to meet and when, etc., she only gave strange and somewhat cryptic answers. You probably guessed it: we sat down a little secluded garden and she told me she needed to step back from our relationship.

I'll once again fast-forward through all of the details of the actual breakup and my thoughts on that. I was shocked and hurt, but generally understood where she was coming from and could agree that trying to maintain such a serious relationship at such a long distance for so long would be, at best, extremely difficult. We also agreed that, in the interest of allowing each other to process and to focus on their own lives/selves, we would break off contact until Christmas, and then again until May-ish (this all took place over the summer).

Alright, well, that sucks, obviously. But I found a lot of strength and resolve in the idea that we were both just freeing each other to focus on ourselves and our ""callings."" I'm currently balancing a demanding full-time job with full-time graduate study, and my daily workload certainly confirms the idea that it would be virtually impossible to maintain a relationship on top of it all.

Now, coincidentally, over the past few months I happened to catch wind of the name of a young man who attended the same school as me and my ex-girlfriend, and was now clearly associated with her to some degree. I didn't want to jump to conclusions, but kept my eyes and ears open -- it seemed a little odd that she would be fostering a strong connection with a young man who wasn't living in the same state.

I tried not to let it bother me, but occasionally I was overcome by curiosity and found that, for example, she had added the young man's entire family on Facebook. I eventually texted her younger sister (with whom I still have a great relationship, as with the rest of her family) just to ask if she was familiar with the guy's name, and she said she was. (I didn't push the conversation any further than that.)

I debated what to do with this information for a while, and finally decided that it would be best to break protocol and call her about it. It seemed to me that if I knew about it but didn't initiate the conversation, then either she would eventually have to ""confess"" something that I, in fact, already knew/suspected, or *wouldn't* tell me something that I knew, and neither situation seemed all that great.

I texted her suggesting the idea, saying that there were some things I wanted to get off my chest before we talked in person in the summer, and she was agreeable. It was a good conversation, definitely made some things clear that hadn't been, nobody got upset or anything. I said I had a speculative idea of developments in her dating life, and she was pretty up front in responding that, yes, she had recently begun seeing somebody.

However, since then I've noticed that -- presumably between the time that I texted her sister and talk to her on the phone -- she deleted all of ""new guy's"" family members from her Facebook friends. Which, to me, is a pretty clear sign that she intended to remove all ""evidence"" that she had any connection to him. In my conversations with her sister since the phone conversation, it was clear that she (the sister) was pretty nervous about whether/what to respond when I had texted.

I'm just not sure what to make of that. I worry that she hoped to keep this new relationship hidden because there are details about it that would hurt me, beyond the usual sting of ""my ex is dating somebody else."" On the other hand, I could see wanting to keep it under wraps simply as a way of protecting the other person's feelings if you're not sure how they will/might react upon finding out.

What is most important to me at this point is for me and her to have a chance at a normal, healthy friendship once this time of minimal contact has passed. But I'm concerned that her motivations behind trying to prevent my knowledge of her newly developing relationship will undermine that.

I should clarify that this doesn't have anything to do with a desire for us to get back together, or that I was under the impression that we were just ""taking a break"" before dating again.

Any advice?

tl;dr: My ex-girlfriend was open about her new relationship when I hinted at it, but I'm not convinced that she would have been open about it if I hadn't asked, and I'm concerned and confused about why that might be. Should I be?"

I acknowledge that now, but obviously I cant go back and right those wrongs.

I have a personal website made, a project from school, and a personal web application I made after graduating.

I'm in college, living in a stable home with a good family. I'll be moving out soon. I'm doing well academically and I'm currently on an internship.

Despite all that, my outlook on life has been getting increasingly negative. I feel like I'm pretty ineffective at my job because I get so anxious about social situations. I dread having to initiate even the simplest social interactions. I'm always uncomfortable unless I'm alone. I don't see how I can support myself financially after graduation or have any professional future when I'm this inadequate.  

I haven't made a single new friend since I moved from my home state three years ago. I'm continuing to withdraw from my old social circles and old bonds are becoming frayed and distant.

I don't see how I can live my entire life like this. What's the point of living if I'm always uncomfortable and I don't enjoy doing anything anymore? I've been thinking about suicide a lot for a while now. Really the only thing holding me back is my family. Every time I seriously think about killing myself I imagine the grief it would cause my parents and siblings and then I realize I couldn't really do it.

However, I can be very impulsive and I struggle with self-control. I worry that I would probably make a rash decision to commit suicide if I was given the chance.

I want to talk to my parents about these thoughts but I don't know what good that would do. I don't want to go to therapy and take a bunch of meds or whatever. And I think my mother would be incredibly nervous if I told her, especially since they're going to move to a different state soon and I'll be on my own.

I've always been the type of person to solve problems on my own. I think I do so much better in a college environment as opposed to a work environment because college is something I can do totally on my own, just me and a book.

So I'm wondering if it's possible for me to just pull myself out of this by my own. Are there any other introverts on here that have overcome their suicidal thoughts on their own? Has any kind of philosophy like Buddhism or stoicism worked for you to achieve mental peace? Am I thinking to much inside the box in terms of the trajectory of my life? Can you live an outsider lifestyle comfortably?"

Throwaway account. Sorry for being ambiguous; I am not sure what to do in this situation but I don't want to give away too much information right now.

So I've interned at a very highly renowned and well known research center for the last three summers (I'm in college) and last summer I worked with a group at this lab that I really enjoyed and had a lot of fun with. As usual each summer, I ended up making what I thought were good friends within my group that added to the set of friends I had made when I was at this place before, and since last summer I've (as usual) kept in touch with them.

One of these friends of mine also happened to be my mentor over the summer, and again it's really normal for me to make friends with my mentors. I feel more comfortable and work better in a friendly environment so that's something that natrually seems to happen. This mentor is married and has heard me go on and on about my very serious boyfriend (seriously waiting for him to pop the question any day now kind of serious) literally every day so it honestly never even crossed my mind of this being anything more than a friendship. I always treated this person in my mind the way I treat all of my friends and that's that. 

So a couple days ago this mentor starts sending me these weird texts asking if I want to talk about ""it"" and I have no idea what they are referring to. So here I am like ""shoot!"" because this person knows I really want to work at this place after I graduate soon and am currently trying to get hired there, so I was thinking they meant like a project proposal that I somehow forgot about, or something work related. They kept playing this weird game but would never ever say anything more in text (a huge red flag I've now realized).

Well today I get a call from this person and come to find out that they thought I was coming on to them all last summer (?????) and that they are interested in me in that way and are pretty sure I am too. I was in so much shock that I couldn't say anything at first and then was like no...? what??? wait what?? and the convo ended with them being apparently surprised at this (?!). 

Of course after the call once things sunk in I really wish I had been like ""WHAT THE FUCK YOU HAVE A WIFE CREEP"" and all sorts of other things, but maybe being speechless is for the better because they work where I want to work and are VERY well connected around this research center and I'm afraid pissing them off could ruin my reputation and budding career I've worked so hard for right at the start.

WHAT DO I DO???? I laughed it off with my boyfriend because wtf... but seriously is this harassment? I'm VERY uncomfortable in this situation and I'm pretty sure they know it yet they even tried to call me again after the fact. They won't say anything in writing which makes me so mad because I feel like if I do anything and this ever comes back to bite me I will have literally no evidence other than my word, which could end really really badly for me. 

I don't think it's my place to send a message their wife. At the same time, if my husband was hitting on the young intern in the office, I'd sure as hell want to know so I can kick his ass to the curb. Rude. 

Also take me and the fact that I am really likely to be engaged soon (AND THEY KNOW IT) and how insanely unprofessional and twisted this is out of the equation here... how could they think this would be a good way to start a relationship? My dad cheated on my mom. I know you NEVER EVER trust a cheater because they will only turn around and cheat on you. How dumb. This person is so not who I thought and I don't think it's appropriate to be friends anymore but I'm not sure how to say that either because I'm so afraid of pissing them off and burning bridges. Sorry I'm just in shock about this whole thing and I don't know who to go to. Please help. 

**Update:** Thank you everyone!! I was freaking out a bit last night, and you guys are definitely right that this isn't harassment, just a big misunderstanding. I think like many of you have suggested the biggest factor to the confusion here had to do with setting proper boundaries for a mentor/professional relationship. This is my first mentor who isn't old enough to be my parent/grandparent, so that probably made it easier for lines to be blurred and unintentionally crossed. This was a really important lesson. I'm drafting a polite yet straightforward response similar to what /u/lil_boots1 suggested and hopefully that will be the end of that. Thanks again!!"

Of course after the call once things sunk in I really wish I had been like ""WHAT THE FUCK YOU HAVE A WIFE CREEP"" and all sorts of other things, but maybe being speechless is for the better because they work where I want to work and are VERY well connected around this research center and I'm afraid pissing them off could ruin my reputation and budding career I've worked so hard for right at the start.

WHAT DO I DO???? I laughed it off with my boyfriend because wtf... but seriously is this harassment? I'm VERY uncomfortable in this situation and I'm pretty sure they know it yet they even tried to call me again after the fact. They won't say anything in writing which makes me so mad because I feel like if I do anything and this ever comes back to bite me I will have literally no evidence other than my word, which could end really really badly for me.

I don't think it's my place to send a message their wife. At the same time, if my husband was hitting on the young intern in the office, I'd sure as hell want to know so I can kick his ass to the curb. Rude.

Also take me and the fact that I am really likely to be engaged soon (AND THEY KNOW IT) and how insanely unprofessional and twisted this all is out of the equation here... how could they think this would be a good way to start a relationship? My dad cheated on my mom. I know you NEVER EVER trust a cheater because they will only turn around and cheat on you. How dumb. This person is so not who I thought and I don't think it's appropriate to be friends anymore but I'm not sure how to say that either because I'm so afraid of pissing them off and burning bridges. Sorry I'm just in shock about this whole thing and I don't know who to go to. Please help."

327nyv,13,2015-04-11,Feeling Overwhelmed and Underprepared for the Job I Want. Graduating In a Month!,SaberCrunch,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/327nyv/feeling_overwhelmed_and_underprepared_for_the_job/,"So, let me start out by saying I'm fortunate enough to have a pretty good network and I'm not in a terrible position career-wise (at least yet).

 I'm graduating from a fairly small school with a BS in CS (3.67 GPA 3.9 in-major GPA).  I had a web development internship with a local company last summer and accepted a job offer for after I graduate.  I applied to many other companies and was fortunate enough to make it through 2 technical interviews with Google for a Mountain View position but my application was dropped after a 3rd.  I received several job offers but none compelling enough to go over the company I already work for (Either the money wasn't enough or I didn't care about what they did.)

 The full time position is as a Java developer and pitching in on some web development from time to time.  They were also very generous in offering to pay for Grad school if I want it, so I'll be starting my Masters in 6 months when i'm eligible for tuition coverage.

Now my dilemma.  I don't want to be at this company forever.  Ideally, I'd stick around for a year or 2 to get my masters and I'd love to work for a company like Twitch or similar companies in the Bay Area.  The only problem is, I don't feel like I'm good enough at what I do to compete and earn a spot out there.  It just feels like the competition is a lot tougher on the west coast.  


 I don't have that Stanford or Washington caliber education.  I'm the top of the CS students in my class where I go to school, but I feel like that isn't saying much.  I have a great understanding of Java (in my opinion) and solid experience with JS, HTML/CSS, Python, C++, and Objective C.  I also have done numerous self-projects with the previous languages but with graduating so close I just feel unprepared.  My biggest fear is being stuck at a company where I'm doing a job I don't care about, regardless of how great the people and company itself are.

Am I in trouble for the future or just freaking out for no reason?  I just have this sinking feeling in my mind that I'm just not cut out to work for an awesome company with my current technical skill set.

**TL;DR** - I feel underprepared with my coursework from school and my current technical skills, even though my resume and GPA would suggest otherwise.  I'm afraid this will lead to me to a dead end job I hate when I want a job I love out west."

The old man rose gingerly from behind his desk and reached out a hand.  Mark paused momentarily to gauge the strength of his handshake.  He knew every little thing in an interview counted, from the suit to the body language down to the handshake but the old man looked beyond frail.



'Thank you for the opportunity Mr Siderno.'  Mark smiled shook hands, unbuttoned his suit jacket and sat down at the offered chair.  The old man watched for a moment as Mark replayed the last sentence in his head - was that too asskissy?  Fuck.



'So, tell me about yourself Mark.'  Siderno's jet black eyes were like a laser point.



'Well, I graduated two months ago, moved to..'  There was a muffled noise coming from behind one of the lacquered doors to the right.  



'Yes?' Siderno asked.  Mark realized he had trailed off mid-sentence, distracted.

'...ah sorry yes, moved here and did my internship with Mr DeCavalcante.  I finished last week and he recommended...'

The muffled noises grew louder.  More panicked.  Mark looked from the door back to Mr Siderno then back at the door.

'I'm sorry, um...is there someone else there?'



Siderno's eyes never left Mark's as he reached under his desk and some invisible button was pressed.  Somewhere in the building there was the sound of a buzzer.  



'Yes, as you can imagine Mark this is a highly competitive position and a lot of the candidates are not only extremely qualified but also, they already have a host of experience behind them.'  

Mark's heart fell, was this the precursor to a rejection?  He had little experience but surely if they had given him the interview he was in with a chance?



The side door opened and three men came through.  Two of the biggest no-necks Mark had ever seen, all bomber jackets and jeans.  The third man was tied onto a trestle.  His hands behind him, his white shirt ripped and stained with the blood pouring from his facial injuries.  His eyes were wild, puffed and swollen from the beating. The man stared wildly around the room and set onto Mark with panic.  The tennis ball duct-taped in his mouth struggled as he began his muffled screams again.
One of the no-necks placed a small bundle on the desk between Mr. Siderno and Mark.



'As such Mark, we pose an interview task to potential candidates to best assess their skill sets.'  



There was a long pause.  Everyone in the room looked at Mark.  



'Er...'



'Come come now Mark.  DeCavalcante told me about your work and how impressed he had been  Please, no false modesty.'



'Wh-what do you want me to do?'  Mark stammered.  The room was suddenly too hot, cold sweat dripped from inside his suit.  His tie felt as if it was tightening all on its own.



No answer from Siderno.  The two no-necks stared at the bundle on the desk.  Mark got up, unsure of his movements now and unwrapped the bundle.  Inside was a collection of chefs knives of every shape and size.  Clean, polished and incredibly sharp.



Silence bloomed in the small office.  The man on the trestle had gone silent.  Eyes wide at the knives he began to rock his head back and forth.  No.  No.  Please no. 



Siderno sat back slightly in his leather chair, checked his wrist-watch and smiled again at Mark.  



'You may begin.'  


Mark took off his jacket and tie.  Rolled up his sleeves and tried to choose a knife.  The chefs knife was a staple of most home murders, thick and wide at the handle to come to a point.  It was a classic Hitchcock knife..  He left it alone, his fingers trailing the other assortment of knives.  
The cleaver.  He slid it out of its pocket and weighed it in his hands.  Heavy, nice thick wooden handle. But messy.  Was that really the first impression he wanted to make?



Everyone in the room watched Mark return the cleaver and trail along the other knives, everyone except Siderno who simply watched Mark's face, still pleasantly smiling.



Mark finally chose the filleting knife.  The no-necks grunted in approval.  Long, sharp and with a wicket curve.  It was the knife of an artist rather than a footman , designed to cause pain than an immediate kill.



Mark let himself look at Siderno, searching his face for any sign of approval but the man just sat there, still smiling his maddening smile.  Instead Mark walked over to the tressle.  The no-necks stepped back to give him room.  Lifting the knife, to the eyes of the man on the tressle Mark paused and turned to Siderno.



'If I may ask, what happens if I fail on this task Mr Siderno?'



Siderno laughed kindly.  'My boy, you're looking at what happens if you fail your task'.



Mark nodded, all his nervousness gone now and turned back to the task.  

Mark got to work.

327y8x,2,2015-04-11,Is it worth it to postpone my CS degree to get it from a better university?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/327y8x/is_it_worth_it_to_postpone_my_cs_degree_to_get_it/,"I'm currently attending a public college in New York, about to finish my BA (they do not offer a BS) in computer science in one year.

I didn't qualify for financial aid grants and so I went here for its low tuition costs ($6600/year). In the New York public college system (CUNY), this college was one of the best among them when I picked it. Though, that is not saying much as New York public colleges really lack prestige.

So I'm thinking of postponing my CS degree by moving to California, where there are dozens of top-ranked CS programs. I've always planned to move there. I like it more and the tech opportunities are much more plentiful. I would have to discontinue school for about 2-3 years. After which, I would have established myself as a California resident and qualify for in-state tuition for their public universities.

There are numerous reasons why I rather get a degree from a better university.

- Personal achievement. I want my alma mater to be a respectable one.

- Statistically, graduates from top tier CS programs make significantly more money in their early careers.

- From what I've read, post-grad degrees are worth very little in this field. If I want a prestigious degree, it should be earned in undergrad.

- I may spend some time working abroad in the future and I've been told these employers highly prefer graduates from top schools.

- A top tier university would provide me much greater means of networking. My current college is a commuter school with no campus life or active computer science interest groups.

- My current college only hands out BAs, even for Computer Science. Many job postings require a BS. Though, many would agree that this is semantics and won't matter much.

So if I go on with this plan, I would spend 2-3 years doing self-learning, internships and getting myself involved in the industry in any way. I already have some offered opportunities I could pursue in California.

But I'm 21 right now. And people tell me that this plan (which they view was throwing away 2-3 years) will be wasting my prime years.

I know Redditors tend to place very little value on CS degrees, but if it's going to represent me for the rest of my life, I want it done right."
327zjp,2,2015-04-11,Discouraged by an industry professional,rooney94,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/327zjp/discouraged_by_an_industry_professional/,"While I was working yesterday, I met a guy who lives in my city that is the head of a big film organization, as well as a lecturer at my university. I told him I am involved in the film studies program, and wanted to introduced myself, as I recognized his name and had heard about him. This man has worked in Hollywood, both writing for television shows and producing films, etc.

He asked me what I wanted to do, and I told him I'm interested mostly in writing for tv and film. He started talking about how my school doesn't have a screenwriting program, that I can teach it to myself. He asked me what sort of things I'm interested in writing for, and I told him television. He asked me what kind. I gave him a couple of examples of shows, and he sort of seemed to try to challenge me on my knowledge of the shows, telling me that one of the shows I mentioned wasn't even on anymore (even though it actually is).

Then he asked me if I'd ever been to any of the programs that have been offered--mostly, people from the industry (writers, directors, etc.) coming in to speak. I haven't, because they are always at night, when I work. He talked about how showing up and doing the work is the most important thing. He talked about internships and how experience is the most important thing.

He didn't actually discourage me from trying to get into the tv/film industry, but I think I may have given the wrong impression. It really is tough for me to attend networking events because my part-time job takes up the majority of time I don't spend in class, but he seemed disappointed that I had never attended one, which I completely understand. I'll make more of an attempt to do so in the future.

I'm planning this summer on starting to write and shoot some of my own stuff. He gave me his card and told me, if I wanted to, that I could apply for an internship with the organization he is involved with. Thing is, I can only do an internship with them for academic credit, which would be an extra $3000+. I can't afford that.

He seemed somewhat jaded and cynical. I know that he was speaking the truth about the industry, and maybe I'm just whining about someone not blindly encouraging me. But I also just feel discouraged because there are so many things that I wish I could be doing to set myself up for a successful career in the future, but I am limited by both my finances and available time.

Do I have a right to feel discouraged? I don't mean to seem petty. I have no doubt he knows what he's talking about, but he made it seem like if I didn't go the exact route he told me to, I wouldn't get anywhere. I would love to do an internship, but it really doesn't seem possible. I can't skip out on work all the time for networking events because I need to pay for basic living necessities. What else can I be doing to help myself outside of these things?

Two days ago his dad went to the hospital (although he was ok) to do a programmed open heart surgery. It wasn't urgent but he needed it soon and they said the risks are low. Over the last 24 hours he suffered many cardiac arrests that ended in him passing away. Now my boyfriend has come from a seemingly healthy father to this in a week. 


I will be seeing him tomorrow and I really have no idea what to say. This is so heart breaking. I want to be there for him and help him grieve well so this wont define him. I know that this will be part of him forever, I just wish he will be able to breathe again soon. 

He is trying to be strong for his mother, he is in shock. Sometimes ranging from a straight face to crying to thinking about his mom. He wants togo back to work soon, he is forcing himself to eat.



I am living in New York for an internship but he lives in Paris, so I will be flying there tonight. I just.. Im going to be there just for a week and I want to help the most I can. He is just a boy and now he is fatherless, and as an only child he is the father of his family now.

I am not religious but I do believe that his dad's spirit or what he was is not lost. If I were in this situation it would help me cope to know he has not just disappeared. Should I tell him what I believe?

Should I stay quiet? Should I say that everything will be ok? Should I try to be strong? Should he force himself to eat? Should he be strong for his mother or feel whatever he has to feel? Should I tell him not to smoke (1 pack a day) since this caused his dad's health problems?

I guess I just want any advice on what helps most, what will help him grieve.

3287yo,17,2015-04-11,Should I take a year off?,Grapedrank47,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3287yo/should_i_take_a_year_off/,"Last May, I herniated two discs in the gym. I spent all summer in serious pain and by the time university began last September nothing had improved and I was on all kinds of medication. Although the pain remains today, I have gotten through almost all of first year (finals left) and my grades are actually very good. This year, however, was nothing like I had hoped it would be. I had no motivation to get involved in any extracurriculars, I couldn't play sports and I was in pain 24/7. I was hoping to push myself to do one of volunteering abroad with a program at my school, taking extra courses or finding an internship, all this summer. However, my plans were shattered when my surgeon said that I will probably need surgery this summer. The MRI which determines that is two weeks away, and I'm left with no clue as to how my summer is going to go. I haven't even applied to extra-curricular positions for next year because I am finding myself scrambling for finals as I really lost motivation in the last month and have started to let things slip. Despite all of this, the worst part is that I have steadily been slipping into depression as the pain is not pretty and I have isolated myself from almost everyone.

If I take a year off I hope to:
- Recover fully from the surgery or seek proper pain management if it ends up not happening. Maybe even learnt to exercise with the condition.
- Travel and visit my family if my health permits.
- Apply for that volunteer abroad opportunity.
- Apply for extra curricular teams and positions for upcoming year.
- Prep for LSAT (I wish to attend law school after my BCom).
- Learn to code and pick up reading again
- Perhaps find work if I'm healthy again.

Some issues I have identified:
- I am on a full ride scholarship and taking a year off may get that revoked.
- I will fall behind my peers and graduate a year later.
- It may affect law school admissions (not sure about this).
- It could turn out to be a complete waste of time and I could return with diminished study skills.

I talked to an academic adviser and she liked the idea so I am really considering it. Does anyone have experience with a gap year? What would you recommend if you were in my position."

328gwt,1,2015-04-11,[26/m] Meeting with twice ex (25/f) to get closure?,Itdoesntmatterbut,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/328gwt/26m_meeting_with_twice_ex_25f_to_get_closure/,"Hey Guys,
the last time I've been struggling with feelings with my ex. I don't know what I expect from posting it here it's partly because it feels good to write it down but mainly I want to hear some outsiders perspective.

But first a short story about our relationship(s), we met because we were in the same semester in uni. We were together for about two and a half years, then she ended it after she was a few weeks out of the country to study abroad for one semester. At that point I also saw the problems but felt that we did not try hard enough. 

When she came back we hooked up a few times but she said she had no feelings for me so that ended. Fast forward a few months we hook up yet once again and this time more regularily, but due to the fact that I was about to go to study abroad we kept it casual for a little time. However we got together almost as soon as I was gone. After that we more or less had a long distance relationship (after I came back, she went to do internships in distant towns).T he same problems started to arise once again (mostly sex and doubts as soon we were not spacially near each other). I was just waiting for the internships to be over and hoping we could work on the relationship but once again she ended one month before she would have returned to my town. Fuck it ...once again I saw the problems but thought we could work something out or at least see how we work out as soon as we are back again in the same town.

After the break-up I did a lot of soul searching/rationalizing and came to the conclusion that it was for the better and that those problems could not be solved because we both are how we are. Everytime I missed her I thought about this stuff and it worked pretty well, I thought of her less and less. After two months she started texting me. We chatted for a little bit, nothing too special. After that we texted a few times, nothing special, when she was back in my town we met for a coffee here and there and talked.

I was really suprised how good all that went us being adult persons who know each other well and meet up just to talk. However I noticed that she still wore the ring I gave her as present a few years back. I really thought that it was just her not thinking too much about the symbolism of that ring because I thought: Okay either she maybe wants me back but then she would say so, wouldnt she? She would say it was a mistake or at least talk about the situation we were /are in. Or she just wanted to stay friends and wore that ring because she liked it. That went on for some time until one night we met for a drink and she hugged me really hard as she was saying hello/good bye. 

Well I was still thinking, I thought if she wants us back together she would gather some courage and talk about it. So it is just Exes being friends right? And I conviced myself that I did not want her anymore didn't I?

Well the next day I receive a text from her that she enjoyed our meeting a lot and asked me if I wanted to go to the movies or cook something. At that point I was really angry, how could she break up and three months later just more or less casually ask me out on a date without even talking about the break up first(although she added that I could hate the idea or her if I wanted to...)?! Yeah I know we both are more or less persons who take stuff lightly but man... 
I replied friendly that I did not want to meet with her that way and liked things how they were then( she stopped wearing the ring after that). I still could convince myself that I did not want her.

 After that we never mentioned that incident again and just went back to casually talking to each other when we meet at lunch (we have the same friends).
So this leads to where I am now. I have not had any sexual contact since the breakup, I am somewhat lonely relationshipwise and once again I am unsure if I made a mistake not meeting with her back when she asked me out and that I also could have initiated the discussion about the break up, instead I was passive all the time.

Now after I went to a party at her flat yesterday I feel bad, I still can't stomach her talking to other guys I don't know. (not that I say anything it just makes me sad)
I think all in all it boils down whether I'm unsure that is just me being lonely and not having a romantical prospect and that it would be an 'easy' way to get affection reconnecting with her. Or if it I am maybe missing my opportunity to be happy with this girl(because altough not mentioned we had really really plenty of good times) just because I am too proud and wanted some kind of apology from her, which she maybe did not give because she did not want to bother me(which is realistic because often enough I'd rather talk about stuff one time less than one time too much)... So after lots of time thinking about it I have the urge to call her and talk about it all. But I am not sure if that's a good idea, if that stops me and her from moving on or if it is not even having talked about it once that is stopping me from moving on.

Wow has really gotten a long text, maybe someone really reads this and even comments on it ;).


Have a good day


**tl;dr** : thinking about meeting my twice ex (2,5 years relation 1 year break 1 year relation) to talk about the break up to get closure, after she asked me out and I declined party I expected some kind of apology after the break up.

Ideally I would like to get my foot in the door in an I/O psych company or get work in some form of HR, but with pretty much no work experience in the area (I will have training in administering psychometric personality tests) would moving to the states be too much of a gamble for me?

This visa opportunity seems too good to pass up, as I may not get a chance to work in the states as easily again, so I feel like I should take it, but I still have that uneasy feeling that it could be a big mistake.

I know it's unlikely anyone here has been in the exact same situation as me but I'm wondering has anyone any experience of entering the states as a graduate with little experience and looking for work other than bar or cafe work? or if anyone has any idea of entry level job market for I/O psych or HR?

Sorry for the wall of text, any advice or suggestion would be great. If I move, I'm looking at the west coast, possibly San Francisco or Seattle.

Thanks."
328v9l,2,2015-04-11,[US] Which public accounting tax group?,throwawaytax3,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/328v9l/us_which_public_accounting_tax_group/,"Hello everyone, need help deciding on which tax group I want to select, I've seen quite a few threads on this topic; however, most of them just list the details of what that group specifically works in as far as subject matter goes but nothing else.

A little bit about myself, I know I like tax but some details about me may help give better advice?

I know early in the career you are forced to do a lot of grunt work and compliance; however, are there certain groups that work on more projects later on (let's say 3-5 years in public accounting) rather than just filing returns?

I would like to work in a project based environment, although I don't mind the filing returns in the first few years to learn the main aspect of taxation, I know that is given. 

Second, if possible I would like to work with clients directly and also travel abroad. I worked in SALT/Expatriate/Wealth management group during my internship, these areas in tax don't really get to do much travel, even as you move up..are there any groups that would start to take things abroad, let's say, after 4-5 years?

I want to stay in public for at least ~8-10 years, I've worked in industry already in financial accounting/tax, it doesn't seem likes it is for me.

So far my choices are international tax/asset management or just federal core group, 

I heard international tax would lead me to more project based work later on and more opportunities to go abroad, just wanted thoughts and opinions.

Partner told me that they really liked me, although his experience was only with wealth management group, he told me because the type of work I want, maybe I would like audit more . HR and the partner told me they could easily switch me if I didn't want to do tax anymore, just wanted opinions before I make a decision.

Also this is in a Big 4.

I haven't had an internship yet. I keep getting turn down for not being in Jr standing and I probably have put myself out there enough but that's another story for another day. 

I am fascinated with cyber security. I have been doing it since high school with the first year of civilian cyber patriot and been hooked since.

I've continued to learn through little bits and been allowed to pentest a few friends networks here and there. 

My chosen school offers no cyber security specialization. 

I am debating going into the air force reserves for cyber security/surety during school or possibly going straight into the air force upon graduation. 


TL;DR: what are the communities thoughts on the air force as a career choice in the security field? Or reserves in cyber surety?"

The thing is, I don't have much useful knowledge except some basic data structures and some principles of Object Oriented Programming. 4 months is both a long and short time, so I want to invest my time into building a portfolio that will display my (soon-to-be-learned) knowledge of useful concepts in today's industry to get an internship. My target position is to either become a software developer or a web developer. What kinds of projects/topics should I diving into to build myself a strong portfolio?

They are calling it a research/internship opportunity, but from what I have gathered, it's basically going to be me doing all of the programming work that they have neither the time nor, I suspect, the skill to do themselves.

My ultimate goal is to start a company pertaining to artificial intelligence. In the likely event that this doesn't happen, I want to at least wind up with a job related to the field. If THAT doesn't happen, I want to be prepared to be a software engineer indefinitely. This internship will have me dealing with climate data and climate models and possibly even machine learning stuff.


Here are a few details:

- I told them I would work 40hrs/week if they get the research grant they submitted and paid me. If they don't get it, I told them I'd consider working 20hrs/week for free.
- Currently, they have written a lot of the code in matlab. They told me that they might want to enhance the code, however, and that I might be able to use a different programming language. I am worried, however, that I will get stuck using matlab.
- The professors did not come off as seasoned programmers and gave me the impression they did not have that good of an idea about what they were doing code wise. I feel that I could really get down and dirty with things and demonstrate my skills.
- They're going to put my name on the paper related to the project.
- If I do well, I can probably ask these professors for letters of recommendation.


How do you guys think a job like this will look on a resume as opposed to a run-of-the-mill internship at a software company? My perception is that this job will differentiate me from a lot of other students, but I do not have a good idea of what employers want."

Note: these aren't in order of importance, just a list I came up with. Please feel free to comment below if you think of anything else that would be helpful. :) 

Quick link: 
For registration questions check out the [Ready, Set, Register! Fall 2015 page](http://www2.humboldt.edu/acac/sites/default/files/READY_SET_REGISTER!.pdf)

**1. Meet with your advisor regularly:** Meeting with your advisor regularly will not only ensure you're staying on track for graduation, but they're also your go-to person to ask all things academic (like which electives are better geared for your career path, how and when to apply for internships, et cetera). 

**2. Keep showing up:** It sounds really simple, but I think the number one thing that causes people to drop out is that they think they can get away with skipping a class or two, then they start falling behind, and before they know it they give up all hope in passing the class and stop showing up all together. College really isn't too difficult as long as you continue to show up each day, pay attention, and put some effort in. 

**3. Stay organized:** Along with continuing to show up, what really sneaks up on people is their lack of organization. As long as you know what's coming up in your classes, you can be prepared. What really helps me is putting all the assignments, homework, papers and exam dates on my calendar that way it's easier for me to see what's coming up, and I can also set up pop-up reminders to keep me on my toes. 

**4. Take responsibility:** This goes with staying organized and continuing to show up. Don't rely on your classmates to tell you what's going on that day, when a test is, or when something's due. If you continually do this you're probably going to annoy those in your class. Instead, be self reliant by checking your class's page on Moodle regularly, looking over the syllabus often, staying organized, and continue to show up. Not only will all these skills help you in your classes, but will help you prepare to be more professional for your first ""real"" job outside of college. 

**5. Get involved:** If you feel like you're not making friends, or if you would like to make more friends, a great way to do this is get involved in [HSU's activities and organizations](http://www2.humboldt.edu/clubs/). There are a lot of clubs on campus, so I'm sure there's bound to be one that fits your interests. Also, sporting events are a great way to get in the spirit of HSU. 

**6. Commuting:** This basically goes along with keep showing up. If you plan on driving, know that parking is unfortunately very limited at HSU (even with the expensive parking stickers). I usually try to get to campus between 7:30-8:00 AM M-F to get a parking spot. If you have a later class that starts around 3 PM or later, then you'll probably be fine to find a parking spot around then. Anytime between 9 AM to 3 PM though, and it'll be tough to find a parking spot. 

I'm not well versed in the bus system here, but I would suggest to know the bus times well and plan accordingly if you plan on using them (they're free with your HSU ID by the way). There's been people who show up late because they missed their bus by just a few minutes, and then have to wait a while for the next one...so plan accordingly. Also, if you plan on riding your bike most days, watch the weather. It rains here a lot, and you may not want to ride your bike on rainy days to get to know the bus system or someone with a car for those days. 

**...**

Basically, I'm writing this to help you guys out because I was a college drop out before. College is so important to do well in life, not only monetarily but it helps expand your mind and grow as a person as well. I know now how easy college is as long as you stick with it, and find some good friends to be around. Hopefully this helps a little, and if any of you have any questions or any tips to add please feel free to do so in the comments below. "
329n4z,2,2015-04-11,Dealing with a NFIL and repairing damage of a Nbf (triggers),[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/329n4z/dealing_with_a_nfil_and_repairing_damage_of_a_nbf/,"Hopefully this is the right place, I don't have Nparents but I have had an Nbf. That relationship was quite damaging and am still dealing with shit from that relationship. Anyways I've been a bit of a lurker and you are all so supportive I thought I'd give you the tale of my FIL and maybe you can give me some advice.... (also this is a throwaway)

So hopefully this doesn't get too long but I feel like typing all this into the universe will be cathartic as some of what I am saying about my exbf I have never told anyone. So when I was about 21 I moved to Ottawa for an internship for school. It was amazing work but it was difficult to make new relationships because I knew that my time was limited and often found myself lonely. Anyways I met this guy and he seemed nice we got along for a while and things progressed. It wasn't until I broke up with him that I realized what was going on. He came over to my house once and I made him dinner, all he did was make passive aggressive comments about how it wasn't very good. Why didn't I have a TV, the internet is too slow, etc. Little things that at the time I didn't think were a big deal. But then little things became bigger things like he would pout and say he was sick if I wanted to do anything he didn't want to do. Which resulted in us not going and provided him with the opportunity to either a) complain that I didn't care about him by not running to his ""death bed"" or b) call me overly attached and clingy by coming by and seeing how he was. Now in the current light I am sitting in it is obvious we should have broken up, but hopefully this is where you will be different than others, I was so broken at that point that I though it was my fault. It was my fault I couldn't please him. The most hurtful thing he ever did to the end of our relationship (how I ever stayed is amazing) which I have never told anyone in detail about is he posted a ""missed connections"" post on craigslist that he made sure I saw because I think its about me"" anyways the content of the post involved him being an attractive guy with some ugly fat chick. It was written as a guy crudely asking ""when you're done sucking on those floppy fat tits I have something nicer you can suck on"" and he shared the link on his twitter and everywhere. If that wasn't bad enough to begin with he later told me HE wrote the post. Now not that it matters but I am not fat, I am larger yes but its due to being 5'10 and an ex rugby player. I am very self concise about it though, I use to be in the most amazing shape when I played rugby and I slipped down hill afterwards. So why I didn't do anything I will never know, I got speechless and for the first time in our relationship I saw a flash of regret. No, not that he hurt me no that I might tell his parents and he might not be the most amazing miracle child anymore. I'd like to say that's where we broke up but unfortunately it went back to 'normal'. We broke up when I moved back to school, I suddenly realized how bright and airy my world was without him, I was less stressed and happy again. Ironically however he broke up with me, he said it was because he couldn't do long distance. I saw its because without his constant influence I called him on his shit and it angered him that he could no longer control me. 

Now I was single for 2 years after that, being super cautious around any new potential bf. But 3 years ago I met my current SO, he is the most amazing guy ever, super supportive and willing to help me through everything. Anyways his father is another story, from the day we started dating he made a big deal to make my life hell. He told my SO that he didn't want to meet me because ""he doesn't trust women"" after his divorce where he accused my SO's mother of getting pregnant just to keep him around.  So fine they can go out and have their father son time, then I find out my SO's GCsis is bring her SO. Not wanting to push anything I mention it and I go along with them next time, big mistake I am ""that girl"" and ignored and ""stealing his son away"". Even when we recieve cards for christmas and birthday I am never mentioned and passive aggressive phrases are always inside like ""how's the big city (Vancouver)? Miss Victoria and your Dad yet? I'll be here when you decide to come home"" and he went on a huge spiel to the cosmetics manager at shoppers (who he didn't know is my mother) about how his son is making a big mistake leaving and he's ruining his life with ""that girl"". He has no family values and is abandoning his family.

Wait what? I should add GCsis can do no wrong she was a heroin addict and still a better child in his fathers eyes. Since we have been together my SO has missed appointments with his Ndad because his Ndad 1)forgot 2)something better came along 3)was so high on pot he couldn't remember anything. But heaven forbid if my SO misses anything, his dad called him drunk at 2am once giving a big spiel about how he was a bad son and other random junk because he was unable to make the very last minute plans on his dads birthday. (His bday was Monday and my SO worked and had plans with me, so he put aside his whole day off Tuesday to hang with his Dad and do whatever his dad wanted. Thursday we get that call about he's a disappointment, how hard is it to see your dad on his birthday)

I just don't know how to deal with it, I talk to my SO about it and it always ends with ""yeah, I know but he's my dad"". I also honestly don't know what is hurting me more his dad's behaviour towards me or towards his son. I am the one that gets to deal with my SOs hidden upset and disappointment when his father ditches him.

Any advice?"

32a0yr,2,2015-04-11,What to classify OT volunteer/shadow experience as on OTCAS,lem0ncake9850,OccupationalTherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/OccupationalTherapy/comments/32a0yr/what_to_classify_ot_volunteershadow_experience_as/,"I have been volunteering/shadowing at the Rehab Institute of Chicago for almost a year now and each area requires 100hrs of volunteering on each floor before you can move onto another. So far I have done 3 floors (pediatrics, orthotics/prosthetics, and neuro/stroke) all inpatient. This summer I plan to volunteer in another setting, possibly outpatient research or TBI, and next fall I have an internship there doing one other setting I'm not sure of yet. When I apply this summer would I have to list these all as ""Rehabilitation"" or would I list them as ""Other"" and specify? Each floor I volunteered on were at separate times under separate OTs. I am just curious, because I want to diversify my settings as much as I can. I'm also a little concerned because I've spent a significant amount of time there, but I know it doesn't mean much if they consider it all under one setting.




I have also shadowed in other settings including hand therapy, school, &amp; assisted living. This summer I am set up to observe in an outpatient pediatrics facility, hippotherapy, and acute hospital




On OTCAS it says to choose the setting to which you observed/volunteered. If any one could help me out as to which setting goes where from what I listed. The categories are;

- Children and Youth
- Work and Industry
- Rehabilitation
- Health and Wellness
- Mental Health
- Productive Aging
- Other

32a2tv,6,2015-04-11,TIFU by eating an edible on my birthday and scaring my parents into thinking I was having a seizure,blueseattle_19,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/32a2tv/tifu_by_eating_an_edible_on_my_birthday_and/,"First, a little back-story before the shit show. In October my boyfriend and I made about twenty pumpkin square edibles that were about the size of your average brownie. The first time I ate one, I only consumed half of the square. It had been a while since I had eaten an edible, so I wanted to be cautious since my first edible experience ended with me thinking I was puking up my rib cage. After waiting about 45 minutes it started to kick in and I was high af and freaking myself out. It took us some time to figure out a good portion size, and in the end we cut the original squares down to sixteenths. These slivers were a good size to achieve a comfortable high.

Alright, so fast forward to December 19th—the day of my birthday. I’m home for winter break, and I decided to bring some of the edibles with me. Now, for the past seven or eight years it’s tradition that my family and I go to this teppanyaki restaurant for my birthday.  You know, the kind where they dress you up as a samurai and take a Polaroid of you as you blow out the candle on your mochi ice cream. It’s great food and a lot of fun, so I decided to continue the tradition. My mom made a reservation for seven o’clock that evening, which would give my sister and her fiancée enough time to meet us there. 

Now I had stopped smoking and eating edibles for a short period of time because I just interviewed for a job, and wanted to pass the drug test in case they decided to hire me. Well a few days before, I found out that I didn’t make it to the second round of interviews, so I thought why not celebrate by having an edible on my birthday and eating large amounts of fried rice, salmon and grilled vegetables. Sounds great right? So I eat an edible around six, an hour before our reservation.

We get there a little after seven, but had to wait because my sister and her fiancée were still on their way. At this point the edible starts to kick in and I’m feeling pretty hungry. Perfect timing. About ten minutes later my sister and her fiancée arrive and we get our table, where I’m seated in the middle. We place our order, and the chef comes out and does the whole show of flipping the eggshells into his hat and turning the stack of grilled onions into a volcano. It’s pretty awesome being high seeing all this fire and hearing all the clanking of the knives, but at this point I’ve reached a comfortable high, and hope that it doesn’t go any further. 

Since I’m home for the break, my family is conversing with me, and asking how school is going, how my internship is etc., but me being extremely high I really don’t want to talk much, so keep my answers short and my mouth full of food. After eating all my meal, I sit back in my chair and look around the restaurant. I’m feeling overwhelmed by all the conversation and kind of freaked out by all the noise and the fires going on at the other tables around us. I must have closed my eyes to try and calm myself, because there was a pause in whatever conversation was going on, and my dad asks “Hey u/blueseattle_19 is everything okay?” I put my hands on my stomach and reply saying, “I don’t think the fish is really settling well.” My dad responds with, “Do you need to use the restroom?” I nod my head yes. There was a problem though. I couldn’t get up. At all. It felt like the lower half of my body was glued to the stool. There was another pause in conversation and my dad asks “Ummm. Do you want me to help you up?” I nodded my head again and he came over. I threw my arm around his shoulder as he directed my semi-limp body towards the restroom, and I whisper in his ear, “Can we just go home? I’m really not feeling well.” He nods yes.

We get to the restroom where there’s a line. Really?! A line to the men’s restroom? My dad leaves me there alone to wait in line, while he goes back to tell my mom to ask for the check, so that we could leave. Next thing I know I’m rolling around in the middle of the hallway with my eyes closed, which clearly caused some commotion, cause my dad rushes over to see what was going on. Not knowing what is happening he shouts out loud, “Someone call 911! He’s having a seizure!” At this point I realize that shit just got real. I open my eyes and take control of my body and whisper, “You don’t have to do that. Don’t call 911.” My dad asks, “What’s wrong? Is everything okay?” Hearing the concern in his voice and seeing everyone standing around me I feel bad, and spill the beans telling him about the edible I ate before dinner and apologize profusely. 

As my dad is helping me up off the ground, I feel some warmth on the back of my leg. I touch the back of my pants and realized that, yes, I had peed my pants. I put my sweater around my waist in an attempt to cover the obvious dark spot as I completed my walk of shame out the restaurant.

No samurai outfit. No ice cream. No Polaroid for our collection.


TL;DR Ate an edible before my birthday dinner, had a bad trip at the restaurant, peed my pants, parents thought I was having a seizure."

Seeing the death of President Bouteflika as a huge loss to their political strength and influence, the FNL lost over ten seats to their leading counterpart, the National Rally for Democracy. The same was also true for the Green Algerian Alliance who, due mostly to their apparent involvement in the President's murder, suffered similar seat losses to the RND as well.  

As for the Presidential elections, the votes were thoroughly counted and round two was ready to begin...however two interns ""celebration"" by the main voting center in Algiers forced the ballots to be recounted.  

As a result, the candidates remaining after Round 2 are as follows:  

* Abdelaziz Belkhadem, the candidate from the National Liberation Front **(FNL)**  
* Ali Benflis, the candidate from the National Rally for Democracy **(RND)**  

Round 2 will be counted by the beginning of November."
32a5pm,3,2015-04-11,What was your hourly wage each year you interned? And which offer should I take?,justcuriousthough,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/32a5pm/what_was_your_hourly_wage_each_year_you_interned/,"I'm mostly curious, because I got paid around $17 per hour at my first internship, and now I'm being offered a really wide range of wages from the companies that have given me offers so far. I'm a sophomore at a top 20 public university. I don't have a whole lot of experience, and my GPA isn't really standout, either. I have a fair amount of leadership activities, and I have a couple small projects I did freshman year that went over well with recruiters.

I'm just curious (I like data and comparing things), so I'm gonna ask: what were your wages for each year you had an internship?

**Internship 1**: fairly small but extremely well-known and pretty prestigious software company (~3,000 employees). Interned the summer after my freshman year. Paid $17 an hour. I absolutely loved working there; everyone was super friendly, I absolutely loved the project I was working on (it's my pride and joy) and there were cool random perks like a super casual dress code, CEO hiring ice cream trucks to drive around and hand out free ice cream to employees, getting to work with unreleased software and apps, I got my own office as an intern, I got a giant box of Legos + an Arduino microcontroller kit + a Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone to play around with, there were outdoor barbecue lunches for employees, and monthly social events, among other things. An amazing first internship experience.

**Internship 2**: I have 3 offers so far.

* First one is a return offer from the company from Internship 1, with a salary of $20/hr, and I'd be working on similar stuff from last summer, just more complex. It's near where I live, so I don't need relocation.

* The second offer is from a large energy company in a large city on the west coast (~20,000 employees). They're offering to pay for my flights and 1/2 of my housing expenses; my offered hourly wage is $22 per hour, and $33 per hour for overtime. I'd be working on data analytics.

* The third offer is from a large job search site company (~5,000 employees). It's near where I live, so no relocation needed. They're offering me $30 per hour, and I'd be working on database engineering.

Thoughts and comments? :)"
32a8oa,3,2015-04-11,Should I renege an internship offer?,[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/32a8oa/should_i_renege_an_internship_offer/,"Hi,

So I am sort of at a dilemma.
Currently I have a few choices but I've narrowed it down to 2: 

* 1. To work at a big national retail company where I've just accepted the offer to 3 days ago
* 2. Renege the offer and work for the big international tech company that just accepted me

Option 1:

 Pros:

* No Reneging
* Like the job
* No relocation
* Great name recognition (fortune 1xx)

Cons:

* Far away from home (30+ min)
* Low pay (only 10 to 20$)

As the the 2nd option:

Pro:

* Big Company (fortune 1xx)
* Known for awesome internship program
* Free relocation/housing assistance
* High pay (23 to 33)


Con:

* Relocation
* Reneging other offer
* Not the job I want, but I can switch to the one I want next year.


The first company is 100% not a company I would want to work for full time, (or ever go back to for that matter) and I really do like the 2nd company, but I don't know if it is the right place for me to start my career. But anyway, I guess my main problem is I don't want to screw up my relationship with the first company just because they recruit heavily at my school so it may make networking events a little awkward and I am afraid that other recruiters at my school will find out that I reneged an offer thus barring me from working for anyone else. I also feel bad for reneging because then they will have to look for a new intern in 2 months. I guess the good news is I've never actually met the recruiter so as long as I never mention my name, things won't be awkward.


Both companies carries high chances of them inviting me back next year for internship and eventually full time.

32aouv,4,2015-04-11,Am I losing too slowly?,rosepudding,wls,https://www.reddit.com/r/wls/comments/32aouv/am_i_losing_too_slowly/,"Hi all! So I need to schedule my 3 month post-op appointment. But I'm so nervous that I haven't lost enough weight between my 1 month post-op appointment and now :( My doctor has stressed that I have no target goal, but I am concerned.

I tried to stick to 600-800 calories a day, but it just was not enough and I passed out at my internship because of blood sugar things. Now I eat between 1000-1200, and shoot for 60-90g of protein daily. And of course, I am still not drinking alcohol or soda... I have an iced coffee sometimes with my protein drinks (iced decaf, it's a nice change occasionally). 

A typical day of food is a Premier Protein for breakfast, a light can of soup or deli meat for lunch, and dinner protein and veg with a little grains if I have any room left. There's no food that I haven't been able to tolerate aside from bread of course because it's like impossible to get down lol. Snack wise, I will have another protein drink or a Quest bar if water is not keeping me full.

About two weeks ago, I started working out more religiously. I go between 5 and 6 times a week for an hour a piece. I walk, I go on the elliptical trainer and I have been doing some weight training for my arms (not much, maybe 10-20 pounds - I'm a weenie lol). 

I started at 301, day of surgery (1/12/15) I was 290, and today (4/11/15) I weighed in at 256.8. So I guess I'm wondering if I should be as worried as I am. Help please :( "

32b3g6,3,2015-04-12,I'd like some help before things really go bad.,as1kennel,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/32b3g6/id_like_some_help_before_things_really_go_bad/,"Hi. I'm 25. I have a Master's degree and I currently make just under $60,000 a year. I make more than my parents even though they're twice my age. My coworkers are friendly and helpful. My bosses are considerate and they have my back when other parts of the organization come knocking. My finances are in good shape, too. In the past year I've bought a car; I've built my own computer; I've built myself a $6,000 emergency fund; and, thanks to my habit of putting half of my salary toward my student loans, I'll be debt free in two years!

Yet, despite all of these positive external things, I'm not doing well internally. Thoughts of suicide plague me constantly. At first they were a trickle, but now they're a raging torrent. Here, in as succinct a manner as I'm capable of right now, is why.

* As I went through high school, college, and graduate school, I tried very hard to stay on the straight and narrow. I wanted to succeed and I'd been taught that in order to succeed I had to make smart decisions. So I went through school actively avoiding a lot of things. I never tried any drugs. I didn't drink. I didn't party. I didn't sleep around. I avoided those things because I believed it was the right thing to do. I believed that not doing those things made me a better person and set me up for success. But it didn't. When I went through graduate school my classmates had done all those things. When I entered the workforce my peers and coworkers had all done those things too! They did all those things that I avoided and they were and are in exactly the same position I am. They're climbing the same mountains and accomplishing the same goals! That's been hard to swallow. What exactly did I accomplish by being responsible? What was the point if the people that did those things are right here with me? More and more it seems like I wasted the opportunities of my youth for nothing.

* I chose to major in economics in the summer between my freshman and sophomore years in college. I chose economics because it spoke to my desire to know what's going on ""behind the curtain."" I chose economics because it gave me a framework with which to understand the world around me. I loved it. But there was something about economics that I didn't anticipate: the politics. As I went through school, people would ask me about economics and I would do my best to explain. But they weren't interested in what I had to say. They had already decided their position and either ignored what I had to say or threw it back in my face. That stung, but I managed to rationalize it. ""These people are idiots,"" I told myself. ""They're not my intellectual peers. They're stupid. People as smart as I am wouldn't be so dismissive."" So I stuck the course.

      I eventually had the chance to test my hypothesis. I was admitted into an internship program in Washington, DC, that would put me in classes with other handpicked students from around the country. I was thrilled. I was excited. ""I will finally be surrounded by peers,"" I thought to myself. ""I'll finally have real discussions."" What a joke. My classmates in DC were more obstinate and intractable than the people I'd run into before. Even factual statements like ""the Federal Reserve manages the money supply by buying and selling Treasury securities"" were met with condescension and derision. Class discussions weren't discussions. They were shouting matches where people simply parroted their pre-determined ideologies instead of listening to each other. 

     My experience in DC taught me that my education and opinions don't matter. No one gives a shit what I think. No one gives a shit what I've learned. Even with a Ph.D. the things I have to say won't be worth the dirt we walk on. After DC I shut down a lot of the things I used to enjoy. I stopped watching documentaries; I stopped watching the news; I stopped contributing to conversations. Why think about things if those thoughts aren't worth jack shit? I also came up with a new rationalization to keep me going. ""Okay, people don't give a shit what you say, but that's because they don't know you. The people that know you, the people that are close to you - those people care about you and what you have to say."" As a result I became intensely loyal to my friends. And I kept studying economics.

* While I was in graduate school I met, dated, and fell in love with another Master's student. She fell in love with me too. We had a wonderful time together. Five months later that girl broke up with me. It was sudden; it was unexpected; and it left me heartbroken. I asked, maybe even begged, her to talk it out with me before ending the relationship. She refused. Heartbroken, I turned to my friends for support and consolation. But my friends weren't up to the task. Instead of helping me, they took this girl's side! They called me an asshole for wanting to talk about things before breaking up! Breaking up with my girlfriend was heartbreaking, but having my friends side against me was positively devastating. After that I went into an emotional free fall. Attempts to repair the friendships went nowhere because I was never able to get them to see my side of the coin. The best I got was that we had a ""miscommunication"" and we eventually just stopped talking to each other. Losing my love and my friends simultaneously was too much to bear, and for the first time in my life I began to consider suicide as a viable alternative. How else was I going to stop the bleeding?

That was last year. Back then I would think, ""What about suicide? There's no joy in death, but there's no pain either. Maybe you'll find peace in death."" Things have accelerated since then. Today, suicidal thoughts occupy every free moment of my life. And I no longer think that suicide might be an option. Now suicide IS the option. Now I think, ""I want to die."" And it's not just about my friends anymore. Now it's more than that. Now it's about the fact that I can't trust anybody. Stupid people didn't give a shit about me and what I had to say. Smart students like me didn't give a shit about me and what I had to say. And, finally, the people I trusted and confided in didn't give a shit about me and what I had to say. 

Now it's also about the fact that I can't make good decisions for myself. I should have chosen a less political major, one where others would respect my expertise, but I didn't. I should have seen the writing on the wall when my classmates in Washington spit on what I had to say, but I didn't. I should have done crazy, stupid shit when I was in high school, but I didn't. I should have slept around in college when I had the chance, but I didn't. In the former cases, I ignored the warnings. In the latter cases, I denied myself all kinds of things for reasons that turned out to be total bullshit. What other erroneous beliefs are lurking inside my mind? Can I really trust myself to make good decisions about my life anymore? This track record says otherwise.

So now I'm here, sitting at my desk while suicidal thoughts run riot through my mind. I'm thankful that I haven't yet made an earnest suicide attempt, but that attempt is coming. I spent this afternoon (and my afternoon last Saturday) dri...oh, it says not to talk about methods. Never mind!

Well, I guess that's it. What now?"

32ba7o,4,2015-04-12,How can we meet in the middle?,misaligned_partners,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/32ba7o/how_can_we_meet_in_the_middle/,"My SO and I have a really wonderful, loving, and supportive relationship, but we've always clashed when it comes to sex. It has been a problem since the beginning of the relationship, and I feel pretty helpless about it. I want to give a description of how it has evolved since the start of our relationship 2.5 years ago...so if this is too long just skip down to the last paragraph and the TL;DR. 

When we first started dating we were both 21 and our physical relationship moved slowly. She was not accustomed to being physically intimate, and was very shy and reserved. Despite that we had a spark of physical passion. We would spend hours kissing, and grinding with clothes on. This was great at first, but it was weeks before our shirts even came off. One night though we got a bit tipsy, everything came off, and we came close to having sex. She stopped it, but after that things were a little bit more loose. It came out that the idea of sex scared her very much. To her it seemed painful, dangerous (pregnancy wise), and against her religious morals. The latter part I didn't fully comprehend at the time. It seemed more like she just needed to get comfortable with being physical, and with the idea of having sex, rather than something she was actively against doing. Though very recently she has told me that she had thought she would wait until marriage up until the night we first had sex. 

At this point in our relationship (about two months in) we became long distance (a 6 hour drive apart). Meanwhile our intimacy was still moving slowly. We would play around a bit under the clothes, but I would always be the driver if that makes sense. It was also very inconsistent, and she often would not want to do anything at all despite not having seen me for weeks. It seemed like any little thing would turn her off, stress, fear for lack of sleep, etc. I became very frustrated during this time. I thought that she enjoyed it, since when we did do things we were very passionate. So I pushed her. I thought that I could try to encourage her to try new things, and she would quickly realize that she enjoyed it despite it previously seeming scary. This was a huge mistake, and I regret it deeply. She did start to try new things, but I was constantly making her feel deeply uncomfortable. She wanted to do things of her own accord and pace. She would try something because I wanted it, but then feel bad about herself for giving in and not being the sole commander of her body. I didn't realize that she was having these feelings at the time, though I did know that she was sometimes uncomfortable and that upset her. So I toned it down, but continued to try to encourage her within her comfort level. This went on for about six months. However, one night we were both drunk, all over each other, and ended up spontaneously having sex. This was pretty much the worst for her I think, and I feel awful about it. I wasn't trying to take advantage of her, she was all for it at the time. I hope that had I been more sober I would have stopped her and had us pick up the next day if she still wanted to. Shortly after she went away for the summer, for an internship in another country. I just want to take a moment to say that otherwise our relationship was developing nicely, and we were becoming close. The sex problem definitely affected us, but not to the point where it soured the relationship. Anyway, midway through her internship (after I tried to initiate skype sex), she opened up to me about the extent of her feelings on this subject. I learned that she felt continually pressured, and like nothing she did (in bed) was, or ever would be, good enough for me. This was the start of a conversation that is still going on basically. I felt awful about how she had been feeling, and wanted to change it. Simultaneously though, we still had the problem of having clashing sexual personalities, so it was not necessarily so straightforward to fix it. Implicit in all of this, was that if we couldn't fix it then we couldn't be together...which we both very much wanted. Regardless of finding a long term solution, I  knew that I needed to change how I treated her.

I immediately stopped trying to encourage her to try new things, and instead tried to focus on repairing the damage that I did, and help her be comfortable again. It was difficult for me not to express desire to her, and it was difficult for her to even talk about the subject. The progress was pretty slow for a few months, but she started to feel much better during that time. I eventually broached the topic and admitted that I wanted more, but only if it were within her comfort zone. Of course this backfired, but lead me to an important conclusion. I decided that I either needed to give her full control, or I couldn't be for her. I wanted to be as supportive and respectful of her as she deserves, but I couldn't be constantly waiting for progress and getting my hopes up at the same time. So I needed to either accept that we won't be having indefinitely... even up to a year or so, or else walk away. I went to visit her and told her that I had decided to give her full control, that I just want her to feel comfortable with me, and do things only if they come completely from within. This worked wonders. I had no expectations, but sometimes I would test the waters by sticking a fraction of a pinky toe in. Essentially I gave her all the power, and then gradually learned what control I could take back so that she had what she wanted, while I wasn't left with nothing. We built up trust this way, and built a sexual relationship where we were both much more comfortable. It was grueling, and required a lot of self control on my part, but it worked. A little over our one year mark we began having sex, infrequently at first, but then a bit more regularly. 

The next summer (1.5 years) we had a period of two months where we just traveled and lived together. During this time our sex life took off, relatively speaking, and we were having sex  3-4 times a week. It was great. We were both comfortable with it, and it was really good sex. Then last September comes around, and we both entered grad school. She began to struggling with classes, and became depressed. I spent a lot of time with her, just consoling her and providing support. I didn't expect anything sexually, because I know she only wants to have sex if she feels happy, loved, and at ease. As any good partner would, I cared a lot more about how she was coping than our sex life. Meanwhile she started taking antidepressants, which apparently reduce sex drive. After the semester was over she took a leave of absence, and moved in with me. So now finally, for the current state of things, and what the problem is.

We currently have sex about once every two weeks or so. Sometimes more frequent, sometimes less. When we do have sex it is wonderful. It's always intimate and passionate, and highly mutual. I feel more comfortable with her than I have with anyone else. Afterwards we cuddle, and she talks about how she enjoyed it, and how nice ""this"" is. So what I don't get is, why doesn't she want to do it more frequently? I never pressure her anymore, and it's not something that's scary. It just seems like at baseline, she rarely has any inclination to initiate, despite always enjoying it immensely. When we do have sex it has to be the perfect combination that I don't fully understand. It can't be close to bedtime, because she gets anxious about getting enough sleep. She won't ever want to if there's anything else that she wanted to do (including just watching a tv show together). And most importantly she can't feel any amount of discomfort either physically or emotionally. I understand these things, but what I don't understand is why she doesn't want to even when the stars align. I am generally a physically affectionate person. I like to cuddle lots, but I want to be sexually intimate with her more often. A few times recently (in the past 3-4 months) I have brought this up to her. Once was not so tactful, and it upset her (for obvious reasons if you read the first part of this), but we talked it through and it was okay...though nothing really changed. Other times, have been more tactful, but similarly not very effective. However, tonight I brought it up and it felt quite different. It was as tactful as I could have imagined it being. I told her that I wanted to be more passionate with her, because it's something that we both love, and because I love to express my affection that way. I said that in no way do I mean to pressure her to do anything at a particular time. I told her that I've worked hard to try to make sure she always feels comfortable, and never pressured, and I don't want to lose that. Instead I asked if there's a way she could meet me somewhere midway, but only if there's a way that she can do that while remaining in her comfort zone, and only because this is something she enjoys too. The thing is though, that there's not. There's obviously not, because otherwise she would be doing it. She took it well this time, but is still disappointed. We're both going to mull it over, but I don't think there's much either of us can do. She can't do things that make her feel uncomfortable, and I can't suppress my desires. There was a period last summer where our sex life was great, but that was when we were carefree. Maybe if she stops taking the antidepressants it will get better, but life will still always be stressful. There will always be a 9am job, among other things. I can only imagine how it would be if we were married and had kids....pretty much never. We just have very different sexual personalities, despite clicking well in bed, and I don't see how they could ever not clash. I don't know what to do. I want us to work. We are really good partners, and I want to settle down and have a family with her. It's just really difficult to think that our sex life might only stay the same or go downhill from here. 

TL;DR: I have a wonderful relationship with my SO but we're very different when it comes to sex. We have great chemistry in bed and both enjoy it immensely, but she generally only wants to have sex a few times a month. It's always been a problem for us, and I'm not sure if it's capable of being resolved."
32bg8q,1,2015-04-12,What Internship suits my career path?,ProfessorTaavi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/32bg8q/what_internship_suits_my_career_path/,"I currently have offers for two sandwich year internships A + B and I am a bit stuck at which one would benefit me the most in terms of career path. My intention once I finish my Computer Science degree is to move into software development but aim towards client facing and project management roles. I would consider myself an average programmer I have more exposure to industry practices than someone straight out of university with no experience as I have a part time role as an Application Developer. But my strengths lie more in my grasp of business + technical fundamentals so I am looking to work towards a role where I can exploit these the best. My question is which of the two roles is likely to be more of benefit to me in my career aims. Both of the internships are at a similar company with a similar rate of pay and both have follow on graduate programs.

Internship A 
Internship A was offered to me a while ago, on advice of the University I have accepted the offer but not signed the contract thus I would have to back down on my word which may hurt my reputation with the company. The role is a straight Software Development Role working on a large Java project in a Agile Environment, here I will significantly expand my own understanding of the technical process of development and will expand on my development skills + practices. But there is very little opportunity to experience management training or any form of client facing interaction.

Internship B 
Internship B was offered recently and is a more Architectural/Management role which will involve me working directly with a senior architect at the company I will be less exposed to coding practices + techniques but will be involved more with interacting directly with teams producing road maps and designs and general project management tasks over a number of varying projects. This role is also very likely to give me the opportunity to network with some potentially influential clients and use some of my existing skills and knowledge. This internship would be likely to lead into a Software Development role after graduation assuming I was to continue with the companies scheme.

I should add that it is my intention to retain the part time role throughout my internship as it can be performed remotely in my spare time. However whilst keeping my skills current, I feel it's unlikely to introduce any new key aspects.

Is it as important to initially have a strong experience of software development within companies as it would be to spend time with a senior architect designing potential solutions to clients problems and effectively managing projects right off the bat and focusing more on the development practices later?"

I really don't want to move anywhere in world other than US. But the problem is there is no way I can get immigration through H1B visa. It is nearly impossible for me and there are no options available to me other marrying a american citizen. 

So the only thing I can do is: Move there on a tourist visa or an internship, live illegally there, fall in love with an American citizen and then marry her. I don't want to break any law except living there illegally. I want to pay taxes properly and do everything that a good citizen should do. 

The only thing that worries is finding my true love and getting married. I am strictly against sham marriage and have no intention of marrying if I don't love the person, but still I feel people will think I am using her for Green Card...even if the Green card is not the primary reason of marriage. Other than this I may want to marry as earlier as possible so I can get my Green Card and can visit my family in home country soon so this is going to raise eye brows again.

This is really complicated. Will you guys hate me if I do that?

Please PM me for my resume and details. Thank you!"
32btyg,16,2015-04-12,QUESTION: I have an opportunity to make a show some details inside,FlukyS,linux_gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/32btyg/question_i_have_an_opportunity_to_make_a_show/,"So im talking with a specific hardware manfacturer about getting sponsorship for an esports show and I mentioned my Linux background and I thought it would be good to pitch both ideas. My background is ive been using Linux since around 07, I contributed to Ubuntu for around 2 years (and a few bits and bobs since but I dont have as much time to give) doing various things like answering questions on launchpad (we didn't have askubuntu before), I helped out doing bug reports, I was and still am (although its pretty dead) for the Irish translations, submitted some crappy patches, contributed a little to GNOME for a very short period, was at a UDS and was the first (only?) intern at Canonical. Ive always been a gamer since my first computer back in 2000. My achievements are master league at SC2 with Zerg, I played a bit of HoN, Dota2 and im quite enjoying Strife right now all to a pretty decent level. I play a good lot of the games that come out on Linux and was one of those people who seemed like the crazy person asking about Linux support for games for years but now we are doing great :) 

The idea for the esports show is from a manager's point of view since I have a qualification in music management and that overlaps a lot on esports. I won't bore you guys with the details. 

The other show that im thinking of is just for Linux gaming. Talking about drivers, how games are playing, new games coming...etc. I plan on bringing on guests and some community interaction. I was thinking of bringing in the subreddit a good bit for it so I thought id ask what you guys think of it? The plan is 1 hour long of focused talk (I'm a pretty strict moderator of discussion if it gets boring ill push ahead). I haven't decided how regular it would be but it would be either bi-weekly or monthly if its monthly id have it 3 hours and make it a little more loose. 

EDIT: I forgot to mention, the sponsorship isn't for definite but I might do it anyway. I just wanted to hear some opinions or ideas. "
32buug,63,2015-04-12,"Me [26F] with my BF [29M] 7 Years, He cheated, my world has been turned upside down.",momeow,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/32buug/me_26f_with_my_bf_29m_7_years_he_cheated_my_world/,"My boyfriend and I were in a wonderful relationship for 7 years. I had never felt as if I could trust someone as much as him--we've seen eachother through some terrible times (his dad dying, my severe bouts of depression). I struggled with depression for a few years and I knew at times that I was unpleasant to be around, but he never waivered in his support of me, and always made me feel loved and calmed me. We both planned to spend the rest of our lives together.

Around Fall of 2014 I started to feel a bit stagnant in our relationship--it wasn't anything too bad and I knew it was a part of all healthy relationships. I work two jobs and go to school and he is a line chef who works 90 hour weeks. It was understandable and the feeling went away for me. He then starts to act unpleasant, often seeming annoyed by me, but I figured it was his job and his need for privacy and personal time/space. We didn't have as much sex, but he always said he was tired and generally has a lower libido than me. 

This started to really get to me and I began to feel undesirable, which then planted the seed that maybe he wasn't interested in me anymore, and I began to have what I brushed off as crazy throughts of him cheating, or at least wanting to cheat. HOWEVER, things in general seemed to be going pretty well these past few weeks both in our own lives and in our relationship (something we both agreed on).

Fast forward to today--I sign onto Facebook on his computer without realized his account was automatically signed in. Without hesitating I immediately checked his messaged and began reading any conversations he was having with girls. (This is also maybe the 2nd time I've checked his text/messages in our relationship).

Most conversations seemed pretty harmless, albeit a bit flirty, which does bother me, but didn't freak me out. I then began reading a conversation he had with an old co-worker (33 F, recent divorcee with 3 kids). It also started out harmless ""Nice running into you..""How are you""...etc..but then around January they start sexting and I read something along the lines of ""I can't wait for you to be inside me again"". (They also both stated to eachother they were drunk, be he admitted he was sexting sober).

I confronted him about this a few hours ago...he didn'y deny anything. He didn't make any excuses--he told me they had sex about 2 weeks ago, but that was the only time, and he has not spoken to her since because he felt weird and guilty. He told me he messed up and he has no excuse, and that the sex was just sex, there was nothing deeper to it.

He is staying at his mom's, he asked if he would talk to me tomorrow or Monday, but I told him I wasn't sure. I want to and don't want to. He became very distraught when I told him I didn't think we could come back from this.

I am going to give myself a coupld of weeks isolated from him to clear my head, but I don't kniow if I should even consider trying to rebuild. I love him and I want to, but he hurt me in such a profound way that I've never felt before. I am strong enough to take care of my school and internship work, but at home I feel as if my life is falling apart. Please help.

TLDR: Boyfriend sexted 1 person a few times, they had sex once two weeks ago. He regrets it, wants to work it out.

32bv5p,16,2015-04-12,This subreddit helped me realize my parents are Ns,PinkBlair,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/32bv5p/this_subreddit_helped_me_realize_my_parents_are_ns/,"This subreddit is amazing. This is my first post. [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/31zgft/daes_parent_have_a_warped_sense_of_time/) about ""busy"" Nparents resonated so much with me, I decided to share my stories and seek commiseration. I am learning so much here. Thank you all!

I have slowly come to realize during my 30s that my father and stepmother are Ns. This believing they are ""busy"" while doing exactly what they want 24/7/365, is one of their most annoyingly delusional behavioral quirks.

They have been retired for more than ten years now (my stepmother since she was in her 40s!), and though they spent several years of energy micromanaging the lives of elderly relatives, they are now free of that phase of life. I am an only, who lives 300+ miles away. Unlike them, I am actually busy (grad school, work, internships, studying at the moment), and so I only see them once or twice a year right now. I would like to see them more, even though they are difficult and we've always had a difficult relationship. I have slowly gotten better at managing our relationship, and there is a great deal of love there despite their N behaviors. My very emotionally healthy partner of the past few years has been a huge support here.

Anyway, my parents have no children, no grandchildren, no elderly relatives or others for whom they must provide care, no jobs, no real hobbies (other than watching television), no local groups (church or otherwise), and only a few close friends who haven't been allowed to come to their home for more than ten years (due to Step-Nmom's hoarding--but that's a whole other story). They have been ""organizing"" their paperwork and surplus inventory since closing their business more than ten years ago, and they have been ""organizing"" and ""cleaning"" the elderly relatives' home for going-on five years (and paying the taxes on an unoccupied house!). 

I call them every week, and regularly send them emails to briefly check in, give them necessary news, or just say hello, but they always complain that they never hear from me when I call. Every time. When I drive the 300 miles to visit my mother, they tell me they're ""busy"" and I can't come to their house for X number of days, even though I drove so far to see them (and I have a job!). When they come see me, it's a huge ordeal, with them being extremely particular about what time they will check into a hotel (to get their choice of rooms); always, always switching tables every time we go to a restaurant; making my partner and I drive them around and chauffeur them to every restaurant and outing so they don't have to walk more than two steps (they are both obese now due to their lifestyle); and, calling me multiple times whenever we are trying to meet up at a location--to give me instructions on *exactly* where to meet, e.g. ""by the palm tree,"" or changing the agreed meet-up location even though I am on a very crowded, standing-room-only train on the way--then, when I get there, I realize I have literally ten missed calls and a text and a voicemail from them asking my ETA, changing the meet-up spot, giving detailed instructions. This has been my life forever, but they have gotten worse with age and since retiring. Now they are totally on their own schedule and do not have to negotiate boundaries with anyone at work or otherwise, so they are very N. This has been what allowed me to see their pattern of behavior clearly, as an adult. Etc., etc., ad nauseum.

The most recent example is really telling. I am graduating soon, and they way it worked out, I have to be at an event in another city three hours away the afternoon before my graduation. And then I have to be at the graduation venue, in regalia, by 7:00am. I am already dreading the drive on a very crowded and dangerous stretch of road on Friday night at rush hour, and knowing I have to get up really early the next morning to graduate will make the weekend pretty stressful. They will be driving literally through the same city on their way to come to MY graduation. So, against my better judgment, I asked them if (if I got a ride *to* the event with a colleague) they could swing through the nearby suburb to pick me up from this event and bring me back home. My partner and I share a car, but he needs it for work, and I have to be away for this event Wednesday-Friday, which will be a work hardship for him if I take our car. So, knowing my parents will be driving right by that same Friday, I ask them if they can pick me up and we can all three ride to my graduation together. My Ndad just says ""No,"" telling me that doesn't ""fit into their plans."" Ooookay. I was so annoyed (why? this is all so predictable! not only are they self-centered Ns who think their non-schedule is the most important thing in the world, but they *enjoy* saying no to me any time I ask for help), so I didn't respond for the rest of the day, instead trying to make other plans with colleagues and my partner. A few hours later, my Ndad emails me again, saying ""I love you, but, we don't want to be on the road that late on a Friday. And we want to get there early so we can check into the hotel before everyone else. If you get there late, they give you the worst room."" Am I crazy, or is this N behavior?! Even though I am in my mid-thirties, partnered, totally independent finally and otherwise, and am getting my second graduate degree, I think it is really, really weird that you would not inconvenience yourself in the slightest to pick up your own, only child, to go to the graduation that you are driving to in the first place! 

So now I may have to rent a car. Which, really, will be more enjoyable for me than spending six hours in the car with these two. They make every car trip twice as long by stopping multiple times to shop at big box stores for things they don't need.

Okay, thanks for listening."

Appendix A- Owner Guidelines 1. Punctuality Rationale 1: One of the core responsibilities of the Instructor is the management and counseling of his/her students. In order to facilitate counseling of students in every class, the Instructor should review past grades, student issues – a form used in student management procedure) history, and other data and documents related to his/her students and designate students for possible counseling – whether that counseling is for praise, encouragement or any other purposes. Class time is reserved for instruction and counseling only. A review of student history should be done outside class time as a part of preparation or follow-up. Since the well-being of students is the main priority of Owner and the Instructor, it is only the reason for instructors to be on the premises preparing for any relevant day’s class or classes. Rationale 2: Punctuality is a crucial component of activities or operations befitting the Instructor. Due to the obvious unpredictability of Korean traffic and other unforeseen circumstances, the Instructor should begin their commute to the premises with a reasonable buffer time in order to ensure his/her punctual arrival for smooth and professional classes. Due to the above reasons, the Owner may monitor and track the time of arrival of every instructor to verify that all instructors arrive on time for class. Although it is suggested that Instructor arrives at least 60 minutes before the start of each class, all instructors are required to log in to class in the ERPS (Enterprise Resource Management System) at least 30 minutes before the start of a 3-hour, 6-hour, or 9-hour block of classes in accordance with the rationales stated above (the “30-Minute Rule”). All log-in to the ERP must be done in the class where the day’s instruction is to be held, and log-in from other areas or classroom will be restricted. Furthermore, the Instructor shall attend any and all his/her classes from the start thereof (the “Punctuality Rule”) and the Instructor acknowledges that the Owner will not tolerate any violation of such Punctuality Rule. The Owner is extremely sensitive to any violation of the Punctuality Rule by the Instructor because such violation is the most conspicuous index of instructors' unprofessional behavior. It is an indication of a lack of responsibility, a poor work ethic, and a blatant disregard of the trust that the Owner has received to educate Korea’s children. Therefore, the following guidelines shall be used in order to promote not only awareness but also certainty of the results of such violations, and the Owner requests that the Instructor do his/her utmost to maintain the level of professionalism required to abide by the guidelines below.
Violation of 30-Minute Rule During 1 Term of 3 Months Number of Violations Result 1 Notification (Online and Offline) 2 Notification (Online and Offline) 3 Substandard Performance Notification (Online and Offline) 4
5 Termination of the Agreement Violation of Punctuality Rule During 1 Term of 3 months Number of Violations Result 1 Deduction of payment in accordance with the formula below + Notification (Online and Offline) 2 Deduction of payment in accordance with the formula below + Substandard Performance Notification (Online and Offline) 3 Termination of the Agreement * The formula for payment deduction: Payment for services provided by the Instructor under Article 1 of the Agreement shall be deducted by the missed class time, which shall be calculated by rounding up any minutes of class time, during which the Instructor fails to attend the relevant class, to the nearest hour (for examples, being late for 1 minute will result in deduction of payment for 1 hour and being late for 61 minute will result in deduction of payment for 2 hours). 2. Absence without Prior Notice Any absence from a scheduled class without at least 24-hour prior notice and approval from the Company shall constitute a violation of the Punctuality Rule, which may be deemed substandard performance or for the purposes of considering termination of the Agreement but not for the purpose of payment deduction under the Punctuality Rule. 3. Dress Code Dress code will be in effect for all instructors of the Owner, including the Instructor, to promote a professional image of the Owner. In the interest of fostering a “casual, but smart” image, the following items are prohibited: a. All headwear including, but not limited to, baseball caps, bandannas, skull-caps, and hats; b. Any article of clothing that is torn, ripped, or tie-dyed, or camouflage-printed; c. Any article of clothing that contains vulgar, profane, violent, or sexual content; d. Any article of clothing which may be excessively revealing including, but not limited to, muscle- T’s, tank-tops, half-T’s, and miniskirts; e. All short-cut pants exposing the legs, including, but not limited to, Bermuda shorts, khaki shorts, and jean shorts; f. Any article of clothing that is purposely oversized or excessively baggy including but not limited to snowboard pants, hip-hop gear, military fatigues, and overalls; g. Flip-flops, slippers, bowling shoes, and combat boots; h. Public exposure of piercing of the body and face with the exception of earrings in the amount of up to three(3) earrings per ear limited in size to two (2) inches in diameter. Nose rings, eyebrow rings, lip rings, and cheek piercing are strictly prohibited; i. Public exposure of any tattoos, hennas, or other figurative markings on the body. These markings must be kept covered with appropriate articles of clothing or accessories; and j. Any dyeing or cutting of hair in a conspicuously unusual manner including, but not limited to Mohawk haircuts, Punk-style haircuts, or hairstyles with fluorescent colors. *Special exceptions to the above-mentioned items may be granted for religious or medical reasons on a case-by-case basis. *Instructors, including the Instructor, should realize the importance of maintaining an appropriate level of formality at the end and beginning of terms. While formal attire is not mandatory, professional appearance and conduct are of utmost importance. Instructors, including the Instructor, are also encouraged to refrain from smoking within visibility of any student of the Owner, and to smoke only in designated areas. 4. Substandard Performance Instructors who have committed any of the following violations or any combination thereof may receive a substandard performance notification based on the nature and extent of such violation(s), or deemed to have breached the terms of the Agreement, for which the Owner may terminate the Agreement under Article 3: Three or more violations of the 30-minute rule during one (1) term; a. Three or more violations of the 30-minute rule during one (1) term; b. Five or more violations of the 30-minute rule during any six (6) month period; c. Two or more actual case of tardiness from class during one (1) term; d. Three or more actual case of tardiness during any six (6) month period; e. Tardiness to or failure to attend scheduled meetings and training sessions on two (2) or more occasions during one (1) term without prior approval; f. Requests for sick days or emergency leave on a continuous basis; g. Unauthorized use of the computer for personal purposes during class including but not limited to playing games, using messenger, using the Internet, and creating documents or files; h. Leaving the classroom during scheduled class hours (other than during break times); i. Failure to properly check Company communication portal and related email account on a daily basis or otherwise fail to receive and respond to communications from Company on a continuous basis; j. Failure to properly complete and provide information pertaining to classes or requested by Company staff on a timely basis including, but not limited to, student grades, overall student evaluations, scheduling preferences, and level placements; k. Failure to return homework, quizzes, exams, or other class materials to students within a timely basis; l. Improper conduct leading to a complaint from a student, parent, faculty, staff, manager, officer, or director where an investigation into the matter reveals that the Instructor was at fault and that his/her actions caused harm to the reputation or the work environment at Company; m. Conduct unbecoming an Instructor including but not limited to violation of the laws of Korea, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, causing a public disturbance, and public drunkenness; or n. Poor work quality evidenced by unsatisfactory performance ratings at the end of any academic term.
Conduct The Instructor shall not engage in using any foul language, mature content, or otherwise offensive themes/materials in any class. In addition, the Instructor shall observe all Korean laws and regulations as a responsible Korean citizen or visiting foreign national, as appropriate.
Professional Development Leave The Instructor is entitled to apply for up to 7 consecutive days (class days and non-class days included) of paid professional development leave after the first initial six (6) months upon commencing teaching services at Owner. One (1) additional day of leave shall accrue for every nine (9) month period after such initial six (6) month period. How professional development leave is to be used is at the Instructor’s sole discretion. Requests for professional development leave must be made to your Faculty Manager preferably prior to the commencement of a new academic term, but in no event shall such request be considered unless submitted at least thirty (30) days in advance. If the Instructor does not take all of the days of leave permitted hereunder, such remaining days of leave shall not be carried over to any extended or renewed term of the Agreement beyond the Initial Term. Except in case of emergency, instructors may not apply for professional development leave or substitute classes during the first three weeks or last three weeks of any academic term. The reason is that students and class stability is most sensitive during these periods of a given academic term, and require the utmost care and attention by both Instructor and Owner management. If the Instructor teaches any intensive classes, he/she shall not apply for professional development leave during the period of such classes. Should the instructor ever teach zero class hours for a period greater than 2 weeks, no evaluation for FAS is given and reconsideration for adjusting the instructor’s hourly rate is delayed for the duration of the instructor’s absence from the classroom.
Sick Days Instructors may request a substitute instructor for his/her classes in the case of emergency. Substitute classes may affect professional development leave eligibility depending upon the nature of the reason for the missed class. In the event that the Instructor has taken two (2) or more sick days or emergency leave days during one academic term, he/she shall be ineligible to request professional development leave time for the following academic term, in addition to any other restrictions that may apply.
CCTV The purpose of CCTV is (1) to serve as a resource for all the instructors of the Owner, including the Instructor and (2) to serve as a monitoring tool. The primary purpose of the CCTV system is not for Owner and its training consultants to monitor Instructor performance, but rather for all instructors, including the Instructor, to continue developing their skills. Hence all instructors, including the Instructor, will have access to (i) their own classroom footages and (ii) classroom footages of other instructors when accompanied by the head instructor of the Owner to observe the best examples of teaching skills and methodologies. CCTV as a monitoring tool serves a vital role in not only evaluating the instructors, including the Instructor, but also serves as a blanket of protection. The Owner may verify student complaints and defend its instructors, including the Instructor, when complaints are groundless."
32c3rx,14,2015-04-12,I [21M] am becoming increasingly concerned with my gf's [20F] depression. (&gt;1 year) Help!,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/32c3rx/i_21m_am_becoming_increasingly_concerned_with_my/,"Throwaway account.

I met an amazing girl and we get along great. We both can see each other dating for a while. Whenever she is out and about she is usually in a pretty great mood. But school has gotten stressful along with her losing her best friend due to a very serious fight. This has thrown her into a pretty bad state with her depression.

At first she'd complain about school and her job (she was interning part-time). After school became too much work she left the internship to focus on school. However she'd often times stay up all night working and sleep all day the next day causing her to be late or skip classes.

Our relationship is fine. I try and be supportive as possible but as of late I've become increasingly concerned about her depression. Often times she'll stay in bed all day, and not leave her room. She's been eating sometimes once a day. She says she stopped caring about what she eats so her diet has become very poor some days (if she does eat it's usually junk food, however her parents recently subscribed her to blue apron or something so her meals are better). 

The biggest issues have come out in the last two weeks. She's been saying a lot that she feels like dying. After I ask her how I can help her she says stuff like ""Put me out of my misery."" or ""Find a easy way out.""

I'm coming close to telling this all to her parents and having them address it. I want to help but now I'm starting to get nervous about which actions I should take. She says she's joking and wouldn't ever do anything like that but she's bringing it up every day.

Should I tell her parents? Or would that ruin our relationship?

How can I be a good boyfriend here?
   
**tl;dr**: Trying to figure out how I can help with my girlfriend's depression/suicidal thoughts."
32c43a,2,2015-04-12,Me [26M] was last splitting on good terms with my on/off girlfriend [27F] of 10 years. When I done something to destroy us ever speaking again.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/32c43a/me_26m_was_last_splitting_on_good_terms_with_my/,"We have had are ups and downs over 10 years but the love I have for this women goes beyond any other love I know. I am by nature a selfish person and I have seen a side to my personality over the last year which practically makes me feel sick. 

Recently she had told me about a dramatic time in her life, while we were not together and I was not there for her a whole lot. I have a way of making things about me (sick). So basically we have not been making each other happy over the past couple of months or year and so when my girlfriend spoke to me, she said what is the point in staying in a miserable relationship.  It took me a few weeks but I finally came around and saw her point. 

My now ex girlfriend is very talented and studying to be a fashion designer. She is in her 3rd year and part of that involves going abroad to do an internship. We have been getting on good since we decided to split, talking great and spending good time together. I suppose deep down we wanted to stay on good terms to see what may happen in the future, at least that was in my mind anyway.

QUE THE SELFISH ANTICS:

So 4 days before she heads off, instead of trying to spend time with her, I go and get off my face on drink and drugs and sleep with some random girl. As well as doing a lot of selfish things in between like not contacting my ex, getting in photos(I cant remember) with people she does not like and I dont really like either, as well as some other shitty stuff. Basically showing the height of disrespect to my best friend and being a real piece of shit by treating her like this. Although I am known to be selfish this is strikingly out of character, I have never cheated on her before or anyone for that matter and I had always been quite proud of that. But in one foul swoop I have destroyed the only real relationship I have in my life.

My ex, knows me so well that from my messages the days that followed, she could tell that something was up. She phoned me in the early hours of the morning and ask if I had been with someone else.? 

I replied with the truth, bear in mind she was heading away 2 days later. I knew I had probably lost her forever at this stage but thought by telling the truth was the least I could do, and maybe she may speak to me again in the future. I know that if someone tells me the truth the first time, it helps. 

So now she has gone off on her internship with this bullshit in her head because I am a selfish cunt and have to angle everything around me. I feel so shit, I have never had suicidal thoughts but the past few days they have been creeping in my mind. I am too much of a coward to act on them though. 

I have not spoke to her since the early hours phone call some days ago. I have tried contacting her, I am completely blocked off her FB, I tried leaving a card in her house and called down later, prior to her leaving, which only further shows my mental health is not great because on reflection that was a ridiculous idea. 

I hope she finds the happiness she deserves and I really hope she is not thinking about it at all. But I have messed up the only person who actually cared about my well being and now their gone, I just hope it is not forever. The least I deserve don't get me wrong but I cannot believe what I have actually done because although I am selfish I have never done anything to this degree. 

I have seen parts of my personality that are fake, selfish and just pretty much fucked up. I hope I can change this about myself. I really do and I am going to try my best. But above all I hope someday she can find it in her heart to forgive me, and maybe we could be friends after all. 

She is a strong woman, talented and ambitious woman who will get what she deserves and I wish her all the best. I just hope we can share a phone call and conversation from time to time. 10 years is a long time and we both have gone through a lot together within that time(Whether I was there for her or not). 

I just really love her and feel sick and ashamed that I have done this.... 

Please leave you thoughts below, good or bad. Thank you for reading this.

TL;DR; Do you think there is hope she may forgive me? What do you think of me as a person? "

32c5qk,1,2015-04-12,I[M23] can’t tell if breaking up with my girlfriend[F23 of 4 1/2 years is the right decision.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/32c5qk/im23_cant_tell_if_breaking_up_with_my/,"I’ll supply a TDLR to be nice as i feel there is a relevant amount of information that i should give for those who are interested in my full thinking. i.e. This is a long one:

TL:DR I told my girlfriend i want to break up because she makes me happy less than she makes me depressed but i care about her and I don’t want to hurt her.

We have been together since i was a sophomore in college and she was a freshman. She helped me through a lot of hardships at the time and we fell in love real quick and things went off from there. We had our scruples. We broke up three times temporarily. Never for more than a month. In those times we never dated anyone else.

Now while the first 2 years of our relationship may seem important what really started this was summer of 2013. My senior year of college i was offered a CS internship at one of the big three tech companies in Silicon valley. It was going to be from May till October. And while it was a big time away i wanted to make our temporary long distance relationship work. There was no guarantee of a job afterwords and even if i did get it i would try and make it so we could live a good life together still. A week before it happened she had a humongous breakdown at a going away party for her friend who coincidently was moving back home two hours north of the bay area. While embarrassed we stayed together but the gist of it was that she didn’t want me to go. That this internship for me would ruin the relationship. 

We patched things up but i wanted her to apologize to my friend who i had to give a ride to from the party since i kept him three hours longer than he needed to but in general she didn’t see what was really wrong with what happened. I understand how upsetting it would be but i was going to make weekend trips back once every two months and i was going to have her come and stay with me for however long she needed.

During the internship i paid for her flight to come see me. See while she was in college she always had financial issues as she has only worked retail or minimum wage jobs. But since i started college i had been financially stable with my jobs. And for the longest time i had been paying for our food, and activities. Pretty much everything. And i never sweat it at all until the moment she left. I began to grow a resentment towards her. I thought that someday she and i will become equals in this and that we will both be well off financially and we will be able to take care of ourselves. Ever since we started dating i always wanted her to be independent to go hang out with her friends and have goals. Something she herself admitted to be lacking.

I always told her that if and when we were married and i died that her life shouldn’t grind to a halt. Yea mourn me and all that yadayada but she should have a life in addition to me. I should enhance her life and enable her to have dreams and goals and not be her only dream and goal.

She transferred to a better college and has been going after a marketing/advertising degree and always talks about her goals now. Something that i see she has great pride in her.

But when she left i and started uni again she spilled water on her macbook and due to my friends working at apple i was able to get a discounted laptop but she needed help with it. 

And there was the start of where i grew into a debt with her. Or so it feels like.

Out of love and care i told her i would help her pay for repairs/a new laptop. This was while i was still in california and we would try and get it done.

Now the agreement was that when the time came she would pay what she could and i would pay the rest. Somewhere in the area of 300 from her and 700 from me. But to do that we would have to wait for her to afford her end. But in that time she grew hateful and angry. Every phone call i would get from her made my day drop down the toilet. Her work sucked. Her classes sucked. Her coworkers sucked. Traffic sucked. Constant complaining. It never ended. I would avoid her phone calls because staying on the phone with her would bring me down. Something that lasted another year. It depressed me immensely. 

When i came back from california i was so fed up with how this relationship was making me feel that i broke it off when her quarter ended because i couldn’t bear the weight of it.

The winter quarter i spent time with friends and family. New years eve happened and i reminisced on the good times we had. Thinking of how even how she depressed me sometimes that i care about her. And that seeing her laugh at my bad jokes, seeing her smile when she sees dopy things, and the we agreed a lot about our future at that point. And so i got back together with her. I apologized. And that was that.

Not one week later i started a job at a  startup downtown where she was at school and we spent time together but it was taking time for me to acclimate my schedule as i used to wake up at 11 all the time and then i was waking up at 6. I was still living at my parents and was looking for a place in the city. 

We got into fights because she never had enough of my time even though i was spreading myself thin to the point of crying some nights with the stress. My startup job wasn’t paying buckets exactly. 

I got a new place and that helped. We were only a quick train ride away from each other. And she stayed over half the week. I would stay over at her place but she had roommates :\.

It was getting time to buy her laptop soon but my parents had just ran into dire finances and needed to borrow a couple thousand which tapped me out. Going into getting my apartment i had only 500 to my name and the apartment was at least a thousand per month.

Soon summer was arriving and while we hadn’t bought her laptop yet festival tickets got announced and she brought it up to me the day they were released and expected me to front them. 500$ for the both of us. Something that i couldn’t afford even though i got my tax return the day of but i didn’t want to spend all of that. I wanted a security blanket in case i lost my job. And also i was going to use that for her laptop. But she said that she would postpone getting a laptop for these tickets. A fight ensued and i felt so guilty about not getting her those tickets. that i bought tickets to a concert the day of my birthday that she also spoke about wanting which cost about the same. She showed no appreciation or empathy towards the fact that i am about to shell out 1200$ by the end of the summer for her. And she hasn’t spent one dime towards me. Not that i expected it to. But the last thing i wanted was her complaints. And so i had to also delay getting a laptop for her.

She grew irritable. She grew mad and complacent. She wouldn’t listen or be understanding. Not to say what about me but i was going to offer 700$ of money that i needed and couldn’t afford to give almost. I eventually bought it but not two weeks after i saw her bank account as it flashed on her app where she showed that she had 2000$ plus saved up. Something i hadn’t known. She had made it out that she was living paycheck to paycheck at that point. I barely had 200$ at that point.

Even after getting her the laptop which supposedly would help her with school and make her less irritable she grew accustomed of being complacent angry mad sad upset annoyed. Dear god. Annoyed. I hate that word so much because of her. She would constantly say the tiniest things were annoying or how annoyed she was. 

I eventually told her how taxing her negativity was to me and that maybe she should find a friend who would be better suited as her buddy for this or a therapist. Instead she said that i was trying to be controlling and that it was unfair. I keep things to my self because of this. Because i don’t think its her responsibility to absorb the blows of my emotions as a punching bag from whatever comes out of my mouth. And so she would hold things back instead of expressing it but would hold it over me saying that she’s stressed out because she can’t express it anymore.

All this changed after new years though. We had a talk and stayed calm and didn’t fight. And we discussed how we wanted to talk about things and had a really good conversation about our issues. She would be less complacent. She appreciated things that i did. Until the same summer concert festival came about again. I promised her last year that i would get her those tickets. And February i had gotten a new job which paid twice as much and so i have a lot of disposable income. But it was literally the first day of my new job when the tickets came out. And i had just moved to a new apartment and had a lot of credit card debt due to movers and had checks floating to pay off down payment and first months rent. I told her that while i promised the year before that i couldn’t do it this year and asked her if she could do it. In which she said she couldn’t afford it.

And so i said heres my credit card and if you feel comfortable asking me of this knowing what my financial situation looks like than do it. She went straight ahead and did it. (This whole conversation was through sms as i was at work).

She went a head and tried but the online system was taxed too much and didn’t work. She didn’t get the tickets. The conversation ensued and she got angry and i told her lets wait for the single day tickets to come out rather than the all weekend pass. We would wait to see who was performing and then get appropriate tickets. She wanted all of them. 700$ roughly. I said i couldn’t do that (the tickets would come out tomorrow).
We got into a fight. A big fight. All through sms while i was at work. And i told her i wanted to end it. That this was a telling flaw. That my eyes were clear. That this was what our future would look like. 

She started to read back through all of the texts and saw what i had asked her. That if she felt comfortable asking me to do this then go ahead and do it. And apparently that dawned on her and she apologized profusely and had said how selfish she had been. And that she just didn’t like that i was reneging on a promise but didn’t take into account that my financial condition had changed. 

I sadly didn’t carry through that day. Because of all the things she said to me were the things i wanted to hear. That she apologized and was going to care more now and that she would be less selfish.

Not even a month later. This past thursday. I was working from home and i was in a conference call. We had agreed that i would pick her up and she’d hang out here and i would drop her off at her work. She had gotten mad that i didn’t do this two days ago when i was working from home but that was because i thought she had stuff to do.

Any way we got into a fight over text again and she had gotten kind of aggressive. I had told her four times that lets talk about this later. Calmly. (However calm you can be over text). And then when i was called out for not paying attention in my conference call (which she knew i was in) i told her to stop talking! Not the best thing to say yes i agree. But she blew up at me after. Saying how big of a jerk i was. How it was rude. That i had better pick her up. But right then and there i felt it again. The low that she takes me to. I am an upbeat happy person. Little things don’t bother me about every day life. I don’t vent. I don’t need an emotional punching bag. But right there i saw my future. And i didn’t want to feel this low ever again. Someone you love shouldn’t make you feel this way. You should want to call and talk to them. You should want to hear about their day and not avoid it.

I told her i wanted to end it right then and there. That this was enough. That every time i don’t deliver because she cutes her way or apologizes. She only apologizes when it gets out of hand. But not anymore. That this relationship wasn’t working. We were resting on our laurels. It wasn’t sophomore year anymore. I had graduated. And i have a new life starting. 

Ever since she has been apologizing profusely and saying how selfish she realizes she is and all of that stuff. But i can’t do this anymore. 

I try and not talk to her but this hurts me. I care about her still. Its been four days and i just want to hug her right now. Not random sexy time just a hug. Her hugs always make me feel good. And thats the thing i want now. But as soon as i do it i will regret it and hate myself. 

And that makes me feel like i am making a wrong decision. I can’t tell if this is the wrong decision or not. If this relationship is how normal relationships are where there are fights and its not always happy days. But you have to push through it.

I’m on the edge and my brain is saying go one way to Facebook deletion and gym time but my heart just wants a hug and to say i’m here.

TL:DR I told my girlfriend i want to break up because she makes me happy less than she makes me depressed but i care about her and I don’t want to hurt her."

I just hope we can share a phone call and conversation from time to time. 10 years is a long time and we both have gone through a lot together within that time(Whether I was there for her or not). 


I just really love her and feel sick and ashamed that I have done this.... Please leave you thoughts below, good or bad. 


Thank you for reading this. 


TL;DR; I basically treated the love of my life like shit and I am wondering your thoughts on it? Do you think there is hope she may forgive me? What do you think of me as a person?"
32c8lv,1,2015-04-12,I[M23] can’t tell if breaking up with my girlfriend[F23] of 4 1/2 years is the right decision.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/32c8lv/im23_cant_tell_if_breaking_up_with_my/,"I’ll supply a TDLR to be nice as i feel there is a relevant amount of information that i should give for those who are interested in my full thinking. i.e. This is a long one:

TL:DR I told my girlfriend i want to break up because she makes me happy less than she makes me depressed but i care about her and I don’t want to hurt her.

We have been together since i was a sophomore in college and she was a freshman. She helped me through a lot of hardships at the time and we fell in love real quick and things went off from there. We had our scruples. We broke up three times temporarily. Never for more than a month. In those times we never dated anyone else.

Now while the first 2 years of our relationship may seem important what really started this was summer of 2013. My senior year of college i was offered a CS internship at one of the big three tech companies in Silicon valley. It was going to be from May till October. And while it was a big time away i wanted to make our temporary long distance relationship work. There was no guarantee of a job afterwords and even if i did get it i would try and make it so we could live a good life together still. A week before it happened she had a humongous breakdown at a going away party for her friend who coincidently was moving back home two hours north of the bay area. While embarrassed we stayed together but the gist of it was that she didn’t want me to go. That this internship for me would ruin the relationship. 

We patched things up but i wanted her to apologize to my friend who i had to give a ride to from the party since i kept him three hours longer than he needed to but in general she didn’t see what was really wrong with what happened. I understand how upsetting it would be but i was going to make weekend trips back once every two months and i was going to have her come and stay with me for however long she needed.

During the internship i paid for her flight to come see me. See while she was in college she always had financial issues as she has only worked retail or minimum wage jobs. But since i started college i had been financially stable with my jobs. And for the longest time i had been paying for our food, and activities. Pretty much everything. And i never sweat it at all until the moment she left. I began to grow a resentment towards her. I thought that someday she and i will become equals in this and that we will both be well off financially and we will be able to take care of ourselves. Ever since we started dating i always wanted her to be independent to go hang out with her friends and have goals. Something she herself admitted to be lacking.

I always told her that if and when we were married and i died that her life shouldn’t grind to a halt. Yea mourn me and all that yadayada but she should have a life in addition to me. I should enhance her life and enable her to have dreams and goals and not be her only dream and goal.

She transferred to a better college and has been going after a marketing/advertising degree and always talks about her goals now. Something that i see she has great pride in her.

But when she left i and started uni again she spilled water on her macbook and due to my friends working at apple i was able to get a discounted laptop but she needed help with it. 

And there was the start of where i grew into a debt with her. Or so it feels like.

Out of love and care i told her i would help her pay for repairs/a new laptop. This was while i was still in california and we would try and get it done.

Now the agreement was that when the time came she would pay what she could and i would pay the rest. Somewhere in the area of 300 from her and 700 from me. But to do that we would have to wait for her to afford her end. But in that time she grew hateful and angry. Every phone call i would get from her made my day drop down the toilet. Her work sucked. Her classes sucked. Her coworkers sucked. Traffic sucked. Constant complaining. It never ended. I would avoid her phone calls because staying on the phone with her would bring me down. Something that lasted another year. It depressed me immensely. 

When i came back from california i was so fed up with how this relationship was making me feel that i broke it off when her quarter ended because i couldn’t bear the weight of it.

The winter quarter i spent time with friends and family. New years eve happened and i reminisced on the good times we had. Thinking of how even how she depressed me sometimes that i care about her. And that seeing her laugh at my bad jokes, seeing her smile when she sees dopy things, and the we agreed a lot about our future at that point. And so i got back together with her. I apologized. And that was that.

Not one week later i started a job at a  startup downtown where she was at school and we spent time together but it was taking time for me to acclimate my schedule as i used to wake up at 11 all the time and then i was waking up at 6. I was still living at my parents and was looking for a place in the city. 

We got into fights because she never had enough of my time even though i was spreading myself thin to the point of crying some nights with the stress. My startup job wasn’t paying buckets exactly. 

I got a new place and that helped. We were only a quick train ride away from each other. And she stayed over half the week. I would stay over at her place but she had roommates :\.

It was getting time to buy her laptop soon but my parents had just ran into dire finances and needed to borrow a couple thousand which tapped me out. Going into getting my apartment i had only 500 to my name and the apartment was at least a thousand per month.

Soon summer was arriving and while we hadn’t bought her laptop yet festival tickets got announced and she brought it up to me the day they were released and expected me to front them. 500$ for the both of us. Something that i couldn’t afford even though i got my tax return the day of but i didn’t want to spend all of that. I wanted a security blanket in case i lost my job. And also i was going to use that for her laptop. But she said that she would postpone getting a laptop for these tickets. A fight ensued and i felt so guilty about not getting her those tickets. that i bought tickets to a concert the day of my birthday that she also spoke about wanting which cost about the same. She showed no appreciation or empathy towards the fact that i am about to shell out 1200$ by the end of the summer for her. And she hasn’t spent one dime towards me. Not that i expected it to. But the last thing i wanted was her complaints. And so i had to also delay getting a laptop for her.

She grew irritable. She grew mad and complacent. She wouldn’t listen or be understanding. Not to say what about me but i was going to offer 700$ of money that i needed and couldn’t afford to give almost. I eventually bought it but not two weeks after i saw her bank account as it flashed on her app where she showed that she had 2000$ plus saved up. Something i hadn’t known. She had made it out that she was living paycheck to paycheck at that point. I barely had 200$ at that point.

Even after getting her the laptop which supposedly would help her with school and make her less irritable she grew accustomed of being complacent angry mad sad upset annoyed. Dear god. Annoyed. I hate that word so much because of her. She would constantly say the tiniest things were annoying or how annoyed she was. 

I eventually told her how taxing her negativity was to me and that maybe she should find a friend who would be better suited as her buddy for this or a therapist. Instead she said that i was trying to be controlling and that it was unfair. I keep things to my self because of this. Because i don’t think its her responsibility to absorb the blows of my emotions as a punching bag from whatever comes out of my mouth. And so she would hold things back instead of expressing it but would hold it over me saying that she’s stressed out because she can’t express it anymore.

All this changed after new years though. We had a talk and stayed calm and didn’t fight. And we discussed how we wanted to talk about things and had a really good conversation about our issues. She would be less complacent. She appreciated things that i did. Until the same summer concert festival came about again. I promised her last year that i would get her those tickets. And February i had gotten a new job which paid twice as much and so i have a lot of disposable income. But it was literally the first day of my new job when the tickets came out. And i had just moved to a new apartment and had a lot of credit card debt due to movers and had checks floating to pay off down payment and first months rent. I told her that while i promised the year before that i couldn’t do it this year and asked her if she could do it. In which she said she couldn’t afford it.

And so i said heres my credit card and if you feel comfortable asking me of this knowing what my financial situation looks like than do it. She went straight ahead and did it. (This whole conversation was through sms as i was at work).

She went a head and tried but the online system was taxed too much and didn’t work. She didn’t get the tickets. The conversation ensued and she got angry and i told her lets wait for the single day tickets to come out rather than the all weekend pass. We would wait to see who was performing and then get appropriate tickets. She wanted all of them. 700$ roughly. I said i couldn’t do that (the tickets would come out tomorrow).
We got into a fight. A big fight. All through sms while i was at work. And i told her i wanted to end it. That this was a telling flaw. That my eyes were clear. That this was what our future would look like. 

She started to read back through all of the texts and saw what i had asked her. That if she felt comfortable asking me to do this then go ahead and do it. And apparently that dawned on her and she apologized profusely and had said how selfish she had been. And that she just didn’t like that i was reneging on a promise but didn’t take into account that my financial condition had changed. 

I sadly didn’t carry through that day. Because of all the things she said to me were the things i wanted to hear. That she apologized and was going to care more now and that she would be less selfish.

Not even a month later. This past thursday. I was working from home and i was in a conference call. We had agreed that i would pick her up and she’d hang out here and i would drop her off at her work. She had gotten mad that i didn’t do this two days ago when i was working from home but that was because i thought she had stuff to do.

Any way we got into a fight over text again and she had gotten kind of aggressive. I had told her four times that lets talk about this later. Calmly. (However calm you can be over text). And then when i was called out for not paying attention in my conference call (which she knew i was in) i told her to stop talking! Not the best thing to say yes i agree. But she blew up at me after. Saying how big of a jerk i was. How it was rude. That i had better pick her up. But right then and there i felt it again. The low that she takes me to. I am an upbeat happy person. Little things don’t bother me about every day life. I don’t vent. I don’t need an emotional punching bag. But right there i saw my future. And i didn’t want to feel this low ever again. Someone you love shouldn’t make you feel this way. You should want to call and talk to them. You should want to hear about their day and not avoid it.

I told her i wanted to end it right then and there. That this was enough. That every time i don’t deliver because she cutes her way or apologizes. She only apologizes when it gets out of hand. But not anymore. That this relationship wasn’t working. We were resting on our laurels. It wasn’t sophomore year anymore. I had graduated. And i have a new life starting. 

Ever since she has been apologizing profusely and saying how selfish she realizes she is and all of that stuff. But i can’t do this anymore. 

I try and not talk to her but this hurts me. I care about her still. Its been four days and i just want to hug her right now. Not random sexy time just a hug. Her hugs always make me feel good. And thats the thing i want now. But as soon as i do it i will regret it and hate myself. 

And that makes me feel like i am making a wrong decision. I can’t tell if this is the wrong decision or not. If this relationship is how normal relationships are where there are fights and its not always happy days. But you have to push through it.

I’m on the edge and my brain is saying go one way to Facebook deletion and gym time but my heart just wants a hug and to say i’m here.

TL:DR I told my girlfriend i want to break up because she makes me happy less than she makes me depressed but i care about her and I don’t want to hurt her."
32ca97,32,2015-04-12,"My life, this sub, and similar places",hibye222,lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/32ca97/my_life_this_sub_and_similar_places/,"Back when I was a naive high school senior, I also signed up for basically 50k loans for 4 years at a state school. I only had two more days to decide, and I was going to do it. 



I asked my mother about it, taking out such large loans when my family was broke, and she said ""well your cousins had to take out such large loans as well, why not you too?"" And I agreed. But I happened to read an MSN article on the same topic. 




The actual article was boring, stuff I already knew. (Average student loans debt and 'College grads will make a million dollars more in a lifetime'). But they asked this questions for the commenters, ""How much student loan debt do you have?"" Simple questions, right? But the comments were horror stories on top of horror stories. 



People in their middle age still paying off loans that used to be small, people working 2-3 jobs just to afford their loans, many dreams differed because they cannot afford them, a lot of sadness and hopelessness about their situation.



 I took these things very seriously, did more research, and decided not go get the loans. It was a bit too late to pick a different college to go to, I called one but they said they were not taking more people for the fall term. So I went to a community college for two years, debt free. 



Then I transferred to another, better school, with full aid loan free. I do regret not having fun at a four year school for the first two years, but I knew that financial security was really important for me and my family, and I just could not risk that. 



Now I am about to graduate. I used to not get any interviews at all, but since I have gotten my internship I have received a few, but no job offers yet. I expected about the same prospects or worst about 4 years ago. Good thing I don't have crippling debt along with my lack of job.



 One job I had wanted me, but only part time minimum wage. Uh I can't afford my $900 a month apartment on that. I am still trying hard to get a job, to support myself and my family. My family is still broke, and I am glad I did not become a debt burden to them. 



They can't support me at all, they can barely support themselves. I want to get a decent job so maybe they will actually have nice things that I never did, and not get bullied relentlessly in school because of it.  



Anyway, just wanted to post here since my story is kind of related? Feel free to ask questions or whatever. "
32caot,0,2015-04-12,"My girlfriend [24f] and I [24m] have always clashed sexually, but otherwise we have a loving and great relationship. Can we compromise? (x-post from /r/DeadBedrooms).",misaligned_partners,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/32caot/my_girlfriend_24f_and_i_24m_have_always_clashed/,"My SO and I have a really wonderful, loving, and supportive relationship, but we've always clashed when it comes to sex. It has been a problem since the beginning of the relationship, and I feel pretty helpless about it. I want to give a description of how it has evolved since the start of our relationship 2.5 years ago...so if this is too long just skip down to the last paragraph and the TL;DR. 

When we first started dating we were both 21 and our physical relationship moved slowly. She was not accustomed to being physically intimate, and was very shy and reserved. Despite that we had a spark of physical passion. We would spend hours kissing, and grinding with clothes on. This was great at first, but it was weeks before our shirts even came off. One night though we got a bit tipsy, everything came off, and we came close to having sex. She stopped it, but after that things were a little bit more loose. It came out that the idea of sex scared her very much. To her it seemed painful, dangerous (pregnancy wise), and against her religious morals. The latter part I didn't fully comprehend at the time. It seemed more like she just needed to get comfortable with being physical, and with the idea of having sex, rather than something she was actively against doing. Though very recently she has told me that she had thought she would wait until marriage up until the night we first had sex. 

At this point in our relationship (about two months in) we became long distance (a 6 hour drive apart). Meanwhile our intimacy was still moving slowly. We would play around a bit under the clothes, but I would always be the driver if that makes sense. It was also very inconsistent, and she often would not want to do anything at all despite not having seen me for weeks. It seemed like any little thing would turn her off, stress, fear for lack of sleep, etc. I became very frustrated during this time. I thought that she enjoyed it, since when we did do things we were very passionate. So I pushed her. I thought that I could try to encourage her to try new things, and she would quickly realize that she enjoyed it despite it previously seeming scary. This was a huge mistake, and I regret it deeply. She did start to try new things, but I was constantly making her feel deeply uncomfortable. She wanted to do things of her own accord and pace. She would try something because I wanted it, but then feel bad about herself for giving in and not being the sole commander of her body. I didn't realize that she was having these feelings at the time, though I did know that she was sometimes uncomfortable and that upset her. So I toned it down, but continued to try to encourage her within her comfort level. This went on for about six months. However, one night we were both drunk, all over each other, and ended up spontaneously having sex. This was pretty much the worst for her I think, and I feel awful about it. I wasn't trying to take advantage of her, she was all for it at the time. I hope that had I been more sober I would have stopped her and had us pick up the next day if she still wanted to. Shortly after she went away for the summer, for an internship in another country. I just want to take a moment to say that otherwise our relationship was developing nicely, and we were becoming close. The sex problem definitely affected us, but not to the point where it soured the relationship. Anyway, midway through her internship (after I tried to initiate skype sex), she opened up to me about the extent of her feelings on this subject. I learned that she felt continually pressured, and like nothing she did (in bed) was, or ever would be, good enough for me. This was the start of a conversation that is still going on basically. I felt awful about how she had been feeling, and wanted to change it. Simultaneously though, we still had the problem of having clashing sexual personalities, so it was not necessarily so straightforward to fix it. Implicit in all of this, was that if we couldn't fix it then we couldn't be together...which we both very much wanted. Regardless of finding a long term solution, I knew that I needed to change how I treated her.

I immediately stopped trying to encourage her to try new things, and instead tried to focus on repairing the damage that I did, and help her be comfortable again. It was difficult for me not to express desire to her, and it was difficult for her to even talk about the subject. The progress was pretty slow for a few months, but she started to feel much better during that time. I eventually broached the topic and admitted that I wanted more, but only if it were within her comfort zone. Of course this backfired, but lead me to an important conclusion. I decided that I either needed to give her full control, or I couldn't be for her. I wanted to be as supportive and respectful of her as she deserves, but I couldn't be constantly waiting for progress and getting my hopes up at the same time. So I needed to either accept that we won't be having indefinitely... even up to a year or so, or else walk away. I went to visit her and told her that I had decided to give her full control, that I just want her to feel comfortable with me, and do things only if they come completely from within. This worked wonders. I had no expectations, but sometimes I would test the waters by sticking a fraction of a pinky toe in. Essentially I gave her all the power, and then gradually learned what control I could take back so that she had what she wanted, while I wasn't left with nothing. We built up trust this way, and built a sexual relationship where we were both much more comfortable. It was grueling, and required a lot of self control on my part, but it worked. A little over our one year mark we began having sex, infrequently at first, but then a bit more regularly. 

The next summer (1.5 years) we had a period of two months where we just traveled and lived together. During this time our sex life took off, relatively speaking, and we were having sex 3-4 times a week. It was great. We were both comfortable with it, and it was really good sex. Then last September comes around, and we both entered grad school. She began to struggling with classes, and became depressed. I spent a lot of time with her, just consoling her and providing support. I didn't expect anything sexually, because I know she only wants to have sex if she feels happy, loved, and at ease. As any good partner would, I cared a lot more about how she was coping than our sex life. Meanwhile she started taking antidepressants, which apparently reduce sex drive. After the semester was over she took a leave of absence, and moved in with me. So now finally, for the current state of things, and what the problem is.

We currently have sex about once every two weeks or so. Sometimes more frequent, sometimes less. When we do have sex it is wonderful. It's always intimate and passionate, and highly mutual. I feel more comfortable with her than I have with anyone else. Afterwards we cuddle, and she talks about how she enjoyed it, and how nice ""this"" is. So what I don't get is, why doesn't she want to do it more frequently? I never pressure her anymore, and it's not something that's scary. It just seems like at baseline, she rarely has any inclination to initiate, despite always enjoying it immensely. When we do have sex it has to be the perfect combination that I don't fully understand. It can't be close to bedtime, because she gets anxious about getting enough sleep. She won't ever want to if there's anything else that she wanted to do (including just watching a tv show together). And most importantly she can't feel any amount of discomfort either physically or emotionally. I understand these things, but what I don't understand is why she doesn't want to even when the stars align. I am generally a physically affectionate person. I like to cuddle lots, but I want to be sexually intimate with her more often. A few times recently (in the past 3-4 months) I have brought this up to her. Once was not so tactful, and it upset her (for obvious reasons if you read the first part of this), but we talked it through and it was okay...though nothing really changed. Other times, have been more tactful, but similarly not very effective. However, tonight I brought it up and it felt quite different. It was as tactful as I could have imagined it being. I told her that I wanted to be more passionate with her, because it's something that we both love, and because I love to express my affection that way. I said that in no way do I mean to pressure her to do anything at a particular time. I told her that I've worked hard to try to make sure she always feels comfortable, and never pressured, and I don't want to lose that. Instead I asked if there's a way she could meet me somewhere midway, but only if there's a way that she can do that while remaining in her comfort zone, and only because this is something she enjoys too. The thing is though, that there's not. There's obviously not, because otherwise she would be doing it. She took it well this time, but is still disappointed. We're both going to mull it over, but I don't think there's much either of us can do. She can't do things that make her feel uncomfortable, and I can't suppress my desires. There was a period last summer where our sex life was great, but that was when we were carefree. Maybe if she stops taking the antidepressants it will get better, but life will still always be stressful. There will always be a 9am job, among other things. I can only imagine how it would be if we were married and had kids....pretty much never. We just have very different sexual personalities, despite clicking well in bed, and I don't see how they could ever not clash. I don't know what to do. I want us to work. We are really good partners, and I want to settle down and have a family with her. It's just really difficult to think that our sex life might only stay the same or go downhill from here. 

TL;DR: I have a wonderful relationship with my SO but we're very different when it comes to sex. We have great chemistry in bed and both enjoy it immensely, but she generally only wants to have sex a few times a month. It's always been a problem for us, and I'm not sure if it's capable of being resolved."

32ck8n,1,2015-04-12,Worth pursuing... again?,[deleted],dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/32ck8n/worth_pursuing_again/,"Back in freshman year, I was a weird kid. Gamer, sci-fi nerd, etc. plus I'm abnormally tall and was sort of fat at the time. Not the definition of 'cool'. Anyway, same year, I met a friend of a friend who I thought was really cute, but she was simply way too cool to consider for a relationship.

Through the years, we ran into each other at parties and whatnot. She stayed cool, but I was slowly closing the gap. Lost a ton of weight, started getting attention at parties, hosting my own. By the time I was in senior year, I was pretty confident that I had broken into the 'cool' zone (albeit at the bottom end).

Here's where things get painful. I'm asexual and it's been the bane of my dating life. I'm not a virgin or scared of sex, I just not driven to get laid every chance I get... and I can't make a 'move' to save my life. Ends up that mutual friends suspected this girl of also being asexual.

Whatever though, it was senior year, might as well give it a shot, I'll probably never see her again anyway. Went to a couple of parties together, had an actual date that I thought went well. We really got along and had common interests, talking was natural, lots of laughing... then it just sort of stopped. I have no clue why. It wasn't a breakup, because we were never together. We just stopped texting abruptly.

Fast forward to today (~1 year later), I graduated, got a good job, and moved away. I'm living in the 'burbs and sort of hating not being in a city. The lack of density makes it painfully obvious that I've been single for a long time.

This girl though... while we were close she mentioned getting an internship up here and wanting to eventually move to the area. For all I know, she graduated too and is working in the same city. Is it worth trying to contact her? If so how?

tl;dr: Met a girl 5 years ago, were close briefly 1 year ago (nothing physical), now we may or may not live in the same city. Worth pursuing?"

Krismötet ägde rum ikväll kl.19:00. Mötet gick inte så värst bra då ingen kom. Jag har försökt att få tag på medlemmar på skype, IRC och genom PM's men har inte fått några svar.

Desperation.

Jag postade lite tankar och funderingar i partiet som jag hade tänkt att ta upp på mötet. Om jag inte får något svar inom 24 timmar kommer jag att demokratiskt välja mig själv till partiledare.

Marxistiska Fronten
---

Hela denna kris uppstod då vi först förlorade några medlemmar som avgick från partiet. Dessa personer hade viktiga poster inom styrelsen och en av dem var ledamot. Vi ersatte de tomma styrelse platserna med personer som några dagar senare lämnade partiet för att bilda MF.

De förlorade ledamöterna är:

------
Myxopyxo - Avgår men lämnar sitt ägda mandat till V

Duplodocus

Foreverjew - Avgår men behåller sitt mandat

Beginner12345

Nikowned

Rafanen

Informalharpy - konto borttaget

------
De ""lediga"" talespersonsposterna är:

-----
Finanspolitisk talesperson - Golamaro oaktiv i 2 månader på reddit (inte bara modellV)

Försvarspolitisk talesperson - Informalharpys konto är borttaget

Kulturpolitisk talesperson - Avgång

Migrations- och integarationspolitisk talesperson - Avgång

Miljö- och Energipolitisk talesperson - Avgång

Näringslivspolitisk talesperson - Avgång

Utrikespolitisk talesperson - Avgång

------ 

Är jag sur för att folk lämnade V för MF? Nej, däremot är jag väldigt förvånad över vilket dåligt sätt de skedde på.

Och en vacker dag gick jag in på /r/modellV. Det var fem tråda som löd i stil med: 

""Hej då! Vi drar nu, lycka till!""

Jag hade länge vetat att denna ""splittring"" skulle ske, det har länge funnits underliggande politiska och personliga konflikter. Ärligt talat var själv sugen på att gå med i det nya partiet. Men när det skötts så osnyggt att man inte ens för en intern diskussion om varför splittringen sker och om partierna ska ha någon form av samarbete innan man lämnar så blir jag faktiskt lite sur.

-----

Framtiden
---

När jag blickar fram så vet jag inte hur detta kommer sluta. Jag tänker inte ge upp men det känns väldigt dystert att vara ensam på nio mandat, samtliga styrelseposter och alla talmansposter. 

Om jag i värsta fall slutar se ljuset i tunneln kommer vänsterpartiets mandat fördelas mellan S och Mp, men vi är inte där än. Tillsvidare kommer V att låna ut mandat till S och Mp som ska användas till gemensamma frågor.

Jaja, ingen har ens orkat läsa enda hit så det är nog onödigt att jag fortsätter skriva.

32cr4n,392,2015-04-12,Why'd You Give Me a Broken Mouse?!,macman0910,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/32cr4n/whyd_you_give_me_a_broken_mouse/,"So I've loved working on computers as long as I can remember.  At high school teachers regularly come to me to fix their tech and I'm set to be an intern at the tech department next year.  As expected, I'm also the ""computer guy"" for my entire family.

My Mom (M) tends to get angry pretty easily.  She had just gotten a new Dell laptop and wanted a regular mouse to use rather than the trackpad.  I had one lying around so I hooked it up for her and she was happy for at least month.  Then one day I get a call from her that went something like this:

&gt;Me: Hi Mom

&gt;M: Why would you give me a mouse that doesn't work!

&gt;Me: What? That mouse worked fine.  There's no way it just doesn't work now.

&gt;M: Well you gave me a broken mouse!  You better get me a new one!

&gt;Me: I'm on my way

I end the call and head down to her office.  She's sitting at her laptop with a frustrated expression on her face.

&gt;M: It won't move or anything!

So I jiggle the mouse a bit and sure enough nothing happens.  I wiggle my finger across the trackpad just to make sure it isn't frozen or anything and it works fine.  So I decide to simply unplug the mouse and plug it back in, thinking maybe Windows didn't recognize it or something.  I turn the laptop to unhook the USB cable, and that's where the problem is.  She had managed to jam the USB plug into the Ethernet port.

&gt;Me: Why is it hooked in to the Ethernet port?

&gt;M: The what?

I just hook it into the right port and tell her to never put it anywhere but there.

TL;DR USB Connectors don't go in the Ethernet port. *facepalm*"

I'm a 21 year-old, male college student, 5' 9"" and 167 lbs. I've been an asthmatic since I was about 10 years-old. I've been feeling odd the past few days. I was going to bed on Friday night at around 12:30 after going into New York City for an internship interview earlier that day. Feeling perfectly fine, I was just about to fall asleep when I suddenly felt this feeling of shortness of breath, which woke me up. Taking it for nothing at all, I tried again and a few minutes later as I was falling back asleep it happened again. I felt this immense feeling of panic (head pain, shortness of breath without actually being out of breath), which made the symptoms worse. The phenomena continued and I was unable to fall asleep until 3 am, and was required to wake up at 7:30 am the next morning.

On Saturday, I felt extremely tired (because of the lack of sleep) and had some neck stiffness and anxiousness. I felt as though my mind was racing and I wasn't able to stop it. Later on that day, I had this feeling of shortness of breath (without actually being short of breath) and spent a lot of time just focusing on my breathing. The neck pain stayed with me throughout the day and a felt like my thoughts were still a little cloudy. I tried relaxing by watching a movie, going to the gym (2.5 miles of running in 30 minutes) and hanging out with friends, but wasn't able to concentrate on anything but my symptoms, which made it worse. I went to bed last night at around 1 am and wasn't able to fall asleep until 2:15ish am after experiencing the same symptoms as the night before. I woke up briefly at 6:30 am, went back to sleep and woke up for work at 9:15. 

Today, I'm still feeling a bit anxious and focusing on my breathing. I still have some stiffness and tightness in my neck a feel a little bit like there's some pressure in my head. Also, my thoughts feel a little cloudy and my mind feels like it's racing - mainly because I think I'm focusing on the worst-case scenario for my symptoms. 

About three weeks ago, I had an anxiety attack for the first time ever in my life. It lasted about 10 minutes, but it just happened out of no where. I've been extremely stressed out this entire semester and have had little ""me time."" I'm currently working about 20 hours a week, interning 16 hours in New York, in school for 12 hours a week and studying the rest of the time. I'm going 7 days a week and I average about 5-7 hours of sleep per night. 

I've done some research on my symptoms and feel like I'm beginning to experience anxiety from all of the built up stress, but I'm not completely sure. Does anxiety just happen suddenly like that? I felt completely fine until Friday night.

I haven't had the chance to talk to my doctor yet about any of the symptoms I'm experiencing because she will not be in the office until tomorrow. I live about 1.5 hours from home so I will be giving her a call to (hopefully) speak with her about it tomorrow.

Any and all input and help would be greatly appreciated! "

I will be graduating next month and have been offered a great internship in Dublin. It's a month long and an opportunity I really can't turn down. 

Now the problem is I'm from the other side of the country and don't have any relations or anyone I can stay with. The chances of being kept on after the internship are 50/50 so I can't lock myself into a long-term lease. I don't care about where it is, the living circumstances or anything like that, I just need somewhere I can lay my head for the month as I will be concentrating 100% on the work. Has anyone got any suggestions? I mean are there diggs or anything around? All I ever hear are the horror stories of renting in Dublin so I'm worried I won't be able to find anywhere and will be left up shit-creek. "

So my question is - could you recommend me some project/s I could do to get back on track? For reference, earlier I've done (among other) some stuff using Qt, simple 2d platformer using SFML 2.1 and tons of algorithms.

32d1mu,9,2015-04-12,I accepted an internship and then was offered my first choice. Any advice? (At the same company),howdoesitallwork,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/32d1mu/i_accepted_an_internship_and_then_was_offered_my/,"Hi, all, thanks for reading.

I applied to a large company that a lot of people might like to work for just as a summer internship to complement my MS information systems type degree (I graduate next year). I got two interviews, one a week before the other.

For the first, I interviewed and was told I'd hear back in at most a week. I didn't hear back after a week. In the meantime, I got interviewed by another manager in their IT department for a different position.
I was offered that one right away, and I asked for a little time to think about it, to see if the other offer would come through. When it didn't, I accepted the second position.

This morning, (two days after I accepted the other, and more than a week after the first interview) I got an email offering me the first position. Either one is an honor, but the first position is much more in line with my career goals and training thus far.

My question is, in your opinion, should I stick with the second position that I've already accepted, or try to call and ask if I can switch to the first? The etiquette sounds kind of dicey here and I'd rather not create a bunch of ill will before I even step in the door.

I can provide more info if needed, but I'm trying to stay as low profile about this as possible (this is a throwaway account). They are both paid the same. They are both in the same building of the same company in the same (large) IT department. It's just that one is a better fit than the other, but its not the one I've accepted.

And I did not put in for these separately. The company has all IT interns put in on one application, and then different managers call who they like.

Please let me know what you think! Thank you for your time and perusal. :)"
32d77a,2,2015-04-12,"Help/Rant. First time posting. I dealt with anxiety in the past and was too scared to see anyone. Now that I feel better, I want to talk to someone, but still have doubts.",neon-,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/32d77a/helprant_first_time_posting_i_dealt_with_anxiety/,"Hello Everyone,

I subscribed to this thread around sometime in the winter of last year. I’ve never seen a therapist or psychiatrist so anything that I think about my self is self-diagnosed. I’m also 20 years old, and female.

Here are some things about me.

* I come from a very supportive and loving family. However I always feel the need to hide everything I am feeling. When bad/negative emotions come I hide them from my family. I feel guilty/ashamed of having these feelings when my life is good and I have a lot of positives in my life.

* In October I was diagnosed with Acid Reflux/GERDS and caused me a lot anxiety and distress. For weeks I would wake up crying, drive to school and cry, sleep and cry, shower and cry, basically a lot of crying. Then it got progressively worse after I read an article relating GERD to esophagus cancer. Then all I could think about for weeks was that I would eventually end up with cancer, and then dying. That feeling of impeding doom and the constant feeling that I was about to die at any moment took over.

* I was not allowed to drink alcohol or smoke anymore. The only thing that had ever given me relief from constant feeling of anxiety/nervousness/self-doubt/fear was now gone. I had no way to escape now.

* Around the same month, I had the absolute worst anxiety I have ever felt in my life. It lasted for about two months before subsiding. The anxiety I felt revolved around many disturbing and intrusive thoughts about my sexuality  suddenly changing, the possibility of losing my mind, and death. I couldn’t function normally. I would wake up and the thoughts would rush in, my stomach would sink, my body would shake, I felt disgusted with myself. I could barley eat due to nerves and could barley drive to school due to excessive crying on my way over there and back. I avoided sexual activity and intimacy, and avoided certain people and places. I went to the doctor the next morning  ended up breaking down and crying in the doctors office. The doctor prescribed my anti-anxiety meds and had me schedule an apt. with a psychiatrist. I never took the meds because I was scared to take them and I canceled my apt with the psychiatrist. Or I should say my anxiety canceled it. I was scared of opening up and being honest because I was scared that if I told the doctor about my intrusive thoughts she would think I was crazy and put my in an institution. I pictured everyone I loved leaving me, thinking I was insane, being disgusted by me, disappointed by me and of course not loving me anymore. I subscribed to this sub and saw I was not alone. 

* Somehow I started feeling better but I was suffering for about two months. Then I felt fine, but had another break in February. After watching one one my favorite youtubers, come out as bisexual, I told my self I was now bisexual. The anxiety that I felt due to these thoughts made me avoid sex with my SO (male), made me avoid my female friends, avoid TV shows with women, and social media because of the pictures my female friends would post of themselves.  I told myself I was BI and that the reason I had anxiety at the thought of this was because I was in denial, despite having never been sexually attracted to another woman. I told myself it did not matter and that one day I would end up with a woman and have to do sexual things to her even though it gave me deep anxiety/distress just thinking about it and not pleasure. NOTE: Fear or being Bi was not what I experienced in the prior months, I still will not share those thoughts with anyone

* Somehow these thoughts also subsided. It’s very strange how real those thoughts can feel once they stop. They seem so far-fetched and completely false, but when the anxiety is present it feels so real and fear inducing. 

* It’s been about a month or so and I have felt completely fine, and wonder how I could even feel that distressed at all. However, I know myself and know this it is possible for me to go through this again. I’ve had anxiety, and low self esteem for many years but always told myself I was fine.

* I am going to be doing an internship this summer away from home. I’ve never lived anywhere else other than my home for more than two weeks. I keep thinking that while I am over there I am going to have another break. I am scared of going through that again except this time I will be alone. Despite being in a good state of mind at the moment, I am scared that i could easily go back to the headspace.



So now..... The main reason I am posting is because I have always wanted to see a counselor about my issues, but I always tell myself that what I am feeling does not deserve to be felt. That whatever I have to say is not important enough to be heard, that whatever problems I have are not important enough to need fixing. That I just need to suck it up, bury it, grow up and move on. I feel that since I come from a loving and supporting home, that I have no reason to have these issues anxiety, low esteem, and self-doubt. I feel that since I am in a good headspace at the moment that I do not need counseling and that if I go I am only going because I want attention, or am trying to make something out of nothing, or that I am just being whiny or weak. I cannot give myself advice. But if I don’t vent/talk I feel like I will just get worse as I get older. There is a free counseling/psychological services program at my university but have not had the courage to set an appointment. My head is all over the place. Any advice on what I should do or anyone else ever have a similar situation?"
32d7f7,4,2015-04-12,Resources for broke extremely depressed people,Horrorphilic,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/32d7f7/resources_for_broke_extremely_depressed_people/,"Hello,

I had the initiative to post today because I'm at the end of my rope and feel I should reach out. I've been a pretty neurotic person my entire life, but these last 2-3 years have gradually been sending me spiraling out of control. Long story short, I've been treated like shit by a partner's family for a few years, have had no control over my life (don't even have my own room), no money to move out, and yet I have been working 40+ hours/wk (part time jobs and an unpaid internship hopefully for graduate work).

I'm at the point where I've had no will to live for the last year and the only thing that's kept me from killing myself is the fear of being found (and hospitalized, leading to way worse problems) and not being successful in my attempt. I am also very conscientious, so the idea of letting down my supervisor(s) at my internship really bothers me as well.

I have tried cheap methods like fish oil and exercise, but they can only do so much in a really toxic environment. I don't have a feasible way of moving out until next Fall at the soonest, and if I do this I will be ending a 5 year relationship with no support from anyone.

The only thing that keeps me going is the work I'm passionate in (which is why I have been doing the unpaid internship - which I love)  but until I reach a point where I can afford alternative places to live/new options in my life I am wondering if there are any resources I can consult for therapy and anti-depressant prescriptions. I have been forced to function quite high despite a lot of toxic people I'm surrounded with and having to save absolutely every penny from part-time jobs. 

My insurance is awful and I'd have an expensive co-pay, which is why I haven't been able to do this by myself. I know some places work on a sliding scale, but transportation is also difficult so I would only be able to go to the doctor once every two weeks or so. It's mostly the anti-depressants I need help with since a lot of the problems with my environment are completely out of my control (until the next few months, anyway) so talking about them doesn't help at all.

Thanks for listening, and any suggestions."

I'm new here. I'm 21 and have been smoking pretty much daily since 15. 

A few years ago I was on heavier drugs, but was able to clean myself up. I thought going back to smoking weed would be OK, but I've honestly found this habit so much harder to break than the harder drugs I was doing -- 'cause its harmless, right? 

Anyway, I'm about to graduate with a Bachelor's next month and I still don't have a job. My grades are good and all, and I have good internship experiences, but whenever I go into an interview I always mess up. This is why I stopped smoking. Whenever I've been smoking, I'm so much less articulate and I just can't seem to produce the words to match up with what I'm thinking. 

It's been only four days, but I think I'm already starting to feel better. For the first three days I was insanely irritable and wanted to start a fight with everyone I love over practically nothing. Typing this out is making me realize what a selfish person I am. Today I feel less irritable, but I've also become sick with a head cold so I still feel pretty shitty. Sleeping has been easier than I had anticipated it would be, which was a pleasant surprise. But, last night I slept for almost 12 hours, which I never do. I'm not sure if this was because of my head cold, quitting the weed, or a combination of both, but I feel markedly better (in terms of withdrawal symptoms) today despite still feeling pretty crappy from the cold. Maybe my brain started kicking up production of endogenous cannibinoids (sp?) last night? I don't know. 

I'm going to keep coming on here for the support. I typically start getting cravings at night before bed because, even when I had an off-day in the middle of smoking 3 times a day for weeks in a row, I would always smoke before bed.

I had the initiative to post today because I'm at the end of my rope and feel I should reach out. I've been a pretty neurotic person my entire life, but these last 2-3 years have gradually been sending me spiraling out of control. Long story short, I've been treated like shit by a partner's family for a few years, have had no control over my life (don't even have my own room), no money to move out, and yet I have been working 40+ hours/wk (part time jobs and an unpaid internship hopefully for graduate work).

I'm at the point where I've had no will to live for the last year and the only thing that's kept me from killing myself is the fear of being found (and hospitalized, leading to way worse problems) and not being successful in my attempt. I am also very conscientious, so the idea of letting down my supervisor(s) at my internship really bothers me as well.
I have tried cheap methods like fish oil and exercise, but they can only do so much in a really toxic environment. I don't have a feasible way of moving out until next Fall at the soonest, and if I do this I will be ending a 5 year relationship with no support from anyone.

The only thing that keeps me going is the work I'm passionate in (which is why I have been doing the unpaid internship - which I love) but until I reach a point where I can afford alternative places to live/new options in my life I am wondering if there are any resources I can consult for therapy and anti-depressant prescriptions. I have been forced to function quite high despite a lot of toxic people I'm surrounded with and having to save absolutely every penny from part-time jobs.

My insurance is awful and I'd have an expensive co-pay, which is why I haven't been able to do this by myself. I know some places work on a sliding scale, but transportation is also difficult so I would only be able to go to the doctor once every two weeks or so. It's mostly the anti-depressants I need help with since a lot of the problems with my environment are completely out of my control (until the next few months, anyway) so talking about them doesn't help at all.

Thanks for listening, and any suggestions."

32dapg,2,2015-04-12,[Budgeting] Being realistic with a budget when I am on my own for the first time,givemeataxbreak,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/32dapg/budgeting_being_realistic_with_a_budget_when_i_am/,"I am doing a 1+ year contract as an intern before I return to finish my degree, and this is going to be my first time living alone and living in a city. I want to be accurate with my estimated budget, and determine whether this is within my means.

**A few clarifications:**

* *Relocation:* Not an issue cost wise, I have some help on this one.
* *Loans*: As I'm still considered a student, I have access to student loans and do not need to make any payments yet.

**The Numbers (Monthly):**

**Gross monthly salary:** $3,840
*Take home estimate:* $2900

* Rent: $800
* Parking (yes, this sucks big time): $200
* Insurance: $200
* Gasoline/Car Costs: $200
* Electricity: $30
* Internet: $50
* Phone: $50
* Rent Insurance: $20
* Food: $300
* Home Supplies (e.g. toilet paper): $30
* Personal Supplies (e.g. Shampoo): $30
* Save: $500

Remaining cash: $490
Which I would probably use for either entertainment, or things like clothes. This number is a little bit high. I would probably put more into savings if I had that much remaining cash at the end of the month.

Do any of these numbers seem high/low? Am I missing anything critical? I would ditch the car if I could but I don't work in the city, and moving to where I work is *not* an option due to several factors. Electricity may seem a bit low, but that utility will be split with roommate.

Is this realistic or within my means? If there are any ways to save money, I will definitely try to maximize that: coupons, price matching, buying used, not having cable, etc."
32do6u,1,2015-04-12,My 1 week report - feeling better than ever!,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/32do6u/my_1_week_report_feeling_better_than_ever/,"Good evening, my dearests,

this is my first post here. I'm not quite adapted to the vocabulary and terms used by the fellow fapstronauts, so excuse me if I say something wrong or out-of-context.

I stumbled across this sub last Saturday. Being a PMO addict, I couldn't get to sleep at night without it. I read a couple articles here and on the web, and decided to give it a try.

My last PMO was on Sunday, 05/04. One week later, I feel really good. In fact, I'm feeling better than I've felt for the last couple months, maybe years.

I feel positive effects with the so described clear mind and focus. But, more than that, I've noticed I'm taking a different approach to both my job and my studies. 

I have an internship in an attorney office, and study on Law Uni at night. My daily routine consists of 6 hours of work, around 4 of classes and a 1-2 more hours of writing petitions when I get home at night. I guess being tired and busy all-day used to be the excuse I gave myself to being satisfied with PMO.

Today, I see I couldn't be any more wrong that that.

One important thing to do as soon as you decide to engage on NoFap is to change your mentality completely. That, for me, meant assuming a new on social interaction personal image. 

On day 1, Monday, I wore my best best suit and tie. I'm not in a good shape at all, but this one set of clothes makes me feel extraordinarily well-dressed. Everyone has a similar set of clothes, so make sure you wear them on your first day.

On Monday afternoon, I decided to do something I hadn't done in the last 2 years. I invited a girl I met a while ago to the movies. We've had nothing too serious before that, but on the few times we talked to each other I saw we had that good attraction to one another. Try and invite someone out on the first day, even if it means to invite a completely random stranger for a coffee or beer after work. Nothing special happened on the cinema, but we decided to meet in a party Friday.

Days 2 and 3 were amazing. The confidence and overall happiness you get from being clean override any potential urges. Since I used to stay awake much past my normal sleeping time just to PMO, I ended up sleeping earlier and having a much better quality of rest.

On Thursday, I had to use the panic button. After a long stressful day, I got home and was on the brisk of committing an error. Gladly, after some inspirational images and a Reddit post telling me to go do something else to keep the mind busy, I went to the kitchen, made myself a cuppa and went to sleep with no guilt.

On Friday (day 5), I went out with this girl from earlier this week. I repeat, I hadn't had a girl for the last 2 years. But, anyway, with the enourmous amount of confidence, I had an amazing time with her.

Yesterday was racing-day with the guys. On the pub we were at, I was able to notice a lady giving me the eye. I'm not sure if ""superpowers"" should happen this early, but I think I would definetely not notice that girl if I wasn't doing NoFap.

Today, I stayed at home all day and watched a couple movies. Surprisingly, had no need or urge to PMO. On a normal Sunday-at-home, I would have already.

In the long run, I plan to start working out, stop drinking soda and reduce the amount of League I play (gods damn this game, I've wasted too much time on it. One match a day sums up to almost a whole day in the month!).

Last but absolutely not least, thanks for you all, with your endless support and help. You guys are great. Thanks for showing a unique way to improve myself!

TL;DR: 1 week after, I'm feeling good. Had a big shift in social life. Will continue the reboot. You guys are amazing!"

The moderation team is once again looking to fill an intern mod position at /r/RateMyMayor. If you’re interested in helping us out with the day-to-day operations of the extended family of *Animal Crossing* subreddits, please read on!

*Please note that we will not be accepting applications from new users. We are only looking for active members of the community in good standing.*

---

**What does being an intern entail?**  
We’re going to be honest with you upfront: it isn’t the most exciting job in the world. Broadly speaking, this is a clerical position. You will start out by handling the Request Your Mayor thread on a daily basis, processing all requests and adding them to the Find A Mayor Index. You will also process requests for updates to existing RMM threads via modmail. Once you are comfortable with that, we'll train you on counting reviews in order to process new threads for mayors who have been archived. It’s counting, copypasta and knowing the alphabet.

There is room to grow in this position, and as you demonstrate ability and willingness, we will discuss giving you more responsibility, first on RMM and then perhaps into a promotion to full moderator on one of our subreddits. A few of our current moderators are former interns!

**What’s in it for me?**  
This position is for someone who already loves being part of our community and wants to do more to help us out. You will gain insight into how the community operates and how all three subreddits work together, and you will be able to discuss behind-the-scenes issues with the moderators. Basically, if the job itself isn’t reward enough for you, it isn’t for you.

---

**REQUIREMENTS**

* Ability to follow and apply rules.
* Good clerical skills such as alphabetizing and spelling.
* A keen eye for detail.
* Availability on a daily basis to handle the tasks assigned to you.
* Ability and willingness to communicate with the moderation team regularly and clearly.
* Ability to check in with us in IRC at least periodically.
* Exemplary history of active participation within the community.
* A genuine willingness to learn and to help, not just the moderators but the entire community.

**We also STRONGLY recommend that you are able to access Reddit through a PC or Mac on a daily basis and already use, or are willing to use, Reddit Enhancement Suite. Some aspects of the job range from annoying to impossible if you are tethered to a mobile platform and cannot or will not use RES.**

I'm now a junior CS major.

So anyway, all my previous internships over the summer have been closer to the EE side of the spectrum, but I got two pretty good offers this summer than stood out to me more than the other three offers I got (the other three were not very competitive in salary and were not very well known companies):

* First offer is for a well known telecom company in the bay area. Position title is RF &amp; Network engineer intern. Pay is competitive at &gt;$30/hr. Company is well known but from reading GlassDoor apparently lay off a good amount of people every year. I have absolutely no idea what my internship would consist of over the summer since they haven't told me what project I'd be working on.

* Second offer is a medium sized software company in the bay area that mostly deals with enterprise databases. Pay is also &gt;$30/hr, and $5 more per hour than the above offer. Job title is simply software engineer intern. My project will be mostly working on getting around data transfer bottlenecks that currently exist in their software in order to increase productivity. The interview was pretty damn difficult and the manager that I would have if I accepted this one said they use a ton of stuff from algorithm analysis and data structures classes so I should come prepared.

I honestly have no idea which of the two would be better in the long run, since I switched to CS so recently. Which of the two do you guys think would look best on my resume in the long run and would help me secure a good job when I graduate next year?

Thanks so much for the help guys!"

I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

My GPA, at around 3.4, isn't terrible or anything but I feel like I retain absolutely nothing from past classes. I can't even begin to think about solving basic problems regarding op-amps, RLC circuits, transistors, etc. My concentration was embedded systems so I feel like I know how to read data sheets, put different digital components together, and do basic coding, but that's about it really.

To make the matter a bit more confusing, I'd had a web development phase and spent a lot of time working on my personal web application projects. My only internship was in this field as well so most EE companies would probably look at my resume and think of me as someone who wants to do web/software development.

I'm not sure what to do. When I look up most jobs I qualify for (EE/hardware), I feel like I have no chance of passing technical interviews. I royally suck at data structures &amp; algorithms so the software side is out of the picture as well.

I'm just blindly applying to general engineering positions but haven't had any luck so far. Was anyone in similar positions? What should I aim for?"

32e6ek,1,2015-04-12,(CAD) Am I a Good Candidate for Leasing?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/32e6ek/cad_am_i_a_good_candidate_for_leasing/,"Hi PF! I have a question about whether I may be better off leasing (I know the general PF attitude is buy a used car and drive it into the ground, but bear with me). 

I'm looking at leasing a new (2015) Focus ST. Until now, I've purchased all of my cars either used or dealer demos, upfront with cash. I'm currently driving a 2013 Hyundai Veloster which is paid off, that I bought in somewhat of a rush because my sister was in need of a car at school for getting to/from work placements. 

Some background information:

* Dealership is offering my $12,700 for my trade in
* I tend to trade/buy a new car every 2-3 years. I realize this is not smart from a financial perspective but I make decent money and love cars
* I drive around 25,000 km (~15,500 miles) a year

I'm looking at a 36 month lease, with a monthly payment of $394.88/month and $19,452.63 (after tax) buyback at the end. I can trade my car in, use $2700 of it's remaining value as a down payment, and get a cheque for the other $10,000, which would cover the first 26 months of payments (and could sit in my account earning interest until needed). If I were to lease it and then buy it out at the end of the lease I'm looking at a total cost of $36,867, or about $900 over MSRP for this vehicle (I may be able to reduce this).

I have two semesters left until I graduate (May of next year), but am on an internship until this September. I have enough in savings right now to cover all of my school and living costs until I graduate, and will be continue to put away $1000/month until I head back to school later this year. 

Am I crazy for considering doing this? It seems safe enough financially as I'll have cash on hand to cover the lease payments until long after I graduate, I don't have any debt, and once I'm done school I can expect to make anywhere between $60,000 and $70,000 a year to start. OTOH, I may be counting my chickens before they hatch and should just deal with the car I have now (which I don't really like) for another 12 months until I graduate and am in a more permanent job.

My OCD manifested much later in life, during 4th year veterinary school to be precise. I am now a veterinarian with a crippling fear of infectious diseases. I worry about contracting these diseases myself and bringing them home to my pets. After my internship, my symptoms became severe. I finally sought medical attention and was diagnosed with OCD. I have received therapy and was started on SSRI. With CBT and medication, I was able to get my symptoms under control after about 5 months. I felt I was well enough to start work again and joined a small animal practice. Within 6 months, my symptoms returned with a vengeance and I am now struggling to get through each day. I am still going to therapy and on medications. I have also gone to support groups but have found it very frustrating since I have not found someone with a similar situation with whom I can talk.

I am reaching out in hopes that I may find someone else who suffers from contamination OCD and works in the medical field. How do you deal with it? Is it possible for someone with this condition to function as a veterinarian? Since my OCD manifested at 26 and already in veterinary school, pursuing another career choice was not an option.

I currently use a Lamy Safari (F nib) with Iroshizuku Kon Peki, I'm currently in college studying math, so I write notes all day. Also, I landed an internship in finance and as you may know, you are always writing down important stuff.

I'll start using Leuchtturm 1917 medium sized notebooks, you may find that info helpful.

So, what I'm looking for is (in the following priority order):

1. Great ink capacity: my Lamy currently uses the standard converter (no idea of its capacity) and I really need something bigger, since every day I use 2/3 of said capacity. I hate constantly having to refill.

2. A finer nib: As stated, currently I'm using Safari's F nib, which I find a bit wide while writing small numbers, also I write in cursive. Anything finer than the nib in question will be gladly appreciated. Consider also the size of the paper of Leuchtturm notebooks, I'll need to stuff a lot of info in small pages.

3. Obviously, great ink flow: specially with Kon Peki, I'll be using that ink for a while since I have a bottle an a half of it. After that I plan on using other Iro inks.

4. Professional, yet not flamboyant look: this one is not that important, but consider that I'll use this pen in college classes AND in meetings with important firm members.

Regarding price, anything from 0 to $150 (or even $200) will be nice. I'm not looking for a Holy Grail pen.

Thanks for any help you can provide!"

A little while ago, I posted asking for internship alternative options and many people were kind enough to reply. Well fortunately, it seems I have two offers on my hand and I am in a position to choose.

I can either go with a big name company whose internship opportunity is within my field or either with a startup company whose internship opportunity lies more in line with what I want to do in the future. Both are paid opportunities which I was a bit surprised about but I'm more than that. I'm curious to see reddit's opinion of what one should be considering to make a proper decision. "
32ekpw,1,2015-04-12,I need cat advice,SpleeBeans,cats,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/32ekpw/i_need_cat_advice/,"I know this is mostly a cat-picture subreddit, but I figured you guys would know the most about cats and the cost of them and such.

So I'm 21F, my boyfriend is 22M, and our daughter is 2. We're moving in together about 3 hours north. Boyfriend's parents are moving with us.

His parents have two cats, one of which is an elderly female and the other is a 4 year old male named Gizmo. Gizmo and the female don't get along very well at all. Gizmo will attack the other cat and he's just mean. He is, however, very gentle and affectionate with people, especially with my daughter. She can be rough with him but he just loves it, sometimes even seeking her out. 

He has his claws and, while he doesn't scratch people, he scratches everything else. Their couches are all scratched up, the door frame leading to the basement is ruined, he gets caught scratching the TV stand all the time. They have a kitty scratching post that doesn't seem to be enough for him. His claws are never trimmed because he gets thrash-y when they try. And believe me, these are big, strong guys trying to clip this cat's claws. It's impossible and they've given up. He is NOT up to date with vaccinations, and apparently hasn't been to the vet since he was fixed. His parents justify this because he's an indoor cat. I don't know how accurate that statement is when it comes to vaccinations. 

My boyfriend's parents have decided that they aren't taking him up when they move because he's mean to the elderly cat and they believe it will be nearly impossible to find an apartment that allows two cats and a dog. They're planning on giving the cat to a family friend.

My boyfriend is really upset over this. He loves the cat. Our daughter loves the cat. He wants to bring the cat with us in the new apartment.

I have some issues with it. Mostly funds. We'll both be young parents, living on our own for the first time. Cats are expensive and this one is way behind in his shots which we might have to prove when we move into an apartment. Then there's any future vet bills if the cat gets sick or there's an emergency. I know my mom spent over $6000 on my childhood cat when his liver suddenly failed. Then there's the day-to-day costs, such as food and kitty litter. Me and my boyfriend work practically minimum wage jobs. The only way we're going to be able to live on our own is because of the loans I get from going to school and $20,000 in trust-fund money I got after my dad passed away. We won't have much of an emergency fund, especially when I still have at least 2 more years of school PLUS a year long unpaid internship afterwards. Boyfriend might also go back to school.

His nails are issue number two. He's ruined the door frames of the house. I don't want to get him declawed because not only can we not afford that, I also think it's cruel. I know that there are those rubber covers, but I'm apprehensive about it because I don't know if they'll work on him and his owners don't seem to want to try it out. So if we take the cat as-is, I know he'll rip up the furniture and the apartment and we'll lose whatever security deposit we may have.

He also has long hair, which is just a mess. That's more of an inconvenience than a huge sticking point, though.

My last, not as important point is how he acts with other cats. He attacks the elderly cat he lives with now and they have to be separated during the night or else they fight. He's also a young cat. I feel like if we take him, we won't be able to get another cat until he dies, over a decade from now.

Reasons to have him is that he's a good cat. He's practically a dog. My boyfriend can wrestle with him. My daughter lies her head on him like he's a pillow. My daughter just loves him. None of the other cats in our two households really care for her, so having a cat she can pet regularly is just the best part of her day. He is practically *her* cat. And she's unfortunately at that age where she's making and holding onto long-term memories. I feel like taking the cat away from her would be just so devastating. [Here's a year-old picture of the two of them.](http://imgur.com/XJA5Rgg) But at the same time, I feel it would hurt even more if we brought the cat with us, realized he was too expensive/too damaging, and had to give him away then.

I don't know what to do, guys. I would love any input. Thank you.

32eqy2,7,2015-04-13,I (21F) don't even know what do anymore..

I think my dad is a narcissist. I read the link on the narcissistic fathers and so many of those things are applicable to him. The usual, long-time-lurker-first-time-posting-here.

I just got accepted into a fantastic college and will be transferring from a shitty community college at the end of September. I am up for a promotion at work from a student intern to a full-time employee and will get a significant pay raise as a result. I have these amazing things going on for me in my life, but he just has a way of making it completely inadequate. I am having a hard time staying positive/happy but he sucks the life from me. I need help coping with this until I can get my ducks in a row and out of this hell hole. 

Here's a little back story (warning - wall of text) : 

I used to be the GC. I am the youngest child of four by quite a few years. I was ""daddy's little girl"" until he started to forget me. He has literally forgotten me. He was too busy drinking and talking to his friends while selling off the last of his merchandise (he was a tool salesman and quit for health reasons) and never picked me up from school. I was six. He did this on numerous occasions. My mom worked in a bank and it was really difficult for her to leave to bring me home from school. He still confuses my sister and I as well... We're nine years apart and completely different personality wise. She gets called my name and I get called her name all the time.

When I was seven, my birthday present was ballet lessons. I loved it, that was probably the only nice thing my father has EVER done for me. It was my escape, I was so happy in ballet. My mom still likes to say that I was dancing before I could actually walk (I used to watch this Irish river dancing video all the time as a toddler and would mimic their movements). He became a deacon/reverend and would go to the local jails and prisons to preach as his job. My sister is the first person out of my siblings to be abused by him. On a regular basis, he would tell her that she was a worthless piece of shit and that the kids in juvie were better than her. And he wonders why she turned to drugs, sneaking out, and rebelling so much... 

As I got older, he became emotionally abusive with me.  I was fourteen and we got in a screaming match. That was one of the last times I actually stood my ground against him... I miss having that courage... He was going to force me to work at his restaurant for ten hours. I got mad at him and said I wasn't going to spend my summer doing that, especially unpaid. I can't remember much else about that fight unfortunately.

Every little argument would lead to him talking about me behind my back. My bedroom is located next to my parents' bedroom and we share a very thin wall (I can hear my mom's mouse sneezes, the walls are so thin). He would say all of these horrible things about me to my mom. She would just sit there and not say anything. On a regular basis, I would hear how worthless and arrogant I am. He would call me ungrateful because I spoke my opinion that didn't agree with his.

I tried asking permission one night during dinner to go to a friend's house. I tried explaining everything and he would talk over me and kept saying, ""YOU'RE NOT TELLING US EVERYTHING. WHY ARE YOU NOT TELLING US EVERYTHING."" I tried to keep my cool (hard to do as a hormonal fifteen year old) and said, ""Well, if you would quit interrupting me, you would get all of the details. Are you going to let me finish explaining first?"" Because of that, being interrupted is my BIGGEST pet peeve. That is unfortunately one of my FLEAS as well... I'm trying really hard to stop that habit now.

I know I have posted about this before, but a few years ago, he had his knee replaced. I was watering some plants after dinner for my mom because she asked me to so she could try to sleep off her headache (she gets severe headaches and I have inherited them from her). My dad asks me to get him a pop-sickle. I tell him, ""Just a second, I am almost done watering the plants for Mom."" He proceeds to get up and yell at me, saying, ""you are the most selfish, spoiled, ungrateful piece of shit I have ever met."" I stutter and try to tell him I was going to get the pop-sickle for him in a minute and he tells me, ""just shut the fuck up."" I ran upstairs to my room and had a crying fit for a while. He would actually get angry with me when I would start to cry due to his words.. I still have an issue about crying in front of people thanks to that. I am still trying to work on that.

I was an idiot a couple of years ago and agreed to work for him as a paid server. He would use me as his verbal punching bag at work. He would yell at me over other people's mistakes in front of the other employees. One of them actually took me outside to help calm me down because I could not stop crying. 

Every. Single. Day. He would yell at me about everything. Out of tea? It's GlitteryCupcakePanda's fault! The produce company didn't have romaine? GlitteryCupcakePanda's fault! I would write down everything we were low or out of. He would lose the notes and blame me. His anger issues are really bad too - he would be screaming obscenities at the restaurant, and actually called a customer the ""c"" word while she was in ear-shot. My brother also works for him. He was never verbally abused until I left the restaurant. My brother, whom I'll call T, would always tell me to just stop arguing back to my dad, that I needed to keep my head down and just not talk back. He didn't understand how horrible our dad really was until T was getting the abuse. He actually apologized to me a few months after I left (I got a new job, my current internship). T told me he never really understood how my dad would behave and treat me and was sorry about the advice he gave. T realized how truly awful our dad was. T was the GC while I lived at home despite his drug problems (he has gotten clean, is back in school, turning his life around, and we have an awesome relationship now).  

It doesn't help that my dad is a closet alcoholic - he would spike his coffee and have a glass of wine going all day long. His travel mug still wreaks of alcohol today (over two years later) and claims to not drink as much any more. He would get so belligerently drunk that I was scared when he got behind the wheel. I worked at the restaurant on the weekends when they were really busy while in high school (I was never given an allowance, I had to work for my money and only got a tip-out from the servers). I didn't get my license until I was almost nineteen (my parents wouldn't take me out driving to teach me, and it took FOREVER to get them to help me on the weekends. My boyfriend basically taught me to drive) and would use ""Can I drive? I need to practice for my license test"" as an excuse so he wouldn't get behind the wheel.

Today, I almost got in an accident. I came home really angry because it was such a near miss. I slammed on my breaks to prevent a collision (I had the right-of-way at an intersection, went to make my turn, and this ass hole speeds up to cut me off and almost hits me). My mom asks me what's wrong. I tend to be really loud when I'm angry (yet another FLEA) and dropped ""fuck"" a lot as I'm telling her what happened. He then tells me that I have no right to be angry. I shouldn't get so upset. This only makes me more angry. HE IS DICTATING HOW I SHOULD FEEL. I leave, go to my room, and an hour later, he barges into my room. He then has the audacity to tell me to never yell at him and take my anger out on him (hypocrite much?). He goes on about how I should manage my anger. I'm laying on my bed, clenching my teeth, trying to not say anything. If I address his behavior, he denies it and tells me to shut up. He can't do anything wrong apparently... I try to bite my tongue because he takes his anger out on my mom a lot of the time if I speak up.

He is the biggest hypocrite I have ever met. He exaggerates so much and it pisses me off. I just don't know what to do anymore. He invalidates my feelings on a regular basis. I tried having a serious conversation with him about my depression and anxiety. His reaction? ""I don't want to hear about it. Smile and get over it."" I am having a conversation with my mom, ""Enough, I don't want to hear about this."" I WASN'T EVER TALKING TO YOU, DOUCHE. 

I asked my boyfriend's dad the first weekend of March (so about six weeks ago) if my cat, Tessa, and I could live with them. I explained that my dad is really abusive (not a whole lot of detail, boyfriend chimes in saying he hates my dad and wants me out of there ASAP) and I need out of there. He still hasn't give me an answer yet. My boyfriend and I will broach the topic again and tell him EVERYTHING and why I need out so badly. He initially told me ""no"" over a year ago when we realized we couldn't afford our apartment any more (roommate left, we had a lot of issues with him unfortunately) because he hates cats. I am not going to abandon my cat and shove her off onto my mom. She is my emotional support animal, she is my cat, my responsibility. I have had her since she was three months old and she just turned two. When he said, ""I vowed to never live with a cat again,"" I got up from the table and cried in the bathroom. He didn't know at the time (and still doesn't fully know) how horrid my dad is. I hope with my explanation, he will see how toxic this environment is for me and will let me and Tessa in. We have thought of many compromises to accommodate each other and he seemed to like our ideas. 

I guess what I am looking for is advice on how to deal with him in the interim. I limit my contact with him as much as possible as is. I give minimal details when I answer his questions. He still finds a way to make me feel like worthless garbage on a daily basis. He has basically destroyed all of the progress I made in therapy a year ago. I think I need to go back because my suicidal thoughts are back (I'm still on antidepressants) but my insurance was accidentally cancelled (dad called to get himself removed from the plan under mom's name because he is on disability and is on medicare now, they cancelled the whole plan instead leaving my mom and I uninsured).

32er5t,1,2015-04-13,The College Dilemma.,lucky0225,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/32er5t/the_college_dilemma/,"Age 17. Gonna graduate high school soon, got a super hectic week this week. Internship interview, senior project presentation, scholarships, scholarships, scholarships, CAP presentation. I'm trying to find money for college and i'm at an extremely huge dilemma and here it is.

For a little background on me:

My family, which consists of my parents, my older brother(20), and I, are super close. We all get along and do fun things together, however, i'm kind of, ""the odd one out"" in a way. My parents and brother have a passion for aviation, I really don't (planes are cool but not super duper cool). My parents love shooting and I think it's fun every now and then but the money my dad spends on guns i'd be spending on cars. My brother and dad have a very different taste in cars then I do. I like a lot of things that the rest of my family could care less for. I'm quite sheltered in a way, my parents track where i'm going via my cell phone, don't really let me out with friends much, if I ask to go out with friends I get ""interrogated,"" however if they've met the friend I want to hangout with they're totally fine with me hanging out with them. If I say I'm hanging out with dudebro1 at the mall and decide at the mall that we want to go to dudebro1's house, I have to call my parents and explain what we are doing. I don't really tell my parents much about my life, I talk to my brother about that. My brother and I are super close and tell each other pretty much everything. If I want my parents to know about something that is going on in my life I usually tell my brother and hint at him to tell my parents. 

I currently attend a specialized high school. It's a small 400 person grade 9-12 STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Math) high school with about 20% of the students female (10% of which are......not the most pleasing to the eye). I don't make decisions based off of how many hot girls are there, but if I was offered 2 identical high schools and one had hot girls, I'd pick that one. The rest of the school is pretty nerdy and 50% of the school is on the robotics team because my school has no sports, which isn't a bad thing (except the sports) but if it was a sunny bright day outside, at lunch time I would be outside and everyone else would be inside having a Minecraft LAN party so they just aren't my group of people, I have about 4 true friends at my high school, they are the more social ones and love cars as much as I do. I didn't do well throughout my 4 years. I am going to graduate with a 2.9, maybe a 3.0 GPA with a 1620 SAT an 24 ACT. Now why did I go here? Because the high school has some kick ass opportunities. I got my first job at Boeing as a paid summer intern through the school, I bet the president of commercial airlines at Boeing and many other great people through the school who have helped me out greatly, so it was worth it.

Now onto the dilemma that's troubling me:

I want to study Business Entrepreneurship in college because my life goal is to become self-employed and fairly wealthy. I absolutely love cars and I am a very social person. I functional very poorly when I have little to no social interaction or a social life I guess you could say.

I want to attend Arizona State University because it is absolutely perfect. They have a fantastic business school, one of the top in the country, amazing social life (party school blah blah I don't party, I just like to be with social people and do outdoor drives and stuff), the gigantic 3 floor gym is about 200 feet away from my dorm so there is no excuse for me not to go to the gym, right next to the gym is 2 soccer fields for outdoor activities so I won't be stuck in my dorm, there is a huge student body to reach out to and so many people that I will undoubtedly make some good friends and make good connections, my future roommate is awesome and loves the same things as I do and so far it's perfect. I'm already talking to people that are attending ASU and everyone including me is super excited. 

My parents however, aren't that excited and this is where the perfectness of ASU stopped, at the tuition. It's currently $41,000 for the first year, and I got $0 in scholarships and grants from Arizona State University. I'm currently applying to over 100 scholarships each at least $1,000 So that I can help cover the cost.

Now the university my parents want me to attend is the same university my brother is attending, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. The problem with this university is, the student body is pretty my my high school on a college level. Same nerdy kids, same aviation focused anti-social people (I'm generalizing here, but you get the idea of what the student body is mostly like). The university is small and they don't currently offer Business Entrepreneurship. If I go there I would be studying Aviation Business Administration. Again, planes are cool, but not that cool, at least for me. The campus is small and a little run down because they got it from another college, the dorms, well, here's the thing, if I go to ERAU then I wouldn't even be staying at the dorms. My brother currently lives off campus and I would be staying in his condo. So most of the time it would be school-homework-sleep-repeat and I cannot function like that. Now why would I go here? Well, tuition is $43,000 a year at ERAU and they gave me $7000 in scholarships. Also, my high school and ERAU have a very good relationship and they just offered 1 senior from my high school a $30,000 a year scholarship to attend ERAU. My parents made me jump right on that. However, the senior who gets that must maintain a 3.0 GPA THE WHOLE TIME while at the university. Not once may it dip under for a semester end. See how well I did in high school? I don't believe that I will do well at ERAU with the minimal social life and I don't know how well I will do with the academics. Also the car culture is like 10X smaller than ASU and that kinda sucks. It's also probably worth mentioning that my Mom just joined the Parental Advisory board at Embry-Riddle because she absolutely LOVES the school and the city. I don't like the city. It's small, and the only kids there are college kids because ERAU is literally smack dab in the middle of a retirement community while ASU is right next to Phoenix, where all the events and excitement happens! 

I also want to start my own business in college which I am currently in the process of starting up. How can I sell to anti-social kids who won't give a fuck about my product while I can benefit from the ASU kids who went there just to party?

I need social interaction not only because i'm a social person but it allows me to reach out to my friends for help academically. If the professor explains a process i'm super confused about, one of my friends can dumb it down to make it so much easier to understand, and I have so much more of that at ASU than ERAU.

So I need to decide which college to go to. My parents are reallyyyy pushing me towards ERAU because of the financial incentive, however, I just don't think i'll do well there. It's a good school, but not for me. Also, everytime my parents have pushed me towards a decision, i've always retaliated and gone with the other choice because of the ""pushing."" Not sure if that's a huge factor or not.

So yeah, that's what's going on in my life right now. Probably not as big as other people's lives though."

32euwz,1,2015-04-13,I messed up Reddit..... I can't lose her.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/32euwz/i_messed_up_reddit_i_cant_lose_her/,"Alright, I apologize in advance because this is going to be a long post because I will try to go into as much detail as possible.

In September 2013, a good friend of mine introduced me to his girlfriends roommate and we really hit it off together. By the month of December, we decided to start dating despite the fact that we live a 2 hour dive away from each other (I own a car and she would bus down to see me). We would see each other on average every weekend or ever 2nd weekend and every day we got to spend together was incredible. She was a full-time student and I was a part-time student working on pre-reqs to get into finance and both of us had a part time job. We had some fights (my temper escalates quickly in certain situations and I was seeing a therapist for help) some were worse than others but nothing was bad enough to tear us apart. This girl has one heck of a head on her shoulders and really takes the time to evaluate situations as I'm more of a deal with it in the moment kind of guy.

Now, fast forward to this semester (dec 2015) she is taking 5 classes, working 20 hours and leaves for a 3 month internship to South Africa in May. She's got a lot on her plate and I'm only taking one class this semester (the last pre-req i need) and working a part-time job at the same time. I have a lot of time on my hands, although I don't get to spend much time with her because she is really busy with work, school and training for the internship. At this time, she really needs lots of support and support is something that was kind of new to me and I didn't really know how to do it. I would say things like ""hope you're doing good on your paper"" or something like ""how's your paper coming along"" wight he occasional ""hang in there baby, it's almost over"". I recently found out that I was doing it completely wrong and that she had started to resent me for failing to support her in the ways she needed. With her being really busy, we started to lose communication and seemed to put each other to the side a little. The fact that I wouldn't hear much from her kind of worried me and I was starting to wonder if she still loved me and then this is where i started to overthink (forgot to mention that i am a BIG over thinker and it is not a good thing). This past Friday, I was coming back from a crash course (5 hours long)  it was around 11 pm and I thought it would be a good idea to call her so we could talk about what I was feeling. 

This is were it all went south. The conversation started off alright until we start talking about things that bother us, and how we feel we are not communicating as much as we should be. I'm going to say now that I had a session with my therapist 2 days before and I had talked to him about how I felt and his response was something along the lines of ""sometimes couples get too used to each other and the love kind of disappears but they stay together because they are scared of being alone"" and he had also mentioned that in those cases, its sometimes better to let them go if you want them to be happy (how cliche). This is where I messed up Reddit....

I told her what my therapist had told me about being afraid to be alone. My body was shaking, there was a BIG part of me that was telling me that I was about to make a big mistake but a small part of me just kept going and told her that she would no longer have to resent my lack of support because we would no longer be together. I mentioned that I loved her and I felt that for her to be happy I would have to break up. She then suggested that I come see her and we could talk about it. She would also ask if I was sure that I wanted to end things but I would stay quiet because it was not what I wanted. After having her ask me over and over if it was what I wanted, I said yes..... but the answer was no. She started to say that it was a great experience for her and that she did not regret any of it and then i cut her off (i was balling my eyes out and couldn't hear her thank me for this great experience because i did not want it to end) and i said that yes, we were done. 

5 minutes later... i realized what I had just done and instantly called her back to tell her that I don't know what I was doing. I let her know that I was confused with what my therapist had told me and that I shouldn't let him tell me how my relationship is going to be and that I actually want this relationship and that the past month has got me scared because we were not talking much and she was leaving for her internship soon.

In September 2013, a good friend of mine introduced me to his girlfriends roommate and we really hit it off together. By the month of December, we decided to start dating despite the fact that we live a 2 hour dive away from each other (I own a car and she would bus down to see me). We would see each other on average every weekend or ever 2nd weekend and every day we got to spend together was incredible. She was a full-time student and I was a part-time student working on pre-reqs to get into finance and both of us had a part time job. We had some fights (my temper escalates quickly in certain situations and I was seeing a therapist for help) some were worse than others but nothing was bad enough to tear us apart. This girl has one heck of a head on her shoulders and really takes the time to evaluate situations as I'm more of a deal with it in the moment kind of guy.
Now, fast forward to this semester (dec 2015) she is taking 5 classes, working 20 hours and leaves for a 3 month internship to South Africa in May. She's got a lot on her plate and I'm only taking one class this semester (the last pre-req i need) and working a part-time job at the same time. I have a lot of time on my hands, although I don't get to spend much time with her because she is really busy with work, school and training for the internship. At this time, she really needs lots of support and support is something that was kind of new to me and I didn't really know how to do it. I would say things like ""hope you're doing good on your paper"" or something like ""how's your paper coming along"" wight he occasional ""hang in there baby, it's almost over"". I recently found out that I was doing it completely wrong and that she had started to resent me for failing to support her in the ways she needed. With her being really busy, we started to lose communication and seemed to put each other to the side a little. The fact that I wouldn't hear much from her kind of worried me and I was starting to wonder if she still loved me and then this is where i started to overthink (forgot to mention that i am a BIG over thinker and it is not a good thing). This past Friday, I was coming back from a crash course (5 hours long) it was around 11 pm and I thought it would be a good idea to call her so we could talk about what I was feeling.
This is were it all went south. The conversation started off alright until we start talking about things that bother us, and how we feel we are not communicating as much as we should be. I'm going to say now that I had a session with my therapist 2 days before and I had talked to him about how I felt and his response was something along the lines of ""sometimes couples get too used to each other and the love kind of disappears but they stay together because they are scared of being alone"" and he had also mentioned that in those cases, its sometimes better to let them go if you want them to be happy (how cliche). This is where I messed up Reddit....
I told her what my therapist had told me about being afraid to be alone. My body was shaking, there was a BIG part of me that was telling me that I was about to make a big mistake but a small part of me just kept going and told her that she would no longer have to resent my lack of support because we would no longer be together. I mentioned that I loved her and I felt that for her to be happy I would have to break up. She then suggested that I come see her and we could talk about it. She would also ask if I was sure that I wanted to end things but I would stay quiet because it was not what I wanted. After having her ask me over and over if it was what I wanted, I said yes..... but the answer was no. She started to say that it was a great experience for her and that she did not regret any of it and then i cut her off (i was balling my eyes out and couldn't hear her thank me for this great experience because i did not want it to end) and i said that yes, we were done.
5 minutes later... i realized what I had just done and instantly called her back to tell her that I don't know what I was doing. I let her know that I was confused with what my therapist had told me and that I shouldn't let him tell me how my relationship is going to be and that I actually want this relationship and that the past month has got me scared because we were not talking much and she was leaving for her internship soon. I explained to her that I love her and that we need to work on some things (especially me) and that I didn't want this to be the end.

I've dabbled with coding and computer stuff but I am by no means the ideal candidate for UW's CSE program (An average GPA in the 3.8-9 range, yikes!). I've accepted the fact I will likely meet the same fate as many other Pre-CSE students. This isn't particularly upsetting, and I have faith I'll find another, potentially unconventional, way to end up in a CS related career. Plus I like core curriculum of both EE and HCDE. However, the difficulty of getting into a CS related career without the CS major is what worries me. That leads me into my questions.


 I've seen UW EE/Informatics/HCDE graduates end up with computer science related careers on this subreddit , but  realistically, how frequently does that happen? 

What's the job market like for these graduates? 

Would a EE/Informatics/HCDE undergrad be incapable of getting an internship either blending their discipline with CS or an internship that's largely CS due to competition with actual CS undergrads? 

Would a EE/Informatics/HCDE undergrad be able to take higher level CS courses in order to build their portfolio/skills? 

Any help you can offer me is greatly appreciated! I'm weighing University of San Diego and UW , so any sort of detailed answer I would likely find really insightful into this decision.

I would suggest reading the whole post even tl;dr - there's essentially three aspects: debt, social life, and starting salary that I cover in detail below.

**tl;dr** Univ of Illinois = 75k debt, but superior CS edu. Illinois Institute of Tech (IIT) (decent CS) = 15-20k debt. I will be commuting at IIT and feel like I will lose networking and social life as I will commute = less of the college experience. Also, there's less career fairs at IIT and Im afraid I wont get internships, where as Univ Illinois has all companies. Is going to Univ of Illinois really worth the debt? Will the salary be that much different? Would I be foolish to go with a Univ Illinois?
-----

I am a senior in high school that has been accepted into the CS program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). To put it short, it's one of the best CS schools for undergrad/grad just ranking below CMU, Stanford, MIT, and Berkeley. Bottom line is: people get jobs. The problem: it will incur some big debt.

On the other hand, I've been accepted at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) which will put me in much less debt. It's not superior in CS, though.

*University of Illinois*
I have done the math, and I will end up with **$114,000*** in debt. However, my parents can definitely afford to put down $10,000 a year (total 40k), cutting it down to about **75,000** in debt. Recruiters from top companies like Google, FB, etc.

*IIT*
I will only be around **$15-20k** in debt. I will commute, and perhaps lose on networking. There are also less companies recruiting, but it's in Chicago - which apparently may be a location benefit. No big recruiters, but many grads get jobs at the big companies (google, fb, etc.)

*The issue*
I want to go to Univ. of Illinois simply because I have the chance to get the best CS education and social life. IIT will give me a really good education, and my parents say that, in reality, there's not going to be a difference in salary. Are they right about this? Does a top 5 CS grad really make that much more than one from another decently reputable school? Also, I will be commuting when going to IIT so I believe I will lose out on the whole networking aspect of things. Social life at IIT will be down low too, so I will lose out on the whole college experience IMO.

**Is University of Illinois worth it?**

NOTE: This decision has been bothering me to the fact that I cannot even think about anything else. **I want the cold-hard truth: is 3/4 of 100k debt *really worth* it for just compromising four years of a better social life and CS education that may just give me the same job?** Many IIT grads end up at big companies too, but not nearly as frequent as UIUC. Am I being silly by sticking with UIUC just for a college experience and maybe a bit more salary? I love this school (UIUC), but money and social life (staying vs commuting, networking, etc.) are the only things holding me back."
32exsc,1,2015-04-13,Should I take this internship offer?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/32exsc/should_i_take_this_internship_offer/,"About me:

1. Junior CS major with 2 QA and 1 SE internship
2. Slightly above average interview test taking skills
3. Below average social/soft skills
4. My resume: https://i.imgur.com/15Xho6Q.png
5. No other prospects at the moment

The job:

1. Test automation internship at a big data Hadoop startup company that was acquired by a huge company 
2. Will be doing performance testing/building in-house tools to monitor testing 
3. I got tested a lot on SQL statements, so this might be a bit of database work, although they are a database software company
4. Parent company is decently reputable (not a top company but a known name in the industry)

Questions:

1. Do you think I will be able to get a SE internship if I skip out on this one?
2. Would working on my own projects or taking this internship be better for me next year to get into the search engines/NLP/data analytics field?

My thoughts:

I've gotten cat fished for QA positions like 50 times already when sending out SDE intern applications. This position was actually one that I got catfished into lol. I feel like another QA internship, even though it's automation QA instead of manual QA won't help at all. 



Money isn't an issue for me. I have enough money to pay rent for the entire summer to work on my personal projects (which will be relevant to the field that I want to get into after college) and study up on algorithms. 

All I care about is getting into a search engine/e-commerce company like Zillow/Red Fin/Kayak/Trip Advisor/Google/Amazon after graduation.

What do you guys think?

30-something male, 3 degrees including a law degree, all for nothing. 5 years of under and mostly unemployment I feel like my entire life after undergrad has been a complete waste.

Have given up on job hunt, do not apply anymore, theres a limit to my delusion on landing a job.

I'm now a shell of my former self. The undergrad me was the pinnacle of my being. I was happy, had a great circle of friends, was getting laid with regularity, and life was grand.

Following that was 5 years of grad school where I worked towards a career (which I wont mention) I truly wanted. I solely went the path I did to pursue this one career. Even landed an internship.

And here I am, 5 years out, with nothing to show for it. 5 FUCKING YEARS of mostly unemployment, with SHIT temp jobs mixed in between.

I've been so depressed I don't even recognize myself anymore. I'm now bitter, dejected, and resentful, and now am only out for personal gain. I've become asexual, and haven't had relations with a woman for years. 

Suicide isn't something I could go through with but the thought crosses my mind daily. I wish that I would catch a fatal disease, take cancer away from some poor kid who still has their life ahead of them. Get bitten by something venomous. Something where I'm not the cause of my own death.

Should you believe those sayings in the title of the post? ""Work hard and you'll succeed,"" etc.?

Perhaps. But maybe you'll end up like me, and find that pursuing your dreams transforms you into a person you barely recognize anymore, not giving a shit about anything or anyone anymore.

I go excessively fast on the freeway, because who cares.

I take unnecessary risks financially, because I don't give a shit.

I don't know what my next step is, but my risk taking is escalating.

I just want to feel alive. Or feel something. Or maybe I'm at the point where I don't care about that either.

Fuck my life. And fuck me too for pursuing a career I wanted. Had I chosen not to follow my desires, I likely wouldn't be in this mess. Life is trash.

32fhic,15,2015-04-13,Should I keep being a unpaid intern for a indie game studio or start on my own?,Instinctx,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/32fhic/should_i_keep_being_a_unpaid_intern_for_a_indie/,"Hello everyone!  
I am currently an unpaid intern for a small indie studio, and I am having a blast and learning A LOT being here. This is the place where I learned intermediate programming techniques and how to create a game from start to finish.  
  
This internship has been a fulltime thing for the past 9 months, and now I am getting short on cash... And the harsh reality is: I need to get another job to not starve to death.  
  
I was prepared for this to happen, so it is no shock for me. I basically wanted to be a unpaid intern for as long as I could, so I could get as much game dev experience as possible before the money ran out.  
  
 
But now I need to chose between staying with the Game Dev studio,  OR start up on my own (small).  
-  
  
My plan is to get a part time job to get some income and still continue developing games. But I can't continue working for the Game Studio if I want to work my own games (because lack of energy and time). And I really want to create games on my own!  
  
Basically, I feel that I have the expertise to create+finish small mobile games on my own. And I think it would be a great experience for me. And if I can make some money out of it great, if not, it's fine. And I can go back to being an intern again.   
  
So should I leave the internship, create 1-2 mobile games on my own (my dream), see if I get any success. Or should I just stay with the internship to gain more experience?  
  
I have one mobile game in the works that I believe could be quite big (it might flop, but that would be an important experience on its own). And I've done quite some research, so I know what I need to do to make it successful.  
And I really want to finish it (and another project that I am also developing), but I don't have the energy and time to work on my personal project after sitting 8 hours each day programming on the game for the studio I am working for.  
  
EDIT: I am going to finish the current game project we are working on in any case. So if I am going solo, then I am doing it AFTER our current project is finished.  
  
EDIT 2: Wow, I left out a vital bit of information:
I got this internship straight out of college (hard to get Game dev work where I live).  
It was me who asked them for a position, they said they don't have the money to pay me, and they need to get the first game out to get the cash to pay me. So I accepted the terms to work for free.  
I did this, as it is crucial for me to get some experience right after school, and to get a foot inside the industry.
We are working on our big project that might be the game that actually gives the business some big revenue, and if that happens I will be the first guy to get a PAID fulltime job at that studio! :) So I am kinda helping the studio to get on their feet, and in return get a paid position.  
  
Also, I've read every comment, will respond when I get home (currently working)

Rather, my questions is HOW MUCH?  

As an aspiring game designer I've made a fair amount of progress so far, but now I'm trying to push myself to be fair enough for at least an internship or something to get my foot in the door.  I've switched from making pong and tetris clones in pygame to learning UE4 and Unity development to make some more advanced games.  One requires C++ the other C#.  I happen to know C++ because I did a bit of coding in it as a kid and even made a shitty sample game eons ago when I was a wee lad.  C# I taught myself recently....it was actually surprisingly easy after learning other languages.  I just had to relearn keywords and syntax etc.  I can make the scripts required to run these games properly, or at least the basic ones.  Connecting maps and levels, adding input controls through coding, I've made a few basic AI's here or there, so I have a basic understanding of programming but not an advanced.

What I mean by this is that I can script games, but I can't make a game engine (or I potentially could, but it'd take years i'm sure at my level).  BUT, I've considered maybe understanding the game engine and what goes into it and how it's coded would be a powerful skill for a designer to have.  In understanding how the engine you're using works, you could potentially make your games much more cleanly.  Every time I implement a new feature or try to understand the feature of an engine, I constantly try to put myself in the programmers shoes and imagine what they had to go through in order to implement such a feature.  Understanding is key and I wonder if all these big companies want designers with this sort of high level of understanding.  But do all game designers have to be able to at least know how to code an engine to be effective designers?

Those engine developers have mad programming skills, and our goal as designers is to make games, not engines right? my question is as a developer should my skills be on par, good enough to be able to understand an engine as well, or would that just be a HUGE bonus and my current scripting abilities in C# and C++ would be adequate to at least get my foot in the door?  How much should I know to start, how much should I know by the time I want a real job (as far as engines and programming)?

I appreciate the help!"

32gb2q,2,2015-04-13,"Need job advice, kind of long but hoping you all can help. Big4 Advisory vs regional firm I have interned with. (Southeast US)",JeSuisPepe,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/32gb2q/need_job_advice_kind_of_long_but_hoping_you_all/,"Hey guys, I'm hoping you can offer some advice regarding my current situation, (Accounting/Finance/Healthcare Management degree). I apologize for the wall of text but I am genuinely stuck. 



**TL, DR**: two job offers, but one (Big4) has already been accepted months back (and starts soon!). Current interning firm genuinely wants me and is offering competitive everything in a field (healthcare consulting) that I feel like may be more relevant to my future interests/goals. Getting married/moving right before job starts. Both in the mid $50k's, both in the southeast. Worth it to give the Big4 a shot in Advisory (IT Risk)?



Long story (not that) short, went through the interview process at school in the fall and ultimately I landed a spring internship (here now by myself, winding down) with a regional firm I had built a relationship with for about a year, working in their consulting/advisory (specifically healthcare) practice. I actually didn't even interview for this position, they made an offer based on our relationship and never formally screened me. 



However, during that time in the fall I also interviewed with Big4 for a full time position in EY Advisory - IT Risk (applied on a whim), and after numerous interviews/visits I secured an offer. Turned out that it started in August 2015, which kind of gave me a ""best of both worlds"" scenario (intern for credit towards CPA in the spring, little time off, move over to full time in August), so I went ahead and accepted back in either October or November. 



Well, as of Friday the smaller firm has made me an offer that is extremely competitive (honestly about $10k higher than I expected) and only $1k less than the Big4 offer. They are not in the same city, but only about 2 hours away and in the same state. Worth noting that the regional firm's area has a significantly lower cost of living, so the difference may be a wash. However, the smaller city is significantly less ""exciting"" (to me personally, although they are both considered big cities and are major regions).



I'm at a crossroads - honestly I'm not sure what to do. On one hand I have accepted the Big4 offer, and feel the need to honor it, especially since they have already purchased the Becker material and I have it on hand (have not been paid the starting bonus yet). Up until now I had no negatives about it at all, and we (getting married during the summer) have been gearing up to move to the ""big city"" for it. However, this other offer is now a huge wrench in the mix that I didn't anticipate. 



I keep seeing stuff about how busy Big4 is/not having a family/not seeing your wife/(insert horror story), yet my current internship position is VERY relaxed, not stressful, and honestly only working about 40 hours a week, although there would be some periodic travel for due diligence (maybe 1 weeks worth every 2 months), and I don't think much would change for full time based on the guys I work with. I think the ""fear of the unknown"" of the EY position has become its negative, which is not really fair to it. I am comfortable here, but I don't want that to keep me from the other. 



I guess what part of it boils down to (sort of) is the long term career prospects that the Big4 offers. I know they are huge and have the name recognition, but in the end how much does that really matter? At school they really hammered the whole Big4 thing in to you, and almost make you feel like a failure if you don't go there - hence why I was ecstatic to get the offer initially. However, I am genuinely interested in Healthcare, and really could see myself in that in the future. Close relative is the CFO of a hospital, current internship boss (partner and healthcare practice leader) was a hospital CFO before moving to consulting (plus they know each other - well), and I would be directly under him if I stayed (really like working for him, very laid back and easy to work with, but he's older and really the main person I would miss). That being said, I know I will have healthcare clients with EY because of the region, but the actual work and exposure would be extremely different. 



Any thoughts/advice? He knows I have accepted the other offer, but wants me. However he said if I stay with my original plan he totally understands and won't be offended. Also, I know at the end of the day if I could leave here on good terms to go to EY, and if it didn't work out or if I wanted to be there for just a few years the odds are I probably could work my way back here. 



If the two offers were on the table (assuming EY had not been already accepted) and if I had not done the internship, I would have taken EY on name/size/prospects alone, but honestly if they were both on the table right now after the internship and neither accepted I probably would stay where I am. 



Has anybody been in a similar situation? Will the whole ""Big4 on resume"" really be more valuable than relevant healthcare consulting experience in the future? I've searched through the sub and most of what I have seen has been ""Advisory vs Audit etc"", I haven't been able to find anything similar to me. I don't have audit experience, so those comparisons were beyond me. Thanks r/accounting, I appreciate it. "
32gbc0,20,2015-04-13,"My GF is out, her parents suck (PS: what do I do about our un-met roommates)",SithrakHatesEqually,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/32gbc0/my_gf_is_out_her_parents_suck_ps_what_do_i_do/,"My GF, J, came out in a letter to her parents a few days ago. We don't have a place of our own and split our time between her parents and mine. She wrote the letter, left it on her parent's bed, packed the essentials, and we went to my mom's house (she is not out to my mom yet) to wait for the fallout. 

Her parents are Mormon and hold the average Mormon viewpoint on most issues related to gender, sex, etc., so she was very afraid of their reaction. However, since they remained friendly and welcoming with S (a gay friend of hers) when he came out and with B (a trans friend of hers) as she transitioned, we had hopes that they would be accepting of her.

After they read the letter, they texted her asking to meet and talk about it. So we (her parents and us) met on neutral ground yesterday afternoon. They were both quite upset (expected) and said some pretty infuriating things (less expected). They both said that ""You have the right to choose this if you think it will make you happy"", meaning they think this is a choice and that she is doing it for shits and giggles.

In her letter, J mentioned some stressors that had been making it particularly difficult to stay in the closet lately. Her dad has fixated on this. He kept talking about how you can't escape from life's stresses and implied that J thinks becoming a woman will make her life less stressful. I got the impression that he thinks she is looking for a quick fix to her issues with depression and anxiety. Well, transitioning isn't exactly a quick fix, but since it is the root of 90% of her struggles her dad has completely missed the point. 

Her mom stated that this completely goes against both of their beliefs and that they do not believe in being transgender. I said that there were studies on brains proving that transgender people are real women/men, she said ""You can say that but I can't believe it"". She also said that she didn't know ""what kind of woman J wanted to be"" and wondered if this meant J wanted to go around in feather boas and diamonds (wat).

They both repeatedly stated that they loved J and will always love J but that they will never understand this. Not that they don't right now, but that they never will. They also said that they want J to be happy and that they accept her, however with everything else they said neither I nor J believe this. 

They have requested that J tell them if she comes out to anyone else in the family, and that she does not come out to J's niblings (two kids under 5). They asked when J would be coming back home, but as long as they fail so completely in any understanding of J's feelings how can she possibly live in the same house as them?

We are both incredibly angry. I am frankly shocked at their reaction; I knew they were Mormon and embraced traditional gender roles so I really should have expected this, but in the course of my 3 year relationship with J I have really never seen their religion affect their behavior like this. I offered to show them some resources for parents of trans people to help them understand what is going on, but they basically said ""thanks, we have done our own research on this"".

Additionally, J and I are moving to another state in a month for my summer internship. We have two roommates that we have emailed but not met in person yet. I have referred to J as male in our emails since she hadn't decided to come out yet, but she is out now and going to be presenting as female in small but increasingly larger ways at least some of the time.

Since this is called asktransgender and not telltransgender, I will get to my questions now.

1. How do we get her parents to come around on this? Are they capable of coming around on this?

2. How do we tell our future roommates that J isn't actually a man and what's the most polite way of asking them if they're going to be transphobic assfaces about it?

I am going to work soon so I won't be able to reply for a few hours. Initially I was going to have at least 2 hours to read responses but this took so long to get out that that time is gone. Just so you all know I do occasionally lurk in the sub for partners of trans people."

-tauritan



Seriously, a suitcase salesman in Beach City? Who'd even want to buy a suitcase in a small, beachside, lower-middle-class town with no white-collar jobs?

This guy sticks out like a sore thumb.

Would Rebecca Sugar, who meticulously plots out minor details ahead of time like Chekhov, who crafts the show's inner workings as meticulously as watchmaker would craft his watch, just throw in some random-ass character in for a goof? No.

The world of Steven Universe is not a slapstick world. It has functioning systems of life and institution that closely mirror our own, from use of American money to mailmen delivering mail. Why is there a conspicuous lack of US Federal Government/military involvement?

- ""Maximum Capacity"": Enjoys fireworks? No. Look, he's watching the Gems! http://steven-universe.wikia.com/wiki/Suitcase_Sam?file=Suitcase_sam.JPG

-- Everyone else is watching the fireworks by staring straight FORWARD. He's looking UP.

-- Gems are directly in front of him, so he purposely misdirects his gaze (above the fireworks in front of the Gems) in order to not arouse in them the suspicion of being watched.

-- Why does he need to bring a suitcase with him to watch fireworks? Suitcase must contain spy electronics.

-- Perhaps Garnet's super-senses picked up the feeling of being watched and listened in on. At the end of the scene she clashes her skillets together to produce a sonic boom that seems to deafen him, at least momentarily.

- ""Political Power"": 

-- During Daytime Mayor Dewey appearance: He is with Greg, then disappears when Steven comes toward them.

-- Look at him looking AT Greg with his good eye, trying to be as inconspicuous as a motha. http://steven-universe.wikia.com/wiki/File:Political_Power_%2819%29.PNG 

--- Was he asking Greg about Steven?

---- What prompted Greg to ask Steven about ""Secret Government Internship""? Doesn't seem specific to Mayor Dewey

--- Does not react with the crowd.

-- During the Nighttime with Mayor Dewey:

--- Half-assed rioting, does not really emote with the crowd. 

--- Next to Greg again, but puts Lars and Sadie (later Onion) between him as a buffer to prevent suspicion http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/steven-universe/images/6/63/Political_Power_%2830%29.PNG

--- Starts acting better when he shakes and clenches his fist.

--- Only geniune act of feeling touched was when Steven talked about how Dewey was sheltering citizens from the truth, out of his love for them. He put his hand over his heart.

- ""The Return"": Did not escape with the rest of the town

Why is US Government not intervening in Gem affairs?

~~They did. See http://41.media.tumblr.com/6ab601aa65c345d97fdb32a2a7af75a7/tumblr_nde9puPQud1smn4pqo2_1280.jpg from ""Ocean Gem"".~~

~~See those shapes to the right of the Temple?~~ EDIT: Scalpels pointed out this appears to be a sunken sword. http://38.media.tumblr.com/f1e0eb9a19ede30e38322ccca143fdc0/tumblr_mx8uk6kRw11smn4pqo8_1280.jpg

- ~~Sunken WW2-Era Aircraft carrier and 2 battleships, 1 destroyer.~~

-- ~~Apparently the US Government decided to engage the alien temple and its residents at around that time. Apparently they lost.~~

--- Speculatively, ~~after that,~~ Crystal Gems would ultimatum the US Government into leaving them and their local township unintruded. Let's say, the US Government cannot enter a 100-mile radius around the temple.

--- Logically, the US Government complied... except in secret. 

Look for this guy to be in an episode later. Steven is going to teach this guy about not automatically distrusting people who are different and scary-looking.

Look for this guy to be Steven's contact to the US Government after that."

this summer I have a ten week internship. I am a junior, and planned on taking 15 credits the fall of my senior year and 13 credits in the spring (fall: operating systems, intro to internet computing, formal languages and automota theory, math elective, cs elective; spring: intro to database structures, intro to software engineering, 2 cs electives and a senior seminar)

However, two of my advisors have recommended that I take one of those classes over the summer because it will be a really rough schedule for me. I would be able to take the class online since I'd be in a different city. I feel like fulltime internship + class will be hard, but also think 15 credits of CS classes will also be hard, so I guess I don't know which one would be the better option. Any advice?"

After the last semester I feel awfully guilty about staying at home everyday and not doing anything with my life, so I applied for multiple jobs and internships.  

Very few got back to me, almost none called me up for an interview. 

Until my current company, which straight after the day I applied, they gave me a call and ask me to go down for an interview the day after.  

I was delighted, but didn't realise these all might be too good to be true.  

During the interview they asked very basic simple questions, and didn't even ask to see my portfolio, and they asked me to start on the day itself.(Which I couldn't, so I told them I could start next week)  

After the interview they told me the internship contract would be for a year, which should have raised a red flag for me, but I was dazed and excited with the idea of doing something productive and related to my field of studies, so I ignored it.  

The red flag was raised today on my first day at work.  

I messaged the HR lady the day before and found out that the office hour is 9.30AM to 6PM.  

I reached at 9.15AM, sat down because most of the people have not reached the office yet.  

The company is a small scaled, with about 10 to 20 workers at most.  

The person who is the boss of the company noticed me sitting there and asked who I was(he wasn't there during the interview), I introduced myself and he called me to his desk and started explaining the expectations and told me to be keen to learn.  

At this point I was still pretty convinced that this was a good idea, until the details for the contract were presented to me.  

The HR lady came and explained the contract, which states that the working hours is 10AM to 7PM, however the boss insist that I need to come to the office at 9AM.  

After that I was assigned a few videos to edit, I did one versions of editing, but it was immediately rejected by the boss when he saw it. Which I found acceptable and that was what I expected at the work place.  

Then at 7PM, after I've finished editing the boss came in to the editing studio and rejected it again.  

Then he asked whether do I want to go home first and come back tomorrow to continue the editing, which later my friend explained to me could be a trick question to see my enthusiasm.  

But I'm an intern, I don't get overtime pay, and these videos was supposed to be a 'test' to see my style of editing(which he barely watched till the end for both times), he gave me very little notes on what is to be expected of the final product.  

Then before I was on my way, he asked another worker to give his copy of the office key to me, and told me from now on I have to open the office up at 9AM everyday.  

A lady who was sitting nearby overheard and told me to not worry about it because she will be here too, which I found extremely comforting but also made me realise that it is quite a unreasonable request.  

After I got home I had a chat about my day with a friend who is older and had more work experiences, and immediately told me that I am being exploited, and that one year for an internship is way too long.  

However in the contract they did mention after 1 year if they're happy with my performance they would offer a 3 year contract as a full timer of the company.  

There is also no consequences of breaking the contract any time, except a clause to not work for the rival companies or other companies in the same industry.(Which when I asked for my mom's advice, she said it's just to scare people and that very rarely do they go to the extend of checking these things)  

I need some advice, am I really being exploited? Is it too early to tell? Should I back out of this as soon as possible to save time? Thanks in advance!  "

On the third day of the job, after a long phone call with a friend who is much older and more experienced in life than me, I've decided not to wait till the end of the week and instead tell them I'll be ending the internship on that day.  
I didn't know how to start the conversation with the HR/finance lady of the company, but she and the boss of the company came to me before lunch time wanting to brief me for a big project they wanted me to help in.  
So I panicked and told them right away that I want to quit, which they didn't receive very well, and kept pressing me on the reasons and on one point questioned me whether did I talk to the full timer who had quit yesterday.(I didn't want to get her in trouble, so I pretended not to recognize her name)  
I didn't want the resignation to get ugly, so I made up a family emergency, which I have to travel overseas for an indefinite amount of time to visit a close family member who is in dire conditions.  
I thought this wouldn't be so hard because after all I'm just an intern, it's very easy to replace me, and I don't have any big project on my hand.  
However the boss of the company said, ""Show me your plane ticket and I will let you go.""  
In the end, as embarrassing as it sounds, I had to ask my mother to come down to the company to negotiate on my behalf with them.  
During the discussion with my mother, they offered me a new contract, which has really desirable salary for someone who is a fresh grad with no experience.  
But I realised it was kinda suspicious for them to do that, and for them to tell my mother that they wanted to keep me because they thought my work was good, when none of them had actually properly sat down and checked the work I've done thoroughly.  
Which I am guessing was mainly because they needed to fill in for the local to foreigner employee quota, before the government realises that this company is breaking the law.  
The discussion I had with them lasted for a good 30 minutes to 1 hour, with me speaking nicely telling them I cannot continue this internship because of several reasons(The whole, it's not you it's me).  
But all my mother had to say was a simple ""No"" and ""For personal reasons."" and they let me go.  
During the discussion the HR/finance lady had mentioned that before I came in, quite a number of interns did the same thing, applied for internship, got in, came for a few days, and quit soon after.  
And that they didn't understand why this was happening, something I'm actually surprised because I thought they are aware of their business model and how shady it was.  
So in the end I manage to get out safely with no consequences.  
I felt terrible for the foreign workers in the company because they are fully dependent on this company for a working pass, and cannot simply leave it like locals do.  
During lunch after I called for my mother to come down to the company, another worker was sitting by the side step, I guess he had heard from the other people in the company about the situation, and told me that I could walk out of it very easily and shouldn't care about how much they're stopping me because it doesn't matter since I am a local.  
I asked him does he like working for this company, to which he gave me a sad smile, and walked away.  
I'm keeping this post here for those fellow fresh grads who are also on an eager job hunt, and might face similar situations.  
I've definitely learnt a lot about the world from these 3 days, so I guess my 3 days in the company wasn't in vain.  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
UPDATE 1:   
Second day of work and as it turns out there is something very wrong with the management of the company.  
A full timer I met yesterday asked me to have a walk with her in the middle of the day to warn me about this company, and told me she is going to resign later today.  
She told me about the company delaying her pay and sometimes even not pay freelancers at all.  
While we were out having lunch during break time, the boss of the company called her and questioned if I'm with her.  
Which the full timer later told me the boss doesn't approve of workers having lunch together in fear of his workers bad mouthing him behind his back.  
One additional thing is I've realised that the company is breaking several laws, one of which is to have less numbers of locals in the company than foreigners.  
I've decided to resign after this week after I'm done with whatever project they've given me and forfeit my payment so I could get out of this easier.  
I think long hours of work and minimum pay would not be an issue if I can really learn something, but a company that breaks the law might get me into trouble too so I guess it's best I just let this job go.

Then before I was on my way, he asked another worker to give his copy of the office key to me, and told me from now on I have to open the office up at 9AM everyday.  

A lady who was sitting nearby overheard and told me to not worry about it because she will be here too, which I found extremely comforting but also made me realise that it is quite a unreasonable request.  

After I got home I had a chat about my day with a friend who is older and had more work experiences, and immediately told me that I am being exploited, and that one year for an internship is way too long.  

However in the contract they did mention after 1 year if they're happy with my performance they would offer a 3 year contract as a full timer of the company.  

There is also no consequences of breaking the contract any time, except a clause to not work for the rival companies or other companies in the same industry.(Which when I asked for my mom's advice, she said it's just to scare people and that very rarely do they go to the extend of checking these things)  

I need some advice, am I really being exploited? Is it too early to tell? Should I back out of this as soon as possible to save time? What are your experiences in internship and how did they go? Thanks in advance!  "
32gkno,3,2015-04-13,I've received two internship offers - one as a Tech Analyst and one as a Quant. Can someone please advise me on what my plan should be?,[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/32gkno/ive_received_two_internship_offers_one_as_a_tech/,"To preface, I'm a third year undergraduate student studying Physics with Theoretical Physics. It is the penultimate year of my degree and so I am hoping that my internship this summer will set me on course for a graduate position.

My first offer is from a huge US bank as a Tech Analyst. I would be working on enhancing the function of some pre-existing projects and if I am lucky I will be given my own project to allow me to work in accordance with traders and quants to devise strategies and write to code to implement said strategies.

**Pros**

* Very good salary
* If I don't enjoy it I will still have a good position on my CV to allow me to go for another tech application when graduating.

**Cons**

* I won't be able to have much of an effect within the company as it is so large.
* Big chance that I won't get a personal project.
* Highly likely that most of my job will be fixing bugs in code and other boring tasks.

My second offer is from a French bank as an FX Quant. As a physicist I am quite drawn towards this one as I will directly be using a lot of the maths/programming skills that I have picked up as a part of my degree. However, I am worried about what my prospects after graduation would be if I took this position.

**Pros**

* My skills are much more relevant for this job than the other one.
* I would definitely be working on my own side project alongside helping to develop new models with the team.
* It would lend itself well to a potential career as a quant in the future.

**Cons**

* Much lower salary than the other job. Less than half the salary of the other and also a longer internship.
* Even if I complete this internship, most full-time quants have completed PhDs whereas I will only have a Masters degree.
*Does not lend itself well to jobs in other fields.

Sorry for the wall of text. I would love some help in solving this problem because it is quite a tough choice. To make things a bit trickier. I got the offer from the US bank in November and accepted it which means that I would have to go back on my contract and then accept the French bank.
I can also reveal the names but I'd rather do that over PM. Thanks in advance!"

32gnej,1,2015-04-13,Third year civil student looking for some internship advice.,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/32gnej/third_year_civil_student_looking_for_some/,"In brief... its April and I still haven't landed an internship, so naturally I am getting desperate and am coming to you for advice! I don't want to sound whiny and I understand landing that first internship is a difficult process for everyone but I will provide you with what I have done so far.

I joined the co-op program when I first started my degree here at Carleton University in Ottawa, as I planned from the beginning on getting some internship experience. Since finishing my first year I have applied everywhere and anywhere. I have sent emails, made cold calls and even done a few informational interviews with places in Ottawa and in my hometown. 

This year was the first time I had someone bite and it was exciting. I had 3 interviews for summer positions, two with the government and one with a large private firm. Unfortunately, I got beat out on each one and still am without a co-op. I realize it is really late in the game, but I refuse to give up and want to fix this as I am eager to get a start in the industry. I also understand finding that first job after school is much harder without an internship. I have applied out west, in BC and Alberta and this year probably about 40 positions around Ontario. 

I have had the co-op office and my Uncle who works in HR look over my resumes and cover letters, so it seems my lack of experience has been my biggest setback. So far I have worked as a carpenter's helper in my summer breaks but none of my interviewers found this very impressive despite the fact that it is at least a bit of experience in construction. 

That being said, if any of you know somewhere that is hiring or that might be willing to create a position for me please let me know! My main interest is structural but I am interested in just about anything construction wise. Am I screwed if I don't get an internship, is there hope? "

They want interns to be returning to school, so I honestly don't mind doing that by taking some extra credits for a semester at school after the internship.

Has anyone had any experience with this? Because I'm thinking of only going back to school if they give me a full time returning offer, otherwise I won't return.

32gowi,6,2015-04-13,Finding it harder to find a reason to keep going,[deleted],SanctionedSuicide,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanctionedSuicide/comments/32gowi/finding_it_harder_to_find_a_reason_to_keep_going/,"I wasn't always like this; when I was younger, I was much happier. Then I managed to fuck up my life and it's just been getting worse and worse ever since.

The fact of the matter, it's been almost a decade with almost no end in sight. I've had brief moments of happiness, but they were over too soon.

The only thing that's kept me going is:

* I don't want to hurt my family. My dad is a cop and has told me that he's seen families torn a part by suicide. As much as I don't want to live anymore, I don't want to bring that upon them.

* It used to be that I wanted to learn Japanese and live in Japan (either temporarily or permanently), but I just can't justify it anymore. I feel like moving to a society that's even more suicidal than the one I live in would only increase the pain.

* The methods are either expensive (Dignitas), have a low success rate, or messy (if I were to do it, the last thing I'd want to leave for my family is a hardly recognizable corpse).

But I can't justify continuing to live a life where I'm constantly having to play catch up for the decade I missed. Why should I want to? What's the fun in being 26 and trying to do all the things that I missed out on in my teens and early twenties? And I don't want to be the age that I am. I don't want to get married and have kids. I can hardly even eat anymore.

The way I see it, there are only two options that would make me happy/satisfied, and one of them is completely impossible:

* Go back in time and become my 14 year old self again with all the knowledge I have now (or at least, having a gut feeling of what to do). Join my high school soccer team and build a strong character. Try to make efforts to hang out with people after school, have a girlfriend or sleep around, and just have fun. Focus on getting good grades as well. Then, once I graduate, go to a good university and get good grades. Take some internships. Continue making friends and having sex. Maybe study abroad. In my senior year, start looking for a job for after I graduate. Of course, this is all impossible, and since it is...

* Just end my life. There's no way I'll ever be happy with the future I've built. I really have no one to blame but myself. Why should I let myself keep living for another 50+ years? I don't want this and there's no reason for me to accept it.

This might sound silly, but I hope that upon death, I can either get another chance at this life or get reincarnated as another person. However, I doubt that will happen.

I always thought my life would be much better than it is now. Well, it's not and I refuse to accept living a below average life.

**Edit: I've decided to keep living. There are plenty of things I still want to try and do.**

**I wish you all luck, whether you decide to live or not. Hopefully, I won't have to come back here again.**"

32h0zo,2,2015-04-13,Me [22F] with my roommate [22F] of 2 years. I fear she will commit suicide. I don't know what to do.,SadRoommateHelp,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/32h0zo/me_22f_with_my_roommate_22f_of_2_years_i_fear_she/,"Hi all. I am a very regular poster on this subreddit. I really appreciate all your wise comments so today I come to you for help.

I'm in University (USA) and I live off-campus with two friends, Jenna and Rachel. I have lived with them for several years and aside from typical problems (cleaning dishes, taking out trash, etc) we're very compatible. We are all good friends and we love to hang out at home or go out together. Rachel and I consider one another best friends but we also are good friends with Jenna (just not as close.)

Jenna is severely depressed, and possible bipolar. I'm uncertain of the status of her medical diagnosis. She often has depressive episodes (past ~2 years), and these episodes are increasing in both severity and frequency. Some examples:

- We all will go out together at night with friends (bowling, to a party, etc). She will have a panic attack and have to go home, usually almost as soon as we get there.

- She will sometimes randomly be in her room bawling for an hour alone. Sometimes in the middle of the night.

- She has self-harming thoughts and will sometimes claw at her face. She says she thinks this is normal and that everyone has these thoughts.

- She struggles to get out of bed and do her work. She will frequently spend several days in a row in bed, crying or moping, unable to do anything.

Jenna knows she has a problem. She says she is miserable and struggles very much with her feelings. She has a tendency to ""fantasize"" about the past. What I mean is that she sees the past with rose-tinted glasses and compares everything now to what it used to be. AKA everything is shitty right now and everything used to be perfect. 

She has a difficult time socializing and prefers to stay home alone. Rachel and I make an effort to include her in our plans but she often will decline the invitation claiming she's tired or has homework but we know better. Even if our mutual friends are at our house hanging out, she will come say hi for 5 minutes and then retreat to her room.

Her father is a depressed alcoholic. She really has been angry with him for a very long time for not being a good husband/dad. She loves him but she recognizes his mental instability. She also says she can't talk to him about her problems because he only makes it worse.

She has a strong tendency to latch onto boys and seek emotional support through sexual intimacy. It is a very self-destructive pattern. She will meet someone, fall in love right away, and be extremely over bearing to the point that they're scared off. And then she is heartbroken because she thinks she isn't good enough for them. She also meets hook-ups on Tinder frequently. I don't have a problem with sexual promiscuity but I honestly don't think she's emotionally stable enough to be having sex with strangers.

Jenna also has severe irrational fears that prevent her from accomplishing her goals. She's scared of everything. She can't answer the door if the doorbell rings. She is scared to eat foods because she thinks she'll get sick so she just lets multiple containers of food rot in the fridge. She is scared that if she travels something bad will happen. She has turned down jobs, internships, and vacation plans because she is so frightened to travel.

She on-and-off sees a psychologist through the school. She claims it helps but then once she temporarily feels better, she'll stop going and everything goes downhill again. Unfortunately she is graduating in 3 weeks so she won't have access to the school counseling center any longer and they are notoriously bad at making appointments anyways.

All of us (group of several mutual friends) are very concerned. We really want Jenna to seek therapy. I think she honestly needs medication but she's very anti-medication (another phobia.) I want to call her mom and tell her what's going. Her mom has somewhat of an idea but she doesn't know the severity of the situation. But I know Jenna will be angry at me if I tell her mom. She says her mom already ""has enough to deal with"" cause of her dad.

Please help.

What do we do?! We are at our breaking point. We honestly are scared that if she doesn't get help, she will do something drastic.


**tl;dr**: Roommate is severely depressed and we don't know how to handle it anymore."

Just leave a comment or PM if you want me to clarify something)

A little background before I start. He is in his early twenties from the Netherlands, and I am 16 years old from Sweden. I have known him for over 2 years. We have never met in real life or anything, but we hit it off super well right from the start. We met over the game League of Legends and we have been talking nearly every single day since. Early in our relationship he told me about his depression. 
He has a very hard time truly connecting with people, since he feels as if he has been betrayed many times before (like people leaving him). I did my best these couple of years to be honest and not give him any bullshit. As we got closer, the jelousy began evolving. I would mention going out with a guy or talking about my first kiss, and he would stay up all night being bothered by it. It came to the point where I would rather lie about boys than tell him about it when he asked. I never did lie though, I felt he deserved to know the truth, even if a lot of the times it wasn't even his business. 

Being the closest person to him, and me being busy a lot with school and what not (he is living with his parents and just recently got an internship, but before that he would stay home all day), his time revolved around me. When I wasn't there, he would wait for me to come home. He hated me giving other people more attention than him, or me telling him I'd rather play with someone else for the time being. It started feeling as if he didn't even appreciate the time I gave him, because being with me was the only time he ever felt normal and happy. It was the only time he didn't feel empty inside. 

We have talked about this a lot, and every time it ends up with us disagreeing. He feels as if I'm being selfish for calling him my best friend while not giving him the most attention out of my social circle of friends. I can truly say that I love him and that he is my best friend, but it really tears away at me knowing he is lonely and disappointed when I spend my time with others. I feel guilt as I have never felt before. As I said, I have tried talking about it many times but we never came to a solution, it always just goes back to the same behaviour. 

I spoke to my boyfriend about it, because he brought up a story from his past in which he had been in the same position my best friend is in. My boyfriend said he had cut off contact with the girl because it just hurt him too much when she wasn't around. He told me it was one of the best decisions he ever made, because it made him slowly, and painfully, forget about her. The talk gave me an idea of cutting off contact with my best friend until he has become used to not having me around. It is not at all a healthy relationship for both of us, and while I love being with him it's also very draining. Needless to say he didn't take it well at all. I tried explaining my point of view, but he wouldn't listen and called me selfish and told me how I had ""destroyed everything"". I am worried right now that maybe I didn't make the right decision. I only want what is best for him, but he doesn't see that. He is also suicidal, which makes the whole thing worse. If he would end his life I would blame myself until the day that I die. I just want him to be happy..."

32hpw2,76,2015-04-13,What is expected from new grads?,sockduffman,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/32hpw2/what_is_expected_from_new_grads/,"I will be graduating this June, but I don't have any outside of school CS/coding experience. I'm not an incompetent coder, but I wanted to take advantage of my summer and winter breaks by  following my second passion to become a chess master, playing in as many tournaments as I could.

I keep hearing two seemingly contradictory opinions, one which motivates me and makes me feel optimistic, and the other which...doesn't.

1-) It's fine. Nobody expects new grads to come in and blow everyone away by their ultra competence. Just apply to entry-level jobs, study for interviews, and you'll be in good shape. (Me: ""Okay if I keep working hard in my classes and keep improving, everything will be okay."" )

2-) HOLY SHIT YOU NEED TO DO SOME SIDE PROJECTS/CONTRIBUTE TO OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS! HOW DID YOU NOT GET AN INTERNSHIP? NOW YOU ARE DOOMED TO ONLY QUALIFY FOR THE LOWEST PAYING, CRUDDEST OF CRUDS. (Me: ""Fuck, man. I've wasted my whole college life! What the hell am I going to do?"")

I mean, I know that the more experience you have the more desirable you are to potential employers. If I had spent those thousands of hours of studying/playing chess on working on side projects or doing internships I would have a better resume. I don't regret attempting to have a life outside school for the first time in my life.

I took all these courses in college, but none of them felt very applicable in the real world. The courses I took such as Operating Systems, Networks, Compilers, and Parallel Programming were rewarding, but they felt like they were just scratching the surface of giant topics. So now while I can ""code"", if someone comes and asks me ""What the hell do you want to work on? What do you know? What is your dream job?"" I can only shrug and say ""I want to start doing *something* so I can figure out what I like doing.""

That doesn't mean that if I get a job I won't go and learn my stuff inside out and try to produce as much value as I can.

I don't know if anyone else is in the same boat as I am. Maybe people in my campus seem to prefer not to talk about stuff like this, or maybe it's not that common."

What are the options?,Robiltussin,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/32hvi4/interested_in_gis_and_have_a_bs_in_earth_science/,"I'll be graduating soon in Earth Science. GPA is above a 3.5, I have had 2 internships, both of which were good but didn't give me much experience in GIS. I wanted to minor in comp sci but couldn't, and unfortunately will not be able to. 

I've been working with arcGIS for about a year but mostly I've made really basic maps of income data of census tracts. 

Programming knowledge:
matLAB
Python - basic python. I've created models in Python of the Earth - don't know if that counts for anything?

Basically, I have a really basic understanding of arcGIS but I've never used Python and GIS together. I've made maps from census data, but nothing too complex. 

Other: I have no student loan debt (and I am so, so grateful). My parents occasionally help me out with rent and could help me pay for a graduate program so long as it is meaningful and not a waste of money/time. 

My end goal...I want to become a GIS analyst. But how do I go about doing this? What are the best programs for someone like me, when I have pretty much minimal coding experience?"

My name is Eli, I was a second semester medical student at the university of Toronto. You see, my dad was a fire-fighter, and I always respected and admired that, ever since I was really young. The idea of running head-first into danger in order to save other people was absolutely incredible to me, and so I wanted to follow in his footsteps. I know what you're thinking ""Every boy wants to be a fire-fighter when he's little, I'm sure you grew out of it"" but I didn't. Even well into high school, it was an obsession of mine. I was determined to do it one day, and to work with my dad. I studied all the time, reading up on different emergency medical procedures, and what to do in case of a fire. I even did something like a summer internship at a fire station, a program that allowed teenagers to help around the station, and even go to fires every now and then. I loved every bit of it. I knew I wanted to help people, and this was how I was going to do it. My parents had always encouraged me to follow my heart, although they weren't too keen on me running into burning buildings, they supported my choices no matter what. My life was great, I had a group of close friends at school, I was sure I was going to get my dream job, and my parents were wonderful. It was perfect, but not forever. 

One weekend in my senior year, I was coming home from my friend Matt's house. I had spent the night since a new game had come out, and he wanted me to stay over and play it with him, since it was a horror game, and he had an ""active"" imagination and he got scared pretty easily. When I got home, I yelled for my mom to let her know that I'd gotten home safe. I walked upstairs to my room, since I'd been watching a movie when Matt had texted me the evening before, and I didn't get a chance to finish it. Before I actually started the movie, my mom walked in the room. Tears were streaming down her face, and my mind kicked into panic mode, wondering what was wrong. My mom sat down on the bed next to me, and gave me a hug, her hot tears dampening my t-shirt. I choked out the words ""What's wrong mom? Why are you crying?"" As tears began to well up in my own eyes. I was old enough to understand that I probably already knew why she was crying, but I didn't want to believe it. 

""Your father... He..."" 

Her sobs had started to get more powerful once she started speaking, and she couldn't finish. She didn't have to. I knew what was wrong. I'd been trying to mentally prepare myself for this situation for years, since I knew that the chances of it happening were fairly high, but you're never actually prepared for the death of a parent, especially at that age. I had to get out of my house for a while at that point, so I left the house and just walked well into the night, just thinking. When someone close to you dies, the idea of never seeing them again is the hardest part. The best way to describe the feeling is surreal. My mind tried rejecting the thought that my dad was dead, instead replacing it with ideas of conversations that we would have in the future, and things I wanted to tell him. For a little while, it felt like I would get to see him again, but I knew that as soon as I went home, realty would come crushing back down on top of me. For a split second, I pondered running away, in an attempt to rebel against the world and to indulge my imagination. I quickly discarded this idea however, as I knew I couldn't do that to my mom. I headed home, and without a word to my mom, went to my room.

I stayed there for almost a week, only coming out late at night to get a drink of water from the kitchen sink. I didn't really eat anything, only the occasional meal that my mom would leave just outside my door. Usually a sandwich, or something of the sort, and I typically would leave it there until she went to sleep. I mostly spent my time just laying in bed, looking at the ceiling. I tried to keep myself in the delusion that my father was still alive by only leaving my room at times I wouldn't have seen him before he died. I lost almost 25 pounds that week, since I was hardly eating at all.

After I finally accepted that the world had bested me, and I felt like leaving my room, I had a hard time with almost every activity I enjoyed previously. Since my muscles had been used so little, they were stiff and sore all the time, and I found it difficult to move without feeling intense pain course throughout my body. I was forced to accept defeat, because I had to face the truth of the matter. I was going to go to my father's funeral, and there wouldn't be any way I could deny the world its victory there. I realized that I had never found out exactly how he'd died until that point. Him and most of his squad had been trapped inside a building downtown when it blew up, killing them all instantly. I would later find out that the police discovered signs of arson in the area.

It was a short service, since the time was split between all of the men trapped inside. My mom and the wife of another one of the men from my dad's squad paid their respects, and we left. The last of the three men had no family.

When we got home, my mom finally broke down at the doorstep. She held me, looked me in the eyes and said that she was sorry, and I couldn't understand what else she was trying to tell me, so I helped her over to the couch, and sat with her for almost an hour. When she started to calm down, she tried telling me again. 

""I'm sorry, but I can't lose you too. I can't do it.""

I realized what she was saying, and my heart dropped. She was asking me not to become a fire-fighter, and I couldn't say no. Despite the fact that it was my dream, I couldn't do that to her. I knew that it would be selfish. But, I knew there were other ways of helping people. I'd always been good with my hands, I could be a doctor, or even a surgeon. I couldn't be a fire-fighter though. I decided that, for my mother's sake, I would have to find something else.

About a month and a half after that, I went back to school, and got a part time job at a grocery store in order to support my mom. Between my depression, and my job, I cut off contact with my friends. I felt horrible about not explaining anything to them, but I just didn't know what to do, and so I decided not to do anything. My mother and I spoke less and less as well, and I think it was because of two reasons. I think that she felt like she had turned me against her by asking me to not follow my childhood dream, and I now realize that, maybe she had. 

Thankfully, once I actually got into college my depression began to fade, whereas my excitement to help people was reinvigorated. I had decided that I was going to be a surgeon. It became clear to me that my drive to help people had never truly faded, and that it was merely suppressed. After the first year, things were doing great, and I was still driven towards my goals. Since I had always done well in high school, I had managed to make in into a fairly nice college, and I didn't have to worry about tuition. I wasn't going to let the world take this one from me. This time I had won.

That summer, I didn't really do much. I didn't go home, I just hung around and watched movies, and studied for the next semester. I didn't make many friends around campus, since I'd become fairly introverted. I began to slip back into my depression, and that's when I began wondering why I wanted to help people in the first place. I made no attempt to be friends with anyone, and I mostly shut myself off from the world, so why was I driving myself so hard to help the people around me? I quickly pushed these thoughts out of my head, and just thought that, maybe I'd be become interested in the matter once again after I began working, the same way it had happened when I started college. 

As the second semester rolled around, something strange started happening. I started to get homesick. Really homesick. It was like a physical ailment, and I could hardly go to my classes. I had realized that, all summer long I wasted time rather than going back to see my mother. I was having a hard time focusing anyway, and so I decided to leave for about a week to see my mom.

I called her, but she didn't pick up, so I decided to just drive there and surprise her. When I got home, I knocked on the door, and a woman answered it. 

""Mom! It's so good to see you!""

I spoke too soon. The dark lighting made it hard to see who was inside, and I thought that it was my mom for a moment. A short African American woman standing in the doorway said ""Do I know you?"" I could tell by her face that she was surprised, and I'm sure that she could tell the same from mine.

""No, I'm sorry. I must have the wrong address."" 

She agreed with me, and she turned around and walked back inside, closing the door. 

My head was spinning, filled with thoughts and questions. Had mom moved without telling me? Why would she do that? Did she think I'd hated her? Why would she think that? But, I made a guilty realization. Thinking back, I couldn't remember a single time that I'd called her since I left for college. I just, dropped out of existence after telling her goodbye. She might think I was dead. Again, my feeling of homesickness washed over me, and I realized that the only person I felt like turning to felt like I had abandoned them. I decided that it was probably best to head back to school, and just try to forget, rather than reopen old wounds between me and my mother.

I found myself able to focus on studies a bit more once I got back, so I decided to focus on the good rather than the bad. I started to get poor grades in my main classes, but I opted to ignore it rather than attempt to improve. I felt like things were falling apart, but I just wanted to stay optimistic about my life. 

I finished the year with mostly C's and D's, but I failed any of the classes I didn't care about. I began to slip back into my depression that summer. I stayed inside, watching videos on my laptop every now and then, but mostly just laying around doing nothing of any value. One day, while I was browsing the internet aimlessly, I clicked on my email. To my surprise, and genuine amazement, I'd received a message from Matt, my best friend from high school. He told me that in a couple weeks him, Tom, and James, three of my closest friends, were going camping. I decided that, I probably wouldn't go. I still felt horrible about abandoning them in high school, and I felt more comfortable sitting here at home, without worrying about how I conducted myself around people. I was always afraid of the connections I made with people, since I felt like each time I would hit another rough patch, I would probably just hurt them. I decided that I'd be perfectly happy staying here in my dorm, letting myself waste away while waiting to continue my work towards my dream of helping people. 

A week later, I was beginning to warm up to the idea of going camping. It was something me and my friends had always loved doing when we were little, and in his email, Matt had described a patch of forest that a friend from college told him about, where we'd be surrounded by Giant Sequoias. It sounded beautiful. While I still wasn't sure if I was going to go, the idea got stuck in my head. 

Three days after that, I decided. My heart was pounding as I got out my laptop, and sent Matt a reply. I told him that I wanted to go, and I asked him what I needed to bring. Two hours later, he emailed me back. He said that I'd need a sleeping bag, and maybe a flashlight if I wanted one. They'd bring food and drinks. I immediately responded, asking how long they were expecting to be gone. Another hour passed, and he said they thought maybe three days or so, but they were bringing enough food for about a week and a half, just in case they decided to stay longer. He told me that they'd pick me up that weekend, since my college was on the way. At that point, I realized that I really wanted to go. For the first time in almost 3 years, I had something to genuinely be happy about. I was finally going to make up for abandoning my best friends, and I was actually excited about it. I couldn't wait for the weekend.

Sorry to cut this off here, but I don't have time to write more now. Despite my current situation, I still have some stuff to do. Don't worry though, I'll finish this up and post the rest of my story later, since I haven't had time to tell you the strange parts of my life. I just wanted you all to understand why I made some of my more questionable choices that I'll be telling you about later on.

I asked how long the turn-around time was for me to make a decision, and the HR lady said was only 24 hours. I had previously heard that they pay software interns a fair amount below what I have made in my last 3 internships, so I was already planning on negotiating salary. 

I have another confirmed offer from ""Company B"", but that won't come in by time I get the one from ""Company A"". Also, ""Company B"" will probably pay significantly higher than ""Company A"". Aside from that, I have my university career fair tomorrow. There are several interesting companies there too!

Still, I really, really like the work opportunity at ""Company A"". I'll get to work on cool projects, and have a short commute.

32iwdv,2,2015-04-13,My [27F] ex-FWB [29M] is started contacting me again and is sending mixed messages about what he wants.,pumpkinmoose,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/32iwdv/my_27f_exfwb_29m_is_started_contacting_me_again/,"Backstory:

In October of 2010, I began a new job and met (Chris). I liked Chris from the moment I met him. Seriously, the second I shook his hand introducing myself to him, I knew we would be good friends and possibly more. Fast forward to May of 2011, Chris' internship ended and he got a job in a different state. Before he left we started hanging out a lot and became FWB. I knew a long distance relationship would never work, so I never bothered asking him to try a long term relationship or something more serious. We talked often online and in January 2012 when I broke up with my then boyfriend, I went to visit Chris at his new location. We hooked up, both knowing it was a rebound fling with nothing long term expected. 

Later that year, Chris received a job offer from the place we worked at together. He moved home. We again hooked up. However, this time he ended things very abruptly. I don't recall the exact reasoning now, but I remember it was very one-sided and we did not have much discussion about our friendship or relationship. I left that job fall of 2013 and we remained nothing more than coworkers. 

Currently:

I broke up with my boyfriend of two years a couple months ago. He cheated on me (which is a completely different can of worms). Chris offered me his couch to sleep on / shoulder to cry on if I needed it. A couple weeks later his text messages started to turn into messages asking me to come over and fool around. They were a bit less blunt than that, but that was the main idea. I was not in a rush to do anything with him, so I kept turning him down. 

He then texted me at the beginning of this month stating, 'I know I've been doing lots of flirting and trying to convince you to come over and fool around. I am going to be honest and say you shouldn't do that with me. I don't want to hurt you and honestly I don't really want anything more than just hooking up."" It caught me off guard and I was obviously hurt and annoyed, but glad that he told me. So I basically said thanks for letting me know and I thought that was what was going on. 

A week later he sends me a picture message/meme joking about sleeping with the fan on and a few other things we used to flirt/bicker about. I was very short with my replies to him and he finally said, ""what no response? Those are your favorites."" A couple days later he sends me a text saying I looked very pretty in a photo he saw of me on Facebook.

So, that's where I'm at. I was hoping to get some outside perspective. He told me he wasn't looking for anything more than just hooking up and I do firmly believe that. But I don't know why he's also sending me messages about how I looked pretty in photos and references to us being together previously. Now that I've typed this all out it feels painfully obvious he's just looking to hook-up despite texting me telling me not to do it.

My name is Catherine, but you may call me Miss Catherine. :)

I'm on the lookout for a writing partner I click with and can develop a good chemistry with. 

The more the merrier I always say. :)

I apologize for the length of this post, but I'm hoping it'll garner some great responses. I'll be around for the next few hours and then I'll look to respond in the AM.

**What I'm looking for:** 

A kind, articulate, well read, RP partner to possibly do a feminization story with me. 

I'm very eager to turn you into the pretty girl maybe you wished you were or didn't know you could be. I love forced feminization. French maids. Turning boys into office girls. Domestic servitude. I have a smoking fetish, enjoy and love power exchange. High heels, skirt suits, Strap-on play, etc etc.

I usually play a dominant female character. I have a very big sensual side to my personality. I do enjoy discipline and domestic and corporal punishment, but this usually to correct the behavior of the character who is the submissive in the story we're telling. I'm not into creating pain (real or imaginary) without a purpose. 

I will be as committed to a story as you are. If you show great dedication and effort, I will return the favor and we'll have a great time. All I ask is for open communication.

Good dialog, realistic dialog is very important. I like a slow burn with plenty of character development. I like realistic scenarios taking place in the real world as well.

Writing in 1st person is preferable. I like long form stories over the course of chat sessions over IM. YIM is preferable. Sex is important to the story, but the sex scenes should be earned. Good dialog, realistic dialog is very important. I like a slow burn with plenty of character development. I like realistic scenarios taking place in the real world as well. 

I have a couple prompts on hand and I will share them with you.

***

**Prompts**

1. **The Auction**: *You've been unemployed for the last six months and the bills are really starting to pile up. You notice an ad in the newspaper that states a privately owned staffing company is looking to fill spots fast. Job duties will require long hours, cooking, cleaning and some manual labor and possible overnight stays, but that is at the discretion of the employer. Payment and rewards are negotiable. You decide to call the number to set up an interview, but little did you know what you were about to enter into.*

2. **The Lady &amp; Her Maid:** *You've had a crush on me since our college days together, but you never acted on it, and were too embarrassed to after I walked in on you wearing a pair of panties and enjoying yourself. I never brought it up, and never used it to humiliate or blackmail. To you, it was in the past and you were eternally grateful to me. We've fallen out of touch for a few years, but after a messy divorce you return to the city a bit broken, with damaged confidence and a depleted bank account. It's a good thing Miss Catherine knows how to make things all better.*

3. **Miss CEO:** *Years ago you hired me for an internship out of college, but it was just because you thought I was some silly blonde who would be painting her nails as she took phone calls. You even talked behind my back, and even though you were married, you'd brag to your buddies about what a hot lay I probably was. ""She's never going to go anywhere,"" you said. You thought you were untouchable as you were the best sales manager the company had going. But then the economy tanked, and so did your marriage, you put on weight, started cutting corners at work, and suddenly you were a shell of your former self and out of a job. Then, one day, you we happen to run into each other and suddenly you have a very important favor to ask.*


***

**Serious inquiries only please.** 

Not looking for a one shot. I want to build characters and write an enjoyable story. Please be willing to IM. Also, be a *good* writer.

{*Remember, if you're a sub you want to make sure that your dominant is enjoying herself as well.*}

**NOT into scat/blood/torture/bondage/or anything with bestiality or incest.**

I have worked in cell phones for the past five years as well as repairing them and customer service. I have been interested in PCs and Networking for years and decided to pursue that as a major instead of transferring out to a university. This added a few more years to my degree.

I am currently in school part-time working toward an Associates (PC and LAN Technician). I have eight more classes until I complete my degree. 

I also recently took and passed my A+ and Network+. I am currently looking for a job in entry level IT. I currently am only getting offers for internships and due to my financial situation, I cannot not afford to take the 8k/year paycut. 

I'm thinking about going for another certification but am unsure about what to get. I have a free voucher for Security+ and am contemplating getting my MCSA for server 2012. However I have also taken my CISCO courses and am also prepping for my CCENT and CCNA. However, I am worried that I will take the test and pass and still be stuck in an entry level position. 

I am really looking for guidance and any advice anyone is willing to offer. Thank you in advance."
32j4dn,0,2015-04-14,Should I get out now? Is working in a small business for too long going to kill my career?,daybreak15,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/32j4dn/should_i_get_out_now_is_working_in_a_small/,"Backstory: I work for a web design firm in my area (kind of) that also does managed services on the side, up until a few months ago. I started as an intern almost two years ago and things have rapidly changed since then. Now, my former boss who was one of the greatest supervisors I've ever had the opportunity of working for, is at another company as he found another opportunity after his position of director of managed services was eliminated. He worked with a guy he's known for years, and they're both great to work with. Now, me, someone hired about 6 months ago, and my co worker who has been at the company for almost 8 years work for someone who has no faith in his IT staff and doesn't communicate at all, basically trying to set us up to fail.

Today, my co worker, the last one from when I started, let me know that he was putting in his two weeks and found another job. I really can't blame him for moving on, they way our new supervisor wanted it was he was doing miscellaneous stuff while I'm trying to defend while I still get paid on a daily basis with no communication back. It hit hard because the two main people I worked for and with for the past few years are now gone and leaving respectively. It's left me in kind of a weird spot from my perspective. I graduate community college with an associates in cyber security and network administration and am testing for my A+ later this month. I don't have many options and I feel stuck, even though it is the beginning of my career. I know a good bit of Linux and Windows administration, I set up a network at a new office space by myself since nobody else really knows Cisco, I do a lot with different CMS and frameworks for web developers, so it's not like I'm lacking skill, it's just proving it.

I feel burnt out just from these past few months, I used to love going to work even though it's a 4 hour round trip, but now I hate it and I can't get anything closer because there's little to no tech companies around me. Am I killing my career staying in this job and slowly getting more and more jaded as the days go by? Thanks in advance for any advice and sorry for the long post and any errors, typing with a squint and two thumbs.

TL;DR: am I killing my career by staying in a job I hate with a small company?"
32j5go,11,2015-04-14,Please read if you are up for a long read. I just want someone to know about me.,Raisedby2narcs,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/32j5go/please_read_if_you_are_up_for_a_long_read_i_just/,"Hello, first time poster here. I've mostly posted at /r/raisedbynarcissists to get advice about my parents, but a lot of other things are bothering me too.  Hopefully this is a sign of healing, that I'm moving past my parents' problems and focusing more on my own.  However, I still have a lot of pent up and confusing feelings about my family.  But on to other stuff...
First, a little about myself. I'm a 19 year old, female, engineering college student. I have a part time job at my school's IT department (my major is not related to computer engineering, but I enjoy working with computers).  I am the only female at my work, and it's a little hard to be working with all males. They make offhand remarks about females that offend me, but I can't tell them or I'll be ostracized even more.  Anyways, a guy got promoted at work that caused a bit of politics amongst us. This is pretty stressful because I really do not want to get involved in this type of stuff.  
Next, I am currently looking for internships. I received a call back 2 weeks ago, in which I was instructed to submit another application the HR person on the phone sent me.  Then, I would call and arrange an interview.  I followed up on the instructions and was met with voicemail.  I emailed the person a while later, with still no response.  Now I'm pretty sure I don't have an internship this summer.  Everyone around me is so smart and has everything together and I can't even get a single internship.  
I got my grades back from last quarter and they were honestly crap. I have a crappy GPA which is probably why the only internship that called me back changed their mind about me. I haven't met anyone who as a lower GPA than I do.  
I've been helping my roommate with several guys after her love.  She is never interested in the guys attracted to her, and asks for my advice for kindly shaking them off.  For some reason, I'm very good at kindly manipulating people by dropping hints, as my roommate has told me.  I've helped her reject 4 guys now.  But I've never been in a relationship, let alone have anyone like me. Absolutely everyoneeee I know has been in a relationship or has had someone like them.  I hate myself for not being attractive to anyone. I'm not fat, many people have told me I'm too skinny, in fact. Maybe it's because I don't wear makeup. I don't know why no one likes me.  I have several good friends, but no one is attracted to me. I feel left out when I'm surrounded by everyone in a relationship. 
I've been feeling pretty sad about losing the promotion and internship, so I decided to try and join the engineering co-ed fraternity, but I was rejected. This was my second time trying to join but I failed again.  However, I understand why I was rejected the last time, because I was extremely shy and awkward.  I have since improved my social skills greatly, and really bonded with the members of the fraternity during ""rush week"" and I was crushed when they rejected me.  I thought I had found my home. My real home life sucks. I guess I don't belong anywhere.  No one wants to get close to me.  
Last, I have some pretty normal family issues, not related to narcissism.  I got rejected from the university in my hometown, and lied to my dad about being rejected because my mom and I agreed he wouldn't see me the same if he knew the truth.  I go to a school 90 minutes away, and am constantly reminded of the financial burden I cause to my family.  I'm told by my dad that if only I went to the school in my hometown, so much money could be saved on food and housing.  I got a job to try and help with the money, but my mom tells me the measly 5k I earned last year covers hardly anything, and my job is just something nice to put on my resume.  
I feel like my family doesn't like me because of the financial burden I cause.  Once my mom told me that I shouldn't visit home because I don't contribute anything when I come home. I just laze around. I do agree, but I don't try to be lazy. My brother doesn't miss me, I have asked him if he does and he says he does not.  He does not act like he does either when I visit.  
I try to talk to my mom about my problems but she just tells me she feels like a failure when I tell her of my problems and how I can't handle them.  I just feel so guilty that I'm a failure and now my parents feel like failures. They lie to their coworkers and friends about the college I go to, since the one I go to isn't very prestigious. For example, when my dentist, doctor, etc asks how I'm doing and what school I go to, I am instructed to lie.  
Lastly, my friends in college aren't very close.  My best friends are my friends from high school and middle school but we only get together during holidays and summer because we all go to different schools now.  The only place I thought I had friends was the engineering club I am a part of. I got a position in the club, but only because I happened to be the only one who applied to the position, whereas everyone else was elected.  I learned that people who hold a position are told to interact with loners so that they feel included and the club membership is boosted.  Now I think the kindness was all a hoax.  They were just being nice to me to get me to join the club.  I don't have any real friends at college.  
Everything I try turns out to be a failure.  My university, my GPA, my job promotion, my attempts at finding a boyfriend or just a friend, my internship applications, and my fraternity.  
No one wants to listen to me. My family is off the table. My dad is a narcissist as confirmed by my therapist and my mom feels like a failure when I talk to her about my problems. My brother is 12 years old.  I don't have any friends to talk to.  I don't want to tarnish the happy times I have with my high school friends.  My therapist is an overworked university psychologist who I have only seen twice.  I haven't told her much because I'm afraid she'll tell me she isn't properly equipped and refer me outside.  We have just been discussing my dad. My family does not believe in mental health related stuff so they can't help me that way.  I can't get help from anyone. 
I really love to read and I really identify with the character in the book It's Kind of a Funny Story.  He mentions that he thought suicidal thoughts were a part of growing up. I always thought so.  I've come close to attempting suicide in middle school.  I was bullied from my kindergarten years until 8th grade when I found my best friends.  In elementary school I thought I would be better off dead, but I didn't think of suicide.  My elementary teachers warned my mom about my bullying, and I was even sent to some sort of school funded therapy.  I didn't make any friends until those in 8th grade.  I'm not socially awkward, I have lots of superficial friends who I chat with in class in such, but no one I can talk to or hang out with in college.  
Anyways life just sucks now. I haven't felt success in a while.  I can't remember the last time I was proud of something. I hope this isn't too long. I just want to feel better. Every day I wish I didn't exist. No one really cares about my so why should I? Don't worry, I am not suicidal. I just don't want to exist. At the same time I feel guilty for feeling that way, because that just shows even more of how I am a failure.  My parents invested so much in me and I can't do anything right.  
I can't imagine feeling good again.  Hopefully this isn't too long a read, if anyone is reading.  If you got to the end, thank you so much for reading. I just hope someone out there cares remotely about me.  "
32jalv,4,2015-04-14,[trigger warning] About to relapse ...,[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/32jalv/trigger_warning_about_to_relapse/,"Hi everyone.

I considered making an alt account, but I guess we're all strangers here, so it doesn't really matter. I lurk here, and though I don't comment often, it comforts me that there are people out there who can relate to me. I am a real person, and I'm still shocked by the number of real people who are experiencing or are survivors or mental/physical abuse from people who are supposed to love you. I'll most likely end up deleting this post soon - not because I don't want support, but I just need to vent. I don't want to give out any more specific details than what I'm about to give, so I'm sorry if that bothers any of you. If you really wished, you can probably find most of what you need in my previous posts.

My family moved to the States when I was about 8 or 9, and then moved cities every month, because of my father's job. I got used to the idea of living without relatives and without friends. I'm a bit of a loner, and I'm okay with that. Ever since middle school, I used to always be a little pudgy. I don't mean obese, but I was always 15-20 pounds a little heavy. And considering that I didn't do any kinds of sports except for weekend soccer games, it was basically all fat. Because my parents have a very strict idea of what a person's figure should look like, they've made a big deal of my weight since then all the way to the end of high school. I tried to lose weight by eating a little less, but when your parents don't want you to go outside and play with your friends, and keep you in summer classes to ""prepare me for college"" right from the end of elementary school, you don't really get to have a lot of physical activities in your life.

Maybe you might have deduced, but they've abused me physically and emotionally throughout everything. Being alone, friendless, and under a torrent of emotional problems as a teenager in which your parents are the instigators of EVERY SINGLE source of pain really fucks you up. I started cutting myself, and started binge/purge routines, and was at the brink of committing suicide twice. I refused to try and lose weight for the longest time, because that was my one thing I had control over. When my peers were going out getting drunk underage or getting high, I was out getting extra food to binge on. This was my rebellion against the people who refused to show me unconditional support when I needed it the most.

I also considered joined the Marines sometime during college when my parents threatened to pull their financial support. Since they didn't allow me to work before or during college, they really had me at their mercy. The reason to their threats are not irrelevant for the story, but I'm sure many of you can make a quick conjectures. I didn't want to go home, and I definitely didn't want to go back to my parents, so I wanted to join the Marines (at least my life would've meant something). In order to join, there's a series of tests you need to pass, and one of them is doing pull-ups. I remember my goal was to get to 15. I had about 3 months to prepare before the current school session was over. I was able to do 3 at the time. For those three months, I worked my ass off, ate barely enough, and dropped about 50 pounds doing jump ropes. However, everything turned out okay and I was able to go back to school the next semester. I gained most of that weight right back. After I hit those 15 pull-ups, I was in such bad state that my doctor told me I can't do more jump ropes or else I am not gonna be able to use my knees (I did 100,000 - 120,000 jumps a day everyday). He also told me I had to eat. I was down to about 11% body fat. When my parents saw me in this state, they told me I finally looked decent. My friends were worried about my well-being ...

Fast forward to after college. Job market is crap, and my parents wanted me back home instead of staying at my college town (I moved halfway across the country to go to college, for obvious reasons). I had done some networking and had possible jobs I could've snagged, but they told me to come back home. The first thing (and I literally mean, the first thing) that came out of their mouths is ""how much do you weigh?"" They screamed and yelled and did what they do best on the drive home from the airport. Needless to say, it didn't even take me five minutes to get a rush of all the years of trauma I was put through when I was back here. To be fair, I had gained quite a bit of weight in college, and I knew that. At 6 feet tall, I was weighing about 230lbs.

My town is a suburban area with very small businesses. The only jobs available are the ones that pay you minimum wage for having a college degree. I found a shit job that will pay me half of what I can get in a real city, and have worked there for a little over year now. I still live at home because I don't make enough money to live independently, and I've been applying to jobs outside the city weekly. Believe me, I am trying. It just turns out that corporations now want interns to work for them for ""experience,"" which is bullshit because they basically just want someone to file papers for free. I can't afford to move to a city just so I can volunteer for someone who definitely can pay me. Essentially I'm stuck.

In that time, though, I've had my ups/downs managing my weight, mostly because I was still doing binge/purge routines, but I started to get a little more serious just for my own health. I weigh now around 210, but my body fat has gone down from 27.5% to right around 14.5-16%. It's not great, but it's not at risk. I can run a 6:30min mile, and I feel that my health is in adequate condition. There's definitely room to improve, but it's a world of difference. I feel better, and my waist has gotten considerably smaller. I didn't just lose 20 pounds - I actually am trying to take care of myself.

Today, my parents brought up my weight again (as they do every three-four days), and they made me stand on a scale in front of them. They told me I have done NOTHING to help myself lose weight, and told me I was a pig. I told them I've been carefully monitoring my fat loss, but they don't care. For them, it's all about the weight. And the more infuriating thing is that they equate fat with weight, so it's essentially like trying to argue with someone who's got his ears plugged and screaming ""NAH NAH NAH I CAN'T HEAR YOU."" 

My blood pressure has risen about 50 points since I've come back home, and I've been severely depressed for a long time. I try to contain a lot of it by resorting to alcohol, but here I am ...

Tonight I've relapsed back to cutting, and I'm kind of afraid that I'll go back to binge/purge. Maybe it's just the drunk me, but there's just nobody else that I know who will understand any of this. I'm not really asking for help. I just wanted to tell someone. I feel hopeless. Thank you for reading. I think I'll feel better tomorrow."

32jetv,3,2015-04-14,My GF (28F) gave me(31M) an ultimatum that blindsided me and took our relationship off track. Am I being unreasonable? What is a different perspective?,throwawayultimatums,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/32jetv/my_gf_28f_gave_me31m_an_ultimatum_that_blindsided/,"TS-Twin Sister

TSB- Twin Sister’s baby

**Background:** We have known each other for about 10 years, we have been dating for almost 9 months.
I’m currently working overseas at a good paying job, but I am tired of being without her, and she is back home. Back in Jan I found a perfect internship that matches my field of experience, the field I’ve been working in for over 5 years. Before I applied to this job I asked her if she would be willing to move with me, and that if she wasn’t I would come home and be with her. She was excited about the move and told me I was her home and she would love to go with me, so we began planning for this move and talking as best we could about where we want to live and what we can afford, etc. She has been on board since and our plan has always been a) to move for my new job if I’m hired, or b) that I move back to her if I don't get the job. So I prepped my resume and had it worked on professionally, I applied for the position and passed the initial interview and the second (board type) interview. I will know if I have the job in 2.5 weeks.

Here is where it gets understandably difficult. Her TS was pregnant and she went to her town for the birth and to help out anywhere she could. We were both so excited about this new baby coming into the world, I got them a crib and mattress with sheets and a changing station, the GF stocked up on the supplies (diapers and what not) so they would be as prepared as possible. We have both talked about marriage and kids being our next step very soon also. I want this woman in my life, she is perfect for me.

 After the birth there were complications that scared the shit out of both of us. But thankfully TS is a FUCKING champ and fought through.  I supported the GF and checked in on TS as much as I could, being that I’m 8.5 hours ahead and on the other side of the world. So I had my interview (via skype) on the same day as the birth and everyone wished me luck and I did well, and was told I’ll have an answer in 3 weeks or less. A few days pass with things going well and TS back home resting with a beautiful new baby. Then I wake up to these 3 messages from the GF. The messages are word for word with names and certain informing details removed or reworded in ()’s.



“Baby =) words don’t explain what you mean to me. I have to be honest. I was running late this morning because I overslept and even though we were busy at work, I found out TS was back in the er for a possible uti (She is now fine and back home, but they did not know it was a uti at first). So my day has been hectic and draining as hell. I’m still not sleeping well. I woke up many times last night with first instinct to check on someone, but no one was there. I also heard TSB and it breaks my heart (I’m guessing this was part of the dream/waking up disoriented). I can’t move to (place where my possible job will be). I have to move down to (place where TS lives). I can’t explain to you how I know this, but I do. Last night I dreamt you moved with me and we started a family. I’ve never felt so certain of a thing in my life. I don’t want to be selfish, but I want you to move to (place where TS lives) with me. TS and Husband own X apartments, and there are $xxx each. I don’t want to turn you away from this opportunity in (place where my possible job is), but I also feel if you don’t get the job, you know where you belong. I know you’ve been setting yourself up for success with the new place and opportunity, but something has happened inside me, and I NEED to be with my family, and I NEED you with me. We could get jobs in (where TS lives). “


“I hope I didn’t just hurt you. I can’t let you go, but I also know what I have to do. I pray so hard you do it with me.”


“In my dream you were determined. You came to me and we were together. Then we started our lives together”


My first response to these messages was to ask if she (TS) was ok, if everything was better now, since the time difference makes it almost impossible for me to stay up to date. 

The TS is recovering and is home now, thank god! She has begun her on family with her husband and beautiful new child, now my GF wants me to not take this opportunity if I get it and move with her. So to me this was given to me “as is” and with her mind made up, she did not discuss this or ever bring this up beforehand, and does not think she has given me an ultimatum. It has always been that she will move with me if I get this job or I will move back from overseas to her if I don’t get it. But now it has changed to what I view is “my way or the highway, I’m not moving with you now”. I just do not understand why it’s an ultimatum and why I wasn’t given an opportunity to have a say in the next step in our lives. I always discuss big changes with her and I ask her what she wants so we can make a decision together. I feel like I was robbed of this here. I understand that the event during the birth has scared her and made her reevaluate her life, I have supported her this whole time, and I am thankful that her TS is ok and recovering. But this wasn’t brought up to me for discussion until she had made her mind up. I was not consulted on what I wanted to do. I cannot turn down this career that will allow me to support a family to move to an area that has little to no job opportunities for me. 

My questions are:

What do I do?

Am I being unreasonable?

What will the next ultimatum be for me?

Is she just scared and not thinking rationally about “us” as a couple and only herself?

Am I the selfish one for wanting to follow our original plan that sets us up to start our own family?



I should say I am not opposed to moving to this new (small) town with her if I don’t get the job, and trying to find work, but it seems careless and not logical. The only problem is it is a “small town” and I do not believe it will afford me any opportunities to have a career that will allow me to provide for a family and own my on home and start my on family with her with stable income. That and I was NOT asked if I would move if I didn’t get the job, I was told that she is moving there “with or without me” and hopes I’ll (what I assume is withdrawal my application) move with her.  


**TLDR:** Did my GF give me an ultimatum that says move to this town with me or you lose me because I’m changing our plans and will not be moving with you. This feels like an expiration date on our relationship if I get the job and chose what seems to be the best choice for a future and a family with a stable income.


**EDIT**: Short edit, I called we talk and emotions were shared. I reached somewhat of an understanding for her. But I honestly don't know if she found one from me. I know what she has to do, I'll support how I can. I just wish the call would have ended better. At least we talked.

Thank you to everyone that took the time to read this."

I’m going to use this old reddit account to post this, as a sort of verification, even though I don’t use it anymore (don’t really like the name).

I got an internship! I start the end of this semester. I’m so fucking excited! I’m finally escaping all the bullshit jobs that lead to nowhere. I’ve worked so many crappy jobs from doing trades work, retail, and eventually computer repair. God damn internship nearly pays more money than the best paying job I’ve ever had. I actually got two internship offers, which is a real confidence booster btw.

You might be thinking, “What took so long?” Well, I was working fulltime at the time I made that last post, and eventually got laid off. With the help of a very supportive wife, I have been going to school fulltime ever since. To be honest, I should have had an internship last summer. I should have at least tried to get one, but instead I opted to take summer classes, which further got in the way of getting some meaningful side projects done. I was afraid to fail. I was afraid of rejection. Please don’t do that to yourself. Expect failure and get some experience in interviewing.

I cannot say the University path is for everyone. I dropped out of high school in 10th grade. It’s been a personal goal for me to prove to myself that I can do it. 

Like Tom said the movie Office Space: “Just remember... If you hang in there long enough, good things can happen in this world.”

32jter,3,2015-04-14,"Just sold my first bike - a 1989 Kawasaki ZXR250A. I'll miss it, here's a short story and some pics.",TGM,motorcycles,https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/32jter/just_sold_my_first_bike_a_1989_kawasaki_zxr250a/,"I just sold my first bike after owning it for six years.

First, some pics: http://imgur.com/a/XSZ7Z

It's a 1989 ZXR250A, for those that didn't get these imported it's a proper 250cc sportsbike. It has an inline four engine that revs to 19,000 RPM. It has adjustable suspension, upside down forks, weighs 140kg and makes 45hp. The cool intake tubes running into the petrol tank aren't ram air intakes. But they are functional! The direct air over the rectifier to keep it cool. The bike actually does have a ram air intake in the left mid fairing. It's got clip-on handlebars and sportsbike ergonomics.

Mine was great. I bought it for a great price because the fairings are cracked. I figured they gave me an extra 10kph in corners. 


These aren't a smart purchase for your first bike. All the ones that ended up in Aus are grey imports. They'll have their odometer wound back, may be assembled from parts of a few other wrecked bikes, and are generally abused by learners while they're on a restricted licence. They've all been to hell and back, pinned at redline, crashed and repainted many times, sold as new by dodgy importers.

But mine was great, I rode it for four years and it never missed a beat. I commuted on it, learned to do some maintenance on it myself, rode it hard through the twisties, even took it to a track day.


I did many stupid things with this bike:

* Letting it down after lubing the chain with the kickstand up; lucky I was on grass. 
* Letting a friend who ""can ride"" wobble it down the street and then drop it on themselves. 
* Locking the front wheel and saving it. 
* Hitting the curb at a trackday due to target fixation and saving the resultant tank-slapper. 
* Running it up to it's 19,000rpm redline with the muffler off. (I wanted to see what it would sound like, it was great!) 
* Struggling for ages to start it one night, finally getting it started, running like crap, ride halfway out the gravel parking lot and the tacho surges to 10,000rpm and the rear starts spinning, clutch in, save it, lock the front brakes for no reason after saving it and bin it anyway. Find out it just didn't have much petrol in the tank and rocking it downhill made it surge, drive to the servo still in leathers and fill up a jerry can, go for a ride in the twisties anyway because bugger it I wanted to ride.
* Riding it WOT everywhere because it makes bugger all power.
* Showing your friend how fast it can stop and doing an awesome stoppie by accident.
* Finding out the thermo fans don't work on the first day of a competitive intern-ship at a place I really wanted to work. The bike was running hot the last few k's of my commute through gridlocked city traffic. Sure I was filtering through but it still overheated and spewed half its coolant on the pavement outside my new workplace. Oh well, I bought some more at a petrol station nearby and rode home. I rode it in again the next morning. This time I filtered faster and it barely overheated.
* Riding to work in torrential rain with no visibility with nothing but a Bunning's poncho for wet weather gear, arrive soaked. (It turns into a cape at 60kph!)
* Getting caught after dark with a tinted visor 100km from home, it was twisties all the way and I lost track of time so I had to ride the twisties back with my visor up. When I got home I had a dark patch on my face where all the bugs hit me.

And it held up strong through all that abuse. It taught me so much about riding. I love this bike, it was so much fun and I'll always remember it. Maybe one day I'll buy another ZXR250 to turn into a track bike. 

I hope the new owner enjoys it as much as I did.


EDIT: Just got a message from the new owner, he loves it after riding it 118km home! It was his first ride after getting his learner's permit."

John sat nervously in the room. His shaky hands fumbled and twiddled with the paper thin sheet absently. As if that wafer thin plastic was going to prevent infection. Bah! To be honest, he felt rather exposed. He had ""donated' several samples to the hospital doctors with varying levels of discomfort and invasiveness. Donate didn't seem the right word when another man was fondling your groin and exploring your rectum. It just wasn't.

Oh yes, and the fact that he was wearing a bloody gown that opened at the back. John didn't know the reason it had to expose his recently stretched body part. John wanted to slap the person that felt the need to make such a ridiculously embarrassing gown. Must have been an angry doctor. Yeah, definitely. Little smarmy doctor was probably in Hell laughing at everyone and their exposed regions.

If he was honest with himself though, that wasn't why he couldn't sit still. Well it was, if a doctor asked if his team of bright faced and bushy tailed interns poke around in *any* orifice they'd be injured. John was waiting for his samples he 'donated' to come back. John was an average man in an average job and had average interests that would suit any average woman. Maybe one day there would be an average but smaller John running around. That's what he thought. He couldn't have kids. He'd went to the doctors, where the donation was less painful despite being under pressure, and his count was fine. Viscosity, motility and other words he sort of knew, all good. In fact the troopers were aggressive.

So after a lot of failures his wife left him for a normal, fertile man. John knew an isolation few knew. It was.. depressing. John felt disapproved by society. Disowned by evolution. He wanted to find an answer - WHY couldn't he give life. A few months of alcoholism later John realised the only thing that lay at the bottom of a bottle was his reflection staring back.

So John was here. He was a medical anomaly, so the chance to use him as a case study was great for them. John felt that being used was a good trade for an answer, he could bear it.

Instead of playing with the sheets or chewing the skin off his nails John laid back and closed his eyes. Within moments, he was asleep.

---

In the mists of his dreams John saw what he had always seen. A taste of what could have been.

John is sat on a bench while a swarm of children are playing in a nearby park. The sun is radiant, shining on his covered face. The sound of laughter reserved to children alone is music to this scene.

A tall redhead woman saunters up to John from behind and surprises him with a hug. The woman's elegant arms wrap around John's frame and for one brief moment he is truly happy. She whispers something inaudible into his ear but he still laughs anyway. He knows it was probably funny. A long pale arm stretches from the woman to a small girl in a pink dress. The flower in her hair is bobbing up and down with each step she jogs towards the couple.

Something is shouted and John runs towards the small girl. His long legs make short work of the distance and he falls to his knees arms open. The delighted girl giggles and jumps into his arm.

The girl never makes contact though. As soon as they are about to touch, the girl dissolves into mist and is carried away by the wind. The nearby trees follow suit and are sucked into the sky. John turns, terrified despite seeing this dream a thousand times, just in time to see the redhead collapse into mist and fall away. Dust in the wind. He lost them again.

When he turns around everywhere is a crisp cool white. A tormented scream joins the harsh pounding of his fists until cracks appear and start spreading like an infection. A final shout and a punch is all it takes.

The dream shatters.

---


A cool voice says 'Sir? Sir? Wake up please. You're screaming'.

'What? What do you want?' John notices the hand on his arm and shakes it away 'Don't touch me! Please.'

The fright in her eyes seems to recede a little. Good job John another woman hates you. Idiot. You miserable little pric-

'Okay. Your results are back. Would you like to see them now?'

Would I like to see them? Thought John. Of course I would! Wait. Would I? Do I want to know? Should I know?

'Yes please' John didn't want to say that. No he must have. He said it after all.

'Come this way then' The nurse turned and walked out the room.

John was so nervous he completely forgot about exposing his buttocks to the public. Hell, if he could have kids he'd cover himself in tar, jump in a pile of feathers and cluck the macarena if he had to.

The nurse led him through hallways and doors and rooms but John didn't really care. Maybe if she walked a little faster..

One last door and they were through. A white room contained a group of doctors speaking low and a pile of X-Ray scans and reports sat in the middle of a table. Looking over his shoulder, one doctor abruptly ended their talk and they all turned to face him. 

'Sir, may I call you John?' John flapped his arms and shrugged his shoulders.

'Ah good' The man smiled 'Well we've been examining the results of the tests we took and decided that we should.. consult you.'

'Right. Consult me how?' John asked slowly.

'Well' The middle doctor chimed in 'We've detected some, unusual results'

'Yes' Chimed in the stiff looking woman 'Very odd'

'Okay.. That means nothing to me. What anomalies?'

'You are not part of our species' Blurted out the middle doctor.

'Idiot. Why would you say it so brassy?' Chastised the left doctor.

'Hey you! Don't belittle him. John wants honesty' Defended the woman.

'Hey all of you! What the hell do you mean I'm a different species? I'm human you fool. Have I accidentally walked into the psych ward?' That seemed to strike a nerve with the left one.

'Well John you are not in the psychological evaluation ward' He said with a edge to his tone 'You are not the same species as us. We have analysed your donations; stool samples, bloodwork, *rectal bacteria* and everything else we can. You are not a homosapien'

'So that's why I can't have kids?' Asked John.

'Yes it is' answered the woman 'You are simply the 'next step' of our evolution, but you are incompatible. Like ducks and their ring species, you can't breed with-

'Wait' I hold a hand up to cut her off 'You just compared my infertility to a fucking duck? Are you an asshole? Don't answer.' John paced left and right before turning quickly
'Yes, you must be if I'm in this draughty gown. How can I fix this?'

'This isn't a problem John. You can't fix evolution.' Stated the middle doctor.

'Well I don't know, de evolve me?'

The left doctor sniggered and hid it with a cough. 

'Something funny?' Demanded John.

'No sir. Nothing.' The doctor replied calmy. Dick.

'What are my chances of finding a woman like me?' Asked John.

'At best..' Stared the middle doctor.

'Yes?'

'Almost zero.' Finished the woman.

'So I'm alone?' All three nodded. 'What else is new?'"
32jv7x,105,2015-04-14,"Me [23 F] with my flatmate [22 F] of 5 months, says that I don't pay enough rent to have family members sleep over, while she has friends crashing on the couch at least once a week. How can I diffuse the super tense situation resulting from this?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/32jv7x/me_23_f_with_my_flatmate_22_f_of_5_months_says/,"Hello r/relationships!

I've been a lurker for quite some time and while I really enjoyed reading insightful posts and comments, I did not think I would find myself in a situation worth sharing. But here I am!

I apologize for the wall of text - writing it all down helps me to distanciate myself from the situation.

Backstory: I moved in a foreign country for an internship 5 months ago, and thought my best option to meet locals / learn the language / have an affordable rent was to rent a room in a shared flat. I found my now flatmate, Caroline, through the leaving tenant (Berta) who posted an ad on a Facebook group. 

So two weeks before moving to this new country, it was decided I was going to live with Caroline. Now this is not a typical flatmate arrangement: the house is Caroline's mother's, and Caroline lives in the master bedroom, while the two other bedrooms are rented out (to me and Georges [25ish M]). This means that only Georges and me are paying rent, while Caroline, who basically grew up in this house, doesn't. Georges is basically out of the picture, because he lives in the basement and has a separate entrance. He only uses the bathroom (not the kitchen), and I barely see him at all. As for her, Caroline recently dropped school and I don't know if she works or have other activities.

When packing for living 6 months abroad, I was clueless about what I would need, so I messaged Caroline a few times, enquiring about the size of the bed (so I could bring the right bedsheets) and such. She never answered because she was very sick at the time. It bothered me a bit but I understood.

The day I arrived, she greeted me, gave me a tour of the house, showed me around the town, and took me to dinner and a beer with a few of her friends. It was a really really nice evening and I really hoped I could build a relationship with her and this group of nice people.

But the thing is: I didn't. In the following days, weeks, then months, we would barely exchange hellos and goodbyes. She would occasionnaly (once a month or so) tell me she was going at the X bar and that I could join her, but I am working a very demanding job and don't like to go out that much, so I would usually politely decline.

Quite often, he would bring a party of friends over (4 to 6 people) to drink beer, without ever warning me first. I don't have a desk in my room, so I usually work in the living room, and was obviously disturbed. When I wasn't working, I would try to engage discussions with them, but they would get bored of english 5 minutes in and continue speaking their native language, effectively excluding me of their conversations. In these cases, I would end up watching series in my room and sleep with earplugs to block the noise any party of 6 people casually conversing would make - not overly loud, but still not silent.

The morning after, I would usually find one or two of them sleeping on the couch. I totally understand that it would be safer for them to sleep over when they drank that much, but I was never aware of their presence, and would usually run into them in the morning while having breakfast or leaving for work.

Then, on the morning of my birthday, Caroline says she didn't know it was my birthday (she had a Facebook notification), and asked if I was planning to have a party or anything. I said I would go to a nice restaurant with my boyfriend who was visiting at the time. She says good, because her mother was hosting a huge family gathering in the house that night.

When we came back of the restaurant (around 11:30 pm), they were all still there. We went to bed and they loudly played boardgames until late in the night (2:00 am). My boyfriend is a light sleeper and was really annoyed by all this. I just sucked it up and slept with earplugs on.

At this point, I started complaning a lot about my flatmate and all the little things to my family and boyfriend. The latter tried to convince me to move out but I was reluctant because the rent is so cheap, the house so well located, and it's only for 6 months! I got frustrated about my flatmate not cleaning after herself (dishes piling up in the sink - when we have a dishwasher, tobacco leaves on the dining room table long after she has rolled herself a cigarette and left the house, beer cans everywhere in the kitchen and living room every morning), and being loud (using the blender at 9:00 am on weekends, playing records at odd hours, in the early morning or when she comes back from a party, playing cards and screaming late at night with her boyfriend, having loud sex with him and leaving her bedroom door open).

But now the situation is a bit different: my employer told me he would like to extend my contract by 6 months. I know I won't renew my lease with Caroline's mother, but I still have to find a new place for the beginning of June.

I know I'm obsessive when it comes to common space, so for some time I just tried to ignore her mess. But three months in or so I got tired of it and just started putting her dishes in the dishwasher, cleaning the dining room table when I needed to use it, and generally putting away the stuff she left lying around.

**To sum it up**, I grew more and more frustrated of our living arrangements, but never really sat to talk about it with her, because the few times I tried, she was in a hurry to leave, or she did not understand my english well enough, and always ended up making me feel bad (like this time she emptied the dishwasher for the first time in month, and told me that the pot was not dishwasher-safe).

**Now the problem is**, I invited my cousin [22 F] and her friend [24 F] to stay with me for a week last month. My room is big enough for three persons, and I told my flatmate they were coming one week before they arrived, which I thought was ok.

Caroline was really nice while my cousin was here, we had actual conversations (for the first time in months!), and the three of them even met at a bar and drank and chatted together.

Now my brother is visiting me for a week. When I told Caroline, she did not see very pleased, so I asked her what was wrong. She told me her mother was not ok me having people over because they weren't paying rent.

I was surprised Caroline's mother didn't call or write to me to tell it to me, but, very well, I sent her the following email:

&gt;Dear [Landlord],
&gt;Caroline brought to my attention it was a problem for you that I had my cousin and her friend stay with me for too long.
&gt;I did not realise it would be an issue for me to host my relatives in the room I rent when they are visiting me, since my contract does not forbid it.
&gt;I invited my brother to share my room next week while he is visiting. He will stay for a week.
&gt;In the meantime, my boyfriend will be here as well. 
&gt;I hope you understand that I do not mean to disturb anyone but only enjoy the company of my family.



And I fought that would be it, but she replied:


&gt;Hi and thank you for your letter.

&gt;Last year 2 girls were renting the room downstairs together. They paid higher rent because they were two.

&gt;I hope you understand that it's not the same having 1 person in the room or 3 persons, even though it's only from time to time. When people have been renting the rooms in my house it is always clear that there are 2-3 other persons in the house.

&gt;My daughter brought it to my attention that it was very difficult to shower when your cousins were in the house since there were so many people showering.

&gt;I hope you understand that it's not about what it says in the contract, but about mutual respect for flatmates and that everybody can feel well at home, that is very important to me.

&gt;I understand that it can be really nice to have some family/friends visiting, but when it's 2+ at a time it would be respectful to find another accomodation for them. Then it is of course no problem to have them over for dinner or whatever.

&gt;Airbnb.com and couchsurfing.com can be a really easy solution and most often no problem to find something close to the house.

Well I'm astonished: Caroline did never ever complain to me about showering. What is going on?
Moreover, her mother tells me about mutual respect when I never felt like Caroline had some for me.

It is not possible for me to accomodate my brother somewhere else, because he is underage.

I see two problems here: money problem with the mother, respect problem with the daughter.
I think I will offer the mother to double my daily rent for the lenght my brother stay, but I don't really know how to deal with Caroline.

Any advise would be very welcomed, I am very confused and torn in this situation. I would really appreciate you help, r/relationships!

I am serioulsy considering moving out. I paid my last month (may) of rent as a security deposit, so I would propably loose it.
 
**tl;dr**: I live rent a room abroad in my flatmate's mother house. I pay rent and she doesn't. I feel like she does not make it easy for us to live together and I clearly don't feel at home. When I said I invited my brother over for a week, she reffered me to her mother who says it is not respectful to have too many people living in the house for too long, and that I don't pay for it. I don't really know what to do apart from moving out before the end of my lease (in a month)."
32jxvb,2,2015-04-14,My GF (28F) gave me(31M) an ultimatum that blindsided me and took our relationship off track. Am I being unreasonable? What is a different perspective?

TSB- Twin Sister’s baby

**Background:** We have known each other for about 10 years, we have been dating for almost 9 months.
I’m currently working overseas at a good paying job, but I am tired of being without her, and she is back home. Back in Jan I found a perfect internship that matches my field of experience, the field I’ve been working in for over 5 years. Before I applied to this job I asked her if she would be willing to move with me, and that if she wasn’t I would come home and be with her. She was excited about the move and told me I was her home and she would love to go with me, so we began planning for this move and talking as best we could about where we want to live and what we can afford, etc. She has been on board since and our plan has always been a) to move for my new job if I’m hired, or b) that I move back to her if I don't get the job. So I prepped my resume and had it worked on professionally, I applied for the position and passed the initial interview and the second (board type) interview. I will know if I have the job in 2.5 weeks.

Here is where it gets understandably difficult. Her TS was pregnant and she went to her town for the birth and to help out anywhere she could. We were both so excited about this new baby coming into the world, I got them a crib and mattress with sheets and a changing station, the GF stocked up on the supplies (diapers and what not) so they would be as prepared as possible. We have both talked about marriage and kids being our next step very soon also. I want this woman in my life, she is perfect for me.

 After the birth there were complications that scared the shit out of both of us. But thankfully TS is a FUCKING champ and fought through.  I supported the GF and checked in on TS as much as I could, being that I’m 8.5 hours ahead and on the other side of the world. So I had my interview (via skype) on the same day as the birth and everyone wished me luck and I did well, and was told I’ll have an answer in 3 weeks or less. A few days pass with things going well and TS back home resting with a beautiful new baby. Then I wake up to these 3 messages from the GF. The messages are word for word with names and certain informing details removed or reworded in ()’s.



“Baby =) words don’t explain what you mean to me. I have to be honest. I was running late this morning because I overslept and even though we were busy at work, I found out TS was back in the er for a possible uti (She is now fine and back home, but they did not know it was a uti at first). So my day has been hectic and draining as hell. I’m still not sleeping well. I woke up many times last night with first instinct to check on someone, but no one was there. I also heard TSB and it breaks my heart (I’m guessing this was part of the dream/waking up disoriented). I can’t move to (place where my possible job will be). I have to move down to (place where TS lives). I can’t explain to you how I know this, but I do. Last night I dreamt you moved with me and we started a family. I’ve never felt so certain of a thing in my life. I don’t want to be selfish, but I want you to move to (place where TS lives) with me. TS and Husband own X apartments, and there are $xxx each. I don’t want to turn you away from this opportunity in (place where my possible job is), but I also feel if you don’t get the job, you know where you belong. I know you’ve been setting yourself up for success with the new place and opportunity, but something has happened inside me, and I NEED to be with my family, and I NEED you with me. We could get jobs in (where TS lives). “


“I hope I didn’t just hurt you. I can’t let you go, but I also know what I have to do. I pray so hard you do it with me.”


“In my dream you were determined. You came to me and we were together. Then we started our lives together”


My first response to these messages was to ask if she (TS) was ok, if everything was better now, since the time difference makes it almost impossible for me to stay up to date. 

The TS is recovering and is home now, thank god! She has begun her on family with her husband and beautiful new child, now my GF wants me to not take this opportunity if I get it and move with her. So to me this was given to me “as is” and with her mind made up, she did not discuss this or ever bring this up beforehand, and does not think she has given me an ultimatum. It has always been that she will move with me if I get this job or I will move back from overseas to her if I don’t get it. But now it has changed to what I view is “my way or the highway, I’m not moving with you now”. I just do not understand why it’s an ultimatum and why I wasn’t given an opportunity to have a say in the next step in our lives. I always discuss big changes with her and I ask her what she wants so we can make a decision together. I feel like I was robbed of this here. I understand that the event during the birth has scared her and made her reevaluate her life, I have supported her this whole time, and I am thankful that her TS is ok and recovering. But this wasn’t brought up to me for discussion until she had made her mind up. I was not consulted on what I wanted to do. I cannot turn down this career that will allow me to support a family to move to an area that has little to no job opportunities for me. 

My questions are:

What do I do?

Am I being unreasonable?

What will the next ultimatum be for me?

Is she just scared and not thinking rationally about “us” as a couple and only herself?

Am I the selfish one for wanting to follow our original plan that sets us up to start our own family?



I should say I am not opposed to moving to this new (small) town with her if I don’t get the job, and trying to find work, but it seems careless and not logical. The only problem is it is a “small town” and I do not believe it will afford me any opportunities to have a career that will allow me to provide for a family and own my on home and start my on family with her with stable income. That and I was NOT asked if I would move if I didn’t get the job, I was told that she is moving there “with or without me” and hopes I’ll (what I assume is withdrawal my application) move with her.  


**TLDR:** Did my GF give me an ultimatum that says move to this town with me or you lose me because I’m changing our plans and will not be moving with you. This feels like an expiration date on our relationship if I get the job and chose what seems to be the best choice for a future and a family with a stable income.

Below are a couple tangible pieces of advice that you can use to better your chances in the CS job market. 


**Commit to Tasks You Are Not Sure You Can Complete**

This might sound a little counter-intuitive, but hear me out. Last summer, a couple of my buddies were looking to start a business to gain some experience, and they needed an iOS application. I had never made an iOS application, but I committed to doing it because I wanted to learn. I struggled the whole way through it, but by the end of the summer I had published my first iOS application, and gained a new valuable skill. By committing to making the app, I could not give up when I started to struggle, and was forced to find solutions to my problems. 

**Learn Design**

Look around you right now. Unless you're reading this post in the middle of the desert, chances are everything you see was designed. By understanding design, you understand why certain choices were made in the creation of an object. You are able to look at products critically and figure out how to make them better. 

In the Computer Science field, being a good designer makes you doubly valuable. Design gives you the skills to put your ideas down on paper, communicate them to others, and ultimately execute them. In today's world of ubiquitous computing, it is more critical than ever that software products are designed well, otherwise consumers will stay away. At the very least, you'll be able to make your resume look snazzy. 

**Reach Out**

Your network can be just as valuable as your skills in landing you a job. These days, it is easier than ever to reach out to industry professionals. Find someone who has the career you want and figure out how to connect with them. You would be surprised how nice and helpful people will be when you are passionate and excited about what they do. It's a low-risk high-reward move. 

**Be Confident, Smile**

I know, it's easier said than done. Often, it seems as though everyone around you knows more than you do - and they might. But that's okay. Be honest about what you do and do not know, and ask questions when you are confused. Stay open to new ideas, and voice your own. 

I cannot stress enough the importance of being a good communicator, and we all know how much of communication is non-verbal. By smiling, you make yourself much more approachable, and put whoever you are communicating at ease. You should your enthusiasm and comfort. The smile is a powerful tool - use it.  


Hope this was helpful!"

First of all, im an incoming freshman from mexico. I'm accepted to 2 colleges: Oklahoma state, and SUNY at buffalo.

My problem is money. OSU gave me enough scholarship that i can attend without any further help, but i can go to UB as of right now, as i am short some ~$10k. Loans arent exactly an option, since they work differently than in the US.

Thing is, i have the option of a scholarship/loan that will pay for the rest of the cost of UB for me, but i have to come back and work for the government here in Mexico for at least 5 years. 

My goal in college was to find a job in the US and stay there for my adult life (or europe, but i dont want to ccome back to mexico).

The dilemma is that i dont really feel like i would be at home at OSU, and i MUCH prefer UB, but if i go to OSU, i can stay there later and find a good internship and job after college. If i go to UB it will be much harder to try and move back to the US later.

Im not sure what option is best, i've heard that it's hard for an internationa student (engineering) to get a job out of college, even if working hard. Is it worth going to the college i like more, even if it means having to give up on what has been a ""dream"" of sorts for my entire life?"

So I ended up breaking up with him 7 days ago, after asking to meet up to talk things through but he refused to because 'you're going to break up with me and I'd rather you do it now'. I wasn't planning on breaking up with him, per se, but that was the final straw as he just *assumed*.

The last week has been refreshing and chaotic. I've met with friends, I didn't feel guilty for doing my own things and that bad ex I have  straight up apologised out of the blue and we talked it through, deciding it's better to be civil than making our friends feel awkward. He even confessed he had been to therapy and was on meds. It was sincere, I doubt I can ever forgive him for some of the hell he put me through, but I put it behind us. I even grabbed myself an internship.

Where as the boyfriend (or ex-boyfriend now, I suppose) had instantly gone back to getting stoned and bumming out. But I get that to a point. I've been pretty up and down with being upset so we decided to talk it out in person today. Bad idea. It was too late, at least for me. There were tears, words that I didn't quite believe and a lot of things that reminded me of why I felt crap in the first place. 'I don't care about your *friends*, I care about you.', 'I don't like change, it scares me so I don't try' and 'I don't know how to focus on my future'.

One part of me is relieved because there's no nagging texts or the guilt I felt when I was with him. But I'm also sad because I feel like a villain and I'm worried he'll start doing stupid things to himself because I'm gone. He was my best friend and now we're strangers.

But giving it another try seemed exhausting and I think going with my gut is a good idea. Even though my gut seems to have a mind of it's own at the moment and I'm still pretty uncertain whether it's good or not. 

**tl;dr**: Ended up breaking up with him. Pretty bummed, but I think it's for the best. Still pretty bummed though. "

I got a phone interview coming up for a Python developer position at a company that I really, really like in an industry I'd love to be a part of. It's working on back end web services and servers for high-load applications, using stuff like Twisted, Django, and Memcached. 

I'm one year out of college, working on my masters part time, and I've been a java software engineer for a year now at my current company, working on similar types of applications (high-load, back end web servers and services). I actually use python a fair amount at my current job (made/extended on a django server, write a lot of scripts and templating in python), we also use memecached, and I've worked on developing a proprietary event-driven architecture similar to Twisted, and I used python a couple years back in a systems engineering internship, as well as here and there in personal projects/scripts.

I personally really like the language of python and have no ties to any single language as a software engineer, so I'm pumped for this opportunity. I'd like to know if anyone has questions that I should PRIMARILY look out for related to the language of python. I've been crunching on review lately, so any/all help or references are useful.

Also, they're also a python 3.x shop, and I've done a lot of 2.x work in the past, so what should I look out for/anticipate primarily in the structural differences between the two?

Thanks for any tips!"

I never did an internship and my GPA was relatively low (&amp;lt;3.0) so when it came to find a job after graduation, I accepted essentially my first offer as a .NET developer. At the time I was pretty low on myself and didn't feel like I had the ability to negotiate my salary or anything like that, so I took their initial offer of $42,000 (in a low-ish cost of living area in the south). 


My issue is that I have an enormous amount of debt, about $90,000 total (mostly student loans and some credit card debt) that I am having a terrible time paying off with my currently salary. I know the best way from here to increase my salary is to look for another job but here are my questions with that:


1. I started at the end of July last year. Wouldn't it look bad and make it more difficult for me to get another job since I have relatively little experience? My original plan was to stay for at least 2 years, but it's looking more like I need to change sooner rather than later, so should I at least finish out my first full year?


2. I really like my current job and the people I work with. I learn quite a bit each day and generally feel challenged. I'm almost scared to look into getting anther job because I fear that other places won't have as good of an atmosphere/work environment. Is this something I should really be worried about or should my top priority be finding a higher salary ASAP?


3. Would it be best for me to look for another .NET developer job since that's the experience I have so far? I actually like it a lot, but I'm early enough in my career that I can change tracks, right?


4. Can I realistically expect to be able to make more with my education and current work experience? Ideally I would want to make roughly $55,000 (in a lower cost of living area) but I'm not sure if I'm quite at that level yet. 

I'm sure I'm forgetting something else that I've had questions about so if you have any other general advice, let me know!"

I feel like that's arguably the most important part of all this, the practical knowledge aspect of how to actually *do* all the little things that are undoubtedly asked of you in a professional environment. 

&amp;nbsp;

I am lucky enough to have an internship where I can learn pretty much anything I want right now, but I'm the only tech/code/webdev oriented person here. I have an opportunity to make a website for a pretty decently sized company, but I have no idea how to do much else than actually make the pages, and I don't have anyone to ask any of this. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not sure if I want to make a career out of web dev, as I gravitate toward programming and really enjoy that aspect of things (that and I am not particularly skilled in design aspects- I am definitely not an artist!), but while I have the opportunity, I figure I might as well seize the chance to learn new stuff! 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here's my question, I guess: Where and how did you learn this type of information? If one were to try to learn this outside of a professional environment, how could they go about finding the resources to do so? 

I would be incredibly appreciative if you could point me to the resources to learn this kind of thing, whatever and wherever they may be! "

I’m a 28 year old male, and I am sick and tired of working in the food service industry. I graduated in December with a Bachelor’s degree in English Literature and minor in English Education, and I really want some help figuring out what I can do with those degrees. 

Originally, I wanted to be a teacher, but I couldn’t major in Education because that would require taking time off of work to intern with a public school, something I could not do. My advisors also recommended that I pursue literature with education as a minor, as it would allow me to be more well-versed in the field of study rather than in the field of education (classroom management, lesson planning, etc.)

Simply put, I don’t know where to go from here. I just moved to Pennsylvania from Florida, and all the teachers I worked with in Florida told me not to get into education, perhaps because of how backwards the school system is down south. I don’t mind doing any job really, so long as it’s professional, it’s Monday-Friday, and there’s room to grow. I have a tremendous work ethic and I’m willing to prove myself.

So what do I do? I’ve sent out resumes to over a dozen places over the last few weeks, none of which contacted me again about employment. I feel like my degree doesn’t mean nearly as much as I thought it would, and I’m considering returning back to school for my Master’s degree, but is it even worth spending the money?
How does a regular, well-read, educated guy find a good job that he can grow with and support his future family with? Waiting tables isn’t my life dream, so where should I look, and what should I do?

Coming from a small public school it was pretty hard getting an interview at companies like Deloitte that hire entry level Business Analysts. 


With my credentials I easily got interviews in QA and Software Implementation. I decided to go with this role because it gives me exposure to client requirements and good industry knowledge (wealth management and capital markets). I have  a CAPM certification by PMI and doing a certification in Business Analysis from a well known university. 


My job is a bit boring and monotonous, the only saving grace is my team and work environment. But I feel I can do better and use my skills to handle client requirements and design solutions. 


On paper I am qualified for the jobs that I apply to i.e 0-2 years of experience (I have 2+).

After having trouble finding an internship for a while, I finally found one, but didn't apply this to the degree. After a while of working as a mechanic, some serious medical issues and an overall huge dislike for the job, I left and decided to try studying IT since computers were the only other thing I really have knowledge of.

Just fumbling my classes has been a huge stress in my life, I can't imagine how much of a wreck I would be if I had to juggle a job on top of that. Just for a little background info, I have multiple sclerosis so being under high stress is really not good for me and these last few weeks I have been in pain. On the plus side, my family is pretty well off, so supporting my bad decisions has not been an issue, but I am ridden with guilt about how much of their money I have effectively pissed away with nothing to show for it.

I feel like ranting a little bit.

My parents are basically toxic people. They fight with each other most of the time and are emotionally manipulative. Mom in particular likes to guilt trip me whenever I mention wanting to go somewhere or do something else other than go home for a school break. It's always something like, ""But don't you like us? You always want to spend time with your boyfriend and never us. You're so ungrateful for all the things we've done for you.""

More background: I have an awesome boyfriend who lives 1000 miles away and I only see him a handful of times a year. We've been dating over two years now and we've been talking about getting married after he moves here. (If all goes well, that is, but I'm pretty sure it will). My parents aren't very supportive of my relationship with him for very petty reasons (""he's so boring and he has a big nose and he's too quiet""), but they haven't been as huge jerks about that since he had open heart surgery at the age of 23 a few months back. Frankly, I think we're doing really well considering that we're never actually in the same room.

BF's family loves me a lot and I think they're kind of assuming that I am going to be part of their family eventually. His mom knows how crazy my parents are and she's even offered to let me stay for the summer if I don't land an internship. My parents know that the offer is there, but they don't know that I genuinely plan on taking it if Plan A doesn't happen. If they really knew, they'd freak out about how improper it is to live with a guy before you're married or some crap like that.

Whatever the result, I can't/won't go home for summer. At least not for long. Every time I do, my depression and anxiety skyrocket. I can't be around these people. It's even gotten to the point where I think about suicidal things, and that was so scary. I have no car, few friends, and little privacy back home. (Parents like to barge into my room unannounced. I can't even rub it out without fear!)

My parents don't understand boundaries and they don't understand that I am my own person. I don't know what to do to stop them from freaking out about virtually all my decisions. I probably can't do much. But I'm tired of feeling like everything I do is wrong and I'm never doing enough. Idk. Do you guys have any life advice?

Edit: Here's why I can't go NC after graduating. I have a crazy BPD grandpa who is rich. We're talking millions here. He's almost 90 and in an assisted living place.

I have a pretty good CS GPA as is, though it should be around 3.5 come time to apply to jobs. Experiences are good; After this summer I will have interned at three different companies, all of which have said they'll give me positive recommendations. I have a few significant projects under my belt, although NDAs have prevented me from being able to discuss them in-depth. I've got a couple of ""meh"" personal projects.  I've also performed research for the past two years under the same professor where I've helped developed a fairly large codebase (unfortunately can't discuss that in-depth either). 

After speaking to advisors, I've realized that I can feasibly attain both math and econ BAs. Ideally, with these degrees, I'd like to land a job at a financial banking institution as a software dev or something along those lines. I've discussed this with professors, and got some positive feedback. I've also discussed this with a group of my CS friends, and they seem to be against the idea. 


My line of thinking is: 

1+ year at uni means = another internship, more personal projects, another year of research, another year of hackathons, and of course two more degrees. 

But that also means that I lose a year's worth of salary. However, the question ""is it even worth it?"" comes into play.

Is it best to stay with 1-2 languages your whole career because you are good at them? Or should you keep knowledge of as many as you can to look for other job opportunities?

Does it pay better to stay with one company and progressively raise your salary? Or look for other jobs doing different things as new languages come about?

32mdjx,1088,2015-04-14,"The security filter, the manglement and the unfiltered intern",dtvhr,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/32mdjx/the_security_filter_the_manglement_and_the/,"Hi guys, first time poster, long time lurker, big time fan of Bytewave.


This is a story that was told to me by the guys at our Ops department where I work.


A few years ago, they worked at an online and phone based gambling company, which we'll call GamblingHQ. It was a good set up, similar to most modern gambling companies, you could set up an online account and bet that way or call into the company call center and get your bet over the phone.


One of the staff in the call center was a fresh from secondary school (high school for you guys in the U.S) kid who we'll call Shane. Now Shane was a quiet guy, he worked in the call center and was in a 2 month long internship. (GamblingHQ had an internship set up where if you weren't up to scratch after 2 months on the job, they could let you go)


 Apparently he kept to himself but was great with customers over the phone, had decent statistics for times on calls and could figure out most basic technical errors with customers over the phone.


However, it seems that he had a hidden talent for coding, and by hidden talent, I mean he was a coding wizard, he could probably write code to make lightning shoot out of a screen if you showed him how. 


*The guy had been teaching himself how to code since he was 9, he was fluent in Assembly, Basic, C+, Haskell, HTML, Python, Java and Java Script. *

*How did this talent come out?* Well the call center had a fairly open internet system with an internally calibrated filter that looked for specific keywords or images, you could browse most sites but if you hit a site that was considered out of bounds i.e an adult website with XXX in the title, it would be flagged with your manager. If you hit a site that was considered a security breach, IT and Security were notified. 

The only problem was that the filter wasn't always calibrated correctly, and completely innocent sites would sometimes send a hit to the managers/manglement. **Too many hits with the filter, explainable or not and you were fired.** 


There was basically a no tolerance policy for 'dirty' internet browsing. Indeed, a couple of brand new staff were let go after a week for accessing sites like youtube or dailymotion to watch football matches.


**However, if you use a site that opens up computer programming that wasnt recognised i.e manual entries, there was a filter in place that would not only shut down your computer remotely, but would send an immediate lockdown to the network, meaning only managers who had a password clearance could go online until this lock was lifted.** 

Certainly an overkill of a filter but the company had over 2 million customers and this call centre alone had over 300 employees so they could be forgiven for being cautious.


This also sends a silent email alarm to HR, Security, IT and most management so its documented.

Cue the manhunt as poor Shane is pounced on by his managers and two members of IT security. He is brought to a room and promptly questioned thoroughly while they pull up his internet history and remove his computer to check for infected files or outside data from a usb stick.


Keep in mind, this guy is 18, and is mostly being asked about hardware as everyone thinks he had outside material, no one thought he was trying to learn coding. It wasnt until the IT staff pulled up his history that they saw what was going on.

Throughout his browsing was a ton of learning how to code webpages, mostly manual education that you can learn with notepad or an online system.

Soon the questioning turned from hardware to software and coding as IT security took over and asked about his knowledge of programming languages, they were duly impressed by his array of knowledge and soon found out what had happened.


Shane had begun to use a new site to learn a set of 'Lamb expressions' in Python (feel free to correct me on that term if I'm wrong) and it turned out that his site generated a set of programming that triggered the security filter into thinking that he was accessing programming on the computer itself, causing the lock down.


The questioning continues and Shane actually shows a lot of knowledge for someone of such young years, he actually pulled out a textbook on Python programming that he had bought. There is a good giggle from IT, which just makes the Managers angry as they can barely understand half of the terms being used i.e Syntax, iterations and standard deviation. 


When what happened came to light, and was explained in laymans terms to his managers, they promptly informed him that due to the massive security breach, they would be letting him go.


The IT staff tried to fight for him explaining that it was a false alarm but Manglement wouldnt budge an inch.

&gt; MGT: No we're letting him go, we have a zero tolerance policy on this, especially with a security breach of this magnitude.



&gt; IT: But it wasnt a breach, hell we'll put it in writing that it was an error on our side.




&gt; MGT: Hes still going, its going to take ages to get that network out of lockdown (*It wouldnt, takes all of 3 minutes once IT are aware*)  


So Shane is let go, no severance, no reference, just told to pack his backpack up and to leave. He grabs his textbook, backpack and a couple of pens, says his goodbyes and heads for the lift.

He doesnt make it to the parking lot before he gets stopped by the head of IT, apparently what happened with the security breach got sent over to him and he brought Shane to his office for an impromptu interview.


In there, the formal part of the interview lasts all of 5 minutes before they both just start talking programming in the same way a Miami Heat fan would talk about the playoffs or a Manchester United fan would talk about Wayne Rooney: Passionately. They talk about programs they have both designed and dream projects


They talk for about an hour, and this is the head of IT for the entire call center that Shane is speaking to, a man more than 25 years his senior, and he is enthralled, all hes doing is asking Shane questions and throwing out scenarios and Shane is talking about Java and Assembly like he wrote the languages and cracking jokes about documentation in Python.


&gt; ITHEAD: Shane in all my time, I've never met someone so young who just 'gets' programming, you just seem to have a knack and a passion for it, listen I have an opening here in our department and I want to see if you're a good fit. Can you be here tomorrow around 10am to meet with the rest of the group?
&gt; Shane: I'm sure I can find the time.

In the end, Shane was hired as an IT intern but was soon promoted to work on the filter system in the call center. He soon had it set up correctly so it would only be triggered by adult material or unrecognized files....and he even managed to find out that one of the managers was embezzling from the company. *But thats a story for another day*


**TL:DR** Call center intern accidentally triggers network lockdown, turns out to be computer programming version of Gandalf the Grey, gets thrown into the depths of Moria by the Balrog known as Manglement, gets saved by the magic of IT, is reborn as IT intern the White.

Edit: Well this blew up, I'll try and get the follow up post on the embezzlement up in the next few days and post the link here. IT Intern the White will return.

Also......holy crap, I got gold for this? Thank you :)

Is it something that companies typically don't expect too much and aren't relatively too difficult to get? Are interviewing processes for internships lengthy and include some technical portions?

I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

TL:DR questions are below wall of text. 

I've just turned 25 a few days ago and I am really serious about taking my career to the next level. I sadly still live with my Mom because I live in a crappy small town with nothing to do but go to bars full of hicks and chance a DUI going home. My girlfriend is graduating in May and both of us would really love to get out of here and possibly live in Philly. 

I have a BS degree and I am the manager of a small computer shop. I hate it. The company loses money too easily and I don’t agree with a lot of the owner’s ideals. Furthermore I hate fixing things. What I once enjoyed now and then has turned into a massive source of stress. What’s worse is I know what I’m doing is stupidly easy and I’m hardly using even 10% of my brain power to do it. Any idiot can run a virus scan. Yet people here are so stupid we do it for them for a little under a hundred bucks. I wasted several years in retail and a call center full time as well while suffering through 6 years of college. I hated all of it. Now that my SO is graduating I feel it’s finally time to leave this rat’s nest and pursue something greater!

I want to eventually create mobile apps and videogames. However I am willing to take a more business related position for simply the experience and pay. I didn’t get to intern at all during college because work took up the rest of my free time so I have limited real world experience. In college I took as many programming classes as I could but the classes were mostly, stare at a power point and copy and paste type learning. During those years I did work with VBasic, Javascript, C#, HTML, PHP, and CSS. That’s pretty much the limit of the college I went to and regretfully it was due to family peer pressure and fear of getting scammed by going for a game design degree that may not be worth the paper it’s printed on. Regardless this is what I want to do. Regular IT is just too dull and I can’t stand much more of it. I understand it will be stressful and I may be tasked with a lot of work but if the pay is right and I can finally have a job that requires me to think, I’m willing to do it.  I want to create awesome applications and games someday, even if they are just steam indie games and mobile apps. I’m currently teaching myself C++ with the intention to create a simple side scroller game with my cousin in the summer as a fun project. I also downloaded UNITY and Unreal engine to learn more on the game development side of things. I intend to dabble with android development soon too. 

I apologize for the long wall of text but I just thought I should get that all out of the way so you understand my circumstances. 

TL:DR 
My Questions: 

1.	Is it possible to practice and get good enough to get an entry level job by this fall? 
2.	What type of questions will I be asked for a typical Phone/Skype interview? 
3.	I was told it’s not the language you know but how you think. I’m currently learning C++. Anything else you’d recommend for someone with my interests?  
4.	Does anyone know if programming jobs are abundant in Philadelphia, PA? 
5.	What can kind of pay and hours should I expect? Small Business and Corporate examples if you have any. 

That’s all I have for now. 


Thanks for any of your help and advice.

This private school consistently has one of the top 5 bar pass rates in the country and has a phenomenal state alumni network. Class sizes and the student body are small. Prestigious externships and internships are nearly guarenteed.

B) A state school who has a somewhat below average bar pass rate. Their alumni network is solid but lacks the luster of option A. Their tuition is $13k per year and I did not receive a scholarship. Here my loans would be $35k per year. This school is quite larger than option A as are the class sizes.


I have the option to live at home with my mom for either option. However, I am really, *really* not super excited about this idea though I understand it could save me around $6k per year in loans. Obviously with the option to live at home, I don't have to take either loan in the full amount. Additionally, considering the fact that I certainly want to go into criminal law, the public service debt forgiveness is an option I will very seriously consider. I have heard that this can be an income based plan that many can't afford though.


Basically, what it boils down to is this: I want to go to school A. Is the debt worth it?"

For this RP I'd like for you to play my Dad's boss, whom he convinces to give me an 'internship' with. Naturally, given my nature and girly looks, this leads to me becoming your 'personal assistant' AKA your sissy lover that serves your every sexual whim, no matter how perverse or humiliating.

How we get to this point, how it progresses, and how humiliating and twisted it gets, I'd like to come up with my partner. We should have a detailed discussion about it before we start playing. For this reason I'd prefer if we could use chatzy or STC.

Some of my kinks are: feminization, light ageplay, dub/non-con, lingerie, trading pics, sloppy oral, lots of toys, being DPd, cumplay, etc.

I hope you enjoy this idea and PM me, sirs!"
32myya,2,2015-04-14,The Rpg Academy - An introduction,RpgAcademy,DnD,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/32myya/the_rpg_academy_an_introduction/,"Hello all,
 I have noticed that on an almost daily basis and certainly more than weekly someone on here asks about podcasts and wants recommendations for some good ones. With few exceptions mine is not among the ones recommended (unless I do it). Now, in addition to being a podcaster I am also a fan of podcasts and I do listen to most of the ones that are often and highly recommended (NPC Cast, One-Shot, Campaign, Adventure Zone, Nerd Poker - though until Sark comes back as DM I can't in good conscious recommend Nerd Poker. I love me some Blackie Green, but Blaine as DM is painful!)
So, I thought rather than just poke and prod my way into those comments I'd give you a full introduction and explain why I think my podcast is, in its own way(s) just as good as any of those and maybe, just maybe, I won't be the lone voice in the darkness.
In no particular order, here are some reasons why I think you should give us a shot:

1. Variety.  We have a little something for everyone on our shows.  Our Main show is called Table Topics (formally Dungeon Talk) and this is our general advice and discussion shows. We started the podcast right as the DnD Next play test was starting so we have covered it quite extensively. While we are not a ""5e"" podcast we do talk about it a lot and fair amount of our advice is aimed at that system.  When we first started the show my original co-host was just starting out as a DM so a lot of our shows was talking about his first DM'ing attempts and doing a critical review of what happened good/bad. So a lot of people are asking about how to start being a DM can listen to his journey and gain some insight.  I have a new co-host now who is very focused on the rules and mechanics. We call him the Crunch Master while I go by Prof. Fluff so you can get a good discussion back and forth from us about various GM'ing styles and philosophies.
    We have a series of shows that are our Actual Plays. We call these The Campaigns. We have 2 that are from the DnD Next Play test packets and have started several more. Some are still going on and others have died. We have a series of 13th age games that is between seasons, a FAE Deadlands that many of our listeners think is our best, we started a Star Wars Edge of the Empire game that has since died, but has about 10 episodes. We have two newer 5e series that are getting really good responses from our current listeners and are working on more.  We produce a lot of content.
     We have another series of shows called The Trials. This is where we try out new gaming systems (either new to us or brand new, maybe as in being Kickstarted). With these shows you get exposed to new systems just as we do. We've done. Star Wars Edge of the Empire, Dungeon World, Numenera, 13th Age, Savage Worlds, Neon Sanctum and Shadow of the Demon Lord (one of my all time favorites).
      We have a series of shows called Show &amp; Tell, these are where we bring on guests and talk to them about new projects and such. (full disclosure: we only recently made this a separate show so most of these are titled as a Table Topic). We've had on Rich Baker when Primeval Thule was being Kickstarted, we interviewed Robert Schwalb about Shadow of the Demon Lord (again, one of my favorite episodes ever), Nolan from Roll20 has been on multiple times as just recently Adam Koebel as their new GM of Roll20. We've talked to the Director and EP of The Of Dice and Men movie as well as many other Kickstarters).
     Finally we have our Movie Day episodes which is where we have watched some RPG or DnD related movies and then gave them a review.  We try very hard to be positive on our shows and if we don't like something we just don't talk about it - Movie Day is the exception.
2. Quality. We've had our rough patches like many shows and our quality has gone up and down over time but I think our current show quality is as good as any other 'hobby' podcast you'll hear. We don't have an intern working the controls like some of the bigger shows but I spend a lot of time editing them down. We cut out a lot of the boring stuff like rules look up (unless it's important) and ummm's and ahhh's and often even dice rolling. 
3. Our catalog. IF and I do realize that there is a big IF, you like us we have over 200 episodes for you to go back and listen too. We release on average 2 episodes a week so there is almost always something new to listen too.
4.Communication. we have a small but growing community and Caleb and I are very active on Twitter. We field questions and interact with our listeners as often as possible. We run games for some of our patrons and are about to play test a module we are writing and are pulling play testers from those ranks as well.

There's more, but i'm thinking i've already rambled too much as it is (if you do listen to some Table Topics then you'll soon realize I talk a lot and Caleb sums things up - a good dynamic). So I hope a few of you will take a listen to our show and maybe you'll be willing to give us a recommendation the next time the question comes up.

Here's my list of top shows if you wanna give us a try

* Dead Center episode # 1
* The Trials: Shadow of the Demond Lord 
* Table Topics # 73 w/ Robert J. Schwalb
* Table Topics # 74 Shadow of the Demon Lord Recap
* Table Topics # 68 DC's in DnD
* Show &amp; Tell ep 3

    If you listen to any of these and don't care for them then we're probably not the show for you.

but if you do like them . . .
Hit me up on twitter @therpgacademy
thanks

The only real options for me as a biochemistry major is to go to medical school or to go to academia. For various reasons, medicine is not an option. Biology academia is a bad place to be right now. There is a good (&gt;90%) chance I would spend 10 years getting a Biochemistry Ph.D. and doing a post-doc to get a position as an associate professor making perhaps 50k/yr. This is unacceptable.

I realized my mistake and started taking computer science classes in my fourth year. Luckily, I am reasonably intelligent. I go to a large and well known state university, have a good GPA (&gt; 3.90) and am good at taking standardized tests. If I work hard and heavily self-study on my own, I can graduate with a CS bachelors of science by the end of my fifth year. Unfortunately, I cannot get an internship this summer because I will have to take makeup classes. Based on the three CS classes I have taken, I can probably get between a 3.5-3.7 GPA in the CS major by the time I graduate.

It is my goal to make 100k-150k/yr in 7 or 8 years. My social skills are average, but I am highly motivated. E.g. I do not mind working 80 hours/week until I die of old age, having no significant other, etc. I am in my last year of college and I do not have any work experience or internships. Assume I can get between a 3.5-3.7 GPA in CS. What advice would you give me to achieve this target yearly salary? (Life advice also welcome, but probably not constructive)

32na64,0,2015-04-14,"I don't think I emphasized it correctly in my last post: we will give you money (yes, money) to do fun, interesting, non-trivial, impactful web development and/or helpdesk work",[deleted],unt,https://www.reddit.com/r/unt/comments/32na64/i_dont_think_i_emphasized_it_correctly_in_my_last/,"Howdy again everyone! I thought I'd repost this once more if the mods here don't mind. ~~If you don't have any internships lined up yet for the summer break or if you want to supplement your coursework with a part-time gig on-campus, then~~ these are some really great opportunities, so here's what I've got for you...

I wanted to share with you that my team is hiring some students for part-time positions. My team is Central Web Services for UNT System and we are responsible for hosting all of UNT's websites (in the very high hundreds). It's nearly all Drupal, and a handful of other PHP frameworks, served up by Apache. Our support infrastructure is lots of Python, Jenkins, and SaltStack, all running on Linux. We have a couple positions open at the moment...

**Helpdesk**: I'll start by saying this is not typical helpdesk – it's a technical position. You'll be working with site admins all across the university to assist with updating and maintaining their websites. There is a ton of work to be done here, and Linux experience is a major plus here. Sure, some experience with a Linux desktop environment is good, but I'm specifically referring to experience working on the terminal using things likes ```ls```, ```grep```, ```rsync```, ```chown```, etc. If you have experience running a web server like Apache or know what a virtual host is or how to setup redirects, that's also good. No one here expects you to know everything about everything – you're a student, you're allowed to learn, but don't expect anyone here to hold your hand the entire time. Good people skills also nice since you'll be replying to tickets.

If that all sounds like your type of thing, apply on Eagle Network\*. We'd like to have you for a while, so freshman, sophomores, this one's for you (not sure whether the job is visible to juniors/seniors – let me know if that's the case). The job ID is **117935**.

**Web Development**: You'll get the opportunity to work on various projects, from website administration tools to tuning up/polishing various websites. We have two really great student web developers right now that we're about to lose to graduation and they both got great experience working with us that helped them land some great full-time gigs in DFW. As I already mentioned, we're a Linux shop, running Apache, serving up PHP. So, PHP knowledge is greatly desired. That website administration tool I mentioned earlier? You'll need to know how to work with REST APIs. I'm actually kinda jealous that a student worker gets to do this and not me. That tool is going to be very important going forward with web hosting at UNT. Other things that we'd like to see are experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – not Java. I don't know why so many people think JavaScript is like Java. It's not. At all. For CSS things, we started using Twitter Bootstrap on some projects and it's really fantastic, so please know a bit about responsive CSS frameworks.

If web development is more your speed, apply on Eagle Network\*. Again, we'd like you to stick around for a while, so freshman and sophomores, here's to you. Juniors/Seniors still feel free to apply if the job is visible to you. The job ID is **117933**.

You don't *have* to be a computer science or computer engineering major to apply (though, huge perk if you are: Central Web Services is located at Discovery Park). If you can show us that you've got the chops necessary to get the job done, then who cares what your major is. Oh, forgot to mention! I don't know how it works for other majors, but if you're computer science, you can also earn internship credit for working here. I think it applies to other majors as well, but your mileage may very.

Questions? Comments? Outbursts? AMAA.

Also I'm curious as to how things are run out there (in the city or not) for example here in la almost all of our paramedics are firemen, and not just single function paramedics with the fire department but firemen as well. 

Eventually I would like to get a position as a hospital based paramedic but it is my understanding that they usually do not hire new grads for those kinds of positions. 

Also I certainly wouldn't mind if anyone would let me know about any positions opening up in June. I have been crushing indeed.com and Craigslist but all the best jobs I ever got were from word of mouth. Thank you. "

I could play someone hired to protect you after an event, someone delevering room service, or maybe I am just an intern who helps carry equiment or your bags. We can discuss that but the bottom line is that you get me alone and the good girl persona goes away. You show your darker side and who you really are, a sexy dom who likes to be in charge. We can also talk about to what degree, I would like to be dominated, but that's not a deal breaker.

My kinks include bondage, feet, impregnation, fdom (obviously), and I am open to most things.

I also have some pictures in mind for Taylor Swift if that is who you would end up playing.  We could message on here or I have a kik too.

Hope to hear from you soon."

I'm nearing my final semester of college. I registered for classes today, and was talking to my roomates about weird interview questions that we've been asked in the past. One of my roomates told about being asked, ""How do you choose your classes?"" and he thought it was weird and answered whatever he needs to graduate. Now, I've been planning my schedule since day one, what electives I want to take, what I found would be best to help me out in the field that I want to go into. I went to talk the research students in the field I wanted to go into, security, and got a ton of advice from them. They helped me plan my schedule, where I would take classes like Network Security, Mobile Systems and Applications, Artificial Intelligence, and other courses from my college's electives.

I'm now almost done with college. I have not been able to take Network Security, the class that's most close to what I want to do. I was unable to get into Cryptography II, due to there also not being enough spots. I'm sitting here with my planned schedule for my last semester, a mere 12 hours. I was able to register for 6 of those hours, two out of four of the classes I wanted. I'm having to take Computer Human Interaction just to graduate. Why would I care about computer human interaction? I've always been about systems and the inner working of things, not some overlay design crap. I'm going to have to take classes and graduate under the ""information sciences"" track instead of the ""systems"" track, like I wanted to. All of the classes that I've tried to force request into have been rejected, and I'm having to settle for classes that I don't even want to take. If I don't take them, I'll not be considered a full time student, and have to start paying off loans. If I try to stay another semester, I'll be another $11k in debt, a growing debt that is starting to feel hopelessly large. I also won't even be guaranteed the classes I want.

At the end of my college career, I'm also applying for tons of internships. I feel like there's nothing out there for what I want to do though. I want to do something like data mining for analysis, or penetration testing. All these interships that I feel like I am almost forced to apply for only want ""IT"". Why would I want to apply for your position if all you're going to give me is a vague description of your job, which could mean almost anything? I'm having so much pressure on me to get an internship, whether it be from my family or the university, and I don't want a single one of these. I'm being told to just apply for all, and work in some undesirable field, just for the summer. 

I just feel hopeless at this point. I've almost made it through college, and I feel like I did not get what I wanted out of it. Sure, I'm getting a bachelor's degree, but what does it mean if it doesn't help me to do what I want to do for the rest of my life. I wonder if I'll regret going to this college later on in life."

32nltg,1,2015-04-15,The concept that BMEs can’t find jobs is utter garbage and complete bullshit,[deleted],GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/32nltg/the_concept_that_bmes_cant_find_jobs_is_utter/,"Sorry for the language but I am fucking pissed

Very fucking frequently I am “enlightened” by anonymous Reddit users that potential students should avoid obtaining a Biomedical Engineering degree since they cannot find jobs. Who are all you fucks that say this?

I graduated from a state university in 2012 with a Bachelor’s of Biomedical Engineering degree. I was not near the top 10% of my class. I have numerous professional connections in the business. The idea that BMEs cannot find jobs is bogus. I obtained an internship at a major biomed corporation as a junior. I started my first full-time job just two weeks after graduating and I was likely paid more than 80% of my graduating class. After leaving that job several months in, I obtained my second job less than two months later in a completely unrelated R&amp;D role (all of my positions so far have been in R&amp;D). I had HUGE responsibilities as a test engineering lead.

Every person I know from my graduating class has gone on to some of the best medical or graduate schools. Everyone else has obtained biomedical engineering jobs, whether it is at a startup, large corporation, or even software companies. Positions you can get hired for include manufacturing engineer, biomedical engineer, test engineer, software test engineer, reliability engineer, quality engineer, supply chain engineer, hardware engineer, verification engineer, sales engineer, validation engineer, and a ton more I’m forgetting. I’m not making this shit up – I or my friends have accounted for each of those positions above and we all have Bachelor’s of Biomedical Engineering. At my last company, I talked to a manager about biomedical engineering degrees, and I admit she said she didn’t know what to hire them as. I don’t think she knew she was talking to one right then!

I cannot reiterate that it is TOTAL BOGUS to say we cannot find jobs. I have met alumni from numerous companies that have spun their graduate school research into a startup. I know for a fact that one of the biggest biomedical companies ACTIVELY FUNDS the local biomedical program and then RECRUITS the students into internships and then full time positions. How the fuck do I know this? It’s EXACTLY what happened to me as explained to me by the department chair, who offered a recommendation for me. By the way, if you honestly can’t find an engineering gig, there are PLENTY of consulting firms that would be more than happy to hire you for your analytic skills.

STOP TELLING POTENTIAL STUDENTS NOT TO GET A BIOMEDICAL DEGREE. What the fuck is wrong with you people?  What the fuck do you know? This only discourages students with a passion in biology, engineering, and medicine to pursue a degree that they may excel in. If someone told me half the crap I heard online I certainly would never get a biomedical degree. The fact of the matter is most of the crap is untrue, and I highly recommend students to pursue the degree if they are passionate about medicine and technology. If you think biomedical engineering is right for you DO IT. You will be happy. You will find a job.

So, here's my story. I have CF, that is cystic fibrosis. It has a life expectancy of 36ish. I haven't checked it in a few years because at first it was depressing and now it is even more depressing because I know I most likely won't even reach that. I go to a very good engineering school and am studying computer science and physics. Through my hard work over the years academically, I have a massive stipend (I received an equivalent of 2 full rides if you combine all my scholarships, only 1 was an actual full ride), 2 grants to conduct research, as well as a hefty paying summer internship. In the end it comes out to a a little less than the medium income. 

I don't have any expenses, either. I am housed by the school, am on my family's health insurance, don't have a car payment (though I have a car) or phone bill (have a phone as well). As of right now, nearly every cent of this money is going into my savings account. For what? I have absolutely no idea. 

My health has been on the decline for the past 2 years now. I spent a large portion of last semester as well as the first few weeks of this semester on oxygen. If my health gets much worse, it may prevent me from continuing my education, but I should be able to hold out for 2 more years to get my degree.

How long until he forgives me?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/32nwax/i_19f_cheated_on_my_boyfriend_19m_how_long_until/,"We've been together for 11 months and we both love each other a lot. I know it may seem like I don't from my actions but I do.

I was at a conference for an internship I was doing, while I was there I met a man who was very forward and honest about his intentions with me. He kept making advances and I kept stopping him. Eventually I gave in. I wasn't thinking and I made a big mistake. I felt horrible after it happened and I know it was a one time thing so I decided not to tell my boyfriend. This was two weeks ago.

My boyfriend said he felt like I was being distant lately. So a few days ago he planned a really lovely date. After the date we had really passionate sex. We were lying in bed post-sex and he was kissing all over my face saying how much he loved me. It was such a lovely night and it made me feel horrible about what I'd done and I ended up telling him. He was pretty shocked and he left my place after I told him.

I am the first girl he's ever been with (kiss, sex, everything) and he's a traditional (one woman) sort of a guy so honestly I think he will stay with me. When we met he had been rejected by a lot of girls because he's short (seriously, you should have heard the things they said to him) and he had bad self-confidence as a result. I know it's probably not the best reason to stay with someone, but I think he will stay with me, if only because he thinks he couldn't get another girl. I don't think that but I think he does. It's been 4 days and he's barely talked to me at all. How long until he fully forgives me? How long does it take to get past something like this? I just want things to get back to normal.

Im a very junior webdev looking for some hands on coding help and advice. Im not sure if this is the right forum if that case I apologize in advice. 

I completing and internship at the moment and figured I would try to pick up angular for the project I was given to learn as much as possible. Being a second year student with a pretty bare bones knowledge of javascript im kinda struggling with some basic concepts of javascript that I really wanna learn. 

One of them that I never had to deal with before while coding simple sites is event unbinding. I've never had to do it before because it's never been an issue. Now while coding in angular I realized that some of my event listeners stay active on all my partials since the site never reloads. 

I realize Jquery probly shouldn't be used in angular but since I used a bootstrap theme there was some jquery in there to start with. 

So here's my question: 

How I would register my events, listen to them and destroy them the angular way sort of speak.

I read somewhere you should use $scope.on but I don't really understand how it works? 

Here's a link to the question on stackoverflow with the relevant jquery im trying to use:

I'm currently a second year at a major state school and I just really feel defeated and lost on what to do right now. My entire childhood all I wanted to do was to get into a good school. Now here I am where I originally wanted to be feeling lost venting to reddit at 3am.

My first semester here I did awful. I failed two of my classes and felt shitty. I ended up getting a 1.XX GPA and placed on academic probation. I saw my flaws and put myself to work trying to pull myself out of the hole I threw myself in. I retook one of the classes I failed the previous semester and barely passed with a ""C"". 

By the end of my first semester of my second year I pulled myself up to around a 2.6 GPA, got out of AP, and changed my study course from Mechanical Engineering to Business Admin with emphasis in information systems (At my school this is basically CS with a splash of business).

Now here I am nearing the end of my 4th semester here and I've fallen in the hole I started in. Somewhere I started slacking and forgetting to turn in online assignments, failing exams, and am now just lacking motivation to do anything school related. I currently have an F in one class and it looks like I could possibly fail another on top of the other. I don't know what I want from myself. At my school you can only use course forgiveness on up to 3 classes and if I fail both these courses I won't have anything to save my GPA from further fuck ups as I need a 3.0 to get into my upper divisions

I had a great internship over the summer with an engineering company but my money I earned from working there is running low. The stress of paying my bills, and going to school is really taking a toll on me. If it weren't for the fact that I have already committed to living in a house with a few friends in the fall I would have moved back home to get back on my feet, work for a little while, and then go to a community college to boost my GPA.  I'm thankful that I come from a family that's been saving money my entire life for me to go to school so I don't have to worry about taking out loans and paying for books but I feel as if my failures are making that money go to waste. 

I've thought about going to a CC around here for fall but I'm afraid I'll bring myself to failure there as well for some reason. If I don't finish my degree I'm afraid I'll be looked at as a failure to my family  as they all see me as some genius who will do great things with my life, for whatever reason that may be. 

Sitting here thinking makes me wish I had gone to a local community college before a 4 year but being the typical 18 year old I was all I cared about was getting out of the house. 

I don't mean to scare anyone off from chasing their dreams but if you are a high school senior who's picking a 4 year university to be able to break free from your parents I would sit and carefully consider what you want. Although living on your own is a luxury it also comes with huge responsibility and burden. Make sure you're on top of your shit enough to not to do bad in school and be able to have financial support or you'll regret being where you are. 

PS: Has anyone here taken time off to go to a CC and gone back to their previous school? How was it and what was your story?"

I don't know where to find what I'm looking for so I'm giving it a go here. I'm an intern at a small pc repair shop that sets up workstations for small businesses.

I've have been asked to find a remote management tool that will log and warn us immediately when something is going wrong. Either with the internet connection not being 100% or other fishy stuff like malware etc.

This is a pretty broad question but atleast something that logs major activities with some detail would be nice so we can backtrack what went wrong. A lot of these customers are extremely computer illiterate to the point where they don't even call us when something major is wrong since they don't even know it.

Hopefully you guys can help me out.

Since then, when I return back to work next week from my vacation, they are offering me a full time position in IT within the company, at $15 an hour compared to my intern wage ($8.75 an hour). However, I am also stuck now...

HP is offering me a position at $20 an hour. They did mention I would be traveling a bit, possibly only being home about 3 days a month, but with a lot of overtime as a Field Technician. But I'm not sure how the company is. This was just offered pretty much at the same time (while I was away) a few days ago. Of course there would be a company car and expenses paid for while traveling from what I was told.

I have been with my current company about 9 years now. But I've been reading a lot of different things about HP, and not sure if it would be a company that I feel would stay stable enough to be with them (reading about splits in the company later this year, people being laid off). Also able to still receive tuition reimbursement with my current company as well. My schooling is online as well.

Just trying to get some advice of what others would do, or what people have heard about for the company overall. I'm only $5 above new hires in Disney, but at the same time, I do enjoy the work. It just feels like a big risk in my opinion, but that's what I'm trying to figure out."

I was happy once.  It was as real as a breeze blowing through my hair.  Happiness was almost tangible.  Lately, I’ve started to think it strange how a seemingly random set of circumstances can result in meeting someone that can have such an impact on your life.  If a single, small thing were changed – you would never have met them at all. 
The job market for new graduates in Georgia was abysmal when I completed my degree in electrical engineering.  I struggled for months to find a job in my field, all while I was still working a lousy retail job.  I pounced on the first thing that was offered to me, a low paying internship with a multinational conglomerate.  I started in July 2006.  After a couple months of making copies and taking training courses in industrial automation, they sent me to Portland, Oregon to learn on the job with engineers setting up a spiral welded pipe facility.  It was going to make replacement pipes for the Alaska oil pipeline.  I spent several months there, learning everything I could about the controls used to automate industrial processes.  I proved myself to be a quick learner and a valuable asset, and so I was hired permanently as an engineer in October 2006.  I spent the next several months working on various small projects around the country, ranging from a couple days to a month.  I really enjoyed my job, it was challenging and rewarding.  I enjoyed the technical aspects.  Although, constantly being on the road did get wearisome. Then I landed myself on a mammoth project, setting up 70 new oil &amp; gas drilling derricks with modern industrial automation controls and small AC electric motors.  Most oil &amp; gas drilling derricks in the country date back to the 1970’s and use clunky hydraulically operated controls and gigantic DC electric motors.  I spent the next 3 months in Houston, Texas to learn from engineers that had already been working on the project for some time.  However, it was Oklahoma City where I was to eventually end up, to setup another construction yard for the derricks and oversee all of the industrial automation controls being installed there.  
It was in Oklahoma City where I met her.  I’ve suffered a long time from social anxiety but my coworkers always wanted to drag me out to explore the city.  I met her and her cousin together at a night club, she told me her name was Tanisha but it was her older, slightly less attractive cousin that I was trying… and failing to hit on.  The second time I ran into her, I could only remember her name started with a ‘T’ so I guessed and called her Tess.  Rather than get upset that I forgot her name, she said she liked the nickname.  She was quiet, gentle and shy.  She was the opposite of her outgoing and gabby cousin.  Tess was going to Oklahoma City University, working on her MBA.   They were both working as translators for an oil drilling company that was contracting work to Chinese engineers.  They had come together from China when Tess was 17 on student visas.  She spoke perfectly fluent English, Mandarin, Cantonese and French.  Tanisha was the name she was given by her English instructor in China.  The Chinese engineers she translated for were from Szechuan province, home of the spiciest food in China, and they had a Chef that made big meals every day for all the engineers.  I started showing up to eat with them, just so I could see her.  I still credit this time for my very high tolerance of spicy food and ability to use chopsticks.  After awkwardly trying to court her for several weeks, we started dating officially in December 2007.  We flew together to my parents for Christmas that year. She wanted to see what a real American family Christmas was like.  I tried to maintain some properness since we hadn’t been dating that long and had her sleep on my bed while I slept on a twin size air mattress in my dad’s study.  All the lights in the house were off maybe 15 minutes before she snuck her way onto the air mattress with me and fell asleep in my arms.  She said she felt safe when she was in my arms.
After we flew back to Oklahoma City, I started spending the night at her place regularly.  She had a nice townhome apartment not far from rich part of town.  Apartments were not exactly expensive in Oklahoma.  I had trouble understanding how someone so beautiful and exotic, so smart and worldly would be interested in someone like me.  She would always just say that I made her feel safe.  Before too long, I checked out of my hotel room for good.  We cooked meals together.  She loved a Mexican restaurant, Ted's Cafe Escondido, more than anything.  She loved getting the sushi boat at Tokyo House.  I got us reservations for the Coach House, the only four star restaurant in Oklahoma, on Valentine’s Day.  She loved going shopping at Penn Square Mall, especially this little eclectic store called Route 66.  Her favorite clothing designer was Nanette Lepore and we found several of her dresses at Route 66.  She loved anything that made her feel like a princess.   Something was wrong though.  She would frequently have nightmares.  She would wake up screaming and kicking, in a state of abject terror.  It was difficult for her to admit it but I learnt that she had been raped when she was thirteen.  It was violent and left her hospitalized for months.  It was always the same nightmare, the man who raped her coming after her again.  She was convinced she had the nightmare less often if my arms were around her.
In the Spring, she finished her MBA and started looking for a new job.  Now of course, we know 2008 was the start of the ‘great recession’ but at the time nobody realized it.  Virtually the only place in the country with job openings and a roaring economy was Houston.  There she found a job with an oil tech startup.  The owner had invented a microchip that was supposed to be able to quickly analyze all sorts of data to find new places to drill for oil.  Just the two of us packed up her townhome.  A bunch of the Chinese engineers helped us load the Uhaul.  They were really sad to see her leaving.  Then I drove all the way down to Houston with her in the passenger seat, talking and gossiping about what we were going to find in Houston.  We had an apartment locator that had found several nice apartments in our budget all over town.  However, we still had to go and look at all of them and decide which one was for us.  For the next three days, we stayed at a Holiday Inn near Minute Maid Park.  During the day, we would look at apartments and every night we ended up eating at Benihana’s in downtown because we didn’t know anything about the city yet.  We finally decided on apartments right off Main Street, south of the medical center.  As it turns out, the “Little Couple” from TLC lived in the same building and we ran into them a few times over the next couple years.  It was a really nice apartment, really big for a one bedroom with a great kitchen and a full size laundry room.  And it was ours.  We bought some new furniture from Bel Furniture which looked really nice but turned out to be poorly made.  We got everything we needed to make the apartment a cozy home at Ross &amp; Marshall’s.  One thing I remember in particular she picked out was a spoon holder for the range that looked like a rooster.  The first week we spent together, not having to worry about work or anything else was heaven.  It was just the two of us, the rest of the world didn’t exist.  
Unfortunately, I had to return to Oklahoma to continue the unending project.  I moved in with a couple of my coworkers who had gotten tired of hotels, we split the rent and were able to keep almost all of our per diem.  Every night I would call Tess and we’d talk about our day and fall asleep together.  Her nightmares seemed like they came every night.  She would call me in the middle of the night and I could tell she was distressed.  I would talk gently to her until she calmed down and could drift back to sleep.  I started working 7 days a week so that once a month I could have 6 days off in a row.  I would use this time to fly back home to Houston and she would come happy as a clam to pick me up from the airport.  She was working mon-fri now so I couldn’t see her the whole time but it always felt like I was home.  She was starting to discover the city and every time I flew home she had a new place she was excited to show to me.  Different places in Chinatown, like Classic Kitchen.  Uptown Sushi, Little Sheep Mongolian Hot pot, Café Lily, Backstreet Café, Avalon Diner, DaMarco’s, Central Market.  She loved shopping at the outlets across the street from the Galleria.  I would always try and stop at The Black Eyed Pea for lunch while she was at work.  A few times we would take a weekend trip to San Antonio, Hotel Contessa became our romantic little spot.  It was a Spanish themed hotel with an amazing restaurant right on the river walk.  Of course, her favorite thing to do was going shopping at the giant outlet mall in San Marcos just north of San Antonio.  It always hurt to have to fly back to Oklahoma.  In 2008, the summer Olympics was in Beijing.  In November, I flew down to Houston and together we flew to China for a 2 week vacation.  We had a layover in New York, an 18 hour flight over the North Pole to Beijing, another layover and finally a last flight to her hometown of Tianjin.  After we boarded the first place, I learned that Tess was terrified of flying.  I had to wrap her up in blankets hold her tightly in my arms for the whole trip.  In Tianjin, her parents picked us up from the airport.  We were exhausted after 24 hours of traveling but her parents insisted on having a giant meal to celebrate the first time their daughter had been home in years.  They didn’t speak any English so Tess had to translate everything for us.  They owned a beautiful 3 bedroom condo, fancy redwood floors throughout and really nice furniture done in modern Chinese style.  Her father owned a stone quarry and a factory that produced any kind of stone product you would want from paving stones to granite counter tops.  The next day we went to a giant 5-star hotel, her parents had reserved a dining room room that could seat at least 20.  It was just one big circular table with a giant glass lazy susan.  All of Tess’ extended family came out, aunts &amp; uncles, cousins, childhood friends.  Too many different dishes were brought out and placed on the giant lazy susan to count.  Tess quietly whispered in my ears what each one was when it came around to me.  She encouraged me to try a few really disgusting sounding dishes.  Sea Slug, Shark Lip Soup.  I never would have tried them for anyone but her.  We went to the local shopping centers.  They were very different from American malls.  There were a lot of European clothing brands I didn’t recognize.  Whenever we were around a lot of people, even her own family, she always needed me to hold her hand or put my arm around her.  With her parents, we went to an ancient Taoist temple on top of a mountain.  The leaves were changing and it was beautiful.  We took a million pictures there.  The temple and its sculptures were carved into the living rock of the mountain and were said to be thousands of years old.  Other than the lonely monk at the temple, we were the only people there the whole day.  We traveled to the remote village her father was born in.  I met her grandfather there.  I got a lot of bewildered stares by the local villagers.  I asked her father permission to marry Tess and he very happily agreed.  After a few days, we left her parents behind and took a high speed train to Beijing.   We stayed at two different insanely fancy hotels for the next week as we explored the usual tourist sites in Beijing.  Beijing was much colder than Tianjin in November.  Tess didn’t pack any socks or warm shoes, so one of the very first things we did was stop at an Addidas store and buy some socks and tennis shoes for her.  We made several trips to the silk market, the market famous for designer knock offs.  We got fake Prada and Louis Vuitton among other things.  But the one thing I got for myself was a traditional Chinese tea set.  We went to the Forbidden City, the home of the Emperor of ancient imperial China.  We got a private tour guide there just for the two of us and took a lot of pictures.  We kissed in front of the famous kissing trees there.  Legend says that kissing in front of the kissing trees means you will have a happy life together.  We went to see the Great Wall. I even climbed to the highest point where Chairman Mao had once said “A boy is not a man until he has climbed to the top of the Great Wall”.  Unfortunately, Tess was too terrified of the steepest part of the climb to make it all the way up.  We went to see a traditional Chinese Opera while Tess whispered in my ear what was going on in the act.  We went to the pleasure gardens of the hated Dragon Empress, hundreds of acres of sublimely beautiful parkland that were once her private residence.  I wish we had more time to explore the gardens, we didn’t see even a quarter of it.  After two weeks spending every moment with my soul mate, I was very sad when it was over and I had to return to Oklahoma once again.  "

32ptjp,7,2015-04-15,Cultural Vistas J-1 visa processing delay for summer internship at Amazon in the US,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/32ptjp/cultural_vistas_j1_visa_processing_delay_for/,"Hello guys.

About a month ago, after following the advice on the threads here and studying hard for the interview, I was able to get an internship at Amazon (Thanks everyone). I am starting my final year of studies in September so this internship could potentially be a full-time career move for me.

So the problem here is that Cultural Vistas, Amazon's contact for dealing with visa and work permits and such, seem to be taking their sweet time with the process even though Amazon agreed to expedite my application. Last communication I had from their rep was that they sent the training package to Amazon who would need to sign it and return it to them, and then they do the same with me. Apparently I would receive the DS-2019 form after these two steps and then the whole appointment with US embassy starts. For some background on me, I am an Indian citizen but right now I am a student at a Canadian university.

My start date is supposed to be 5th May which is already so close. I was worried and I though that maybe I should ask you guys for your input.  


1) Would you be willing to share your experience regarding the J-1 visa application? I am curious about how much time should I expect all the involved parties (Amazon, Cultural Vistas, US Embassy) to take.

2) In case a candidate's work visa does not gets approved on time, have you heard of any case where these company is willing to change their offer from one location to another on such a short notice? Amazon has offices in Canada in Toronto and Vancouver so if the plan for working in US falls apart, I wanted to know if working in Canada is an option.

I am relying on my work term at Amazon for both professional and financial reasons and would prefer if nothing messes up (at-least from my side). If you have any other advice on how I should proceed, I would appreciate that.

I have seen other interns mention the same problem on facebook groups and seems like the response time from the recruiter(s) in pretty long which is understandable considering that they probably have a lot to deal with at this time."

They will have more people leaving, so another position will most likely open up over the summer and I am the first one on the list for round two. I was told to email him at the end of July ""to see where they are in the hiring process."" I think my chances of getting this position are high, but it's not guaranteed. This works out well because I am going out of town from July 3rd - July 22nd. When I told him this, he said that it should be no problem because they're still not sure when their people are leaving.

I did a phone interview with Job A. I just received an email from the director of the lab saying that they ""reviewed my application favorably"" and would like to speak to me about my interests and the position. This position pays less and I do not know if they will be ok with my vacation in July, but if I am offered, should I take it? What if I'm offered the Job B position in July?

As an unpaid intern for almost a year, I am easily excited by money and I want Job B, but what do I do if I am offered Job B while working at Job A? Is this even something to be concerned about? What do?"

32q4zx,12,2015-04-15,How I Eliminate 80% of Internship Applicants in Under 10 Minutes,brandon_tyler,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/32q4zx/how_i_eliminate_80_of_internship_applicants_in/,"Ever hear that employers only look at a resume for 5-7 seconds? Sorting through hundreds of internship applicants can be time consuming, so I’ve developed a system that allows me to eliminate 80% of applicants in under 10 minutes. This system allows me to quickly determine if the applicant possesses the basic skills necessary to receive further consideration. Here’s the inside scoop:

**Initial Meeting**

Are you confident? Well spoken? Do you show genuine interest? The first few minutes I meet someone often leaves a lasting first impression. Candidates who lack the traits above are generally placed in the “no” pile immediately. Those who stand out proceed to the next step.

**Follow Up**

I’ve touched on this in previous posts, but I want to reiterate its importance. Follow up is essential. Why? If you don’t follow up with me, how can I trust you to follow up with my customers? A simple email shows me that you are serious about the position.

**Communication Skills**

Timely and effective communication is key. Do you respond to emails in a reasonable amount of time? Are your responses well thought out? These are key factors that I look for in a potential intern.

While more advanced knowledge can be helpful in the interview stage, it is highly unlikely that you will get to that point in the hiring process if you do not possess these fundamentals.

32q6st,11,2015-04-15,"""Alternative""/dyed hair in the workplace?",sqshemet,belgium,https://www.reddit.com/r/belgium/comments/32q6st/alternativedyed_hair_in_the_workplace/,"Hey r/belgium,

I am a female American college student, and I might be working as an electrical engineering/computer science intern in Belgium this summer (at Televic Rail or NXP Semiconductors). I haven't heard back yet, so I don't know either way for sure. It's spring, and starting to get warm here, and so I was going to cut my hair into a mohawk, and probably dye some of it. I realized I should probably check first: would this be acceptable, or viewed as prohibitively unprofessional? Should I hold off if I wind up working in Belgium? 

Thanks!"
32qh7p,1,2015-04-15,[Wall of Text] I'm stuck and I don't know what to do.,throwthrowitawayplz,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/32qh7p/wall_of_text_im_stuck_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,"I've been a long, long time lurker and I hate posting (I don't even know if this is the right subreddit for this) but I don't quite know where else to go. I apologize in advance for the wall of text.

I don’t have my journal and I feel stuck and alone and I don’t really feel like talking to anyone so I guess I’ll just write here. I have no idea what I’m doing with my life. None whatsoever. I sit around and watch television and play games and pretend like everything’s okay when it’s not. I don’t want to live here but I don't know if I could move while being unemployed since I don't want to impose on people and crash on couches.

I apply to all these jobs and never hear back and I think “Well, that’s okay, I’ll just go on to the next one” but what about when there is no ‘next one’? What was the point of all that school? And I can’t tell anyone this because I went to a prestigious school and so the inherent assumption is “well obviously you won’t have a problem because you went to that school” and I don’t know how to say “Well no because I didn’t really do fancy internships at name brand companies during the holidays. I just went home and spent time with my family because I was so burnt out and tired by the end of the semester.” And what’s more frustrating is that I know I can be a hard worker and would do well in a job…if someone just would hire me. Or just give me a shot. Or just a fucking interview. 

I’m sick of obsessively checking my email and rejecting unpaid internship offers. I should start freelance writing but I can't get myself to do it, but I need to. I have loans and credit cards to pay and I want to travel and I can’t  because I need money for it and I hate it. I hate it. 

And then there’s my love life…or lack thereof. I’m a mildly attractive human being in my early twenties and I have nothing to show for it. After perusing Forever Alone, I realized that it’s me but it shouldn’t be. I should have had my first kiss by now, or at least a relationship or just something. Even a fling. People are always so surprised when I tell them this but I don’t know what to say. “No I haven’t been in a relationship because of my weird gypsy lifestyle and never staying anywhere for longer than two years.” Or the weirder explanation: “Those guys…it wasn’t right. I could feel it.” I know it sounds ridiculous (and perhaps why people may think I’m attracted to my own sex but that couldn’t be further from the truth) but when I talk to people at bars/clubs, when I’m dancing with people, I’m always so cautious to not let it go further – partly because of my upbringing but also because there’s a part of me that’s like “This person isn’t the one, they don’t feel right.” They just aren’t the right person 

I feel like an idiot for always following those instincts but they serve me well for the most part so who knows. Those people weren’t right for me, and I avoided a lot of scary situations because of that little voice in my head…but I wish I could find someone where it did feel right. And I don’t know how to put myself out there because I get so shy/uncomfortable in those situations. I’m fine in the beginning and I can flirt and be okay but once it goes past casual conversation and into the realm of “Wow, I think this person has real feelings for me” I back off. I can't keep repeating the pattern but I don't know how to stop.

I'm stuck and I don't know what to do.

""I wanted to let you know that unfortunately we won’t be moving forward with you for the internship on the firmware team.

Initially I felt happy and relieved that I was able to earn something and people believed in me enough to give me this opportunity. I had gone through recruiting last year but I couldn't get any offers for accounting firms and almost everyone I know did. I felt like a failure and sank deeper into depression for a few months.

Anyways, I bounced back but now I'm starting to feel anxious about my new job because it means a lot to me. I want to do well and get along with everyone so I can earn a full time offer after a few months. During my two years in Beta Alpha Psi I met many of the people there and I know they're nice, they seem supportive, and are happy to work there. However, I'm  afraid of doing a bad job, or how would people react if I make mistakes, or if they think I'm not a good fit. 

I've never seen myself as an intelligent, smart, or confident person, but I know I'm very determined and passionate about most things I do. I had an internship in accounting for a F500 company where I spent most of the time at my desk, and although I learned more just accounting there, I don't know how prepared I am for audit. I also worked in retail for a few months.

I'd appreciate if you shared any advice, encouragement, or experiences you had starting your career.

I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

32rth8,1,2015-04-16,My [20 F] boyfriend [22 M] of 5 years and I can't seem to be nice to each other.,cheeseyscrambledegg,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/32rth8/my_20_f_boyfriend_22_m_of_5_years_and_i_cant_seem/,"Mark and I met in high school and have been long-distance through three years of college (together during the summers, and with almost-monthly visits during the academic year). 

He's my best friend, and we have fun together in pretty much anything we do - working out, watching Netflix, cooking, running errands, etc. I look forward to his visits, texts and calls. I also have mild social anxiety and enjoy my time alone, and he is the only person I've met who doesn't exhaust me over long periods. 
We've discussed marriage many times, as we both always thought it was an inevitability if we stay together after college. I think in a lot of ways we would fit perfectly together. I am driven and want to pursue a scientific career, and he would be thrilled to be a stay-at-home parent (I'm sure he would be good at it, as well). We are both hesitant about children and could be happy either way, but agree we would eventually prefer to have kids.

Despite the really great aspects of being together, we've never had an idyllic relationship, and always struggled with emotional communication in particular (I am emotional, and he finds discussions of feelings rather distressing). He put a lot of work into becoming more emotionally available and supportive in the first couple years, and made improvements (he'll now tell me why he's upset, for example), but I know he resents me because I asked him to make that change, and every time I ask him to hear me out on an emotional situation.

I have started to resent him a bit too, because I've been supporting him financially in small amounts (e.g. $50 monthly for food) throughout college. In return, I asked for gratitude and proactivity, e.g. staying on top of his grades and major requirements, looking for an internship or a job, etc. He has told me straight up that he will probably never be genuinely grateful, because it's not a feeling he experiences. He has not tried to get a job or an internship (he competes in a club sport and doesn't feel he has time), and will not graduate on time because he has failed too many classes in his major, and didn't speak with his adviser early enough to realize he would need to switch majors. I'm mostly resentful of this because I will end up paying a good chunk of his student loan debt if we stay together (I have no debt and a job lined up after my Bachelor's, and he is planning to go to graduate school for 2-3 years).

We have just struggled to be nice to each other for the past several months, and it's making me so sad. I don't know that I could place blame on either one of us more than the other. He has always had a tendency to be pretty critical under the guise of being ""honest,"" although he is selectively honest (vocal) about bad things when there are plenty of good things to pick from. I have been pretty impatient with him recently, and butthurt about the lack of gratitude/appreciation. We've talked about this, but it doesn't get anywhere because I suppose we both feel like the other should be apologizing. He also hates talking about this sort of thing (see above, emotions are distressing), so it's a struggle for both of us to even have the conversation.

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I can't stop being jerks to each other recently. I'm seriously considering asking for a break, but I don't want a break from my best friend, I just want a break from arguing, from being criticized, and from being mean.

I don't feel ready to end the relationship over this, but I also don't see any end in sight. I'm not sure what to do."

But the office of study abroad advised me to do more preparations about the exchange and not taking an intern at that time...So normally how will you guys deal with the 5 months? 

Since I had never been there and just interested in the culture (I can speak Japanese, a little bit better than high school level). Need more advices.
Thx!

32rvwp,5,2015-04-16,Masters Admittance,northavenue1,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/32rvwp/masters_admittance/,"Hi guys, so I'm a CmpE undergrad w/ a minor in Econ and I'll be graduating in a few semesters. My GPA isn't too great. I have a 3.0 right now, but it will probably go up to about a ~3.2 or so (hopefully) by the time I graduate. I want to try to get my MS in ECE at Tech, but I'm worried that I won't get in. I'll be starting a 2-semester internship with GTRI this summer, and they help pay for grad school at Tech which is part of the reason I turned down other offers for GTRI. 

My question is two-pronged:
a) is my GPA too low for getting into an MS program here?
b) If I do end up working at GTRI after graduation (they have a really high offer rate for interns/co-ops), will that help my chances of coming here for my Masters?

Thanks!"

I have a well off supportive family, an interview for a dream internship, a trip of a lifetime booked, etc. Basically, all the tangible things are going my way right now.

However, I have always been slightly socially awkward. I am a really well known and well liked person, but I do not have that close group of 5-10 friends that most people seem to have. Well, I do have this, but I am not an integral member. I am basically on the edge of every social circle, and not near the middle of any single one. This often means that I am not heavily included in people's plans. 

Also, I tend to not stand out from the crowd, which makes me disposable. In these group conversations, I always seem to stand there awkwardly. I AM ALWAYS SO AWKWARD at night clubs.

Again, I have everything tangible going my way (well off, decent looking, smart, etc) and most people say that I am really ""nice."" Yet I can't seem to really connect on that very close level to others outside of my family. 

This is very self appreciating, but I think maturity might be part of it. Most people my age seemingly don't see the world and life the same way I do, and I really don't want anything to do with smoking dope and doing much,much worse stuff. Party girls and one night stands don't really appeal to me much either.

Any help would be appreciated."

32s5q8,4,2015-04-16,Which is better for an internship resume: making and shipping a game vs working on current company's database?,nova_cheeser,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/32s5q8/which_is_better_for_an_internship_resume_making/,"By a combination of sheer luck and playing my cards right, I landed a full time job as a combined IT/Dev in a major VFX company for my first university co-op experience. They hired me not as an intern, but as a regular employee for the full production of a movie they're contracted to do. Unfortunately, the scheduling would leave me with 4 more months of co-op needed to be filled. However, I believe having such a role in a big name company in my resume gives me decent ammo to shoot for an internship in a Big 4 company. I am aiming to start contacting recruiters starting this summer to secure an internship term for January.

Before that, I want to make my resume as great as it can be. To do that, I feel that there are one of two things that I can do. I can either buff up the personal projects section of my resume with video game development or add more accomplishment statements for my work experience by working on the company's database.

The advantages I see in the former is that it shows I have experience designing for front-end. Also, my projects are somewhat lacking. I currently use the pong game I made from programming an FPGA board for a school project and a self made Powerglove controller as a personal project for my resume (I'm in EE). Additionally, I could actually show this project off. On the downside, I feel that a lot of my peers have something similar to this.

If I work on the company's database, my employment history section could potentially look way better. I'm looking to optimize the search algorithms of lookup scripts using the database API. This is easily quantifiable and I could list down how much money I'm actually saving the company. I feel as if this is more ""professional"", sets me apart from competitors and is a lot more technically challenging. Downside is, I can't show it off with an external link on my resume.

Ideally, I'd be doing the game on my spare time and working on the database on my downtime at work. However, I'm not an expert at either of those subjects yet and I still have to learn. Realistically speaking, mental fatigue would only limit me to focusing on one. To maximize my chances of getting an internship interview at Microsoft, Google, Amazon or any other huge software companies, what should I choose to focus on? Thanks!"

I had a major crush on him in high school, we went to different colleges, and met up again after he graduated and I was wallowing around in my second senior year. He motivated me in an LDR to get through college. Sam is very no bullshit and doesn't tolerate much, so over the years there are very few friends of mine that have gained his approval. Part of me sees his perspective (I definitely surrounded myself with very broken, unreliable, and lazy types) but part of me is saddened that he can't see what I see in them. Some of these people include my neighbor who is like my mom, my dad, my brother, and my best childhood friend. All of these relationships are strained in some way or another due to this balancing act. I am a compulsive liar and people pleaser so I tell people what they want to hear. This has all come back to bite me in the ass, hard, and that's why I'm writing for help now. 

I interned at a small local store. This store is barely squeaking by and I had no regard for it when I started and just wanted to wrap up my credits, but as time went on the owner and I developed a pretty good working relationship and improved the store's revenue by 34% over last year in 2 months of projects. After the internship I reached out to a friend who works in HR for a company in my field, and I got an entry-level job at this company. Let's call the internship Co. A, and the entry-level job Co. B. At Co. B I'm the very bottom rung in a position that doesn't REALLY set me up for the job I'd like to have; the experiences I'm getting don't translate to more experience towards what I'd like to be doing for the company and the hours are both not enough and terribly timed (an 11 hr day followed by a 5 hr day, late nights, etc.). However, the company is well-respected, growing fast, and has decent pay and benefits for the work and I LOVE the people I work with/general atmosphere of the company. Conversely, Co. A is incredibly small and can't offer anything competitive, but the work is more relevant to what I'd like to end up doing at a different company. Co. A offered me the title of manager, a 20% raise, and a settled 9-5. After considering it for a week, I settled on Co. A-- though a lot of that has to do with feeling obligated to the owner. I'm figuring I can spin Co. A into a great experience and resume bolster that will work for me faster than chugging along in Co. B, and I'd have more fun day-to-day. This remains to be seen and I've been having nightmares about it. 

Since I started at Co. B, I've been looking for an apartment. I wanted a small place in the city, but Sam wanted to stay closer to nature. I ended up looking for places near my transit station, and found this amazing place that's at the very tippy top of my budget. Basically, I oriented my life around Co. B while trying to incorporate Sam-- I had hoped moving in would alleviate our crazy hours and days without seeing each other, give us both some independence from our parents, and be a good step forward in our relationship. Unfortunately, I didn't really communicate my reasons or expectations with Sam. I just wanted so badly to have him with me. We have no budget breakdown, no nothing in terms of what we can rely on each other for. My friends and family think I'm living alone because I haven't had the balls to tell them the truth. 

While I was debating the offer from Co. A (which was given two days after I moved to be closer to CO. B--ugh), I brought it up to Sam's mom, who dismissed Co. A immediately with no discussion. It was clear his dad felt the same. Sam did not want to talk about it in the agonizing detail that I wanted to, but later made it clear that he thought Co. A was a losing track and I should stick with Co. B. Unfortunately, I had already promised Co. A that I would work for her. 

I have 4 days left at Co. B. I just told Sam, offhandedly, that we could go shopping Saturday because Sunday would be my last day. 

I know I fucked up by not telling him my decision when I made it. I fucked up by not letting him know how desperately I needed his honest feedback and for him to really listen to me.  I'm already a wreck because I don't know which of those two tracks would have been the best. But I made my bed by promising I'd work for Co. A and putting in my two weeks at Co. B and I have to lie in it. 

Sam is distraught. I hid information from him, I didn't respect his opinions, I put our security at risk, and I made him move an hour away from his family and job to support me in being closer to my job...that I just left. He's talking about leaving. I'm selfish and immature. 


---   
**tl;dr**: BF and I don't feel close, we moved in together a month ago, I switched jobs without telling him because I was afraid of his feedback, now he feels entrapped by me and we both feel alone. Can I fix this? "

If I stay for the masters I can get another internship next summer, most likely higher profile (I'm thinking google, microsoft, amazon, dropbox, etc. A lot of students from my department go on to places like this).

I have a few fantasies in mind, but I'm open to other ones. In general, my kinks are D/s, exhibitionism, dirty talk, ageplay, incest (Dad/dau), bondage, rough play, cum play, impreg. Limits include toilet stuff and non-con.

Specifically, here are the fantasies I'm thinking about:

1) Dad/dau play. Maybe you're my secretary or a new intern. Maybe you're just playing hooky to come visit Daddy at work. While others may think you're innocent, Daddy knows what a dirty girl you really are. Or maybe you're just an out and out slut. Maybe we can have some people watch or join in? Or maybe we have to sneak around.

2) I read a cuckquean scenario last night and it caught my attention. I don't have a lot of experience with this one, but it sounds like fun. Maybe you are my wife who gets off on letting me play with other women. Maybe you're the other woman--younger, hotter, kinkier, wilder.

3) You're a neighbor, a girlfriend, daughter, whatever. This one would be a bit of a transformation tale. Not a straight up bimbo transformation, but definition an innocent to sub fucktoy.

Hope one of these catches your attention. Can't wait to hear from you."

I don't mean to turn this into a ""looking for work"" forum but would really appreciate anyone's advice. I'm an undergrad at a top 15 school studying journalism, with a year left. Last month, U.S. immigration hawked down on me (through no fault of my own; no illegality involved; can explain in PM) and I chose to return to the country of my citizenship as to not risk my goal of graduating.

I picked up coding (mostly front-end dev languages + Python) after realizing the huge potential of knowing how to code so journalists can tell stories better, more empathetically and more beautifully online. I've had a couple internships at journalism organizations with their news applications/web dev team, so feel confident about, if nothing else, my ability to learn quickly. I've gotten over the initial hump of ""WTF am I looking at?"" a couple years ago so have been working on different projects since (db, UX/UI, design, data, PM, etc.).

It will be at least a year or two before I can return and finish school. Until then, I'm looking to engage my time usefully by building upon the skills that I have. Sadly, because the journalism-tech community is still fairly small, no such thing exists in my country; I can't speak the country's official language at a professional level; companies here put a lot of emphasis on having a degree to be hired; the list goes on. 

So I've been trying to see if there are ways for me to work/intern for a company/organization abroad, remotely (or maybe even moving there with the proper visa), preferably one that has some human-interest, social aspect to it. What might be your best advice for me?

**TLDR;** Life is not cooperating atm. How can I find a paying (IDC if it's min-wage; gotta support myself somehow), non-CS degree-friendly, remote internship doing web development work? "

I've been having a rough go of it lately. I've been feeling super confident in my diet some days and then tearing down all my hard work other days. 

I think I've come to the conclusion that all my self-sabotage revolves around alcohol. I've been cycling through losing and gaining five pounds for the last month. When I start to see real progress I grab a beer or two and on occasion drunkenly splurge on whatever food is available.  It doesn't help that my fiance is a non-ketoer and a beer enthusiast.

It's not really so much a food issue, as I'm not tempted by his food around the house, but I am tempted while drinking out and about. Typically I'll order french fries or other carby foods and go straight back to work the next day. Obviously this isn't ok, and it really doesn't work to splurge on this diet like it can on others.

I guess back to the main issue, the drinking. I never start cheating unless it's with booze. Always with the alcohol. I tell myself all week I'm not going to drink but it always happens. I just don't know what to do. If I keep drinking this lifestyle isn't going to work for me.

AA is out of the picture until next year, along with in person means of help. I'm leaving for an internship for the next two months in the middle of nowhere. Unfortunately alcohol will be available to me. I just hope that since I'm out of my house I'll have better will power. 

Any suggestions ladies? I'm just feeling really bad about things."

I am passionate about my major, have my dream internship lined up for the summer, get good grades, etc. I also have a good number of friends, I'm an introvert so I'm not super out there but I have enough friends to have a normal social life, stuff to do, etc.

Many of my friends are guys, and some of them are my friends because I was interested romantically in them, and when that didn't pan out (they just weren't interested) we became good friends. I'm decently girly but also a fan of Marvel/camping and hiking/other things that my guy friends like so sometimes I guess I am seen as just one of the guys.

I think I'm decent looking, I'm not stick thin but I'm athletic, I rock climb 3 times a week and stay active. I am confident in my body and myself, dress well, do my hair (most days) and wear a little make-up.

Here's the thing though:  I'm a 20 year old female who has never kissed a guy, gone on a date, or had a boyfriend. I've never even noticed a guy checking me out. I've gotten sick of this so I've just started making the first move if I like a guy. I've never been one to think that has to be the guy's job.

I've come to the point where I've just been turned down by a guy I really liked (we were friends, I asked him to hang out and watch a movie, he ended up texting our mutual friend right after I left asking if it was supposed to have been a date, because he wasn't interested).

Is it socially acceptable for me to just ask some of my guy friends (especially those who turned me down) why they did? I'm getting to the point where I'm so frustrated, I don't know if it's a physical thing, a personality thing, or what. The guys I'm going after are of similar looks and social standing and all that, so it's not like I'm crying over being turned down by Ryan Gosling.

I don't want to make myself more unappealing by seeming insecure about it, I think I deserve love and all that, I'm just honestly confused and want to know why guys all want to be my best friends (literally ever guy who has turned me down has then go on to be my best friend and spend a ton of time with me) but don't want to date me.

Came home at 23 and started college right away. It took me 5 years to finish undergrad engineering (i will be graduating next week) and already have a job lined up (working there now 9-530 mon-fri). I am 28 yrs old now.

* I will be making 60k/year to start with a guaranteed 4.1% increase in salary every year until i cap out around 92k on a 40 hour work week. (it's a union engineering position). any hours over 40 hours is 1.5x my pay.

* my car is paid off, so i only pay insurance. car has 112k miles.

* i have 0 debt with 15k in cash savings

* i live in an expensive area (boston and surrounding area), typical rent can range from $1000+. Most are at least 1000-1100 at the very least.

* i get free healthcare from the VA. i just go to any VA hospital for any problems i have.

* bill summary: car insurance $200/month, phone bill $80/mo , food $varies depends on how much i go out to eat, gym $25/mo, gas $250/month i fill up about 5 times a month.


my parents are divorced so i live with my dad and my sister. my dad is cool, he doesn't bother me or give me a hard time at all. hell i hardly even see him, i work 9-530 now, come home eat and just hang out in my room. he never asks me to do any chores, but i help him shovel snow and other things just because.

* my goal is to buy property when i have enough money. preferably a house/condo under 300k. would it be recommended that i just live with my dad until i save up enough for a downpayment + emergency fund or move out now and rent a place for my own?

**edit**: thanks for the advices everyone. so i rented out an apartment while i was in the service and paid for my own food at the time. i managed to save up about 60k before i left. the reason why i only have 15k left now is because i spent 26k cash on my car and another 19k to pay for my last two semesters of school because i had run out of the gi bill. right now i'm still an intern but will be a full time hire very soon starting at 60k/yr. currently i make about 2400/month after taxes and have about 565/month in total bills (exluding food). so i'm left with 1835/month to do whatever i want and i save at least 1400 dollars of it. the rest i spend on food/pleasure. i don't really have much time to do anything anyways. i don't go out if i have work the next day so my days to hang out are friday nights and saturdays but those days i just spend with my girlfriend chilling at her/my house anyways.

i guess the reason why i'm asking about renting is based solely on the opinion of ""it's embarassing to live with your parents at 28"". financially, it makes perfect sense to just live with my dad."

I'm a [filmmaker from Wisconsin](http://www.nathandeming.com), currently living in Chicago.  I went to the London Film School and my work has been in the LONDON SHORT FILM FEST, EDINBURGH INT'L FILM FEST, and BRITISH SHORTS BERLIN.  My latest film, **[DOG DAYS](https://vimeo.com/101995733)**, is a quiet, personal story about learning about discovering violence that just premiered at the WISCONSIN FILM FESTIVAL.

I'm working on my first feature, called **SPEAKING IN TONGUES**.  It's about my journey from normal, calm dude to extremist evangelist and then to atheism.  It follows 6 college students who go on a ""church internship"" to help start the latest branch of a megachurch called Bright Horizons in Chicago.  Over the course of the summer, our main character completely loses himself in faith and devotion, only to find a hypocritical center to the faith that makes him question and leave it.

Among other things, it's got awkward street evangelism (which we'll do FOR REAL to get real people's opinions, ha), some cool VFX (our main character's hands start on fire whenever he thinks God is near), and a moving personal journey that tries to capture WHY many people get hooked into religion, and WHY they leave it.

Our budget is **$10,000**, which is microbudget territory, and not new for me (my last short was self-produced, and cost 20% of what it should've cost, thanks to favors and connections).  

I'm beginning the process of putting together a Kickstarter, but I also wanted to gage the support of the atheist community.  If there's any individuals in particular who think they'd be interested in supporting my project at any level, please PM me.

P.S. Here's **[TONGUES](https://vimeo.com/86385229)**, a previous short I did about my relationship with religion.

I am currently doing a IT internship in the city hall and yesterday my supervisor gave me a employee's PC and said that it had some virus and told me to clean it.
So i took the computer to my workspace, logged in and noticed it was no normal virus as it had som instructions on how to decrypt the files and some tor links with instructions and etc.

After a couple hours yesterday and the whole morning of today i think i came to a dead end. The computer had no shadow copies of the files and the stubborn user didn't save his files in the server folder.
I also tried the *decryptcryptolocker.com* website but it dind't work (during my research i read that it doesn't work with newer versions of the encryption).

Do you guys know of a solution for this or do we really have to pay for the files if they are really that important?

Sorry for some technical terms that i used as i am not a native english speaker."

I took all the normal C.S. classes (Operating Systems, Data Structures, etc) and I would say I did well b/c I spent time in understanding the concepts. I also did my internship where I had to learn Perl. 

However, after I graduate, I got a job in Business Analysis / Business Advisory field and have not done any programming since then. However, after 6 years, I am done. I did a small project in VBA in Access and truly enjoyed the work. 

I am interested in switching my career and going back to software engineering. However, I would like to focus more on data analytics as opposed to front-end / back-end development. I would like to understand the concepts of big data, but based on past experience, quickly work on a project or get a job in a related field. I think that is the best way to learn in parallel to spending time learning the concepts / theory. 

What are some courses / materials available for focusing on data analytics? If possible, I would actually prefer taking in-person classes as opposed to online courses. I am based out of NYC area. "

On July 1st, I begin my first real job as a 26 year old adult! To this date, I've had no real income aside from a summer internship in undergrad and a 1 day a week gas station job (paid cash and off the books). I've heard so many horror stories of doctors going into financial misery that I'm fairly worried about becoming an anecdote one day because of my illiteracy . Luckily, unlike most of my classmates who have debt in the 6 figures, I went to an instate school, lived pretty conservatively, had a lot of assistance from my parents, as well as scholarships and my total debt is only $14,000 subsidized loans at 5% interest (my parents might pay this off for me as well). My parents have also allowed me to use one of their cars while I've been a student and have been paying the insurance on it as well (not sure if I will be taking that with me to residency or not). 

As a resident physician my salary will be roughly 52k/year for the next 4 years. I will have health insurance from the hospital I work at with no monthly charge as an added bonus as well as disability insurance. The city I'll be moving to is Cleveland and the home prices there aren't to staggeringly high and are actually pretty good. I'm at a loss in figuring out how much of my money will go to taxes, how much will I take home and how much can I save. I plan on buying the place I move to, as an investment, and hopefully rent it out to a medical student or resident once I finish my training in Cleveland (I rented my last place from a former resident physician and pretty much paid his mortgage for him). I'm not familiar at all with home buying but people have recommended using a real estate agent. I don't really know what loan options are available to me as well or what types of loans to look for. I'd also like to take this opportunity to start saving and investing but don't really know what to do. 

Things I have at my disposal: I have some money saved up, just under 10k. My credit history: I have a creditkarma account and follow my scores. Currently it says I have a 758 transunion score and 744 equifax score (I have a $26 bill that went to collections because fuck people who charge you one thing and then change the charge after you've paid initially, contacted them for a pay to remove but they declined the offer.) I have 3 main use credit cards without any major debt (pay off in full every month) and a total credit limit just shy of 30k and 4 other credit cards from macys and what not without that high of limits. 

I guess to summarize what I need help with is:

* Home, Buy vs Rent? What is a good rate for someone like me, what should I look for in a mortgage. 
* Begin to save? What should I look for in that department? I plan on doing the 6 month saving to build up a safety net, but that's it so far. 
* Begin to invest? Good resources to invest in and how much to tuck away. 

Thanks     "
32t7om,0,2015-04-16,"Childhood friend sexually assaulted but ""over it""",zante74,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/32t7om/childhood_friend_sexually_assaulted_but_over_it/,"First of all, I should state that we are not from a western country, so please bear with me if any of my description or opinion sounds alienated to you. Throwaway for obvious reason.

I have a friend who I have known for 9 years, she has basically been a best friend and we went to the same school for the first six years. After that we went our separate ways for university but we keep in constant contact, meeting up every couple months or so to catch up and would talk for hours. She has always have the image of a tomboy - strong, with a harsh sense of humor - which was why we became friend in the first place. 

Around the end of 2014, she called me up and asked what I thought of having a fwb, which is not a common or at least publicly celebrated concept in our part of the world. But I was pretty open to such things, having been on reddit and interacting with some foreign friends and learned their idea of a healthy sex life. I told her it was nothing to be judged and that ""as long as you dont get hurt, Im all blessings"". She said okay but so far they had only made out, because she didnt want a sexual relationship with a stranger, especially not before marriage. She was still a virgin then. (She is a Christian - more relevance to the story later)

Fast forward about 2 months, she told me they ended up having sex on new years eve. She didnt want it at all but he did. And at that point she had been having feelings for him and therefore was obliged to say yes. I was baffled when I heard this, and asked her to cut ties with him right away. She said she would but they actually had to finish their internship together, alone in a basement everyday for 8 hours. She assured me the sex would never happen again. Yes, I told her to not have any physical contact with him anymore and she said she would. Yet at this point she still liked/loved him and he had become a close friend. She said she would ""watch herself"". God I wish she did.

The last part was from tonight. She told me what happened in the past 3 months, crying her eyes out. She still liked him initially and they kept on sleeping together without her liking it. But he wanted the liberty to pursue other girls. My friend said in that case their fwd deal should end, and he refused. They remained a sexual relationship. She constantly wanted to cut ties but due to the persistence of the guy and her own feelings, she never succeeded. Eventually, the guy started to fall for another girl. On one hand my friend was relieved for ending this messy relationship, on the other hand she felt a bit sad being ""used"" for sex and ""thrown away"". She never enjoyed the sex (Christian mindset) more than she enjoyed the intimacy with the guy she loved(and he knew it). Saying all that, she went to end things with him. He was quite impatient and distracted throughout the conversation. She thought it was a done deal and was getting ready to leave. He said he wanted a ""broke-up sex"". She said ""we were never a couple thus there is no breakup"". He started begging her and she insisted no. She only wanted to go back and rest. She tried to leave the room but the guy had her trapped. She kept saying you will regret this, you will know what youre doing tomorrow and you will be nothing but ashamed. The guy couldnt hear anything, he had nothing but sex on his mind. He said this is not going to talk a lot of work, all you have to do is lie down. She did. She told herself ""Im a Christian, I endure until I cant take it anymore"" and she did. He didnt actually rape with PIV her but basically pleasured himself sitting on her. She hated the whole deal. At last he wanted a blowjob and she repeatedly said no (she had little experience and always hated it). And then he did it. He held her breath out of her will, so she would open her mouth for his penis. She said that was the single most horrifying experience she ever had. They were even friends up to this point, and this is what he ended up doing to her. She didnt remember any more detail from that night. She went back her room afterwards and blacked out. 

She was sobbing when telling me all these.

I am really messed up now. She never called the police or anything because she didnt want anything else out of it. They study in a small school. Both her and the guys's reputation would be ruined, namely the latter but she didnt want to take the risk. I respect her decision even though I could not care less for what happens to the guy at this point. I only want to protect her. They still see each other in person because of class schedules and the guys still tries to be her friend. He has started dating the girl he liked and acts as if they could just put all these behind them. He tells her ""its not a big deal, why are you still upset"". The horrific experience was 3 weeks ago so she no longer has prove of it. She also told me she's ""over it"" now. She just wants to graduate and never see this man again (somehow he still has the courage to message her on facebook casually asking her how she was!). She thinks the guy will get punishment later in ife for what he did. Not from her, but from other people. (The concept of karma, that is...sorry if this sounded crazy but it does sound comforting at times, in this case especially). As for me, I dont know what to do. I want the best for her and if that means not telling anyone of this experience thats exactly what I will do. I just cannot believe this could happen to a person I am so close to and who I thought was so strong and protecting of herself. The image is going to stuck in my head until i dont know when.

TL;DR: Child friend got sexually assaulted and told me about it crying. Wants nothing to do with it afterwards except carrying on with her life. The image is stuck in my head."
32t80k,1,2015-04-16,"[M20] My ex [F20] is continuing to see her new lover whilst we still live together, I'm heartbroken",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/32t80k/m20_my_ex_f20_is_continuing_to_see_her_new_lover/,"Hi guys,

So basically, me and my now ex girlfriend were together for over 2.5 years, ever since meeting eachother at university. We've had our ups and downs but we've always managed to make it work and were generally happy together. However, she gets a new job over a year ago, and gets a new social circle. I'm delighted because she's never really had that before, and things were great up until we've moved in together, just the two of us...

We moved in together last July, I started a full time internship, so I still am working it until this july, and she started her final year at university (only in uni for 6 hours a week), so she's had a lot more spare time than me overall.

So anyway, it gets to around november/december, I notice her and this other guy that she works with become quite close as friends. They hang around a lot together in studies, bars, and are constantly joined at the hip whenever they are all out with their 'work friends' (I've bumped into them a few times all out together, and my ex and him were always huddled together talking and sitting next to eachother, etc).

So anyway, at this point (january) I start getting quite annoyed with all the shady stuff she's started doing (e.g. switching her phone off whenever I come near her, dolling herself up really good on a 'work night out', which I'm never invited to, and then never coming home until the day after, claiming that she 'stayed at a friends house', catching them out together and her trickling the truth again and again).

So FINALLY I've had enough, I went away for a week, and when I came back I checked her phone for texts, it turns out she spent the whole week with this other guy, and i saw things like 'I wish things could be different, miss you, etc). So I end it with her right there and then. She didn't even ask to take me back or didn't put up a fight or anything, instead all she did was ask about our living arrangements.

Ever since she's been out with guy 'walking', on little dinner trips, staying over at his house 'watching films', etc. I'm not an idiot, I know what's been going on.

The worse part it, she's been away for 2 weeks, and we occasionally whatsapp, but everytime I check her messages she's last seen online &lt;1 or 2 minutes ago. Which means she's constantly texting this other guy non stop. like literally she never constantly texts anyone, she's not a big texter to anyone, so it's obvious that it's this guy. Even at 4-5AM in the morning she was on it constantly when she was out in town with her home friends. They're probably in love or some shit at this point. I have no idea what I'm going to do. She comes back home in around 4 days after a (long) easter break from uni. I'm 100% sure she's going to continue seeing this guy non stop at work, drinking, and now it looks like she's staying over at his all the time. So this is pretty serious. She doesn't tell me much of what's going on, she never has. But at this point it's STUPIDLY obvious that they're going to be an official couple sooner rather than later. So I have no idea what to do. I'm just sat at work all day, and then I come back to our home and she's hardly ever there, she's out with this other guy most of the time. I can't move out because I need the place for work, she needs it for uni. Honestly my heart is still broken because I know all of this time she just wanted to be with him, and she was stringing me along.

Now once we breakup, this girl who I've known for around the same time as my ex invites me to a gig, she's on my course at uni and we're good friends. She's been quite flirty with me before but I've always ignored her because I was in a relationship, also she flirts with a lot of people so I thought nothing of it really. Anyway I go and end up stopping over at her place because the gig was near her house. Nothing really happened, but when I get back my ex got SUPER angry and started acting passive aggressive at me all day. I don't see why since she's done this to me countless times before, but I go out with my friends and she starts blowing up my phone being like 'why her, out of any girl why her', and starts accusing this other girl of being a slut, whore, etc. Like super jealously. The next day she calms down and goes out with this guy again. It's like she's now trying to 1-up me now and wants to make me suffer almost. I don't know where I stand. I still have feelings (sort-of) for my ex, but at the same time I know she's probably in love with someone else already.

tl;dr: My heart is broken. Girlfriend wanted be with someone else for the last year of the relationship. We breakup, I sort of start hanging out with this other girl and she gets mad/jealous so she stops with this guy even more.

32t855,2,2015-04-16,I [M24] and a girl [F19]... how to not make her potentially uncomfortable when asking her out cause of age gap?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/32t855/i_m24_and_a_girl_f19_how_to_not_make_her/,"So long story short, I went to college and majored in something for 3 years, took a year off to deal with mental health stuff, then came back and have done pretty well in turns of internships, grades, etc.

Recently I met this girl who is a freshmen... 5 years younger than me. I am a very warm person naturally and I really think that community and having relationships with people you care about is the most important thing in the world. At my school, this is not common, as many people are highly concerned about their careers and image, are not warm people because of their culture, or other reasons.

She really tries and makes people feel good in the same way that I do. She initiates texting just as much or more than I do, and is always just genuinely happy to be around me. I think she's the best, and she's beyond gorgeous.

So at some point I really would like to date her in a more focused way.. but there's the possibility that she's just extremely warm to a lot of people, or that she just isn't going to see me in a dating way even if we can still become BFFs, etc.

So ladies, Im wondering how I can approach the dating topic (when I feel like were both ready) without potentially making her feel freaked out or uncomfortable because of the age gap? She also has a great relationship with her parents and from what Ive heard they are super good people, so I want to make them feel good about what their daughter does as well.

I just dont know what its like to be a freshman girl in college (though a very mature one) and have to deal with attention from men who she may think are too old.... the point is that her feeling comfortable is the most important thing to me, regardless of what happens, and I dont know how best to retain that as a guy 5 years older than her asking for part of her life.

Sorry if this is vague or repetitive, I dont really know what Im asking at this point either.

And did I mention that she's drop. dead. gorgeous? Yea, I dont know why she talks to me but Im ok with it lol.

tl;dr I think a girl is interested in me, I definitely like her a lot, how to not put her in the spot due to age gap when talking about dating?"

I got the job through a staffing agency, but it is not a typical temp place. They described the job as “long term” when they hired me, but I feel like I’m still treated like an intern.

When I do project and finish them, my boss always says OH SOMETHING FOR YOUR PORTFOLIO or A NEW PIECE CONGRATS like I’m an intern. I know I should be taking it positive, but I just feel like it’s kind of demeaning. I want to think of it as a job, not something temporary I get portfolio pieces from. I have bills and debt!

And, I feel like they don’t give me as many projects as the other freelancers here. One guy previously did my job, but typically, they would have many people with my position. Now, it is him and I. 

Today I really felt like an intern. I just got out of a meeting for a project when my boss showed me this stuff they had torn down from redoing the office and told me to basically clean it up and rip the stuff off as a “little project.” I was pretty pissed but didn’t show it. I told him I wanted to work on X instead right now. Eventually, I will probably have to do it. But I just feel like they wouldn’t ask the other people to do it. Why should I? I mean, we have a admin assistant who does stuff like this all the time.

I hope this does not continue because I like the work and the company, and I am lucky to have the job. But now I fear in a couple months they will tank me, and it was like an internship. 

tl;dr; freelance job feels like an intern, less work than I would like, little projects popping up now that include cleaning or picking up after them, money and company is good. don't want to leave but ego is taking a hit.

i am a young professional (26) who is totallystraight. at work, one of my colleagues introduced me to one of her subordinates. he's a young, sarcastic, charming, attractive 18 year old. of course, i noticed him immediately, but really grew to like him from the brief interactions i've had with him (i work in a totally separate department). he really is very charming, and his muted sarcasm is right up my alley. 

anyways, i noticed some chemistry after i sassed him jokingly... ever since then i noticed him always trying to get closer to me. if there is a group of us, he will always find his way to my side. i will catch him gazing up at me, and if i look his way he will smirk, roll his eyes, and look away. i know that probably doesnt sound very attractive, but the way he smiles and looks away are very transparent, and actually kind of sexy. he is obviously a little into me at least. 

on a separate occasion, i was visiting my colleague and he just happened to be there. again, i could feel his energy focused on mine. the way he looked at me--his head turned slightly downward, eyes flared with hidden intensity, with his mouth hung ajar and smirking--was hiding nothing. it actually made me uncomfortable because i am his superior and this is my work environment. after clocking out, my colleague mentions that this young man actually has a little crush on me. i laughed and deflected 

today though, today the line was crossed. and i couldnt be more turned on. it was right before clocking out, my colleague had her little posey with her and he was amongst them. they welcome me in, we chitchat. of course, he comes closer to me. he was smirking again. eyes darting away every time i looked his way. he started trying to bicker at me--he's figured out i kind of love it--and of course i was throwing it right back. it was great, i would make enough eye contact and he would blush and turn away, again smirking but trying to hide it all. as the general conversations progressed, i mentioned noticing all the knickknacks on my colleague's desk. they all agree and start taking them. i picked up what looked like the cylinder part of a bike pump--a tube with an inner tube that you can pull out and reinsert to pump air.... the motions are very phallic, and the thing itself is conveniently cock shaped.

 anyways, i take it and ask her what it is.. she answered, but i didnt catch it and asked again... then as she answered, he takes it from my hands and begins pumping it. not hard, softly. as he pumps it, he looks at me and smiles... this is just their humour, they all laughed. he kept doing it, and his technique got more suggestive. he was now masterfully jacking off this pump while smirking. i of course laugh with the others and tell him to get the hell away from me... but one of them notice im blushing. they all laugh even harder. it was pretty hilarious actually, if it werent for the fact that i wanted nothing more than replace that pump with my dick. he went right to the jugular and without any shame. i was at work, so i couldnt deflect that display with equally sharp retorts--i am his superior, i shouldnt have even been in that situation with him altogether. he saw i liked it, i think they all did. as we clocked out, he kept the joke going, he kept trying to get me uncomfortable by overly hitting on me. 

i only wish i had been more prepared for that situation hahah...i was not expecting him going from 0 to 80! its superflatering that this boy is hitting on me, but i only wish i could satisfy both of our needs... i cant in this position though...maybe once he is done his internship 

has anything like this happened to any of you? what did you do? what do you wish you did? what should i do"

Timothy Anderson created a charitable foundation called the World Computer Exchange. He was trying to find a way to help the world after he graduated from Harvard and he saw that many reports of donations included the basic needs such as water, food, housing materials, etc. Anderson says. “I thought about what I would need; what’s missing to allow me to me and what I do? I just kept coming back to computers.” I think this was great idea because many of us take our computers for granted. There's so much information on the internet and when people aren't looking at cat videos they can literally learn almost anything. This would be a enormous help to the people in developing countries that only dream of owning a computer. This will grant THOUSANDS of kids and adults access to their very own computer.

Many organizations like The Salvation Army, Goodwill, World Vision, United Way are worth billions of dollars. They get help all the time. WEC isn't a large foundation, but has an amazing model that could definitely use the help. $800,000 will go to the World Computer Exchange and $200,000 will go to me and my family.

We can do this with just a dollar from you.

I do not think I will be able to take my desktop computer. Here are the two main reasons for this:

1. I will be taking a plane there as driving is out of the question (no parking, won't need car anyway). It's unsafe/too expensive to ship my computer tower/monitor (This is the case for reference, its massive: [Corsair Air 540](https://www.google.com/search?q=corsair+air+540&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;biw=1440&amp;amp;bih=734&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=0O0vVf_XJoOiyAThloCQAQ&amp;amp;sqi=2&amp;amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg)

2. I don't think there will be enough space in our dorm-like apartment. As far as I have been told, it will be 2-4 students per room with about 4 bedrooms to a suite containing a kitchen/living area. 

I have a 2011 Macbook Pro that I will bring but it cant really run League at all. I am open to possibly buying a new computer soon as I am starting to hate this thing for other reasons as well. 

I cannot go that long without playing my favorite game with my friends so I am open to all of your suggestions! (be it buy a certain laptop, strategy to bring desktop, etc.)

**TL:DR** Moving for just Fall semester, probably can't bring awesome huge desktop, NEED LEAGUE O LEGEND FIX, what do?

32u3gf,3,2015-04-16,Putting together a 2.1 home theatre system + turntable set up for ~$1000 and seeking advice before the purchase.,Ninjasquirrel21,hometheater,https://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/32u3gf/putting_together_a_21_home_theatre_system/,"I know there have been posts on similar builds so I apologize if these feels, reposty… Some of the info is a few years old and I would appreciate the help or advice on this as this subreddit has taught me a lot and I would like to use your advice to confirm I’m making the best choice, and that anyone else in the same position as me will be able to refer to this.


So to being, I’m fairly new to the world of audio to the depth that I feel this build is going to be. I have always been an aspiring audiophile though money has always been an issue. I have Klipsch pro Media 2.1’s for my desktop, Klipsch R6 ear buds and the ATH-M50 over ear. I have gone with these as the internet has seemed to love them and they’ve made me want to be continue to progress to get the most of my sound (Music specifically). I plan on trying out external DAC’s  with my equipment soon to take that to the next step. So now to the reason I’m here. I plan on putting together a home theatre system this summer (thanks internships) and have been reading a lot on here and taking a lot of advice from over at r/zeos. So I’m getting a Samsung Plasma F5300 from a friend for my TV and am planning on setting up a 2.1 sound system (as well as my first turntable) that I will be able to convert to a 5.1 once I graduate and have more room. I plan on spending between $750-$1500 on the audio equipment and turntable. My current plan is to do 2 bookshelf speakers, an essentially “end game” sub I won’t need to replace when I expand, a solid phono pre-amp to run the turntable, and a nice power amp after. I believe that the pre-amp/power-amp will allow me to bypass getting a 5.1 receiver of sort for now as the pre-amp does the switching and power-amp will amplify the signal. Is this smart to do or would it be a better investment to get a receiver right away instead of the pre-amp/power-amp set up? The Current build I’m working on would include this.


Bookshelf speakers 
-

-	Teac LS-H265 $200 – I’ve only heard good things about these but read in many places that the price hike is kind of a turn off.

Or

-	Chane A1rx-c - $300 – A bit pricier but I feel the investment will be worth it and they won’t need replacement

Or

-	HTD Level 3 $330 – Highest rated on Zeo’s not sure if they’re worth the investment but willing to go this route if they are very highly regarded


Or

-	Anything this subreddit suggests :)


Subwoofer 
-

-	SVS SB-1000 $500–Highly rated and I feel strongly will not need replacement if I expand.

Or

-	Klipsch R-110SW $550 – Kind of always have been a Klipsch Fan boy…

Or

-	Once again anything you guys suggest, I’m not sure if I’m going to big and won’t need to spend this much money on the sub, but from my research it sounds it pays off to just get a great sub from the start if possible

Phono Pre-Amp
-	
-       TCC tc-754 $80 – Honestly I probably know the least about this and this was the only one r/zeos recommended so it seems like a good choice from what I know.

Powered Amp
-
-	Behringer Reference Amplifer A500 $200 – Highest rated on Zeo’s though I’m wondering if it’s worth it to go for this high end of an amp right now. Because when I move to a 5.1 I will need a receiver that takes care of the amplification (correct?)

Or

-	AudioSource Amp-100 $120 – Smaller amp that still puts out 60 watts per channel into 4ohms that I feel will get the job done I need for a more reasonable price
Turn-Table

Or

-	Audio Technia AT-LP60 $120 – Quality low price and recommended starter turn table. This one has a built in pre amp. For sake of future upgrade I wouldn’t mind still getting the above stated Pre-Amp (or a different one) with the build still

So I believe this covers what I know and plan on doing and how there is some good advice I can get about this build and the idea I have doing this and eventually transitioning to a 5.1 Thanks everybody in advance.

32u8j4,1,2015-04-16,I feel that my graduate studies became a trap to unemployment.,[deleted],GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/32u8j4/i_feel_that_my_graduate_studies_became_a_trap_to/,"This is going to be a bit long, so please bear with me.

I graduated with a psychology degree and got a teaching certificate a couple of years after. I originally planned on becoming a high school teacher, but I didn't have a license to back it up. Someone close to me offered me to work as a part-time college teacher at a public college. I was around 22 at that time. Since I really wanted to work, and I had problems finding a job, I just accepted it.

My mindset then was that it was just going to be part-time, while I look for another teaching job. I also thought that since I didn't have a master's degree yet, I would only be limited to general psychology courses.

However, the people close to me had the assumption that I should be tenured in that college. So they encouraged/forced me to take up a master's degree. It was not in my plan to get tenured, but I didn't have that much of a choice then.

I wanted to get a master's in history, but the people close to me shut it out, saying that because I'm a psychology graduate, I should take a psychology graduate degree to comply with vertical articulation in college teaching. Again, I didn't even plan on being tenured, and the key reason why I even took up psychology is because I just wanted to make sure that I'll have flexibility in finding work. After all, I was only 16 when I had to make that choice on which college course to take. But since I pretty much have very little choice, I just went on with it, and took graduate studies in social psychology as an acceptable compromise.

Over time, the pressure between my work in the college and my graduate studies has increasingly left me frustrated. I had to handle clinical psychology internships of around 100 students, and this is despite not having any clinical psychology internship experience myself. (I only had industrial and guidance counseling experience, which are way different.) I ended up getting major subjects, like statistics and experimental psychology, which forced me to re-study subjects that I've essentially forgotten from my college days. In some cases, I actually ended up studying the subjects from scratch, since my experience in college wasn't that satisfying. Plus, I had to teach other subjects like entrepreneurship for non-business students, because the college had a lack of teachers.

My graduate studies became a burden because for 1-3 nights a week, I had to literally hike on a mountain to go to class, since the building really is located in an elevated area, and oftentimes there is no vehicle to ride when I arrive to class.)

A point came when I decided that I've had enough. I was only working part-time (adjunct), without any medical benefits, and with way too much pressure in my brain than I could ever imagine before.

So I quit my job. I continued my graduate studies, though, because I've already started it, and I'll just have to finish it. I did want to get a social psychology graduate degree anyway; it's just that I had been forced to get it sooner rather than later.

As I looked for a job, I had very little luck. I got a job in teaching English to non-English speakers, which was cool, but then it didn't pay too much and it was only seasonal. Another college offered me a job, but I was misinformed about the nature of the job and I ended up feeling the same pressure once more. I had to teach major psychology courses in a college where I'm the only psychology teacher available! I'm not even an expert yet!

Now I'm trying to look for another job, while continuing my master's degree. But I honestly feel like the master's degree is becoming way too much of a burden for finding a stable job. I couldn't teach in a high school setting, because my master's will definitely kill me. I couldn't work in certain companies, because the long travel time and the master's will kill me as well. While my younger brother gets to enjoy a full-time job already, my master's degree is stopping me from doing so. And from time to time, it annoys the hell out of me. I'm being offered a corporate job, but then again, my plan was to teach high school, not a corporate job. Three years in, and the plan is all messed up.

Essentially, I feel like my graduate studies was a trap. The people close to me thought it would be fine, since it would supposedly elevate my career and make me get paid more. They said that it's going to be easy, because all of you supposedly have to do in master's is just sit around and listen to a lecture. (Even then, I questioned that notion.) They even told me to take the psychologist board exam to gain points in the tenureship. It always comes across to me as shallow thinking, and my decision to listen to them because they're close to me ended up screwing my life.

When a college tells me that they will pay me $28 a month for every major psychology course that I teach to a group of 10 students IF I have a thesis already, I can't help but question what the hell I'm doing. $28 to lecture in a school with no electric fan, no psych laboratory, no sufficient computers, no benefits. Plus, if there's a vacation that forces me not to have a class, I end up getting paid $7 per subject. If this was high school, I'd forgive it; but dammit, this is college. I sometimes wonder: is this really what this damn master's degree is worth?

Sometimes, I feel like it's not worth it, but quitting is no longer an option. I only have two years before I expect to graduate, so I might as well continue this. Plus, I really don't want to face the burden of getting letters of recommendation once again.

I feel that if I was just given more time to prepare myself and to be more mentally prepared, my master's would've been more productive for me. But because this master's degree was rushed to me out of a need for compliance, I've ended up being very disappointed. I'm not exactly becoming a ""master"", and I'm facing unemployment. (And thank goodness that English school offered to pick me up.)

I'm just hoping that after I graduate, I would still be able to fix everything in my life. I've taken some steps to doing so, and I hope my graduate degree won't be the immovable rock that blocks me from pursuing those steps.

tl;dr Being rushed to take master's has put me in an unemployment trap. Don't listen to graduate school advice from people who don't even understand what graduate school is really about. Or to some extent, what psychology graduate studies is really about."

So far I've applied to about 20 places and got 3 interviews, but couldn't get past the phone interview to the on-sites for any of them. So far, a lot of the places I'm looking at interviewing are asking that I be familiar with any programming language (java, C++, python etc.), but when I get to the interview -- they tell me they're looking specifically for X language and experience in X framework or technology stack. 

I was under the assumption that companies just wanted to find hungry learners (obviously with a background in CS at the very least), rather than already-competent students that could fill for an already-competent engineer but for cheap. My last interview with the lead director specifically told me that he expects me to know how to write tests for all the protocols in the 7 networking layers. To be frank, I've never really studied that sort of stuff, closest I got to networking protocols would be socket programming. I know my program definitely doesn't cover unit testing at all, since we're just expected to manually input values and hope to god our programs work (I know I should probably self-learn this, probably will this summer since I can't seem to get anything). 

How do recruiters expect students to know so much from the get-go?

I also notice that I sound pretty dispassionate and unknowledgeable during the soft-technical interview portion. When engineers ask me what I know about a certain field of programming (web dev, networking, etc.), I end up just giving them a general description of what the field is, embarrassingly -- in my defense that's really all a student is taught in school. I'm not sure how I can appear to be knowledgeable about something I'm really not. I'm at the point where I get rejected before I can even demonstrate a working knowledge of data structures or algorithms or anything I've learned, purely because of either a) shitty soft skills or b) I really do have no experience against other applicants.

32uffd,1,2015-04-16,How to approach recruiter about requesting an earlier decision?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/32uffd/how_to_approach_recruiter_about_requesting_an/,"Hey guys just quick background I am currently a sophomore in college who is just now finishing up the interview process for a summer internship. I reached the final round of interviews for two companies:

Company A is a  very large, established corporation with whom I interviewed for my dream position. I had a primary, somewhat informal interview/intro to the company. Then a secondary phone interview with the senior manager I would be working under. Then yesterday I went in-person, for what they said was the final interview. It was three rounds, one of which was with my phone interviewer and I think it went pretty well. I am also the only person interviewing for the position, it isn't of immediate need for the company, but they seem to like me and my experience. They told me at the end of the interview I would hear back in the next few days. 

Company B I applied to when I was freaking out a little bit about not having an internship yet so I applied on a whim. The position is a decent fit, but not exactly what I want to do. The firm is medium sized and in a pretty niche industry. I was never really enthusiastic about them, but their application process was straightforward. I made it to the second round which was a case-essay we had to submit within a few days. Submitted it, just hear back that I made it to the final round which is an in-person interview. They gave three dates and the one I picked was the latest since I wanted to hear back from Company A, so the interview is Monday.

Now here is my dilemma, I just sent the recruiter for Company A a follow-up/thank you email stating the usual etc. She replied rather quickly with this email:

""Thank you wingeddingbats, glad to hear you had a good experience. Would it be okay if we got back to you on Tuesday of next week on our final decision? We are finalizing a few things.""

I really don't want to have to go in to an interview Monday with Company B, a. Because I'm not very enthusiastic about the position and thereby don't think I would do as well and b. My finals week begins, and interviewing would inconvenience valuable time to study. 

Would it be inappropriate for me to send this message to the recruiter for Company A:

Hello 'Recruiter',

Unfortunately I have a deadline with another company on Monday and I was really hoping to hear back from 'Company A' before then. Having been through the interview process I have really enjoyed all the people that I have met and believe I would be a great fit. 'Company A' is my top choice and so I am wondering is there any way that you could possibly get back to me Sunday evening? I understand if logistically this is difficult and will do my best to reach out to the other firm. 

TL;DR: Is it appropriate to ask a recruiter to push their response time forward a day or two? "

I've run into this kind of things very often (I'm a software engineer/student and female colleagues of mine often get internships at places such as Microsoft, Google despite being vastly less qualified than I am (especially academically, but also from a professional point of view), I also tend not to put too much effort into selling myself, but that's not the point. (This is a personal anecdote, the real study is at the above url).

There you have it ladies and gentlemen, a double-blind test concluding that women are 2:1 favored over men in STEM tenure track (academia).
http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/04/08/1418878112.long

This is just the tip of the iceberg of course, in soft.eng in general, you'll see women have a vastly easier time than men at same qualification/skills. But this is not surprising to anyone around here. 

Obviously, I posted this to show this relatively recent study. It's in line with most of what most people around here know about the world, and obviously it would be a fool's game to complain about this. It's the way the world works. Complaining that a less qualified women got your job/position, is not a man's way of looking at things. A man would make it impossible for his employer not to hire him. 

If you're comparing yourself to women academically, or in some field that means something to you, then you're a nobody. If a man is really interested in a field, then he would master it. "

Just want to ask everyone how much was their real world salary when they first started out in the world of Salesforce, either you were an admin type or developer type, better yet, you were a ninja business analyst in the sales/marketing department.
I am about to graduate college with a degree in information systems with over a year and half of internship experience interacting with customers. Recently I got into the official Salesforce  ADM 201 class for free and I am studying to take the ADM 201 certification in the next few month or so. I just talked to a recruiter that specialize in hiring Salesforce professionals for other companies, his numbers of salary wise for someone like me (Entry level SFDC admin type) was only 35k-50k. Is this realistic? I thought that was pretty low, but wouldn't be bad for a start if it is in the lower cost of living area of the US like Texas or Arizona. 
So that's my question, when everyone here was just starting out, what was your salary and how was your benefits? How long did it take you to make more money or to get to where you are today at your position?

Around 10 months ago I moved out home to live in London for a year long internship. The company that employed me also hired a few more people my age for the same scheme and sourced us a house for all of us to live in. So anyway.. There is this girl that I have lived/worked with for the last 10 months, and for the past couple months I have had feelings develop for her. 

The weird thing is that when we all moved here, at first I didn't really fine her attractive and didn't really make much of an effort to spend much time with her. Fast forward to around christmas and we suddenly clicked and started spending more and more time with each other. 

When we returned from our chirstmas break she starting going out for food with this guy she met on Tinder and I couldn't help but feel slightly jealous, I guess it was from that point that I knew I liked her as more than a friend. Dispite her going on these dates we continued to become closer, to the point that our housemates would comment on the amount of time we would spend together. 

So shes goes on another one of these dates with this guy and ends up bring him back to the house and ends up sleeping with him (as my room is directly below hers, you can imagine how much it hurt lol). At this point I said to myself that it's a lost cause and it wasn't worth the pain and I was determined to move on. 

The problem being that I live with her and we sit pretty much next to get other at work, also not to mention we have the same friends, you can imagine it was hard to avoid her. Nevertheless I attempted to distance myself from her and I just came accross as if I was mad at her. It made things very awkward.. 

So she ends up breaking contact with this guy soon after and I thought maybe things could go back to the way they were. We become very close again to the point where she would happily sleep in my bed on occasions. For the past few weeks I was constently considering the option of just coming clean and letting her know how I felt about her. I would have done this alot sooner with any other girl, but given the circemstances that I live and work with her, I was worried about things becoming very awkward. 

A couple days ago I got the point where I couldn't take it anymore. I told her how I felt. She was supprised and lost for words for quite awhile. She told that she hadn't really thought of me in that way, but seemed very flattered and happy. We spoke about the whole thing for about an hour before she went up to bed. The strange thing is that its almost like nothing as really changed.. She still comes and spends time with me and we still laugh and joke around. It's not awkward.

I am in the position now where I don't really know what to do. In 2 months time we will both leave this place and move to opposite ends of the country. I feel like I might still have a chance of some romance with her for the remaining time but on the other hand I don't want hurt myself even more by being shut down. The problem is I just can't avoid her.. She is around me literally all day, everyday..

Sorry this has been a long read. I appeciate any advice!
Thank You."

I'm a cs major at Umass Amherst (Ranked 25 for cs) and I came here for the strength of the program and I know the education quality will be good. My first semester I got all A's in my major courses so I have a 4.0 for my major gpa. However this semester, it looks like I will end up in the B/B+ range for both my cs and my math class. 



I heard the class next semester that I'm taking will be hard too and most people end up with B's after curving/scaling. I do fine with programming projects but I've been losing points in my cs class this semester because I can't wake up early enough for my morning class and nothing I do seems to help me wake up earlier. 


Anyways I'm just wondering if I end up graduating with a gpa in the B/B- range if my gpa continues to go down slowly (I'm currently at a 3.8), will I end up with a ""bad"" job or will experience and internships through undergrad make up for it? I have an interview set up for an on-campus computer related job for next semester which might help with work experience and I plan to start applying to some internships next year and then definitely aim to get one end of Junior year. 



Will my GPA hold me back from some of the more highly desired jobs? I obviously have dreams of working for a company like amazon but I would be fine anywhere as long as its a good environment and has good pay. I am taking the weed-out course right now which is probably why I have a much lower grade compared to last semester- I still have well above the average grade for the class though. I'm just worried since I know the classes will keep getting harder and harder. 


Thanks! "

I'm planning on doing more reviews in the near future, so keep an eye out if you are looking for a real consumer (read: *chemist*) with reviews. If anyone has any tips on how to make/format this better or ideas for future reports, please, by all means, inform me! I love *constructive* criticism. 

So without further ado..  (for a tl;dr - see ""conclusion"")

---    

IMPORTANT INFORMATION, PLEASE READ: STAY SAFE, USE REAGENT TESTS TO MAKE SURE YOU RECEIVED WHAT YOU ORDER ONLINE/ON THE STREET, AND ALWAYS ALLERGY TEST FIRST! THIS CAN SAVE YOU OR YOUR FRIENDS LIVES. YOU ONLY HAVE ONE, PLEASE DON'T WASTE IT BY BEING CARELESS.

I'm serious guys, I'd hate to read somewhere that someone died because I posted harm reduction information and they took it the wrong way then downed a bag of these strictly not for human consumption pills, then went out and did god knows what only to wake up with bruises and a terrible headache in a jail cell.. Or dead.

**Vendor:** N2P0  
**Product:** Clonazolam (Clonitrazolam) 0.5 mg 30 pack  

## Payment and Communication  

The payment was super swift, they accept CCs, bitcoin, bank wire, etc. I payed with by CC and was immediately notified that my order was being processed. Within the hour I received an email from their customer support informing me that they would  provide MSDS information with the order (as per my request).  
They were SUPER nice and helpful, answering all my questions and making sure I was completely satisfied and comfortable about the transaction and product.  
This team has customer service on par with DS, and I hope to see more vendors follow suit.
It's hard to express how impressed I am at the customer satisfaction they strive so diligently to achieve and maintain. Definitely my new go-to for Clonaz and hopefully more interested material in the future. 

## Shipping, Packaging, and Stealth  
So the packaging could use some improvements, it is sub-par but in this case there were no problems.  
I would suggest using Mylar bags as a second cover and for the stealth it provides.  
A return address (fake or not fake) is a must in my book. Without a return address, if for some reason they fuck up and loose the package, they will either send it to the return address or open it up, which can flag my address (that is not something I want).
Also, using a padded envelope would be better than cardboard boxes imo.

As for shipping; it took eight business days for it to arrive in the great southern state.  
They only had the option of untracked, regular mail (for op-sec I guess), but I'd really like to have the option to get tracking, especially from over-seas vendors.  

## Product and Images 
The research material came in small yellow capsules and seem to be of high quality, they don't instantly melt in your mouth or get squishy when you hold them.  
I am in the process of researching one capsule now and will update with results in a couple hours.  

[Here is an album with some of the packaging and product.](https://imgur.com/a/ayw29)

I have not yet had this tested by an independent lab but based on my personal research on rodents, I have concluded a rough hypothesis stating that the ingestion of 0.5mg can create feelings of euphoria, pronounced anxiolytic effects (but not to the degree of clonazePAM), and minor hypnotic effects. I will update this with more info within a few hours when more research has been performed if people request it.  
When administered orally on an empty stomach, onset happens around the 30-45 minute mark and the effects increase until the 2:00-3:30 minute mark (very tentative, varies from person to person due to metabolism and other things).

---

## Review Conclusion  

**Payment:** 10/10

**Product:** 10/10

**Communication:** 12/10  
*+1 for the MSDS.  
+1 for the few extra capsules they added.*

**Shipping:** 8.5/10  
-*1.5 for not offering tracking. I understand their reasoning, but I still want tracking.  &gt;:(*

**Packaging/Stealth:** 7.5/10  
*No mylar bags/other stealth: -1 point   
No return address: -1 point  
Slightly flimsy cardboard, would be better in a padded envelope: -0.5 point*

First of all, I need to clarify that I do not belittle software engineering jobs, but I know that they won't fit me and won't satisfy me probably. I am a CS undergrad student, (3rd year) in one of the best universities in my country. Nowadays, I chase an internship for this summer, thus gave a lot of thought about this and realised that a software engineering job that will make me sit down and write 7-8 hours of code everyday probably won't fit me. What I would prefer to do in the future is probably thinking about, struggling with 10 (or 20, you got the point) lines of code or some other thing for hours or even days rather than thinking less and doing more to get things done. (In terms of video games I enjoy playing Dark Souls more than playing Skyrim) I think that in order to get a job that I would enjoy, I should get a real expertise on a field. I have some interest in parallel computing, computer architecture, machine learning. (These are very broad fields but I am an undergrad student after all, I don't know much) I think that I may chase a career on R&amp;D departments on these fields but probably an UG degree won't be enough to do so. And I also wonder, would being an expert on any of these fields get me a job of my dreams? As you can see, I am in a struggle right now, so can you help me to sort things out?

That's all. I may sound cocky, weird, awkward etc. since English is my second language and my word selection can be awful. Sorry about that.
 
Thanks for reading."
32uum6,2,2015-04-16,3 shoes to cover bases for a college student,[deleted],malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/32uum6/3_shoes_to_cover_bases_for_a_college_student/,"So I've been running white leather sneakers for shoes for almost 2 years now and it's time that I expanded. Needed something that will look fine in campus but also not out of place at a government internship, but it's a research position so nobody cares at all what you wear. After reading tons of posts and articles, I'm looking at a couple of options now for my next shoe, and may add a pair of boots next fall. My guidelines are basically something that's 

* younger looking, something with a sleeker profile that's not overly plain and stifling
* around 200 dollars secondhand or new, but price is very flexible
* will definitely go with darker jeans and tan chinos and potentially some other pale pants but doesn't have to be worn with an ocbd - looking for something that's very flexible, can be worn with popovers, henleys, polos, whatever. If they went with some chino shorts that'd be amazing, but I feel like the odds are low so it wasn't really a criteria.

So after ruling out a mocs/loafers/boat shoes and the dressier shoes oxford/balmorals etc I'm considering

* Brogue - semi or wingtip, either a lighter brown like a chestnut or suede, paler to get it really light and casual. Feel like this might be too dressy (not as in formal but moreso #menswear) and not as flexible as I'm looking for, though I do like the aesthetic. I also feel it wouldn't really fit my style very well either because I dress very clean-casual. It may be an unfounded racial bias but I also feel as an Asian this style would be out of place.
* Bucks - considered white/sand, tan, and navy. Honestly tan is just unappealing - too basic and plain. Navy doesn't really work with jeans. White would be fun I think, but inflexible and exclusively a spring/summer shoe - also it's probably my penchant for white shoes taking over. A sort of pale grey/brown could be a strong middle ground, but I've yet to see anything here that I've really liked so if you've got any examples I'd much appreciaet it.


Any ideas for clean, casual, versatile shoes that would be great in spring/summer but still wearable in other seasons? "

It's not important.""",cheesy_italian,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/32vczw/you_dont_need_the_c_drive_its_not_important/,"Hello again, TFTS!!  I have yet another tale from my time as a Windows Sys Admin for $LargeFinancialCompany.  Enjoy!
*****
Part of my ever-growing list of duties included training the new interns that we got in our department.  This wasn't really too bad as I had experience training people before and I really liked helping out the new guys get a grasp on how things worked in our department and company.  So when $Boss informed me we would be bringing someone else in to help with the workload, I was pretty happy.

Monday morning rolls around and $NewIntern shows up promptly at 8am.  I usually take punctuality as a good sign.  I realize it was his first day and he was trying to make an impression but I needed some hope to cling to so I went with it.  $Boss makes the introductions and $NewIntern is left in my completely capable hands.  Cue the “getting to know each other” conversation.  

During the course of the conversation, we started talking about his technical background.  I found out $NewIntern was a senior in college and would soon be graduating with his Bachelor’s degree in CIS.  As a side note, I should mention that my only previous experience with anyone who did programming was an Army buddy of mine who knew as much about hardware and software as I do.  Based purely on this friendship, I made the assumption that this fellow programmer too had an in-depth knowledge of hardware and software and understood the basics of computers.

Now, this isn’t an insult to any other programmers out there by any means.  I have met plenty since this time that have blown me away with their knowledge of computers and how they work.  And I have also met plenty whom I was surprised could even find the power button.  This guy fell into the latter group.  For example, he broke a motherboard the first time I asked him to replace RAM in a server because he was trying to put it in the wrong way and decided brute force and a hammer would make it fit.  Yes, you read that right.  He used a hammer to pound RAM into a server the wrong way.  Imagine Thor using Mjolnir to fix your computer.   

*(I’ll give you guys a minute to compose yourselves and wipe your eyes after laughing your asses off.  If anyone fell out of their chair and was injured, I apologize.)*

The incident at the heart of this story is what made me understand he really had no basic computer knowledge.  For chronological sake, this came before the RAM incident.

Part of my job included wiping drives before sending them out to be destroyed.  We used a program called KillDisk and these were wiped according to DoD standards.  I had a wiping station set up that consisted of 4 servers.  Each server has 2 OS drives and 6 additional bays to be used for the hard drives to be wiped.  I wrote out explicit instructions that included screenshots, warnings, and tips for exactly how to do this process.  Apparently, they were not clear enough.  
&gt;$NewIntern: Hey, cheesy_italian, I think we have a problem with the KillDisk servers.

&gt;$Me:  Oh really?  What’s wrong with them?

&gt;$NewIntern: Well I was wiping hard drives last night and all of a sudden, I got a blue screen and it rebooted.  Now it won’t load.

Oh no.

We go back to the room and what is greeting me on the screen?  [This great Windows message letting me know there was no longer an OS]( http://imgur.com/PLZCwnV) on all four servers.
&gt;$Me: What happened?  Which drives did you choose to wipe?

&gt;$NewIntern: All of them.

&gt;$Me: Even the ones the instructions that I gave you explicitly say not too??

&gt;$NewIntern: Oh.  I didn't think I’d need them so I threw them away. *(shrugs shoulders)*

That’s right – he ran the KillDisk program on the C: drives of all four servers.  For those of you who aren't familiar with the program, it allows you to select which drives you want to wipe and which you want to leave alone.  This was spelled out in my instructions to avoid this exact scenario.

I don’t mind honest mistakes.  We've all made them before and will make them from time to time.  What bothered me was he blasé attitude about the whole thing and that he knew he made a mistake but didn't care.  No apologies.  No offer to learn to fix or restore the servers.  Nothing.  Just a shrug of the shoulders and a turned back as he walked off towards his desk.  Thankfully, he left shortly to go destroy some other companies’ hardware and software and we got a replacement that turned out to be awesome.
*****
TL;DR – Your C: drive isn't important and can be formatted; also, a hammer works wonders to install RAM.

I am 23 years young. I live in a privileged community. My family is connected with successful and hardworking families. My parents came to this country very poor and suffered for years before making steady income. There were many times where they went hungry to feed my older brother and I.

It's been a long journey, and we live a comfortable lifestyle in a safe neighborhood now. From the start, my parents made sure to surround me with ""good influences"" - role models that I could look up to. Overachieving, humble and healthy people.

Both my older brother and sister-in-law are successful for their ages: 31 and 29, respectively. They work for major firms in steady employment that allows them to travel frequently and be paid six figures. They chose the right majors in college and worked really hard. (And had a lot of luck!)

In college, I studied in the liberal arts (Mistake #2901) and excelled. After college, I moved back home. I was unemployed and the black sheep of the family for awhile. I worked internships and coffeeshops. Friends of my parents, with elite children attending Ivy Leagues and working in Wall Street, learned to stop asking questions about me. After awhile, my parents stopped mentioning me in public altogether. 

One year ago, I began working full time in a political campaign. Teeth pulling work with long hours and low pay. Then I progressed onto another campaign as field director, managing a team of 50 volunteers and 4 staff. Still overworked and underpaid, but I at least got to be more of a leader. Now I'm on break, catching my breath from an extremely stressful campaign that made me question my very existence.

I don't plan on staying in the field of politics forever (or, at least, in the low rungs). Working in this field has taught me to be more competitive, cutthroat, assertive and goal-oriented. I do have big plans and dreams, but don't think my family or friends would support me.

Right now, I don't feel good about anything. Everyone I know around my age seems to be progressing faster, harder and better. No one I know (outside of coworkers) works in politics. I feel ashamed living at home, when so many people have *moved on* (literally and figuratively). **I rationalize living at home to become more financially stable and move out when I have steady income. Also for the emotional support of being around my family.**

I pay rent and groceries and pick up after myself in the house. I have an active Roth IRA account. I have a semi-active social life. (Could be better.) I'm working on my health, exercising and eating more healthy foods. 

Here's what's wrong with my current situation:

* Living at home at age 23
* In the ""wrong"" field (better choices include business, STEM, law, academia, etc.)
* Overworked and underpaid 
* Gained a lot of weight and unhealthy habits due to stressful nature of work
* No romantic partner, which leads to less chance of being married in the future, which means less chance of grandchildren for my parents (the pressures of being female)

So after a week long breakup, where I would argue and suggest we stay together until she returns from study abroad, and she would say ok, only to change her mind the next day, we eventually broke up when she started crying hysterically and said she couldn't take it anymore and had to end it. That was 5 days ago and we haven't contacted each other since. 

After having some time to think about the relationship, I came to a devastating conclusion, despite what she did to me being extremely unfair. During our 3 years, the first was amazing - absolutely sensational. At the start of the second year I started a 6 month full time work internship and was miserable, and it was at the end of this period just before I had a 1 month europe trip planned that she expressed her doubts about the relationship. We stayed together and once I got back from europe and was back in the swing of uni (not work) things were amazing again. She was going through a lot of issues outside of the relationship, but our relationship was going great guns once again. Fast forward 8 months and I finish uni and start full time work. She is also in full time work for another year, and also at uni. Over that 12 months the relationship declined and I didn't see it until now. I don't think she even realised. The tone of our messages and conversations changed from joking and playful to just asking about each others days and each of us complaining to the other about work. On weekends as well I'd be too exhausted from being screwed all week that I wouldn't have much energy and would just want to laze around. 

At the end of that 12 month block (We'd now been together 2.5 years), she finished work to resume uni full time and started gearing up to study abroad, but meanwhile I was getting really screwed with work. I was being denied opportunities and hated my job and complained about it all the time. Her quality of life started to go up dramatically the closer she got to studying abroad, and the other problems in her life started to level out as well. So for the next 5 months of our relationship she did not need my anymore, not for support and I really needed her. She realised this over there, that the spark was lost and that she was just comfortable having me as a boyfriend, and it didn't necessarily make her any happier. I wish I could've known this at the time because I would've changed my life around there and then. I did know I needed to change and had decided to use my trip to see her in July as the catalyst for this, unfortunately her mind was made up beforehand and I'll never get to experience that trip with her. 

It is true that when she returns she will be under not all, but many similar pressures and especially when she graduates next year and starts working she will be extremely under pressure, however no matter how hard I tried I couldn't get her to see this. I'm so angry with myself, with the timing, with her, and with the fact she went to study abroad because all this worked against us. I know that if I just got to have my holiday with her, it would have reignited that fun spark in the relationship and changed everything, because since going away she's become all about partying, travel, exploring, fun and I wanted to show her these are the same things I wanted, just couldn't have due to timing and me not doing anything about work soon enough.

I am so afraid now that she will never ever give me another chance with her because she will forever associate me with just being comfortable and not be able to see past that. It's not like things were bad between us - we didnt fight, had great sex, and spent alot of time together, but it just wasn't like we were in the first year of our relationship. 

Despite hating her for what she's done to me, I still want her to realise that I can be that fun, playful, exciting person again, but am so scared she will never give me that chance. 

To top it all off, she got really close to a guy overseas who lives near us, I got really jealous and she hated that I was jealous. The thing that got to me was that they were messaging each other like we had at the start of the relationship, nothing naughty or scandalous, but just playful, fun, joking type messages that you really can only have with someone you spend a lot of time with. She sees this guy every single day, smokes weed with him, drinks with him, parties with him, and this is all stuff I desperately wanted to do with her for such a long time, but we never had the chance except for the first year of our relationship, and now because we're not travelling together and have broken up I won't ever get that chance. She swore on our relationship that she wasn't into him and one of our mutual friends also told me nothing was going on, but it still got to me. 

Will she ever give me that chance to excite her again? I hate that this has happened and I know we were so compatible and I could've been the guy she wanted, and its not even as though she wanted anything in particular - all i ever got was ""I'm too young to be in a serious relationship and I know I don't want to marry you so we have to end it now"". I thought about how I feel and despite also wanting to be young and single once upon a time, I felt like she was the best thing ever and I didn't want to ever lose her, and I guess she didn't feel this because for her the spark was lost. 

help :( I'm crushed because it's like things between us were meant to be - but because of circumstance they weren't. 

tl;dr: 3 year girlfriend broke up with me because she wanted to be young and single, I realised my depression caused by my job and constant complaining probably had a lot to do with it. Will she ever see me in a different light?

I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

32w69j,1,2015-04-17,"Graduating, Starting Job, looking for insights on my projected finances!",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/32w69j/graduating_starting_job_looking_for_insights_on/,"Hey guys, so I am graduating in one month with a Computer Engineering Degree. I've accepted a position as a Software Developer at a large company in the Midwest starting out at $59k with great benefits (401k contribution + match up to limit, health and dental, HSA, bonus, etc.) and automatic 3% raise every three months for at LEAST the first year I'm there. I did four internships with the same team over the past 3 years that I will now be full time with. Basically I'm just looking for your guys opinions on what I'm projecting my finances will look like once I start, and any criticisms, opinions, insights, etc. 

I decided to live downtown so that I can walk or take public transit to work for free, giving me a commute of 10 minutes instead of 1-2 hours each way. The downside is... higher rent, but I tell myself I won't have to pay nearly as much for gas to commute and saving 2+ hours a day commuting is very much worth it to me. On internships I was given housing, once I lived ~18 miles away and the commute was ~1.5-2hrs each way, once I lived ~9miles away and the commute was ~1hr each way, lastly I lived downtown and it was fantastic which is why I decided upon living downtown. I looked around and found a fantastic building nearby to where I work that is not too outrageous price-wise ($1140/month) and am moving in just after graduation.  

So here's a breakdown of what I'm projecting my finances will be:

**Income (Net/Gross Estimate)-**

* $4916/month (June-July-August) = $3680/month gross estimate?

* $5064/month (Sept-Oct-Nov) = $3800/month gross estimate?

* $5216/month (Dec-2016-Jan-Feb) = $3900/month gross estimate?

* $5372/month (March-Apr-May) = $4030/month gross estimate?

* $5533/month (June+??) = $4150/month gross estimate?  

**Expenses-**

* Rent: $1140/month

* Parking: $120/month

* Utilities: ~$120/month (estimate based off similar tenant in the same building)

* Internet: Either $40 or $70/month (FIBER!! Coming to my building soon?)

* Loans: $500/month (Planned to pay off in 3 years at this rate)

* Car Insurance: $100/month

* Food: ~$100-$150/month

* Gas: ~$50/month

* Misc (entertainment+clothes+random bs): $400/month?? (I need to be better about spending so much on bs, yep I know.) 

**Conclusion:**  
In: $3680  
Out: ~$2650  
Left: $1030

I also have about $7000 saved up that I'm planning to use for my rent/expenses I have to pay before I actually get a paycheck and to purchase some furniture for my apartment. Estimating that I will be down to about $3000-$3500 before I start getting paid. 

1. So one thing I realized is that I was estimating my gross income based off of how I was taxed when I was an intern ($4000 net / $3000 gross, no benefits.) So how far off of what I'll actually see am I? What role do benefits play in affecting that? 
2. How do I split up my ""left-over"" money? I want to start taking advantage of that 401k match, but I've lurked here for a bit to know I need to start building my emergency saving as well. 50/50? 
3. How do I prioritize increased earnings from first-year raises?
4. What other things am I missing, not thinking about, should be considering? 

Appreciate anyone taking the time to read through this, I think part of me is nervous about having to be responsible for EVERYTHING for the first time in my life and looking for guidance to make sure I plan well and start out with good financial habits. "
32w6rl,1,2015-04-17,Just a stream of consciousness journal entry about what's missing.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/32w6rl/just_a_stream_of_consciousness_journal_entry/,"TL:DR - Guy talks about guilt, earning happiness, then devolves into a lament on loneliness.

Today is April 17, 2015.  In less than a month, I’ll have graduated from college with a degree in engineering.  I have a great job to look forward to, with a good income in a nice area.  My immediate family is healthy, we’re (relatively) financially well off, I have zero enemies, most people I meet say I’m a thoughtful and caring guy, and I can cook well enough when given a recipe.


So why do I feel so discontent?


I’m constantly thinking of what I’m missing from my life.  Sure all that other stuff is good, but what *don’t* I have yet?  No car, no apartment, no girlfriend, no legacy.  Obese (230lb, 6’1”), lazy, and (soon) friendless.


What is it about me that prohibits me from enjoying what I have, and instead constantly makes me think about my shortcomings and failures?  I almost think it’s a carry-over from my childhood.  My dad was (is?) somewhat hard to please.  His motto was always “failure is not an option,” and he’d accept nothing less than your best effort in everything, whether it be school or sports or chores.  Our family has a legacy, and he’ll be damned if we were going to fall short of it.


But now I’ve pretty much found success, and I still find myself yearning for more.  Despite the good things in my life, I have this constant need to make things perfect.  To save as much money as possible, to make the most responsible purchases, to work out and be as physically fit as I can.


And even as I write this, I feel the need to qualify everything I write.  Saving money isn’t a bad thing, and being responsible in spending is commendable, and physical fitness is a necessity.  I live with a constant guilt that if I take time for fun, or spend a night at home watching TV, or go a day without moving, my entire world will come crumbling down.  I feel a guilt that says “you’ve failed today, as expected, and you absolutely must work on that.”


I don’t actually deserve happiness until I achieve the perfect life.


I don’t deserve to eat at a nice restaurant until I retire.  I don’t deserve to spend $200 at a show or concert.  And I certainly don’t deserve to be loved, to fall in love, to feel any kind of physical intimacy or sexual attraction from a living breathing female until I weigh less than two-hundred pounds.


I spent the last four years of college trying to improve academically, and to build a network (because the network is everything) and to find an internship and a job and  assume a leadership role, and now I’m leaving it all behind.  I may have mastered the art of being a student, the science of the resume, the subtle skill required to have a position of power and responsibility, but I still feel like I’m disappointing everyone I love when I go to a bar.  Any time spent having fun while there is something due for a class is time spent pretending to not care, all the while feeling disapproving glares from my parents and brothers.


I envision my life as a series of focuses, each having to be mastered to rightfully attain some mythical notion of happiness that is free from guilt.  Once I find an apartment, I can find a car.  Once I find a car, I can organize my finances.  Once I organize my finances and start investing, I can establish myself at my job.  And the whole time I can work on a hobby (cooking?), watch what I eat, exercise, lift weights, dress better, and eventually find an equally mythical girl who enjoys my personality, appearance, lifestyle, career choice, religious and political views, and whom I like in return.  Then we date for a few years, get married, have kids, buy a house, continue working until we retire (never having too much fun that whole time, heaven forbid we spend money that we could be saving) and struggle through the last couple decades of our lives until we die of some unavoidable disease or condition.


And yet even still I’m convinced that if I continue making similar financial moves as I have been and lose 60 pounds, I’ll be allowed to flirt and express attraction towards someone.


Is this just how life is?  Do my friends feel this same thing, this ever-present burden of aspiring to perfection in every part of life?  This guilt at not having yet achieved it?


All of my close friends have significant others.  Just this weekend, my one roommate had his girlfriend over (laying in bed, but not getting too physical since we all share a bedroom) while the other had the girl he’s been flirting with over to watch TV.  Two of my close female friends were spending time with their hook-up-partners/pre-relationship-guys, both of whom are also friends.  My friend from back home has her boyfriend, my friend from church has his girlfriend, and my friend in my major has his girlfriend.  Yet there I was, trying to enjoy my Sunday, all the while knowing that I didn’t have anyone in the world who was, at that moment, wondering how I was or what I was doing (except my mom, but you get the point).


I’ve never known what its like to be considered attractive.  I’ve never held a girl’s hand as I walked down the street, never laughed over a shared ice cream, never danced close, gazing into each other’s eyes and enjoy the moment.


The logical part of me says that’s not reality.  The logical part of me says that a relationship is work, far less fun than I imagine, and even downright annoying at times.  At least that’s what *all* of my friends say.


But they know what all that is like.  They know what it’s like to fall asleep with the girl you love.  They know the fun of flirting at a party, of that first kiss, of staying up into the wee hours of the morning just talking, never wanting the sun to rise.  They all say “it’s really not that great.”  Alright, but let me decide for myself.


And I know I can’t blame anyone but myself for any of this, because I shouldn’t have such high standards from someone who looks or weighs what I do.  That I shouldn’t expect much if I’m not outgoing at a bar or willing to approach a girl out of the blue and ask her out.  But admittedly, neither do they!  My friends don’t know how to do a cold approach, they just found girls they were already spending a lot of time with as friends and escalated things.  And I know I’m probably just not direct, and it’s all my fault, and I should be more aggressive, but what am I supposed to do?  Go up to a girl who I’ve seen absolutely no indication of attraction from and ask if she wants to grab dinner?


I don't have any illusions about ""nice guys"" or ""friend zones"" or any of that.  It might be a confidence issue, stemming from the guilt I feel.  It might actually be that I’m just unattractive until I lose weight.  It might be that I’m not as aggressive as I think I am, or that I really don’t understand the signals girls give or the signals I give them.  All I know is I want to experience that budding romance, that first kiss and the late night conversations.  I want to go to bed thinking of someone who is also thinking of me.  I want there to be someone who is willing to change their plans if it means spending time with me, and someone who wants nothing more than to just be with me.


But I don’t know that.  I don’t deserve to know that.  Not until I find an apartment, a car, develop a hobby, invest properly, lose weight, get fit, dress better, and find a new group of friends.


I don’t deserve happiness."
32w7nr,13,2015-04-17,What's up with conflicting viewpoints on the CS job prospects?,Pharmakoza,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/32w7nr/whats_up_with_conflicting_viewpoints_on_the_cs/,"I've asked a question like this over a year ago, attempting to get a pulse on what career prospects will look like down the line, but I've been hearing things that are making me even more confused.

Here are a handful of opinions, situations, and anecdotes I've encountered on reddit and in real life. Paraphrased from memory:

- ""My company is having troubles filling positions. Nobody wants to go into CS anymore.""

- Lockheed Martin has trouble finding qualified personnel.

- Some people say there is a shortage of CS workers. Others say this is a myth propagated by the man to keep wages low.

- Web dev jobs seem to pay shit. I've seen ads for web dev positions ranging from minimum wage to 20 dollars. I've never done web dev so I don't know how easy/hard it is.

- Some people on this subreddit are having extreme trouble finding a CS-related job in spite of having a degree. Granted, this can probably be chalked down to selection bias.

- The US is importing foreign CS talent and this will damage home grown talent.

- Foreign competition is getting pretty stiff all around, and this will damage American CS workers.

- Recently, I delved into a search for internships and I found that most of the CS-related ones paid double or more than paid internships in other fields.

- If you want to go into computer vision and have the skills for the job, there is high demand for this area.

- Employers prefer younger devs to older devs. As you get older, you become less employable in CS-related fields.

That's all I can think of for now.

Bottom line: I want to plan for the future, but I'm getting mixed signals about the current climate for CS workers. It seems like everyone has their own set of strange beliefs that are based off nothing. I'm inclined to chalk down most of the opinions I encounter as voodooism if they are not based on hard facts, but I nevertheless find them unsettling. 

Is the future bright for CS grads?"

I've gotten a number of phone screenings/interviews and a few on-site interviews but have never gotten to the point of the technical interview... The last interview I had was really humiliating because as I was about to leave, I heard them talking and making fun of me.

I feel like what I have on my resume isn't really impressing them at all. I have my school projects but I feel like they're not impressive. They're pretty much puzzle solving programs, one puzzle with GUI, a program that just sends/receives a file, nothing really big. Not only that, I'm having an incredibly hard time on the behavioral interview. Especially when they bring up my GPA. One question in particular is that I have a tough time answering why I have a low GPA. I actually asked a friend afterwards if telling them that I did poor in the theoretical stuff and that I did amazing in the projects was an acceptable answer. He said no, and that I should make some shit up. What's an actual and reasonable answer that I could give?

I've already cut down my gaming time, so I asked some friends for advice. A friend has recommended me to learn Python, make some things, and fix up my resume first. Another friend recommended I read the first few portions of Cracking the Coding interview about how to dress, talk, and all that jazz in the behavioral interview. I've started that a few days ago but I'm starting to doubt if this is an actual course of action I should take. What are my options at this point so that I can still pursue a career in programming?

http://www.phillyvoice.com/draft-nonprofit-aims-tech-access/

All personal or corporate computer donation will help fuel NTR's programs and increase technology access in low-wealth Philadelphia communities.

Nonprofit Technology Resources’ (NTR) mission is to ensure that all Philadelphians, regardless of income, have access to and the capacity to use information and communications technology. By providing low-cost or no-cost equipment and training, NTR helps our vulnerable neighbors unlock all the economic, academic, and social opportunities that technology can provide. NTR has been providing the people of Philadelphia and the organizations that serve them with accessible and affordable technology since 1974.

NTR accepts donated computers from organizations and individuals, which are then refurbished in our Brandywine Street ‘factory’. Everyday, 10 to 20 participants in the city’s welfare-to-work programs, interns from the city’s technical training schools, and conventional volunteers, come to NTR to learn computer troubleshooting, repair, and refurbishment. The resulting computers fuel NTR’s other programs, which distributes them back to the community through several channels.

NTR sells some of these computers for as low as $75 to all of Philadelphia in their Computer Thrift Store.

Several of NTR’s programs provide no-cost computers and training to low-wealth individuals through partnerships with schools, service agencies, faith-based organizations, and after-school programs. Almost 4000 vulnerable youth, elders, and disabled people have utilized these donor-supported programs through collaborations with over 800 partner agencies since 1999.

Machines that cannot be refurbished are stripped for usable parts and recycled through our partnership with a local, e-Steward, R2 certified partner. These certifications mean that our donors are assured that these toxic materials are disposed of in the most ethical and environmentally sensitive manner, as well as meeting current legal standards. In 2014, NTR diverted over 21 TONS of potentially dangerous material from our regions’ landfills, saving taxpayer dollars and our environment.

I feel as though I am not learning anything.,Bilalin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/32xllk/advice_for_an_international_student_i_feel_as/,"I am an international student here in the YS. I'm currently attending community college and then I will transfer to a real college after 2 years of study. I am taking some programming classes and I really feel like I'm not learning anything. So far I have taken, Java I &amp;amp; II, SQL, database management and some other prerequisite classes like calculus, college composition etc. My problem is that I am not learning anything at all. The teacher does all the work on the board and does a terrible job explaining what she is doing. The entire class is just mindlessly copying everything down and nobody is really being challenged. Everybody gets an A.


I know this problem will be fixed if I go to a better school with a better computer science program. I was thinking of attending Missouri Science and Technology, which seems to be a great school in the industry. The only problem is that I will be paying about $40,000 a year if I go there and I know they have great recruiting opportunities there so I can possibly get a good internship to help pay some of it off before I get into the field. Also I should probably mention that I am in process of getting a green card, my priority date is in about 2 years if all goes well. Should I take the plunge and pay ~$40,000 a year for the next few years until I get immigration, or ride out community college for another year before I transfer? 


Side question: is it possible for me to get a full time job in Canada (where I have residency) before I finish school if I were to transfer to MST? "

My plan was to develope an app for iOS and andriod. A light weight one that would just be displaying tier lists for a game, and running a small add banner. 

As someone with knowledge of only up to: oop, pointers, sorting and searching, pointers, inheritence polymorphism, small data structures (stacks, queues,  trees, arrays, vectors) and basic IO files. Who is familier with c++, c#, java and python.

Go about learning how to do this?

I know next to nothing about any web coding, server/non local development, or mobile development.

I would probobly be able to follow a basic guide to make a simple application. But things such as, when I change the tier list weekly, i would have no idea how to make it so I update the list on my end somewhere and it changes the list they see that week in the app. 

Even things such as how apps handle different screen sizes, or implementing a small add banner are things I dont have the slightest clue about.

32xsfn,1,2015-04-17,"Offered a position, how to negotiate for my first job?",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/32xsfn/offered_a_position_how_to_negotiate_for_my_first/,"Hi all,

Very happy to say that I've been offered a job about a month and a half shy from graduating. I'm excited about the position, but want to ensure that I can properly negotiate some key aspects.

The short story is that I'm in the animation and art industry and have two previous internships under my belt, both related to my career path. I cold called a small studio in NYC and they interviewed me and offered me an internship with strong/likely possibility to go full-time after two months. Here are a few things I'm wondering:

1. How do I make sure I don't get strung along and dropped from a full-time position, aside from doing good work? The interviewer really liked my work, but said that because they are a smaller studio, they usually have new people intern or freelance for a time before they get hired full-time. I have talked to a few other people at my school and apparently that is a common process among boutique studios. 

2. How do I approach pay? As an intern, I was paid $10/hr at my last job. However, NYC is a lot more expensive than the city I was in and I'd like to receive at least $15/hr. I also want to make sure I get a full 40 hour work week (I was full time at my last internship but part time at my first). I don't think I can afford the city on part-time pay. Figures have not been discussed yet. What's the best way to politely bring that up?

3. If I get hired on full-time, how do I negotiate for a higher salary? As full-time my professors advised me that $25/hr is a good amount for someone starting out in animation. I guess it would be like getting a promotion to go from intern to full-time.

4. Can I ask for assistance in moving up to NYC as an intern? I live in the south currently. 

I think those are my main concerns. And if any of you folks have advice for someone moving to NY, please have at it. Thanks in advance!"

Q. What's the difference between greeting a queen and greeting Bill Clinton?
A. You only have to get on one knee to greet the queen.

Bill and Hillary are now married 40 years. When they first got married, Bill said, ""I am putting a box under the bed. You must promise never to look in it."" In all their 40 years of marriage, Hillary never looked. However, on the afternoon of their 40th anniversary, curiosity got the best of her, and she lifted the lid and peeked inside. In the box were 3 empty beer cans and $1,874.25 in cash. She closed the box and put it back under the bed. Now that she knew what was in the box, she was doubly curious as to why.
That evening they were out for a special dinner. After dinner Hillary could no longer contain her curiosity and she confessed and said ""I am so sorry. For all these years I kept my promise and never looked into the box under our bed. However, today the temptation was too much, and I gave in. But now I need to know why do you keep the empty cans in the box?""
Bill thought for a while and said, ""I guess after all these years you deserve to know the truth. Whenever I was unfaithful to you I put an empty beer can in the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again.""
Hillary was shocked, but said, ""I am very disappointed and saddened, but I guess after all those years away from home on the road, temptation does happen and I guess that a few times is not that bad considering the years.""
They hugged and made their peace. A little while later Hillary asked Bill, ""Why do you have all that money in the box?""
Bill answered, ""Whenever the box filled with empty cans, I cashed them in.""

Q. How will history remember Bill Clinton?
A. The President after Bush.

While undressing for bed one night, good ole Bill notices something like a red rash around his you know what. Alarmed, he thinks, ""I can't let Hillary see this!""
He makes an appointment to see his doctor at Bethesda Naval Hospital, the very next day.
""Doc,"" he says, ""I've got this red ring around my, you know. What is it and how do I get rid of it?""
The doctor says, ""Well, I'm not exactly sure what it is, but take these pills for a week, and see if that takes care of it. If not, come back and we'll try something else.""
Bill takes the pills for a week but unfortunately, the red ring is still there after 7 days. He goes back to the doctor and tells him the pills didn't help. So the doctor prescribes another medication, capsules this time, and gives him the same instructions. Take them for a week, and come back if it's not improved.
He takes the capsules for a week, and damn, the red ring is still there! So he goes back to the doctor and asks,
""What next?""
The doctor gives him a cream in a tube this time.
""Rub this on every day for a week and let me know.""
Bill goes back in a week and says,
""Great news Doc! The rash is gone! That stuff in the tube was wonderful! What was it?""
The doctor replied, ""Lipstick remover.""

Q. Why does Bill Clinton wear underwear?
A. To keep his ankles warm.

Two new young interns are hired in the White House. They are walking down the hall when President Clinton sees them. The President walks up and says, ""Gee, I've never come across your faces before.""

Clinton replies, ""Yes, I'd like a quickie.""

She walks away.
Gore leans over to Clinton and says, ""Bill, it's pronounced 'Quiche.'""

Q. What's the difference between Bill Clinton and government bonds?
A. Government bonds will mature someday.

Don King was thinking about promoting a fight between Mike Tyson and Monica Lewinsky, but he called it off when Bill Clinton told him that Monica doesn't bite.

Q. What's the difference between Bill Clinton and a scuba diver's wet suit?
A. The wet suit's hard to get off.

Monica walks into her dry cleaning store and tells the guy, ""I've got another dress for you to clean.""
Slightly hard of hearing, the clerk replies, ""Come again?""
""No,"" says Monica. ""Mustard.""

Q. Why is Hillary standing by her man?
A. So she doesn't get her dress soiled.

While the Clintons were still in the Governor's Mansion in Arkansas, one night Chelsea came in to the bedroom and said, ""Mommy, tell me a story please!"" Hillary said, ""It's 3:00 am, honey, can't you just go to bed?"" Chelsea answered, ""I tried, Mommy, but I can't sleep... please tell me a story.""

Bill Clinton steps out onto the White House lawn in the dead of winter. Right in front of him, on the White House lawn, he sees ""The President Must Go"" written in urine across the snow. Well, old Bill is pretty ticked off.
He storms into his security staff`s HQ, and yells ""Somebody wrote a threat in the snow on the front damn lawn! And they wrote it in urine! Son-of-a-bitch had to be standing right on the porch when he did it! Where were you guys?!"" The security guys stay silent and stare ashamedly at the floor. Bill hollers ""Well dammit, don`t just sit there! Get out and FIND OUT WHO DID IT! I want an answer, and I want it TONIGHT!"" The entire staff immediately jumps up and races for the exits.
Later that evening, his chief security officer approaches him and says ""Well Mr. President, we have some bad news and we have some really bad news. Which do you want first?""
Clinton says ""Oh hell, give me the bad news first.""
The officer says ""Well, we took a sample of the urine and tested it. The results just came back, and it was Al Gore`s urine.""

32ylzn,1,2015-04-17,So you want to work at Riot Games ? [VERY LONG TEXT],[deleted],leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/32ylzn/so_you_want_to_work_at_riot_games_very_long_text/,"&gt; Posted by Riot employee - RiotVert

My name is Jon Pan. I’m a Product Manager at Riot Games who started full-time in November 2013. I was also a graduate intern at Riot from May to July 2013. Since I’m leading the Internship Program this year (the circle of life), I have been very heavily involved in all aspects of recruiting. I feel that most people who interview at Riot understand the pros of working here, yet very few understand the cons of working here.
That is why I’m here today – to shed some light on the hard realities of working at Riot Games, as well as to talk about my positive experiences through situations I’ve encountered. Why do I want potential candidates to know about the hard realities? Because I don’t want people to end up working here and hate it once the honeymoon period is over if they only know the good stuff, of which there is a lot and significantly exceeds the negatives.
I looked through the only source on the internet that offered some reviews of working at Riot Games and it is at Glassdoor, but often the reviews are short. I want to try to offer something more comprehensive here.
I didn’t ask for permission to write this, I didn’t clear this through our awesomely-named communications team (The Ministry of Culture and Propaganda), and that leads to one of the pros of working at Riot. Every individual that goes through “Red Name” training is empowered to communicate to our players. On the other hand, I’m also personally and solely responsible if this post goes terribly wrong (I hope not =P). Finally, the most important disclaimer is that this is purely based on my experiences and perceptions. Other Rioters’ experiences could be different.
Getting a project or initiative done at Riot is pretty damn hard, but satisfying. Rioters are generally a passionate bunch and we’ve got a weird culture where there are tons of alphas who are willing to collaborate a lot. Sometimes, we over collaborate and nothing gets done. Eventually, someone has to step in, get to the lowest common denominator, and get the ball rolling.
Also, most things we do may have tremendous impact on other teams. I’ll give you a non-League of Legends product example. Last December, my team decided that we would commit to responding to all intern candidates by a certain date (2/15/14) to let them know if they are moving on or not. We did this to improve candidate experience. We were thinking, two whole months! Of course the other teams will get this done! This didn’t get done, and on 2/16/14 we started seeing social media blow up with comments like hey I didn’t get an answer, etc. That was a Sunday and I was already exhausted from answering something like 500+ questions on LinkedIn during the application period. But here comes another reality of working at Riot – if you own an initiative, you own the messaging. I never see Tryndamere pass the buck on some hard questions to someone else, he owns it. So I sure as hell wasn’t going to pass the buck to the teams who failed to respond on time.
Then it gets worse. A Rioter accidentally invited 25 Data Science interns for an interview, just to reject them 10 minutes later. And instead of LinkedIn, which I was monitoring, it went on the NA forums and Zileas finds out and alerts me. 2/17/14 was Presidents’ Day and now I have 25 people involved including the head of recruiting, game design, communications, and the data science team. We ultimately offered a feedback session to those interns who were sent interview requests by mistake…which added 30 mins x 25, which is 12.5 hours of extra work to the head of Data Science. How does that impact other teams? No idea, but it just did. But throughout all of this, nobody ever said who the fuck did this? Fire this guy. Everyone was genuinely distraught over causing these 25 candidates, who are also our players, pain and wanted to solve this problem immediately.
So what does that mean for a candidate? You need to be able to create a venue in which Rioters can share their thoughts and you are responsible for finding consensus and driving action. Not everyone is comfortable breaking a stalemate and you have to be comfortable doing that in order to drive action. Also, you have to be cognizant of the potential downstream impact of your decisions. Some are unpredictable, but just understand that Riot Games as a company is very complex and intertwined.
You need to have a presence to succeed at Riot. This may be controversial, but I think if you are unable or unwilling to stand out, look energetic, and get your thoughts across in a concise way, it is hard to be heard at Riot. Does that mean everyone needs to be an “alpha male” to be heard? No, then it would just be a shouting match. This is hard to describe, but I’ll give you some examples.
Everyone knows some version of the story of the small, elderly teacher who can keep her classroom in control and then one day, a substitute teacher comes, let’s say a tall, strong-looking male who has never been a teacher in his life, and he can’t control the class at all, especially if he shouts. This isn’t about physical appearance; it’s about the respect one can command through their demeanor.
Same thing happened when I was in the military; there was a lot of discussion among us junior officers on how to exhibit a “command presence.” It’s not acting, it comes from within. And some people just don’t have it.
So what does that mean for a candidate? I rarely, if ever, meet a wallflower at Riot. I love getting my ideas challenged by Rioters who started yesterday or three years ago. People hit the ground running here, and part of that is having a strong presence and having self-confidence.
Riot becomes your life. Since I started full-time, there have only been a few weekends that I haven’t worked (think usually 1-4 hours, not 8 hours). I’m actually having an argument with a senior Rioter about a strongly-worded email I sent last night as I type this. Am I pissed off? No. I have faith that we both want the best for the company and we are having a constructive argument. But because we work on the weekends, we end up communicating primarily through email during the weekends and you know how tone/perception changes with email.
And I know a lot of other Rioters who work on weekends. Why? I think it’s because the people who join Riot are generally so fracking passionate about Riot, they can’t turn it off. Personally, I turned down a 9-5 job which paid 25% more to be here. Why? Well, because that was a “job.” Riot has a mission that I believe in: to be the most player-focused game company in the world. This isn’t some crap that’s printed in some brochure that we keep in our drawers. I don’t even have a drawer…this shit is for real. This is like me saluting the American flag duringreveille every morning when I was in the Army. FEELS.
So what does that mean for a candidate? Sometimes (edging towards often), I see or hear about frayed relationships and that’s on you to get straight. It’s on you to figure out work/life balance. Riot doesn’t force anything on you. I have never been pressured to work more. I just end up wanting to work more. Fucking brilliant Ryze/Tryndamere.
You have to figure out how to turn off. If you don’t, you end up buying a ton of Frozen merchandise and secretly stashing it away because you know Titanfall (“researching” games is part of work) is about to launch on Tuesday night and DAMN you forgot to pre-load that shit (50GB..really?) on your home computer. You want to call your wife and ask her to do it? Don’t be crazy.
So at 8:00pm you drive home real to eat dinner real fast, give your kid Sven to make yourself feel better, then drive back to the office so you can play Titanfall with other Rioters because I sure as hell pre-loaded on my work laptop. Then you get matched with the beta dudes who are level 16…
This is a good segue into why you should probably be a core gamer if you work at Riot. The gamer culture is for real here. My boss, who is probably 15 years older than me, is more of a hardcore gamer than me…WTF? That night I was playing Titanfall, he was playing ARAM until 1AM and I told him that I’ll see him in the morning for the 9AM meeting that we are both in (he didn’t make it).
And back to the strongly-worded email – you better be able to do the right thing rather than the “nice” thing. It obviously feels better to be liked and the “nice guy,” but I’d like to think that at Riot, people have thick skins.
In conclusion, it has been both intellectually and emotionally rewarding and exhausting to work at Riot, but I have loved every minute of it. And if I scared off even one person, good. I want you to manifest your true human potential at the right company. I’ve only offered a glimpse, my glimpse, of my perception and experiences at Riot Games. Treat this as one anecdote, find more stories, do more research. I look forward to working with some of you in the future :)

32ymkb,3,2015-04-17,"Didn't get a consulting role this summer, how do I leverage my backup?",[deleted],consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/32ymkb/didnt_get_a_consulting_role_this_summer_how_do_i/,"Hi all,

**Little background on me**: 3rd year accounting/finance major. I have just changed my direction this year and have gotten extremely interested in the consulting field. Been using a lot of resources on this subreddit as they have been extremely helpful! 

**My predicament:** Being an accounting/finance student I am a little disadvantaged when it comes to landing a gig in consulting, however from what I have read opportunities exist for all majors. I've done what I could, got involved on campus, attended a few competitions and eventually landed internship interviews for Deloitte as a BTA and AccentureStrategy. Didn't make it through unfortunately, however I still have a year left of school and am doing what I can to build my value proposition. 

**My question:** I've accepted a financial role with one of the big oil&amp;gas companies this summer, and I was wondering how I could leverage this internship to best position my experience for full-time consulting?


I appreciate any advice/direction I can get. :)


Thanks again!

32yo0f,88,2015-04-17,"""I am 15 and you should all envy me""",CSHO,copypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/32yo0f/i_am_15_and_you_should_all_envy_me/,"Found this on a forum.
-----------------------------
Who Am I?
Well, it is all on my profile but I'll restate it here. I am a fifteen year old student living in San Jose, California. I am decently smart and do competition math and computer science. I enjoy Ultimate, running, breakdance, and being in the outdoors. I am currently delving deeper into some more advanced algorithms and expanding my computer science knowledge. I attend hackathons and do some Android development, specifically in the rooting sector.

What Are My Credentials?
Many of you may already be looking down on me with scorn. ""This guy is only 15 years old! Who the hell does he think he is, trying to preach to us as if he was some elite god?""
Well, it is true I am quite young. However, I am fortunate enough to live in what is probably the best place for students in the whole world: Silicon Valley. Yup, that magical place in California where Apple, Facebook, and Google were founded and all those amazing new technologies are invented. Here, new companies are created every single day. (In fact, that may not be an exaggeration) The people and environment around me is amazing. For example, students and people I know are setting up TedX at their respective schools, inviting a friend that happens to be a Tesla co-founder to give a talk (This is a student and a great friend of mine), attending hackathons every month where students are encouraged to 'hack' and create new and innovative projects(and prizes are handed out, as well as scholarships and other free sponsor stuff), and it being strange when we don't have some national finalist in areas such as business, STEM, competition math, engineering, etc. Probably the best public school in all of the USA. The atmosphere, type of parents, teachers, and community we have are simply so dedicated that it is amazing. 4.0 is practically given. The environment here simply churns out successful entrepreneurs, businessmen, and thinkers. So I get to experience all these innovative people, be one of these people who are doing things that grown-ups or college students do, and everything is just so advanced here. Everyone does extra stuff, everyone has amazing background, etc. Repigyou, for example, goes to a school a few minutes away from mine and he quit Minecraft because he got a few bad grades in freshman year, which many might say doesn't matter because colleges don't look at that. Very ignorant mindset. Anyways, this might not have happened in other areas.

In my opinion, this is a sharp contrast to most of you folks. In Mexico, Hong Kong, and other places in America, school is probably all that students have to do. You aren't pushed to do more, a couple of B's and maybe a C is fine. (Keep in mind this is general. In Korea for example I know the education standards are extremely high, due to the format of the College applications process) So I'm saying that many of you guys live in normal, ordinary schools where you aren't pressured to study and if you are it's only to get good grades in school, which is still not easy for some and can delude you into thinking that you're doing something. Perhaps you feel you are involved because you are in some clubs and your parents have encouraged participating in a club sport. Or perhaps you are depresed because Minecraft is taking over your life. Whatever. My point is that unless you are Apple, Plastix, Khazhyk, or somebody who's in a good Ivy college and still apparently plays on Overcast, you will find that I have a stronger background and experiences to be able to talk about this topic of studying, dedication, and life with certainty and conviction.

But it's not all fun and games here. It's very stressful for some people. Sometimes I envy you careless gamers who don't have to worry about life.

Actually, I don't. I'm happy I have this opportunity to live here. You should all envy me.

So What is the Point of this Thread?
Yes, we're getting to that. And as a note, what I say is really only applying to the players who've been on this server for double digit days. The donators, the people in teams, the people that are obsessed. Don't worry about this if you are very active in real life , which I'm sure many of you are. But still read this, hopefully you can learn something.
The people this doesn't apply to are the noobs that get rotated out every month that are used to raise your KD to 1.0. Or the hacker noobs that stack up on the ban list, making the several thousand pages or however many pages there are.

I recently found some depression threads on oc.tc, and I never actually totally realized what type of people were on this server. Now I know that this place is filled with young and immature kids, in addition to the diseased, homeschooled, depressed, and normal kids. For example, people that spend all day on mumble wasting time playing porn for the other immature players to laugh at..(Not pointing fingers at all, please don't be offended, I still respect you. This example just helps to prove my point) Really. I had always thought that I was only playing with kids that even if they were young, were mature and had control over their lives and gaming. But still, there are a couple of specific cases I want to address.

The most basic case. This was me for the past two months or so, and in my guess 50% or so of the really good players on this server: You are a normal or dedicated student, but Minecraft has taken over your life. Your grades are suffering, but you and your parents don't really care. You have stopped playing sports and ditch track practice every day. You play until morning, and finally sleep when you ask yourself exactly what you are accomplishing by ruining your eyes and sleep quality. Finally, you go to sleep and wake up on the same day, eyes burning in the morning and vision foggy. You tell yourself that you will never ocktick again, and finish your homework at school, finishing each classes' homework in the class right before. Sometimes you are unable to. (I always did, as I am BS and clutch master. And got full score. And my grades didn't suffer. But my eyes and self-esteem did.) You come back in the afternoon, find that your mom is not home and clock a couple of hours before dinner. You tell yourself you will work later, but find yourself playing Minecraft again. This vicious cycle repeats over and over. To aid in your slump, you download and tweak some programs so you can hotkey and hide Minecraft from your taskbar and screen. These people know Minecraft is bad for them. But they can't tear themselves away from farming a couple of more monuments on Primed or wrecking noobs on Conquer.

Then the minority case. You are bullied or depressed from real life problems. Perhaps you are antisocial and unable to make real friends. You are immature and get depressed about yourself because your 'crush' is in a 'relationship' with another person. You find yourself disappointed with yourself and the current state of affairs. Perhaps you are diseased. You turn to Minecraft for comfort and friends and to lose yourself and forget all your fears, expectations, and homework. You find that friendships online are easier to maintain. Eventually the only thing you look forward to is Minecraft and it becomes your life.

And these are the problems I would like to address, and hopefully provide some valuable tips, advice, and insight to help anyone that might be in this situation. I want this to be a wake up call for you guys.

Great, So What Can I Do to Help Myself?
Okay, I have a lot of information for you guys. I'm going to try to organize it as best as possible, but please don't be disappointed if it's not so clear. I'll do my best, and please try your hardest to stay with me. I'll provide a brief summary at the end as well.
Step 1: Finding an Interest
The first step in getting out of this slump is to set a goal. Without a goal, you're just a sad looking Magikarp floundering around. If you don't have a goal of becoming a elite Lvl. 100 Magikarp or a sexy Gyrados , you're not going to get anywhere in life. So this first step is finding what interests you. This could be anything, from art to design to computer science to biology to law to business to e-commerce to networking to engineering to fashion design.

A common answer I've gotten from my ocktick buddies to this question is 'gaming'. Now. Guys. Galls, girls, folks, buddies, homies, niggas, besties, strangers. Listen! 'Gaming' is not an answer choice for this question! Games are flipping made to appeal to people. They accomplish absolutely nothing but merely provide enjoyment. Like drugs. I know most of you fantasize about getting rich off a youtube channel, but this is very unrealistic. 99.9999% of you need to stop thinking that this is an interest. Gaming is a time-waster. The only purpose should be to help de-stress, there when you need a break and need to forget about life for a short while. It is not something that is going to turn into a career. So get that mindset out of your heads this instant. And you will have an interest, trust me. The only reason you don't have one right now is because you've been wasting all of your time ockticking! So how do you find an interest?

I encourage you to take some time to just surf the web. If you're interested in technology, go to popular tech websites such as the Verge or similar sites and just read about current technology. Find something that seems cool, or interesting. Anything that strikes out at you as potentially interesting, learn more about it! If you are interested in what rooting does to an Android phone, google it. Try rooting your android.(Actually, don't if you don't know what you're doing) If you think 3D printing is amazing, learn more about it. To find an interest, you really just need to spend time out on the web surfing, researching, becoming interested. I don't know. Bioengineering?

Step Two: The Inevitable
Now that you've found an interest, you need to be able to spend some time learning about it. And that means steering away from Minecraft a bit. I know you're all fearing this, but it must be done. You don't have to quit, but you should definitely cut down on the time you spend gaming. You have to. It's not a suggestion. Go do it. If you're feeling particularly adventurous, uninstall Minecraft and all the related mods, texture packs, recording programs, etc.

I can't tell you how to play a game less. But the main things:

If you've realized that Minecraft has a negative impact on your life, step away from it. Try leaving it for three days. Or restrict yourself to 1 hour a day for a week. See what happens. Enjoy the fact that your head doesn't fall back in class every ten seconds in the morning. Enjoy the fact that your eyes aren't blurry or painful in the morning. There will be so many immediate improvements in physical health, as well as mental health. You will immediately feel more purposeful and energetic. Once you've commited to this, it should be easy because you know it is for your own good, and you see instant results!

For others, however, this step may be difficult. But there are other things that will actually cause you to spend less time playing because you're so busy! I'll discuss those things later.

You need to overcome a certain threshold of understanding for this step. It will be different for everyone. You need to realize that stepping away from Minecraft is a good thing. You might suffer. But you need to push through and simply PLAY LESS. There is no simple way to do this one. Good luck.

Step Three: General Life Tips
This step is not really a step. These tips are just here to improve your life. Read on!

Blue Light Filters!!! Something really important! Blue light filter and reducing screen brightness! So in a nutshell, blue light is really bad for your eyes. The LED stuff. It will ruin your eyes multiple times faster than other light, and sadly this is what is used in AMOLED screens and LCD. Basically all screens such as computers, TV, and phones. LED is simply very bright artifical light. As in, when you look at it late at night, it tires your eyes and disrupts your sleep patterns, as you are only supposed to experience bright light during the day.

Getting a blue light filter such as f.lux brings the screen closer to natural, room light. This is so much better than killing your eyes with LED 24/7. Ideally, the computer screen is barely brighter than room brightness, to minimize strain on your eyes. Actually, the most ideal would be less bright than room, but that is not realistic.

Also, never use screens in the dark. Anything in the dark is too bright because there is no room brightness to counter it, so your eyes are basically getting wrecked no matter how low you put the brightness.

The colors are more yellow-reddish and more washed out, but you get used to it. Currently, when I disable blue light filter I can really tell a huge difference and too much blue light is extremely uncomfortable, as my eyes are not accustomed to such unhealthy screens now. Minecraft without the filter seems way too bright and over-emphasized, and it strains my eyes. Which is not me having weak eyes, it's my eyes not being used to such lethal screens. Which is good. Trust me and try using the filter for a week straight without turning it off. You will see improvements in sleep and eye condition.

Get some Good Music! Okay, you can group music into several groups. I'm not going to pretend I'm a music expert but hopefully I can suggest some good producers at the very least. The music I have is some party music, because everyone's got to have that when you're with groups, electronic music, and inspirational music.

You listen to hardcore, dubstep electronic music when you game or work out. Like Monstercat if you're weird like dukman or biixerv. Nightcore and some Tobu if you're me. It turns you on and your body just enters a high-activity state. Or rap music is fine for these purposes as well, which I prefer.

You listen to inspirational music when you need inspiration. This is like people singing... Simple electronic can't really touch chords such as words do with humans. Some mainstream inspirational music I have is We Are the Champions (Queen) and You Raise Me Up (Martin). I was listening to one when I finally decided I would write this for my ocktick buddies.

I also have peaceful electro music such as Kygo, which is for when I am doing homework or taking a break. Calms you down. Check him out, he's an amazing producer. I've bolded his name for a reason.

And I have Buddhist mantras for when I'm feeling overly religious and need that dose of mindfulness and insight. For any of you atheists out there, I reccomend Buddhism. I could probably write a whole 'nother page on how Christianity has ruined Koreans in my community and Buddhism actually is proved in real life and is not a flipping worship of Buddha. Buddha was the first person to achieve enlightenment, a state of true insight. You have probably all experienced flashes of it, like when you unclouded the mystery behind something,(solved that elegant math problem, finally realized WHY something happened) you felt that ephemeral, raw beauty. Enlightenment is not some bullshit state of godly being, it is just pretty much constantly having that feeling. And we are followers, and he merely offers us guidance. We are not worshipping him like Christians worship God as the creator of this earth. And you know when you're all like thanking God for trivial stuff.. And then you look over at Africa and really that's 'God's doing' as well... Some God. Anyways. Don't want to get controversial here. Skype me for more. Check out the book ""Outliers"" by Malcolm Gladwell for a good read and good content. It has a lot of mind-blowing and thoughtful content. Anyways. Back to the main topic.

Exercise! Exercise can have different purposes, but this is a vital aspect in ensuring that you are a well rounded Homo sapiens. Just like music, exercise touches off important chords in humans. And if you don't like sports, that's simply because you haven't explored enough. And if you're weak, even more reason for you to get out and do some sports. Even if you're fat or a twig. I really cannot emphasize how important sports and physical activity are for the human.

Some not-so-considered sports that you might not have considered?

Badminton. This is not sissy tennis, boys. It is definitely easier to play than tennis but still has the same dedication and skill required at higher levels. Fun and entertaining for both gender and all ages.

Ultimate frisbee. This is not a sissy sport, kids. This is more tiring than tennis, volleyball, basketball, or any other 'legit' sport you play. You're constantly cutting to get open, or staying on the right side of your man. It encourages co-ed playing, and has a lot of strategy involved. Definitely more strategy than sports like soccer or tennis, which I've both played at a competitive club level. If you think it is a toss-and-go, easy-money game, learn about Horizontal Stack, Zone, handler movements, dead disc plays and come back. But it is very easy to pick up, as all you need to do is be able to run and throw. And all you need is a disc and some open space! Very entertaining, and google AUDL matches if you're interested.

Working out. This improves confidence, makes you stronger, and is just helpful to your health and well-being. I have started doing this recently, and contrary to popular misconceptions, you don't need to go to a gym or be a buff guy to do it. You get buff from doing it, not you do it because you're buff. This is most realistic for anybody from a twig up to a bit overweight person. All you need is bars and motivation. Also if you're young, lifting weights is actually bad. Stops bone growth by crushing your growing muscles. Calisthenics, or bar workouts, is what I'm recommending, and you can still get insanely buff... Check out the Bar Brothers. Anyways, Someone I know was 98 pounds at 16 years and put on 20 in a month. 20 more in the next two with simply bars and eggs, nothing else. I'm no expert, but you need to work till you physically can't do another set. And buff up on protein such as milk, eggs, meat, etc to fill up the muscle tears you get from working out. Do a lot of dips and pull ups if you want big arms. ;) And work out every two days, for usually half an hour or until you're muscles have enlarged to twice their size and you can't control them very well. It's not a big time commitment at all. Here's a link to an inspirational Quora article for y'all about this guy that bounced back from gaming and disease to become an amazing person: Click on this link for an inspirational article!&gt;

You Can't Make Good Food out of Bad Ingredients Stop eating junk food. Often times I hear people say they will go out for Jamba Juice or something before their workout. When I ask why, they reply that they'll burn it off anyways. Now that's just stupid. Health does not consist of two variables, fat level and work level. Unhealthy is not the same as fat. You need to understand that even if you don't see immediate negative results, junk food is bad for you.

I don't know to what extent this may seem weird to you, but if my friends offer me chips or a cookie, I always decline. If I'm offered food by my mom at around 3, I usually refuse. You folks need to understand the benefit of good eating habits. They are vital to your health, wellbeing, and happiness. Have you ever seen girls who drink Boba every day as they go into high school? Or try too hard to impress? Their aura, their faces, suffer. They just have a more negative, less natural, less attractive face.

Food is what your body uses to build itself.
If you give yourself bad food you will become a 'bad' person. Just eat healthy, eat greens always. And get a lot of protein. Have a balanced diet, and eat good food. But you don't have to deprive yourself of sweets. I enjoy eating cereal and blueberry pie and baked treats every now and then, which in my opinion taste much better than the artificial junk most eat nowadays. I don't eat any junk food, because I actually think it tastes bad. And I'd like to propose to you what's known as intermittent fasting. In a nutshell, if we eat when our tank is full, the excess becomes fat. Simple. So you group your food intake . You eat 3 big meals a day, giving your body time to use all the energy. For adults, you usually take a break from a meal about three times a week. This is a very effective and healthy way to burn fat, as you're not starving yourself or using pills, and just burning fat naturally. If you're really interested, google it. Just know that how you eat is just as important as what you eat. Don't always be stuffing yourself with small snacks throughout the day to keep up your metabolism, because that's ignorant BS that will just keep your excess energy spilling over into fat. Eat balanced, and keep to 3 meals a day. If you're going to eat some unhealthy food, eat that soon after the meal, to keep your meals grouped.
Now, the meat of this article: The Inspiration
Now that you've found an interest, and successfully stepped away from Minecraft a bit, you need to be inspired to study...

Let me tell you guys something. In life there are geniuses, and normal people. Geniuses are mutants. Their IQ is over 155, their brains are wired differently. They'll work out everything in their heads and spit out an answer that normal people can not comprehend. Geniuses can visualize multi variable calculus, and visibly see the changes that occur when you add in another equation. Socrates is a good example. In debates, in his head he would predict what the response would be to his answer, and then the next, and the next, and so arrive at the final conclusion before it occurred. Try googling it if you're interested.

Now, everything comes easily to geniuses. They can skim through a book and understand 80 percent. Then they have to try for the rest of the 20. Normal people understand 5 percent, and then they have to try for the rest of the 95. It's not fair, but life is not fair.

But many geniuses are homeless drug addicts. Since everything comes so easily they never work or do anything with their talent and their lives are ruined. However, when geniuses try that's when you get people like Einstein or Socrates. Their work is studied for centuries after as people attempt to understand why they said what they did.

Now the rest of the people learn that they must work to understand things. And that's how it is for most people. Even if you're a little bit smarter than the person next to you, that person will succeed if they try harder. It's as simple as that. The more you work, the more you will succeed. There's nothing to it. If you want to be smart, you have to be prepared to lose sleep studying. The genius that works hard will always win. But between the genius and the diligent worker, the diligent worker will always come out on top.

One of my Korean adult 'buddies' came from Korea as a kid. The education here was so different, so much more encouraging than Korea. But he struggled, as he didn't know any English. Anyways, he set his sights on Harvard Law School (Arguably the best law school in the USA) and became zealously dedicated. He didn't sleep, he worked his butt off day and night. He ended up putting in ONLY ONE college application. That is insane. Psychopathic. And guess what? He got in.

You ask me, what if he didn't get in? Then it would be over. It was a leap of faith. If he hadn't gotten in, as my man Rise likes to say, bleach would have been the answer. But the thing is that is how dedicated you need to be if you want to be that sure of your success. How much dedication do you think it required to be able to only put in one app like that?

I don't know what you are all feeling. Maybe annoyed that your mom is pressuring you to study and it's annoying as hell. But when high school sophomore year rolls around, and you're starting to get worried, it will be too late for many of you. All those other kids you're competing with, the serious ones, have already put in thousands of hours. You need to start right now. If you don't want to look back at your life once you're in college and have regret, regret that you're going to the number one party college where it's literally impossible to work as girls in bikinis rollerblade outside your college classroom, regret that you go to a college where the new law allowing mobile homes to stay on campus has led to 500% increase in drug dealings, you need to start studying. You're deluding yourself if you think you're going to succeed somehow, or that you're going to be satisfied with mediocre. You need to get out there and make something happen.

And I'll tell you right now, school is not enough. To put it simply, school is just something you have to do. The bare minimum. Everyone does it. You took a couple of harder classes and got a 4.0? Great. Nobody cares. What will really help you get into a college and help you enjoy life and get a good job and so on and so forth is having passion for what you do. (And also soft skills, which you will never develop by staying home playing games anyways.) And don't worry if you are scared about locking yourself into a field of study this early. The fact that you're taking anything seriously and with maturity shows that you have diligence. Many people change majors in college, they change in their junior year even. And they succeed. You know how the 2 years of Spanish in middle school equates to 1 year in high school. That's 1 semester in college. You're not locking yourself in. You need to learn how to work and set yourself up to be successful in the future. And if you end up enjoying and spending the rest of your life doing what you're doing in high school, even better! More time to practice. More hours put in. That's what's really important.

The question you need to ask yourself, is ""How bad do you want it?""

Do you or do you not want to be satisfied and successful the rest of your life. Don't think you can make up everything in junior year of high school or magically turn your life around in college. That will be much more difficult. You need to start right now. Stop fooling around. You know how everyone says that getting into a good college doesn't matter, grades don't matter, etc. Trust me. That's important. It's not everything, but it is a huge advantage. The type of people, atmosphere, and what they teach you using the material is different. Do you really want to go to some shit college and work for those Harvard people in the future? Capitalist slavery. Is that appealing to you?

The answer is very simple. Hard work = success.

So get to work kiddos.

Extra Stuff for Homeschooled/Miscellaneous Tips
For the homeschooled, I'm not educated in your situations and context so I can't say much, and I'm not sure how college works for you guys. According to Pugsley, there should still be a lot of clubs and activities in your area that are unrelated to school that you can still find. Which you should.
There's something I've observed. It's that when I find I'm distracted from homework with my phone, I'll usually put it away and think that the problem is is solved. An hour later, I'll still have made no progress on my homework. That's because if you're not focused, no matter what you do, you'll always be distracted and unable to finish your work. That's why all my steps are necessary. You not only need to step away from Minecraft, you also need to inspire yourself. If you don't accomplish the latter, you might as well go back to Minecraft. Because you won't accomplish anything anyways. So delete the facebook app, quit skype, don't go on reddit or whatever time-wasting sites you go to, stop going on youtube and watching pro ladder drops and wool caps, and focus. Music helps. But you have to be inspired. Simply deleting PAD or Trivia Crack from your phone or uninstalling Minecraft and LOL is most likely not going to magically make you focus on your work and succeed.

Maybe you're finding it difficult to become more involved. As well as learning more about your interest on your own and studying, you need to become involved in activities. This is really important in widening your contacts network and being exposed to more opportunities such as internships or events. Again, I don't know about all of your lives and the situations about people in different parts of the USA or the world. But go to competitions, meet more people, ask and get emails. Learn about other events. Consult your teachers that are most involved with extracurricular things at school. Attend camps or sessions or competitions. I can't tell you the specifics, but you need to get out and actively try if you want to extend your network outside of your little school bubble. That is really important. Use google to find events near you! Don't stop searching. Don't think that somehow opportunities will come to you because you deserve it. You need to reach out and contact people yourself. But remember, you can only use these events and contacts to their full capability if you have knowledge in the area. That's why your personal studies are just as important as reaching out. Trust me:

Nothing's fun unless you're good at it.

It's not going to be easy. Being inspired to study and actually studying are completely different things. Often times you may be pressured to just give up your 'pointless' studying and come loose yourself in Minecraft. Don't do it. You have to stay dedicated.

In a Nutshell:
I wanted to wrap up everything I've said:
Step 1: Find an interest.

Step 2: Step away from overcast and Minecraft in general.

Step 3: Become inspired and dedicated. Learn that there is purpose behind your studies.

Step 4: Get to work. Work till you drop. Study your butt off.

Step 5(Optional): Follow SilentBuddha's exceptionally wise Life Tips to become a better person.

Step 6:(Optional): Quit Minecraft forever.

Step 7: Reply on the forum post if this has helped, and share your stories.

Wrap up, and about me.
So some of you may be wondering by now, and can see from my profile, that I've ranked up a decent amount of playing time on this server. Is this guy even practicing what he's preaching? What a hypocrite!
Well, recently I had a wake up call from my good Korean adult mentors/buddies. (It was indirect, they don't even know I play the game. My parents don't know either. I was just inspired) But before that, my friends criticized me. But I played on. I was ignorant and stupid. And perhaps it was easier to step away from Minecraft because it was difficult keeping it secret and having my parents pressure me about my work. It will be more difficult for you because your parents don't care that you game. But if you have parents that care, they will be so proud and impressed at your changes. But that's only if you change. Stop dreaming and start doing.

But I'm glad that I got to see the light before things got worse. I decided that I wouldn't let Minecraft ruin my life, and luckily I wasn't as deeply rooted as some of you are and stepping away from Minecraft a bit is really easy.

However, I've always wanted to help my fellow Minecrafters. I reached out to some people on my team and tried to initiate the first step of finding interest, and the only person that listened to anything I've said is Biixerv, I guess. Creds to that guy. He's really cool, people. Never let biases, first impressions, or anything affect you. You have to stay positive and always try to maintain good relationships with people. Once people see your true nature, you can convert them. You can make anyone a good friend of yours through kindness, respect, and compassion. Don't be an asshole or a jerk. But remember that people like me aren't stupid. When my attempts fail, I can be a real asshole. I have been. But hopefully that never has to happen with you guys.

I changed two people that bullied me. (I wasn't affected at all, don't worry peeps. AKA Their attempts FAILED MISERABLY) One leaves me alone, and is a lot more subdued now. The other is a really good friend of mine now. We're hella chill. And he's much nicer to everybody in life now. I haven't seen any truly mean actions from him since two years ago. Stuff like that makes me truly happy.

I've met some great people, and apply everything in my profile to real life, always staying positive and cheerful but serious enough so that I am taken seriously. And I've met a lot of jerks in real life. Recently a lot of my closest friends I'm having doubts about. Currently only one candidate is in my 'true friends' list, and I don't even know her that well. My other best friends would have to be two Korean adults, who have helped me so much. And they're not benevolent, kind people. They're rough. They're brutally honest. But inside, they're the kindest people ever. Their personalities and mindsets have rubbed off on me. They've brought me above everyone else I know that is my age. In a good way. And they've made me into a new person, someone who wants to give back, and will help if you reach out. But you'll never know. They're scary on the outside. And they changed my inner personality. On the outside, I'm usually over-cheerful and very immature, although that's changed recently due to my friends and just aging. But inside I've become more like them. The people who you choose to associate yourself with is important, people. People this age are mostly all immature on the inside, even if they seem adult-like. Unless you guys meet people like my Korean friends in real life, you will probably be that way as well. I really don't know why I'm saying this... It feels necessary to tell you where this post is coming from. Sorry if it's awkward. I'm just typing what's coming into my mind.

I've got a lot of philosophic stuff that I've thought about and if you have any questions or are curious feel free to ask me on skype. About friends, studying, attitude, dedication and diligence in any academic area... How to approach life and problems... The affect of school and education on friendship, ethics and the morals in mini Cold Wars that happen in your schools... Feel free to hit me up if you need inspiration. Or want to talk. I'm here and I want to help you all!

Hopefully this post helped you. I took a solid couple of hours to write this for you guys. I'd like to hear any stories or reports back if this has helped. Share your stories! They will teach me and everybody else something.

As for Overcast, I'm not really sure what is going to happen. I'm not sure if I'll be able to cut myself off so suddenly. But I'm definitely going to be playing less. I have goals, people. Educational, social, and personal goals. And Minecraft is not helping me achieve those.

I already know that many of you will just brush this off. Please don't. Others will be inspired but they won't actively follow this guide. You have to stay inspired. But that's your job. I'm not your life counselor. Be thankful I'm here helping you. I assure you that you won't get this type of advice in your life. In the rare case that you do, it will most likely be too late. I'm doing you people a favor because I want to help you. And I've still got fuel for y'all! Ask me on skype if you'd like to learn more.

And even if this doesn't do anything to help your lives, at least try to be mature people and stay courteous and respectful in-game and in mumble. I hear stories about completely unacceptable responses in mumble. Don't be a jerk. You're only bringing yourself bad reputation and discouraging others to contribute to making this server better, as well as making it worse yourself.

And lastly, I really have no idea what to expect from Overcast community. I've never done something like this before and I'm not sure whether my 50 percent estimate was correct. Maybe all of you are much smarter and involved than me and I'm just psychopathic. Who knows.

Anyways, thanks everybody. Hope this helped and best of luck in your lives!"

I'm interested in studying IT. I'm really passionate about computers, I love to solve problems, ever since I was little I had interest in electronics, made circuits, solved software issues, etc. So I have some question for UCF students who studying IT.

1) How rigorous are the math courses required for this major? Is it a lot easier compared to someone who is studying to get a computer science degree?

2) How is tutoring for the classes required for this major? I don't think I will struggle but I am wondering if UCF has great resources for students who need help. Sometimes I don't understand things and I will seek help

3) How is UCF with internships? Does the Computer Science college help to land good internships? What are your experiences? Did you land a permanent job from an internship?  

4) How is the stress load of this major and the stress load at a beginning position? 


I'm interested in this major because I am passionate about computers and I would like to use my skills to solve problems. Eventually I would like to become a IT manager, then work my way up to Chief Information Officer."
32yy5g,0,2015-04-17,I found my [25m] GF [23f] of 4 months involved in a sexually charged facebook conversation with her ex,Down4thaCount,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/32yy5g/i_found_my_25m_gf_23f_of_4_months_involved_in_a/,"So a little background.. I've been cheated on before. Its really hard for me to trust girls. It took me a long time to admit that I love this girl. Lets call her Jess. We have been seeing each other for about 7 months. We only started really dating in January after she told me she loved me. It took me a long time to realize I love her too.. within the last 2 months. We have been dating for about 4 months.

The problem is that she is only in my town for an internship and could possible be leaving in June if she doesn't get a job with the company she is working for. We knew that this might be an obstacle but we wanted to make the best of the time we had and worry about what to do when the time came.

Some relevant stuff about her.. Shes a little religious. She told me that she didn't have sex until a few months before I met her. And she said it was with a guy that she thought she was in love with. Before that, she says she had only kissed a few guys and did a little bit of oral but didn't like it. I believe that because she did if with me and I told her she can stop.

Full disclosure: I met her on tinder. Before, I was using it to meet loser girls that just wanted sex. That was fine but I wasn't into that anymore. I met her and we really like each other. Didn't have sex until months later. Not sure how this sub feels about that sort of thing but there it is. 

Fast forward to 3 days ago. She sends me a text specifically asking me to send her a picture she made on my computer to her through facebook messenger. The day before she was logged into facebook on my computer and was sending her mom the stuff that she made. I said ok and went to facebook. Turns out that she never logged out and I was in her profile.

This is where I'm a bit of an asshole.. But, I guess my trust issues from the previous relationship made me curious. I started going through her messages. It didn't take long to find a recent message between her and a guy she went to college with. 

Basically, its conversations that go all the way back to before I met her. She made out with him but told him no when he tried to have sex. They didn't do anything besides kiss according to the conversation. She tells him that she has never had an orgasm and he tells her he will give her one. This was right before I met her.

However, the most recent conversation was last week. It started with her saying ""whats up sexy ;)"" then they talk about a few normal things. He starts talking about her ass and how he misses it. He tells her he wants to wrestle her naked. They talk about how they miss each other wish they could see each other. He again talks about when they were making out back in the day and how he wished that could have gone further. Then, he again asks about the farthest shes gone with a guy.  She says that they already had that conversation and sends him screenshots from her phone pictures of the what they were saying before I met her. He again promises that he will give her an orgasm. She say something to the effect of ""lol promises, promises.. we will probably never see each other again but maybe one day"". 

Finally he asks her what she thinks about sex. She says she still hasn't done it yet and says it should be with someone who she really cares about. He says that it makes you one with that person. She replies something to the effect of ""yeah and you cant become one with everyone you find attractive because then you will be pulled into many directions"" or something. 

Soooo... as soon as I read all of this I was pissed. I thought about it for an hour and told her that we needed to talk. I straight out told her I read it and asked her what the fuck? She pretty much says that he was a crazy guy that she thought she loved. She was never planning on doing anything with him. The typical stuff you can expect to hear when someone is caught. I asked about why she was even talking to a crazy guy like that. She says because he asked.. okay. 

The cherry on top is that all of these recent messages happened on a night the she was sleeping over at my house. I was doing homework late and she was a few feet away talking about sex with this guy. The next day, we went to a theme park and had a blast with each other. 

I guess im just rambling now. This confrontation happened last night. I still don't know what to do. I have been in a similar situation before and know that I never want to be in this position again. However, it was just messages with a guy hundreds of miles away. She didn't actually do anything. I dont want to break up with her because I do love her. But I'm not sure if I can ever trust her again. Especially since she is moving back pretty soon. They could be planning on meeting up as soon as she leaves. 

It also opens a lot of questions in my mind. She has made plenty of trips back to her college to hang out with friends. Maybe she was hooking up with all of her old flames from college? She tells me about how her old roommates were slutty and fucked a bunch of dudes. Maybe she is the same? She didn't tell this guy that she had sex with anyone let alone her boyfriend. She told me she had sex before but only like 3 times with one other guy. Can I really believe that? She tells me that she told him he was a virgin because he wanted him to believe she is still pure. I guess in the past she wanted to wait for marriage. 

I guess I'm rambling again. I just want some advice. I told her that I wouldn't make a decision on what to do until later. She is out of town for the weekend for work (again.. trust issues). She says she will make me trust her and be the best girlfriend ever. I wish it was that easy. What should I do?
   
**tl;dr: My girlfriend talked with another guy about sex while next to me in bed. Could have possibly been planning to meet up after she moved. She says it was nothing but I not sure if I can ever trust her. I love her and dont know if I should just break up with her now.**"

I started this journey way back in 2003 when I graduated high school, but I didn't try very hard and got little to no direction from anyone about the college experience other than the movies. I scored a 31 on my ACT after taking it just 2 times and doing no prep for it, so I easily got a full ride to the local state school. 

Well it rolls around to the Fall semester I decided to not live on campus and commute for 30 minutes each way every day (did I mention I was stupid and signed up for classes last minute) and waited too long to get my books (did I mention I was stupid had no money other than gas money so I needed financial aid to pick up books), so I downloaded the books I could get and hoped to wing the rest without material. Well that landed me squarely in academic probation and you would think I would learn my lesson, but alas I did not. My second semester was also bad and after skipping all of my finals I ended up with a 1.52 GPA. 

Fast forward to now and I'll be finishing up my second semester back and now have a 3.56 (which should go to a 3.75+ at the end of the semester) and can graduate next winter with a associates of applied arts in general education from the local Cc and transfer. Now to my questions since the back story is out of the way. 

1) Should I stay at the community college and finish my business administration associates and possibly try to get into a more prestigious school? 

2) If I can get into a more prestigious school would it be worth it to pay a bit for it or would it be better to get the freebie education from the local University? (Arkansas State University) 

3) What's my likelihood of scoring a good internship the summer after finishing CC if I work on some decent projects this summer? 

4) I'm also interested in electrical engineering and was planning on double majoring. Would it be worth it outside of learning to do that? 

Give me some opinions guys I've been reading the sub for awhile now and until doing so thought I was doomed, but there is some really uplifting stuff in here and some true feel good stories. "

I'm really in need of some advice... I've been stuck in a ""hole"" for over five years now and I'm not sure how to climb out anymore. 

So back about six years ago, I was interning for an art department in a fantastic advertising agency. We mostly worked with various music studios, with a lot of high profile artists that I really enjoyed, so I was incredibly excited. I was also going to two year college  for a degree in business, as well. 

It so happened that my internship and my last college semester ended at the same time, and without continuing education I was unable to comeback to the internship. This saddened everyone, and because of my work and the bond I'd created to the newly hired on-staff photographer; The president of the department sat down with us and negotiated a very reasonable weekly paycheck for me. I began to officially actually work there as the assistant to my new friend, and to basically run the in house studio (production needs, assisting, fine tuning, retouching, the works).

While we were working together I was his assistant in the office and pretty much every kind of an assistant on the shoot.. Like some of you might know you sometimes get gigs just because you know how to use certain software, and/or because you have a drivers license and don't mind driving trucks. I was that guy. I could practically do anything you need and wouldn't mind grabbing you a cup of coffee. I ended up learning a ton from everyone on every set that I was hired for.
 
I also started to borrow his camera and lenses and ended up getting my own dslr setup some months after I began working there. For the longest time all I did is keep on shooting as much as I could, and in as many variations (landscape/city life/fashion/still-life), but I never did anything with the pictures, except look at them and maybe show a few of them to someone, like a friend 

Even still, life was great, I couldn't be happier. Fast forward two years, my boss/friend and I have a disagreement and I'm ""fired"". We tried to stay in touch but it didn't seem like it was working out and now we haven't spoken for over five years.

 I tried making a website and business cards a bit later on but it didn't go anywhere and the website eventually stopped working and I lost the rights to the link, because there is another photographer out there with the same name. Over the past few years I have reconnected with at least one other assistant that I was friends with back then, and I got a few gigs because of it; but he moved to Paris to continue his career and it's been years since I have worked for someone else on a set. 

I had my own (first) official shoot for a musician and that went amazingly well. It was in studio and I had access to my own lights and an assistant. I did my own retouching on this one because of the budget restrains. The pictures came out great.

In the past I've been hired for a few small gigs as a photographer, mostly for food and drink, as well as some fashion and event. I also did a two year stint with an events photography company, doing specialized digital photography for weddings, bar mitzvahs, that sort of thing.

Without going into too much detail, in the past I have had my food pictures in The Village Voice, in form of a advertisement for a restaurant as well as a full size billboard in downtown NYC for the same restaurant. I've had some other ads in magazines that I mostly lucked in to, as well as a photo of a popular musician that was a right time right place quick snap in another big magazine; but it's been years since that happened.

I have tried to get fully back into it, but I keep running into walls. Time keeps lapsing, and I'm not sure what to do, but I know what I have been doing isn't working.

I fell back on restaurant gigs and bartending because it always feels like it's going nowhere and no one will ever even look at the pictures I take. I have posted over 300 pictures on deviant art but besides the first hr reaction the pictures never get views again. I'm not super social online and hate bragging about my photography in the real world.
 
Recently I had this idea of printing my resume in landscape mode and putting some simple graphics around the corners to make it pop a bit more and maybe show that I'm artistically inlined... Maybe put some retouched pictures on the back to show that that's with in my skill set. After I have this thing printed, i can walk around and hand it out to the local wedding photography studios and hope someone calls me back. 

The most I'm expecting out of this is some retouching work and maybe a job where I can go and shoot. I know it's a far cry from the big shoots with famous musicians of the past but at least i could start paying my bills with some photo related work. 

I don't know what to do if this idea fails and because of this I have been very afraid to start, but today I was fired from my bartending job for basically being depressed and looking unhappy. 

I'm unhappy because I'm not doing what I love and I needed the push to really give it my all. Now that I have to look for a new job, I'm going to look where I'm the happiest rather than just doing something that I can do, but get very little pleasure out of most of the time. I enjoy a lot of the social aspects of bartending as well as the science behind craft bartending, but I hate the in house dynamic, the incessant drama that comes with it, the hours have destroyed my social life and I constantly feel exhausted because I'm unfulfilled career wise...

So now that I'm back on he job market does anyone have any suggestions on what I should focus on to grab a job? My graphic resume is a good start, but I'm afraid that it won't take me that far and I'm going to have to craigslist most my job interviews.

32zim9,3,2015-04-17,Salesforce or eBay Internship?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/32zim9/salesforce_or_ebay_internship/,"Hi everyone,
I'm a 2nd year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Engineering in Cali. I accepted an offer from eBay back in January for a mobile web development internship. However, I received an offer today from Salesforce for a Software Engineer Intern position for a Platform Engineering UI team. However, the recruiter described the position to me as a hybrid of development and testing, and this is evident by the position's roles/responsibilities found here: [Roles/Responsibilities](http://careers.force.com/jobs/apex/ts2__JobDetails?jobId=a1k7000000084eeAAA&amp;tSource=)

&amp;nbsp;

I think Salesforce is an awesome company, and working in SF would be sweet. However, I'm worried about the testing aspect of this position (again, look at the roles/responsibilities in the link above) and how it may affect my opportunities for internships for next summer when I'll have completed my junior year. The hiring manager who I interviewed with gave me a few algorithmic exercises on collabedit and then had me come up with test cases for each problem. The recruiter said this position is 50% development, 50% testing, and that as long as I do well this summer, there's a LOT of opportunities for positions for next summer. Also, they love their interns and have a 80% conversion rate from junior yr summer to full time, and for people who have interned two summers, they have a 100% conversion rate.

&amp;nbsp;

What do you guys think I should do? Pay is similar but I love the appeal of working for the industry's #1 Cloud Computing company while eBay is ok, but it isn't as ""hot"" as Salesforce is. 

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: Accepted Mobile Web Dev position at eBay, but got Salesforce position where it's on the tools/testing team where it's 50/50 testing and development (probably on internal frameworks). I like Salesforce much more than eBay and they have an awesome return offer/full time offer rate. "

I have some options:

1. start studying fall semester's material (because the work is very, very hard and time-consuming)
2. try to get a summer internship
3. take the INTRO classes for a SECOND major that I may want to pursue. 
4. get a job
5. summer coding projects

Explanation of options:

1. Another friend and I, if we do this, want to simply expose ourselves to material. I think if we even just get to week 6, we'll be super prepared for next semester. Pros: Free. Cons: Not really using the summer.
2. Self-explanatory, but it's a little late to look for them (in my field at least)... and I am only a freshman. And I don't have any projects. Pros: maybe $$$, definitely a resume-stuffer. Cons: hard to get, may be unpaid, may not learn much.
3. My favorite option. My current Comp Lit/Rhetoric professor encourages me to be a Rhetoric major (she actually told me to drop CS for it). And I love the material. Pros: won't be behind in that major's classes. Cons: expensive... $2200 (including apartment, food, books, tuition), may not get all the material. And I already NEED to be taking a math class this summer, too. So potentially 3 semester-long classes during the summer (though no more than 2 classes at once). 
4. I already have a job--they'll likely still want me. Hours flexible, $20/hr. Pros: easy and good money. Cons: not related to majors, so not really furthering my potential career... also very boring.
5. Self explanatory. Pros: may be fun, free, potential source of passion. Resume-stuffer. Cons: what if nothing comes out of it?"

32zweo,2,2015-04-17,Certain I have ADHD. I will be undergoing testing through the health center at my university in a couple of weeks. Seeking advice/guidance,TheRelentlessSkeezix,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/32zweo/certain_i_have_adhd_i_will_be_undergoing_testing/,"Hi guys,

I'm new to this subreddit. I'm mainly a lurker on Reddit, but I would like to seek some advice/guidance from this community.

A bit of background:

As a teenager, I was diagnosed with MDD (major depressive disorder) and GAD (generalized anxiety disorder). I have been on and off SSRIs, SNRIs, benzos/mood stabilizers throughout much of my adolescence and young adult life. I'm a 24-year old female. 

Without divulging too many details, I had a very traumatic upbringing and have been diagnosed with PTSD. This past winter, I went through some major episodes of depression. I live in Michigan, so it's not uncommon for some people to go through the winter blues, or SAD (seasonal affective disorder). 

When I was 3, my grandmother told my mom that I needed to be on Ritalin because of my hyperactivity and high levels of energy, but my mom refused to put me on any type of medication. I have never been diagnosed with ADHD, but now I am going to get tested for it since I exhibit many signs of it. 

In recent months and weeks, I have been experiencing panic attacks, low motivation, lethargy, outbursts of irritation/anger at trivial things and I constantly experience racing thoughts and jump to conclusions.

My wonderful, patient and supportive boyfriend has been there for me through all of the turmoil this year. I am a graduate student seeking to get my Masters of Social Work and I'm the news editor for my campus' newspaper.

The panic attacks and anxiety I've been dealing with have been crippling and debilitating. I've missed work, class and internship due to them in recent months. 

After talking with my mom and boyfriend, in addition to doing some research, it's becoming more and more evident that I may have ADHD. It would not surprise since my father (now deceased) had ADHD and self medicated. (Marijuana was only the substance that helped him. Unfortunately he turned to harder drugs that had a role in his untimely death). My twelve year old brother has also been diagnosed with ADHD. It seems there is a genetic component. 

After talking with my boyfriend, who also happens to have ADHD and has received the proper treatment, we are both certain I have it as well.

These are the signs and symptoms I experience on a regular basis:

-Impulsivity, I want to act on something right away and I jump to conclusions.
-Procrastination. I put too many things off until the very last minute. I tend to avoid them by hyper focusing on an entirely different task.
-I get started on tasks, but have a difficult time finishing them.
-I have very poor organizational skills. My desk at work and my bedroom is a mess. I've never been much of an organized person.
-I'm forgetful and I tend to lose items (such as my phone, car keys, etc on a daily basis).
-I experience difficulty paying attention to lectures in class or I have trouble focusing while reading a textbook and often have to go back and re-read a paragraph several times over before moving on. 
-I tend to ""blurt out"" answers a lot and interrupt people without thinking about it at certain times. 
-I have major issues with focusing on one thing at a time. My mind is constantly jumping from one thing to another. 
-I overreact, I'm impatient and I'm prone to being defensive.

After visiting my psychiatrist and explaining the symptoms, she agrees that it would not be a surprise if I have ADHD. I will be undergoing extensive testing in early May from a psychologist to find out if I have it.

The antidepressants I've been taking have not been working. I was recently put on Klonopin (which does help with my anxiety) and I've been prescribed LeMICtal (25 mg) which is a mood stabilizer. I am also on Pristiq (50 mg) for the time being. 

I also experience trouble sleeping at night because of racing thoughts and constant worries. I'm more likely to sleep during the day by taking naps after I get home from class/work/internship because I'm exhausted and unmotivated. I find that my worries from putting things off become depressive thoughts and I find ways to distract myself from them until I absolutely need to get them done. 

I also have a hard time sitting still and I fidget/squirm a lot in my seat. I always feel like I have to be doing something and have trouble relaxing. 

My boyfriend, who has a background in chemistry, biotechnology and pharmacy, feels I was improperly diagnosed with MDD. I think he may be right. 

At this point in time, I can not say for sure that I do have ADHD since I have not been formally diagnosed, but I'm highly certain I have it and have had it, it has just gone untreated throughout the course of my life. 

I apologize for the novel, just wanted to share some points so it makes sense. 

What would you guys recommend I do for the time being until I undergo testing and get the results? What habits/rituals should I begin to ease the difficulties I've been dealing with lately and for much of my life? 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Any advice/suggestions are greatly appreciated. This seems like a very supportive and helpful community. I look forward to your feedback. 

TL;DR - 24 year old female who may have ADHD. Has family history of ADHD and exhibits many of the signs and symptoms. May have been wrongly diagnosed with MDD. Will be undergoing testing through my university's psychiatric/psychological services in early May to find out if I have ADHD. Seeking advice and tips to help me stay on task with school, work and other aspects of my life. "

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL THE REPLIES!!

That's exactly what I wanted to hear! So the program takes care of its students with partnerships and internships.

I know that you have to choose a path in the EE program.. could you tell me a bit more about those? (or what you've heard?)

I've been building computers and overclocking since 13ish years old. I've messed around and wrote a few programs (self taught) in java. I also have experience in soldering....from those ""kits"" you can buy.

What I really want is the opportunity to get formal education and learn some theories in Electrical Engineering. I want to sign up for classes and learn about circuits, computer architecture, etc.

What classes have you taken? Any particular ""weed-out"" classes/professors I should be aware of?

Should I take a specific programming language to get me up to speed before transferring?

EDIT2:
Also, I'm thinking about picking up an Arduino or RaspberryPi set to play with it over the summer. Do you guys have any recommendations?

 I am currently a senior in college, looking to graduate next month. During the summer of 2014, I interned at a big corporate firm. Unfortunately, toward the end of the internship, the recruiter stated they weren't able to offer me and the other interns full-time positions after we graduate (most likely budget strategy). The recruiter, however, did mention that if we ever come across any junior roles on their page, to let them know.

Earlier this month, I came across a position that I felt I would fit in quite well, given my experiences. I emailed the recruiter, and two weeks later, she asked my availability to come in to interview with her and the hiring manager.

I had the interview today. The hiring manager spoke to my manager over the summer, and she got some great feedback about my work. The interview went very smoothly, we spoke for close to an hour. 

I thought everything went swell, until the hiring manager mentioned that since this position recently opened up, she wanted to interview a few more people. While she was walking out, I asked her about the timeline as to when I could possibly hear back, and she said she wasn't 100% sure as she still wanted to interview others.

Given that last bit of information, where does that put me? Was this some kind of social cue letting me know I didn't get the job? As soon as I got home, I sent the hiring manager, and the recruiter a thank you email.

I may be overanalyzing, but i'd love some outside perspective. Thank you!"

I can't sleep. I barely eat. I have no friends within 600 miles, and shitty relationships with my parents and sister.

I have an education, but no job, going on almost 2 years unemployment. I'm trying to get in to grad schools for the fall (to get a job...) but even that seems like a long shot, because I underachieved in college and lack grades to get in anywhere worth the cost of going. 

The only ""work"" I've had was an unpaid internship who dismissed me when they realized I was searching for a full time job. 

I am up all night, regardless of if I stay up, then sleep all day. Nothing apart from lots of alcohol or weed can knock me out at any reasonable hour.

But really, life would be fine if I still had friends. Since graduating college, I moved away to live with some older cousins (the only people who would take me), and I cannot make new friends.

I tried, really, truly. I've been here for well over a year, and either my terrible social skills, or lack of anyone remotely my age in the local area, but I just know I'm alone, and it sucks. 

Couple times a year max I see my old college buddies, and seeing them progressing with life, holding down jobs, long term relationships, etc, makes me so depressed it's unreal. I'm blame only myself for current predicament, but it seems no amount of effort on my part can change the status quo.

I've  studied for and done exceedingly well on a variety of graduate and professional exams, but my GPA scares off any prospective employers or graduate schools. My GPA sucks because I was lonely and isolated for 2 years in college and gave no fucks playing video games all day and constantly skipping class. My fault. No real explaining things. Just underachievement. 

Relationships? Please. Like any girl wants jack shit to do with a loser like me. I'm in pretty good shape, although I'm definitely on the weaker side, but I can't even get second dates anymore. I had two long term girlfriends in college, but never even got close to sex with either. I was raised in an ultra-religious household where talking to girls was forbidden, and never really adapted to most social norms. I can be as outgoing and friendly as I want, but I am pitifully bad at building any attraction.

But regardless, I am in an area with no people my age. The local meetup.com events are all singles 45+ events and their like.

My only friends are my online gaming buddies, and even they are getting too old for wasting the days, working jobs and such. Fuck.

I've even picked up a small drug habit it seems. Lucky for me I have no supply where I live, but I always jump at the opportunities when they come along.  

It's been years since I have enjoyed real happiness. Years since I consistently walked around with a smile because life was good. Now I am just distant and withdrawn. No one around me knows me anymore. 

So anyways, I feel at a total loss for the first time in my life. I'm still strong inside today, but sooner or later, I won't be able to keep going like this. I have no questions or wisdom. Just talking to reddit because no one else will hear me. "

This is going to last for probably six weeks. I'm still arranging a good schedule to come in because I have some tests to study for. I'll primarily take care of computations and data from his projects. (Because he took note that I'm good at math.)

A bit of background: I got into computer science because I played a lot of computer games and I thought it'd be cool to get in that industry. Since then I've realised that I don't enjoy playing games let alone making them. I used games as escapism from my bigger mental health problems. I don't hate computer science, but a big part of me thinks I'm doing the wrong subject and that I am not cut out for being a software developer.

Kinda long.,FutureDawg,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/331cv7/im_just_looking_for_advice_so_confused_4th/,"So I started out in CC. I was pre-med. I did some shadowing, enjoyed it. Did first aid work, it was alright. Volunteered at a hospital- really liked the environment. After my first two years I transferred and thought medical school wasn't for me, in fact I decided to chase the money and chose engineering.

I've been in a mechanical engineering program and just finished an internship. The engineering work is just not for me. I was offered a very good salary(94k), but I hate the work to be blunt. In fact I just simply began hating my major. I'm not passionate or interested in this field.

I took a look back at my classes and I really liked organic chemistry, probably a poor indicator but still. I like the science behind medicine I think. I'd much rather be reading why a kidney transplant works versus why my beam is undergoing torsion.

Anyway, long story short: I think I want to consider medicine as a career path again. The money isn't worth it for my current option for me to stick around. I'm looking for advice though. Because I still dont think I'm cut out for it.


My main issue is I'm passive, as in I don't focus well. I tend to day dream a lot and that to be seems like its going to ruin any chance I have. I'll have someone's life in my hands. I can't afford to be this way. That's something that really bothers me because I know in many jobs I haven't exactly been focused.

Then my academic career. My GPA has been on a decline ever since hitting university. But I honestly think that's an indication of how much I hate the material I'm studying. sGPA is pretty good: 3.85, but my cGPA is a 3.5 and that has been on the decline. Poor grades in some engineering courses. However, I do think if I take some other bio/chem courses it will show a decent upwards trend.

I don't know professors well enough for good letters of recommendation. The only extracurriculars I've had since CC are just engineering clubs.

I guess in this jumbled mess I typed up, I'm just worried I'm not cut out for being a doctor. I have focus issues, and perhaps academically, and extracurricular-lly I lack a lot of good ""points"" so to speak. Just looking for some advice here."
331epy,15,2015-04-18,Regarding 'Time Cops'... My Theory.,Peperib,Yogscast,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yogscast/comments/331epy/regarding_time_cops_my_theory/,"Hey there! 
With the recent release of Time Cops... The tragic backstory of Bort... All that good stuff, I've come up with a theory. This came to me like a smack in the face (which happens more than often with me) as soon as I saw that first episode of Time Cops.

So, here we go.
Duncan from Magic Police and Time Cops is the original Duncan. The true Duncan. 
After going back in time, he tampered with things that created different timelines. These different timelines led to different circumstances for Duncan. They are as follows.

Timeline 1.
Duncan, instead of meeting Sjin and starting Magic Police, met Lewis and Simon, becoming an employee at Honeydew Inc.
He was lead engineer for their space angency, architect for their Jaffa Factory, an intern at Yoglabs, and a CEO of Hole Diggers. He was successful in their business until Simon ripped a hole in time and space on the Yoglabs episode leading to Hypercubed.

Timeline 2.
Instead of meeting Sjin, he does science alone. He goes slightly insane with power, building an immensely fortified castle. On the brink of sanity, a small lady named Kim drops from the sky and gives him companionship. This becomes Flux Buddies Duncan, who was competing against Honeydew Inc. for the space race in their Galacticraft series. 

Timeline 3. 
This is the same as Timeline 2, however, Sjin never blows Kim up. She never lands in Duncan's castle and he goes insane. He is simply known as 'Lalnable Hector'.

You're probably saying, ""but there was a Magic Police/Flux Buddies crossover"". Well, realise I never mentioned Magic Police as a timeline. This is because Magic Police is the same series as Time Cops. This means, they would have the ability to travel through time and space at their free will. This means they could of travelled to the Flux Buddies timeline if they wanted to. Technically merging the two timelines permanently, creating two Duncans in a single timeline.

Then there's the issue of Duncan's Castle appearing in Flux Buddies with Lalnable's lab in it.
Who's stopping Lalnable from finding the same time travel laboratory as Duncan and Sjin did, but in his own timeline, but before the incident happened? By the flashbacks we can tell that all the scientists there were villagers.
With one unique Elvis looking villager. It's possible that Lalnable kidnapped these villagers, so he could lock them up and interrogate them for their knowledge of Time Travel. With this newly acquired knowledge, Lalnable could freely send himself and his castle through space and time, especially with all that power from his big reactor. He just wanted to get away from everyone so they'd stop bothering him.
But he made a mistake. He sent his castle and himself through time, however, they landed in separate timelines.
His castle landed in the Fluz Buddies timeline, while he landed in the Hole Diggers timeline, where space travel technology was at its peak. During this time, Zoey's mushbury series was happening (I forget its name). He landed in her ship. This was why it picked up a Duncan-like hostile life form.
After landing on earth, Duncan escaped from her ship. When he was finally there, after many years of stowing away on Zoey's ship, Yoglabs had occurred. As we know, it's set in the future. He was arrested by authorities (for whatever reason) and given to Yoglabs. That's when he was contained in his containment cell seen in an episode of Yoglabs.

Now, do you remember that episode of Flux Buddies... ""Rescuing Elvis"", where they rescued a group of villagers, locked in cells, under a castle that had travelled through time? One of these villagers was Elvis, or as we now know him as, Bort. 

In Hypercubed, which is after Yoglabs, they find Duncan suspended in the reflecting pools. This was obviously a high security container area. But when they release him, he seems like the normal Duncan. That's because Lalnable and HoleDiggers Duncan got mixed up, and Lalnable was set free, probably wandering around in the depths of Yoglabs.

To finish off, what happened to Bort after he was released from captivity?
Well, they let the villagers out into the village near Panda Labs I think. After the war between Flux Buddies and Hat Corp, Bort was radiated, and mutated into a giant, green, man. He retained his ability to talk, however. 
Remember that episode of Yoglabs where they met the talking zombie named Bort?
Well, we can only assume as to how he jumped timelines for now.
But I'll assume that in his mutated form, he wandered off to find his old lab. He got there, and went through the stargate (it's pretty big). He ended up in the Yoglabs timeline.

So I think I've covered everything. Sorry for the long post, there's just a lot to say about this, as it all makes so much sense!

331gd7,3,2015-04-18,"PMO Leaves You Cold, But A Real Woman Loves You Even When You Fall Short",willdieproud,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/331gd7/pmo_leaves_you_cold_but_a_real_woman_loves_you/,"A week ago, I was given a job offer at a company I worked for as an intern for about two months.  I was graduating from college studying computer information technology, with honors, and with an award given to only one CIT graduate per year.  Things were looking great, until I found out how much (or little) the company I was working with was paying me for full time work.

18 - 20 dollars per hour.  Now, for some, that salary would seem great.  And I will confess, the salary is fair given my level of experience.  I’m a fresh graduate with some experience, but not enough to bring me over a certain wage bracket quite yet.  I knew from my performance at work that I still had a ways to go before I would reach Senior level, yet I could see how I could progress to the point of being at Senior level.  

However, my current situation is different.  I am engaged to the most incredible woman I’ve ever met.  Once we’re married, I’ll be the sole provider since she’s going to med school.  I also have student loans; not too many, but enough to get in the way a bit.  After I told her how little I was being paid, it drove both her and I to tears.  

We cried because, with such low pay for our situation, we knew we’d have to endure a complete lifestyle change.  It would be hard for me because I would have to work two jobs (not impossible, but something I’ve never attempted before) and it would be hard for her because, her mother being an ER doctor, she has grown up in luxury most of her life.

However, even though my fiancee was driven to tears at first, the next day she told me that she was going to stick with it, even though my starting salary wasn’t very glorious.  It drove me to tears when I heard her say it!  She’s staying!  I’ve always had a bitter feeling that a man is judged upon and is given gifts according to the amount of money he makes; that a man deserves only as much as he makes.  I knew this was wrong and I never believed it in my head, but in times of high stress or discouragement, this feeling would always rear it’s ugly head.  Thankfully, this feeling died when my fiancee said she not only chose to stay, but she wanted to stay.

Her words and actions have shown me what love is, as opposed to what you would see on a computer screen.  Of course, I knew in my head what love was and I could imagine it happening, but I had never experienced it in that way with a woman outside my family.  I would have never expected her, being from an affluent family, to so willingly and lovingly embrace the situation we were in and stay with me.

She has shown me of what real love really feels like.  Not just what it looks like.  Some of us probably know a couple who truly love each other and have proved it to each other and others on the outside.  We may have seen this love manifest itself in a way that, when we witnessed it, it hurt to be present because of the longing we felt for the same love.

I felt this way for a long time in my life.  Then there was the point in time when I met and actually interacted and loved a real woman who has proved to me that she loves me.  I just pray that I have done the same. In fact, I’ll do just that right now and in future times of weakness by giving up PMO when the urge comes.  That is one of the greatest things I can do for her in this moment and in the future.

Moral of the story:  Give up PMO and look for true, authentic love.  It may be easier said than done, but, for the sake of your future family, and yes you’ll have one, give up PMO.  Take the steps necessary to start recovery.  If you’re not sure where to start, just ask.  This subreddit is filled with men (and women) who can offer you insight to how to quit the addiction.  Just remember that we’re here for you."

I recently acquired an internship with a radio station and part of my internship is helping out with the creation of radio spots and promos.

I learned about sidechain compression in school and used it extensively when I would make promos for my college station. I learned how to do this in Pro Tools 10 by setting up a key input within a compression plugin (I can't recall the specific plugin).

The radio station I'm with now has the first version of Adobe Audition as their DAW. Although I'm familiar with Audition (3.0 and CS6 specifically), I was unable to figure out how to set up the proper signal path to employ the use of sidechain compression.

I understand you can manipulate the volume envelope manually to achieve similar results, but I've always felt that knowing how to do one thing through multiple methods is always beneficial.

So in short, how do I go about using sidechain compression in the original version of Adobe Audition?

Thank you!"

I have e-mail addresses of two IT managers that work at my previous employment. I have a good standing with the company and HR knew me by name. I left to go to college and I will finish two classes in networking and database fundamentals with a 4.0 gpa and earn two MTA certificates (database administration and networking fundamentals) this May. Questions!

* Should I send an e-mail to both, or just one of them? Should I Bcc or cc the message if it's for both? 

* Should I meet them in person instead of sending an e-mail?

* When I ask about an internship, should I be quick to mention my certificates and GPA?

* Would I even be worth anything to them? My networking class had a focus on Cisco equipment (IOS commands), and they have some at the company, but other than that I only have fundamental skills and knowledge

* Should I contact them ahead of time or wait until I've finished? I'm confident that I will have the 4.0 and certificates after I'm done, but would that come across as cocky if it's beforehand?

I know there are a lot of different experiences here but a lot share the same elements so I'll make it kind of brief.

I was born-in, my mom studied with someone before getting baptized. Lived the life, went to meetings, I was a decent JW kid. In high school, I didn't really do anything against the borg other than watch porn and stuff like everyone does, didn't feel so bad because I said I would stop when I'm done being a teen. I had a JW friend group outside school and a ""worldly"" friend group in school. I didn't get to do tons of fun stuff like dating and drugs and stuff but I played games with my friends in both groups and it was fun.

I had the plan to pioneer after graduating but the elders never told me I had to have a good field service record previously to qualify for it. My hours were bad so I was turned down. Praise Jah!

I ended up going to a school near my house (only one parent was in the truth) and didn't really talk to anyone there, mostly chilled with jdub friends (didn't even have that many). Long story short, I was wronged by one of my ""friends"" who by doing this also did an act worthy of disfellowshipping.

In this situation, I saw how fucked up the organization is. He was the son of an elder in the congregation and his family and he was forgiven. He lied, and his dad covered him. The truth ended up coming out so he lost his privileges (readings, sound duty, territory).

I was pretty upset by this, as if it were me I would've been DF'd on the spot. I knew /r/exjw was a thing as I've been on reddit for like 5 years prior. I checked it out, heard about the UN NGO stuff and other shit that we all know to be true and started fading (I actually just stopped going, lol).

I've realized a couple of things - firstly, I never believed it! I deluded myself into doing it somehow, but I always tried to get out of going to meetings and service. Personal Study never happened, I did it all for recognition to one-up ""friends"" and to get into a JW girl's pants :) (didn't end up happening though)

I find out the reason I stayed in the organization for so long was because I inadvertently deluded myself into getting rid of the cognitive dissonance I would have experienced if I wasn't so good at pushing aside the real truth (agnosticism/atheism for me). I still delude myself even today for different things, which boosts my self-esteem and lets me do things I wouldn't have otherwise. I'm an extremely self-centered and opportunistic person so it works well for me. Great skill to have, I ain't even *that* mad about wasting my teenager-hood other than no gf and such.

Anyways... I'm doing really well right now. My career is great (internships during school), I'm making lots of friends at work and at school and life is good. My family is pretty much out, my dad was never in it to begin with. The elders keep on trying to call and visit me but it ain't happening, until now...

**start reading here for question**

At work I'm looking for a certain position for my next internship in the same company, and one of the people in charge of hiring me is - you guessed it - a Jdub elder in a different Jdub cong near me where I know his son. I went and talked to some managers who are working with the team I want to join and emailed my resume to them after, but the elder took me aside before I went back to my desk and told me to book a meeting for coffee with him. This is the first time I've talked to another JW in person and I assume they've been trying to get a hold of me, and this is their chance.

When he briefly took me aside, he said we would talk about some ""stuff"" and he off-handedly mentioned it would be mildly secular regarding his son who I know, but we both know what he wants to talk about.

I have the meeting booked in a couple of days. I chose the location to be inside the workplace at work hours at the communal coffee area, but I'm still worried about talking about religion. This person is in a position of power over me and probably has a say in whether I should be hired or not.

What do I say? I am very interested in this position but I know he will bring it up. I prefer not to live a lie, because I get drunk and shoot shit with the guys at work. What do I say if he brings up why I don't go to the meetings anymore?"

332s6s,1,2015-04-18,School &amp; life advice,vFlorentino,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/332s6s/school_life_advice/,"Hi, I have no real friends to talk to, or peers who I feel close to. I kind of just need to discuss a few things and I hope some of you can help me out here.

I am 24, I've been in community college for about 5 years now, part time for the last 2. I've wanted to study architecture and pursue a career in design. Out of high school I wasn't equipped to go right into a University; I had no portfolio prepared, and had average/poor grades, and I just didn't understand the education system. I seriously learned a lot in CC, and had good, meaningful relationships with some of my professors. I felt like I was prepared to transfer out and move on with my education. I wanted to get on with my life and get a degree already. I was motivated and felt that my hopes could be achieved.

I just found out yesterday that I didn't get accepted into UCLA. It was the only school I applied for. I had a 3.2 GPA with a good portfolio and 2 years of volunteer work at a small architecture office. I think I can say that I genuinely tried to get accepted.

I guess what I'm getting at is that I don't think I'm a good student. I'm not sure how else to put it, but I don't seem to work well with the school system. It's difficult to focus, difficult to care. I don't know if I'm lazy or just stupid. In the back of my head, I just keep wondering if I tried my best. Maybe I didn't. Maybe my best just isn't good enough for school. And if I didn't try my best, is it worth trying anymore, or should I just cut my losses and try something else. Maybe I'm not a thinker, maybe I'm just a worker.

But I seriously love to learn, and find most meaning in doing that. I want to know things, I want to be informed. But something about school just kills it for me. The books, the formality, the classrooms, and even the students sometimes. The teachers are mostly great, and I can see the humanity behind them, the lives they've lived and things they care about. A lot of the time I just wish I could work with them, 1-on-1, on site, and learn through practice and work and apprenticeship.

I seriously tried these last few years. I had a rocky start, but in the last 2-3 years I joined a club, audited classes with professors I cared about and wanted to learn more from, made up bad grades, and volunteered a lot of my time as an intern so that I could learn more about the field of architecture/design.

If you're still reading by now, thanks so much for your patience. I really have no one else to talk to, so really, thank you.

I think I know the core of my sadness right now. It's that I have nothing to contribute to the world. I have no qualifications, no knowledge to impart, nothing to give. I want to work, I want to research and contribute to people's lives. Architecture doesn't seem to be doing that for me. After years of pursuing it, I'm not sure I want to be in that field anymore. Office-life isn't fulfilling; being a consumer isn't fulfilling either. Being outside, however, is where I feel clear and normal. Working with nature, understanding it, growing life, and giving to others who can live off of it. That feels more meaningful to me.

I don't know what I'm good at. I don't know what I am capable of. I'm okay at design, I'm okay at being a student. I don't feel I'm good at being a person, though. Most times I don't feel qualified to even have a conversation with somebody. What's there to talk about? What do I even know? It's hard to care about the world, the politics, the qualifications, resumes, college, texts after texts of reading material. This post is a mess, I'm real sorry for that. And again, thanks for sticking around, the one or two who have made it this far down.

So yeah, 5 years gone by. Telling people and my huge family that I want to be an architect, but really I just want to find purpose. I just don't seem to fit well anywhere. I have no real skills, no confidence in myself. I don't connect with people, with my family. I do care, though. I want to stand up and shake it all off and look forward. I want to work; I want to have hope for something better. I just don't know where or how to go about it. I don't know where I belong.

I'm not sad that I didn't get into UCLA. I'm sad that my best attempt to move forward wasn't good enough. I'm sad that maybe the life of a scholar was never for me. And I'm sad that after 5 years I still feel just as scared and lost as after leaving high school. Learning and expanding my horizons through the educational system; maybe I'm not that person.

I am considering finding work through the wwoof program. It seems more fulfilling than what I have going on right now. I can get out of my parent's home and pull my own weight for a while. I hate living with the guilt, seeing the people who are helping me and not being able to help them back.

Yes, this post does have an ending. And really, thank you for reading through it all if you did. I know this post was more of a rant; I don't mind if it's deleted or ignored, I'm just glad I made the time to express what I'm going through. Your advice is very appreciated though.

And a tl,dr: 5 years of community college, still just as lost as before. Maybe school=no."

332uts,12,2015-04-18,Very Big Interview on Monday. Need Tips ASAP.,basedyeezy123,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/332uts/very_big_interview_on_monday_need_tips_asap/,"Hello all of you,

After applying to over a hundred jobs, I was able to finally secure myself a job interview (45-60 minutes!) for a summer  finance internship at a fortune 100 company. I'm extremely nervous right now as I feel like this job is a great opportunity to jump start my future career. 

I have read many of the top threads and noted as many tips as I could, but I am still extremely nervous about this due to the lack that I lack experience and I am not a great speaker. Here are my concerns and tips would be greatly appreciated.

- HR and the job requirements asked me if I knew how to use advanced Excel functions. I said yes because I'm desperate for a summer internship and I have always planned to learn Excel after exams or after I receive a job offer. The problem is that my interview lasts for such a long time (45-60 mins), I feel like I'm going to be tested on Excel. I am really short on time right now as I have 2 back-to-back exams on Tuesday while my job interview is on Monday.

**NOTE:** I'm not a complete beginner in Excel. I have experience with it from my finance courses, I just haven't been introduced to advanced functions such as Macros/Pivot tables (the ones that will probably be important for this job)

- I am not a real great speaker and I tend to stutter when I am unprepared of what to say. I tend to be a lot better speaker when I know exactly what to say since I don't really have to think about what to say. In other words, I talk faster than I can think which leads to my speech impediment.

**A bit about myself**: I am a student in an accounting and finance program who is going to specialize in accounting. my GPA isnt terrible, but it's not something that's really exceptional either. I'm definitely above average.

I have not much experience other than a bit of bookkeeping that I do once/twice a month recently.I volunteered for the university tax clinic where I prepared tax returns for students free of charge.

All other work experience is retail, not much related to the job position.

**Things that I have done**

* Researched the company and the interviewers. One of them is an alumni of my university. 
* Dressing sharp. I'm an avid follower of MFA. I'm wearing a tailored navy suit, burgundy tie, white dress shirt, matching coffee oxford shoes and belt
* I have prepared myself for the basic questions and will rehearse them to myself so I attempt to mitigate my problems speaking under pressure. For example, I have answers for ""What is your greatest weakness"", ""Tell me about yourself"", etc
* Physical copies of my resume to bring to the interview
* Questions I will ask at the end of the interview will be: ""Why do you like working for this company?"", ""What would the typical day in this position be?"", and lastly ""How is success measured in this company?""


That's all I can think of right now. I'm extremely nervous right now and being able to work at this company even for just 4 months would be a real dream come true.

Thanks

I'm currently doing my internship in an IT company. I've been there for the past month and a half. During that time, i didn't really have meaningful conversations with the people in my department. The thing is, im the youngest there. All of my office mates are at least 30 years old. I feel inadequate and not having anything in common with them. They've tried to get me be a more outspoken person but they just did it in a snarky and a bit condescending way. I acknowledged that fact and I've been a bit better in speaking with them,  but it doesn't go far from that. Throughout the internship, i ate lunch alone. This most probably made them think that I'm arrogant and a loner. In reality, I'm scared about asking to join lunch with them. 

I've spoken with my parents and they said that maybe i wasn't in the same mindset as them. All this while, they were focusing on finishing a project. I'm not involved with it. Because of that, i didn't have any conversations with them, not small talks at least.

Do you guys have any ideas on how to overcome this problem? I have at least another month to make them change their mind about me and i want to at least go out on a good note.

Software engineering student,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/333omx/i_dont_know_if_i_can_make_it_software_engineering/,"Hi Reddit. I've been feeling really anxious the past few days and I just need some advice or help or something.

Basically I just don't know where I'm going and I fear living a life of unhappiness and anxiety. Some background info:

* Starting my 4th year of software engineering. Should've been my last year but will need 5 years to graduate
* Currently studying abroad for a semester in Asia
* Early 20s, F

I honestly don't know where to start so sorry if the following sentences seem a bit disorganized. Basically I'm stressing over a lot of things. I've never been the typical computer science student and I feel like companies only value hard-core computer geeks that know everything about everything. I like coding but once I'm done with homework, I don't head home to code more, unlike most of my classmates who have tons of personal projects to showcase. I put on my resume that I'm in a music committee, that I'm studying abroad, that I work part-time and that I do a lot of sports, but no company ever asks me about that. I feel so frustrated that nothing that I do except for code is valued.

I have a 3.5 GPA (yay, I guess) and even got a scholarship because of it. But I feel like I'm such an idiot even though my grades are good. I feel like I'm that example of the person that's good in theory but sucks in practice. I always have trouble with technical questions during interviews. Homework always takes a really long time. Recently a prof recommended me to a really good company (think something like Microsoft) and I got an interview very quickly. Of course I didn't get an internship and I'm so embarrassed because apparently, everyone this prof has recommended got a job. Everyone said ""Oh, you're a girl, you have even more chances of getting it"" (something I fucking hate hearing. I want to get hired for my skills, not for my vag) and I wish I could just hide the fact I'm a girl. I've never felt like it was a plus for me, personally.

Up to now I have done 2 internships for a total of 12 months. I fucking hated them. They weren't in the fields that attract me (which are web design, video games, visual/digital design). Because I don't have any experience in these fields (and no personal projects because I simply don't have the time with work and involvement at school), I feel like I'll never be able to land a job in them. I dread having to work in a boring company that does boring stuff. Even then, I'm afraid I won't be able to find a job because they'll judge me: ""what, no personal projects? Probably went abroad to party. Kind of weird she needed 5 years to finish her degree."" 

All of these factors just make me dread finishing my degree and entering ""real life"". I know it would be stupid to drop school now when I only have two semesters left, but I feel like I'll never find a job in my dream companies and will be miserable forever. I hate to be that kind of person, I want to feel like I have my life under control and that I can do whatever I want, but right now I feel like the worst programmer that has ever been and the worst candidate companies have ever interviewed. Please help me. I hope I'm wrong and that I'm just overreacting.

333qcb,0,2015-04-19,"Low GPA, good GRE -- any chance at top schools?",Dro133,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/333qcb/low_gpa_good_gre_any_chance_at_top_schools/,"A little bit of background on me -- I have considered myself ""pre-med"" for the past 6 or so years, but after one unsuccessful application cycle and another cycle looming, I'm considering a potential change in my future career path and applying to Ph.D programs instead. Here are my stats as of now: 

- 3.3 undergrad GPA (Top 15 school, neuroscience BA)
- 33 MCAT
- GRE: 164 verbal, 161 quant
- Masters GPA: 4.0 (state school, cell biology MS)
- Research experience: I had various internships/grunt work during undergrad, got one abstract out of it (does that even count?). The research I did during my masters was much more substantial and culminated in a solid thesis, although I didn't get published (I probably could have published had I stayed another year and furthered my project, but being pre-med, I was in a hurry to finish my courses, graduate and move on to the next thing). 

After finishing my masters, I began an internship at a well-known tech company in a group that is involved in the bioinformatics field. During my time here, I have picked up some programming skills and developed an interest in combining biology with technology/computation. As a result, I am thinking of applying to bioinformatics or biomedical engineering Ph.D programs. I've also been collaborating with researchers at a nearby medical school, and one of the projects I'm working on might lead to a publication. 

My question is, do I have a shot at any of the big-name schools with my numbers/lack of publishing record? I understand that in many cases, the quality of training one receives can be more lab-dependent than school-dependent; however, I would like to keep my options open in terms of going into industry someday, and I have heard (anecdotally) that the name of the school can go a long way in that sector. I would really appreciate any input!

I decided to accept a promotion last summer which was a giant mistake. This promotion got my pay bumped up by a couple bucks, and for a 20 year old working through college that's not terrible. 

Except when I moved here for college I didn't have any friends. I got job at the same fast food place that I worked for in high school, and just figured it'd be an easy transition because same shit different place. I. WAS. WRONG. 

In my old store I had friends, management was supportive of each other, and if somebody got in your face and cussed you out they were told to leave. Whether that was a worker or a customer. And I can easily say that is not the case whatsoever at this store. When I took the promotion, the people who were my only friends that I had made while in college were work friends. And they immediately turned their backs on me, even though leading up to this they were openly supportive and seemed happy for me.

Shortly after getting through my training and I'm on my own for shifts as a manager, other management quit supporting me quite as much. As in an employee got in my face, threatened, and cussed me out. This man is at least twice my size. And he did this with my GM there, and all my GM did was told me not to talk to him the rest of the night. No disciplinary action. So big surprise that said male employee was escorted off the premises by the cops today for trying to do the same to my GM today. 

But this isn't the only incident. Three other employees have cussed me out and the like. I haven't been given access to discipline them yet (6 months later wtf.) and so there's been nothing done. This is even with me leaving messages for my fellow managers about the problems I'm having. This is after my GM asking about why the shifts that I'm in charge of don't go smoothly. 

Well all the while, my best friend comes to college (she's a year behind me) and she comes to work at my store. Management loves her and she takes a management position, however I think she can stay at a level where she won't be running shifts like me. Which literally makes all the difference in the world. She won't have to deal with blatant disrespect by employees above her and under her. Well because she too got promoted, said former work friends become vicious with her as well. Eventually one of them just completely walks out midshift and quits showing up to shifts altogether and cites me as reason without ever being actual conflict before this. I'm at a loss because these were people that I trusted as friends, but this isn't middle school and I don't need people like that. Because of this girl just randomly like quitting, my higher up managers get pissed at me, as if I forced her to leave. But she was a big silent complainer about this store. She'd always have problems but never voice them. So I try to voice my problems with management. 

My supervisors are yellers. It's kind of daunting to work with, and it's intimidating to try and communicate with them. Well I've finally just kind of gotten sick of it. I've been a manager for about 9 months now, and this place just isn't working out. But if I put in my two weeks they'll just get offended. Numerous employees before me have put in their two weeks and have been given bad reviews to future employers, even if they supposedly left on good terms. The only times this has not happened is when an employee left for college, or a college degree based job/internship. Well I've been applying to internships and I think I got one, but on top of that I applied to some other jobs and I got one which is in retail. 

The other job makes just minimum wage again, but I know that I'll be happier. I just don't know what do. Do I put my two weeks in and possibly burn the bridge? Should I be concerned that his could blow onto my bestfriend/roommate (we live together)? Should I just say to hell with it and do what I feel I need to do for myself? I get so stressed with this job between vicious customers, management that just blatantly disrespect each other face to face and behind each other's backs, and then workers who feel it's okay to threaten and cuss at me. 

This has gotten to the point that I'm so stressed between a full course load, a student leadership position at school, and work that I've sought out counseling through my uni. I just can't anymore. It's breaking me. And I know I sound like I'm whining, but most nights I just come home and cry. It's a type of job you can't care about, but I don't like to half ass things. I do my best and always try and keep a good work ethic. Now I'm just driving myself crazy because it seems to be all I can think about, and all that I obsess about. I dream of the day I can leave, but I can't create a hostile workplace for my best friend. And I feel that for some weird reason I owe it to my GM who doesn't even give me support to stay because a lot of people are quitting (because management doesn't keep promises like days off), and they promoted me. 

I feel as if I should be grateful, but it's gotten bad enough my adviser for school held an intervention and made me look into applying at other jobs and working at the school if I had to. Jesus.

It's been a fun thing to do on the weekends and in my free time. However, something has recently came up. I haven't had any issues before this. 

The competition I mentioned is at the end of the school year. It's about 6 weeks away and one of the last few things that needed to be considered was who would go to compete. Long story short: 3 spots open for our sub-team, 4 of us, I got the short end of the stick. 

I'm kind of heartbroken and frustrated. Not so much because I wouldn't be going (I wouldn't have been able to go because of an internship this summer), but because no one brought it up to me. I had to ask. It makes me feel like I'm not an equal member of the team. 

Although he was sincere and apologetic, my software lead wasn't exactly forthright about the issue. Granted, if you had to ask me who should go, I would have chosen the same people. Their reponsibilities seemed to be greater than mine. My two team members (who would be going) remained silent while he spoke with me. I wasn't in the mood to make a big deal about it. To me, it seemed so painfully obvious that this wasn't right. I had to walk out from time to time to take a breather. My interest in the project has pretty much plummeted. 

What should I do?

333yo3,4,2015-04-19,I [19 F] broke up with my long distance boyfriend [19 M] of 1.5 years. He wants to try to get back together in a year.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/333yo3/i_19_f_broke_up_with_my_long_distance_boyfriend/,"I'll start with a brief summary of our relationship. We met in middle school and were best friends. Before high school, his family moved to another state (around 3 hours away). We kept in touch through facebook and kept that friendship alive, he was the person I'd turn to when I felt sad and just needed someone to distract me. Our conversations got pretty flirty, though we never meant anything by it. We would meet up whenever we could, about once a year, and enjoyed every visit.

I ended up choosing a college near his new hometown, and he went pretty far away (3 hour flight) for a 2-year college. The summer before freshman year, we had internships in the same city, and started going out together. Neither of us really wanted a relationship at this point, the thought of trying to stay in a long distance relationship scared us. So we just went out and had fun, usually getting lunch together then going out and trying something new (museums, movies, laser tag, rock climbing, etc.) Sometimes we'd just go to his apartment and watch tv and talk. There was incredible sexual tension, but we ignored it. At the end of the summer, we said our tearful goodbyes and headed off to college.

We missed each other a lot, and after a few weeks started videocalling regularly, just to talk about our lives. We built up to the point where we were calling every night, and throughout the day I would look forward to hearing the skype ""log in"" noise that night. We were deeply in love, and even though we didn't want to do long distance, we had no choice. He came home once every two months for a weekend or two, and I would always spend as much time with him as I could. A few months in, we started having sex, and it was mind-blowing. Everything about the relationship was perfect. 

Later that year, I felt that I wasn't missing him as much as I usually do. I felt the love that I had for him fading. These moments wouldn't last long, but it happened each time he left. I shook it off, telling myself that our time together was perfect, and everything I'd want in a relationship. When he jokingly mentioned spending the rest of our lives together, I just thought that I would like nothing more than that. I wished he was serious about it (he might've been, but it's not always obvious when he's joking). 

We spent the summer together again (planned this time) and it was the best summer of my life. I had never been so happy at any point in my life. I loved everything about him, from waking up in the morning and seeing him next to me to going to sleep at night in his arms. When August came, I started dreading the day he'd have to leave again.

The next few months, I started feeling the love fade, more and more. It got to the point where I couldn't ignore it. I didn't see myself being able to stay with him for another year, especially since I didn't know where he would go after college. It was unfair to lead him on, since I was losing feelings for him. I didn't want to let it build and cause a bad breakup... I just wanted us to go back to being friends, like we were in high school. Three months ago, I called him and told him we should break up. He was completely blindsided by this, and fought back initially, but agreed it was best for both of us because he also didn't want to lose the friendship. He made a few comments about trying again later, which worried me a little; I wasn't so sure that I'd ever feel that way about him again.

We agreed not to talk for two months, and try to use that time to separate the relationship from the friendship. During that time, I had some casual hookups with a guy at my school and he hooked up with a girl he met (or multiple, we haven't talked about what we did, I just got this from a mutual friend). It seemed like we were both over it and ready to be friends. That went well, and for the last month we both had what we wanted-- the friendship we missed so much during our time apart.

He's graduating soon, and taking a job in his hometown (where I go to college). We were talking about the job offer yesterday (he accepted this morning), and he said he wanted to try dating again once he moved back here.

Reddit, I don't know how to feel. The time I spent in that relationship was the happiest in my life. I've told him things about myself that I couldn't imagine saying to anyone else, even another long-term partner. During the breakup, I told him that if I could somehow love him again, get that initial spark back, I would want to marry him. We're both still (physically) attracted to each other, and we'll live in the same city for the next few years.

But I don't want to jeopardize the friendship. If he's asking me this, he still has feelings for me; if we date and it goes poorly, our friendship might not survive the second breakup.

Should I say no, and keep the friendship? Or say yes, and risk it all on the chance of an amazing relationship? Should I stop dating until he gets back?

**tl;dr**: Broke up with long-distance boyfriend because I lost feelings for him. He's moving close to me soon, and wants to try again. I don't know what to do."

I'm going to get paid hourly, plus a stipend for housing that I get to pocket since I live in the area. 


$18,400 seems like a lot of money to me and there's nothing I really want to buy. My family and I live in the Bay Area as do my grandparents, they live a block away from us. So once they're out I live in their house, and my old house becomes the new grandparents' house. (I love them, lack of emotion for brevity)


We also have as many cars as drivers, so no need to buy a car. My parents are trying to convince me to buy my mom's 1999 car from her though, which I totaled when I was 16 and was salvaged. I did do a lot of costly damage to the car, and so it makes sense why they'd want me to buy the car for $5,000 (Mercedes), but I feel like I could use the money more wisely to make all of our lives easier in the long run. I also am taking an extra semester to finish college, so could help pay for that. If you can't tell yet, I have an Eastern family-oriented personality so that adds some *spice* to the problem.


Should I invest the money in some fund and pull out after 5, 15, or 25 years?
Spend the money on things for the family i.e. new workout equipment, take the fam on a vacation, get a dog, get twenty-three dogs, or leave it in a savings account for a rainy day?



TL;DR

* 21 yo
* $18k
* pre-stable job in enlarging tech bubble
* no debt
* have house and car in suburbs
* Where do I insert the money?

No $$ needed,SmilingMango,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/3345z8/help_pay_for_my_study_abroad_airfare_in_full_with/,"Hi everyone, I'm currently a third year undergraduate college student majoring in Public Health Sciences. This summer, I will be studying abroad in Bali, Indonesia, where I will be interning with an NGO (non-governmental organization) to complete the fieldwork requirement for my major. It's a really wonderful program. I will spend 5 weeks getting hands-on experience doing what I love, exploring my career path, and developing my character. In addition, I will be traveling and exploring the beautiful island of Bali with my lovely girlfriend, Public Health professor, and a handful of other students who are also doing the program. In addition to the internship, there will, of course, be lots of fun activities throughout the weekdays and weekends as well as many tourist attractions. I'm 20, I live in the US, and I've never been outside of the country! It's a great opportunity for me to step out of my comfort zone, and I really believe that there's so much out there that I can learn and grow from. What a way to spend my summer, right? 

Here's the thing: traveling 9000+ miles is *expensive*. Fortunately, I'm currently partaking in a scholarship competition where the grand prize winner will receive FREE round-trip airfare to his/her study abroad location of choice. My girlfriend and I worked together and created a video that I believe embodies three key aspects of international study: 1) Understand and appreciate cultural differences, 2) Be courageous and unafraid to get a little uncomfortable, and 3) Encourage students to be see the best in others. Although we both worked on the video together, I turned in the submission, and.. we made it to the Top 10! Now is where things get a little tough. I need your help, Reddit! The only way to win is to get the most Likes and Shares out of everyone else on the Top 10 on the Summit Global Facebook Page. Subsequently, the winner will receive the grand prize (allow me to reiterate), which is a fully paid-for plane ticket to Bali and back to the US. This will definitely help alleviate the financial burden on my girlfriend and I.

334ft6,5,2015-04-19,Which school should I attend?,allofthebytes,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/334ft6/which_school_should_i_attend/,"After a couple of years at a big state school, I was suspended because of poor grades, mostly because of my laziness and poor study habits. I've been attending a community college since and I have good grades from the cc. Should I apply back to the big state school? The reason I attended that school in the first place was because it is in a tech hub and it is the biggest engineering school (which includes CS) in the state, I figured I could find some part-time internships while finishing my degree. The thing about that school is I'll still have the super low GPA (under 2.0) when I go back to that school and I don't know if I could bring it back up to something respectable.

My other option is to start fresh at my local university. I could live at my parents' place while going to school there, which will save me some money. But, a lot of the CS classes I took at the big state school might not transfer for their CS program but i'm guessing my gen-eds will transfer, so I'll start over on the CS classes again. The local university is also on a somewhat small city with few Software Engineer jobs so my best chances for internships would be during the summers only. Also, since it's a no-name university, recruitment at the career fairs might be weaker compared to the big state school"

**44,480 villagers** spamming ""A"" for **4 years!**

You open your eyes and find yourself on a train going.... where? You're not quite sure. In the corner of your eye you see a blue and white cat eyeing you up, before getting up and sidling towards you. He asks you for the time. You tell him it's about 2:55PM. He asks if he can sit across from you. You still don't know where you're going or who this animal is. For some reason, this all seems perfectly normal to you.  He asks for your name. You repeat it back to him. You remark that you think it's quite a cute name. He agrees, saying he thinks you're a ""pretty cool gal."" Wait a minute. You're a guy. You correct him, resulting in him apologising and confirming your gender one final time. He asks you where you're going. You realize you get to *choose* where you're going. You tell him a generic town name, not realizing this is one of the most important decisions you'll ever make.

He shows you a map of the town you claimed to be going to and you confirm the map is accurate. Suddenly, a chime plays and the train comes to a halt. You get off the train after saying goodbye to the cat and exit the train station. A group of animals await your arrival. In hushed voices, they discuss something before shouting greetings towards you. A dog starts yapping things to you about your mayorship. You're quite confused. You still don't know who any of these animals are. After dwelling in thought for a second, it occurs to you that there was a monkey driving the train you were on a minute ago, and that everyone around you is an animal of some kind. The dog whisks you away to the town hall, yaps some more things you don't really listen to, then tells you to head up to a real estate agent in the upper part of town. Before you take your leave, she subtly mentions that you are now officially the mayor of the town.

You head up to the train station where you arrived not minutes ago and cross the tracks. You spot a unit named ""Nook's Homes"" and head inside. An overly enthusiastic raccoon somehow sells you a house and you now have a temporary home in the form of a tent and a sizable mortgage in the town's official currency, bells.

It's been about a year since you arrived in the town. You're still somehow the mayor. You've completed quite a few projects in the town, like a coffee shop *( where you now work, )* some benches, a campsite and a dream suite. Your bell count is a number too big for you to be able to count. You've been to a tropical island where you met the former mayor and earned some sweet rewards. You've caught every bug and fish in the book. You've paid off your mortgage and have started paying mansion tax due to the sheer size of your house. You think you've finally made it.


In reality, you're just getting started.

Welcome to the life-sucking void that is Animal Crossing.




/r/AnimalCrossing is a tight-knit community revolving around the Nintendo game, Animal Crossing. With posts ranging from [artistic interpretations](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/225jxb/recreated_a_beautiful_drawing_as_best_as_i_could/) to [frog death threats](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1gyjdw/extra_bells/). Everyone is always [happy to help](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/30nin5/do_villagers_always_move_into_the_same_plot/) with any questions, concerns -- or anything really. Even the villagers [chip in](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/30n4bw/so_i_sent_a_letter_to_this_villager_when_i_was/) with your problems sometimes. Sister subreddits include /r/ACTrade, ( allows for easy organising of item trading ) /r/ACTurnips, ( helps you to top the stalk market ) /r/DreamCrossing ( to visit others towns ) and /r/RateMyMayor ( a quite clever rating system used to determine the legitimacy of individual players, determined by ratings left by other players. ) Of course, as with every subreddit, /r/AnimalCrossing has [its](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1gvs99/not_what_i_thought_it_was/) [own](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1h8tyh/oh_retail_xpost_from_rgaming/) [humour](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1gklwi/told_my_wife_to_visit_my_house_and_lie_on_the_bed/). One of the best parts of Animal Crossing is the level of customization given to you in your house. With that in mind, there [certainly](http://imgur.com/a/X3M98) [isn't a](http://imgur.com/a/yOGEd) [shortage](http://i.imgur.com/trp089x.jpg) [of inspiration](http://imgur.com/a/Pvyez) [for your](http://imgur.com/a/zu9cc) [latest crib](http://imgur.com/a/uPwZ3)! 



I sat down the lovely moderators for a coffee at the roost and asked some questions.



&gt; #1. Tell us a bit about yourself!

 &gt;&gt; **/u/LadyDrac**  I'm a late 20-something residing in the state of Washington who enjoys Animal Crossing just a wee bit too much. My dog is learning Pavlovian theory for nerds. The sound of my DS closing makes him extremely excitable because he knows that it means it's finally time to go play outside or do something fun together. Husband has also started to become trained and now knows to take a detour through the McDonalds when we drive by for ""that streetpass thing."" I would make Kapp'n proud with my job in the cruise industry and I only wish I had a ship of my own to christen as the Cucumber of the Seas.

&gt; #2. How did you initially get involved in the /r/AnimalCrossing community?

 &gt;&gt; **/u/LadyDrac**  I would not be happy with my game until I had obtained everything... and part of everything was grabbing an elusive 7-11 set before duping was commonplace. Naturally, Reddit was the place to come! Eventually, someone decided it would be a good idea to make me a mod since I was always involved with answering peoples' questions about the game or sharing new information based on what I had learned in my own game or research I had done.

 &gt;&gt; **/u/E_lucas**  I started this subreddit a while back when talking with another redditor around /r/gaming or something, and we realized there was no Animal Crossing sub. It was started then had absolutely no community for a year or so. Began to pick up around the launch of New Leaf, and even those with previous iterations only discovered the sub late (and now their online capability has been shut down ;_;)

&gt; #3. If you have one, what is your favourite post of all time on /r/AnimalCrossing?

 &gt;&gt; **/u/LadyDrac**  It's too hard to limit two years of participation down to a single post. There have been so many posts here that have restored my faith in the goodness of others, made me laugh hard enough that I couldn't breathe, or impressed me with a skill or talent that truly took dedication to master. Each post here truly captures that so many different people with so many different interests and so many different play styles can still come together as a community over something as simple as a video game.

 &gt;&gt; **/u/E_lucas**  I don't think it's possible to pick a single post that stands out. My favourites will always be fan art and comics. You can almost project your own emotions on to how people interact with their villagers. Everyone constantly talks about their ""dreamies"" and their best possible population. It's hard to explain the connections you make with the NPC's, but they have so much personality that they become a huge part of what the game is. When people put down on paper how they feel when a villager does something awesome, or dumb, or moves away, everyone who plays AC can relate.

&gt; #4. A very important question; who is your favourite villager ( or other character! ) in Animal Crossing?

 &gt;&gt; **/u/LadyDrac**  There are too many characters that I truly enjoy to pick just one so I guess I will share my top three favorites. I'll start with the NPCs first. Phyllis is probably my all-time favorite just because her snarky remarks just crack me up. She's admittedly lost some bite in New Leaf so I really miss the ""real"" Phyllis from games past but I can understand why Nintendo made the effort to tone her down... children really wouldn't understand the ""disgruntled postal worker"" vibe she gives off. Next up, I have to admit Celeste is just too adorable for her own good and is probably my favorite ""sweet"" character to balance out Phyllis' bite. She is just so beyond cute in the Animal Crossing Movie that if I lived in the town, I would probably spend a lot of my time in the museum with her! For my favorite villager character, I have to admit Vesta has been my favorite for a while now. She loves to sew and craft just like me and she always seems to be positive even if it's a crummy, rainy day.

 &gt;&gt; **/u/E_lucas**  Genji is my favourite villager and gym bro, Brewster, because I'm a coffee addict, and Pascal, because he's just so chill.. maan. Of course KK also has a special place in my heart, but that's a given for everyone.

&gt; #5. Is there anything else you'd like to share?

 &gt;&gt; **/u/LadyDrac**  I guess I'll end this by saying I am so proud to be part of such a caring community and I feel honored that so many people (around the world even!) look to me for help or reliable knowledge in the game. I am honestly just a girl behind the screen with an intense love for Animal Crossing but so many people have put their faith in me to provide accurate information and keep the community running smoothly. It's just very humbling and I very much appreciate all of the support and encouragement I have received from the community. Lastly, I would encourage anyone who checks out /r/AnimalCrossing to also please check out and support our sister communities linked in our sub wiki. We all work together to truly make the Animal Crossing Reddit community a safe and enjoyable place and they deserve just as much credit, if not more, for making this little corner of Reddit worthwhile &lt;3

 &gt;&gt; **/u/E_lucas**  I just want to shoutout to the Animal Crossing community as a whole. I don't think there is a gaming community out there who is as nice and ready to help out a fellow villager/mayor at any moment. From all the boards, IRC's, etc. that I've been a part of over the years, the community really becomes as much as a village as those in our games.

Now, excuse me whilst I go attend to my weeds.

*writer's note: Hi! I'm Superburke -- a new intern at SROTD. I'm a something year old working as a full stack web developer for a relatively large corporation. My interests mainly include programming and gaming, so you'll probably see a lot on those subjects from me.

334vem,5,2015-04-19,Another Story,thegrasingsheep,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/334vem/another_story/,"Hi guys,

I am a 27y/o guy and currently t a private scholl becoming a game designer and i want to share the story of my life and the struggles I have and had to put up with.

I was a very smart kid and had pretty much perfect grades in elementary school. I was reading a lot of of books and liked classical music. I think you get the idea.

In 4th class my mother made my apply at two schools, comparable for Highschools. Changing to such a school in Germany is rare and resevered for the best pupils. In one of them the education would be completely on french after a couple years. The other one finished a year faster then usual. Even though the odds were very slim, I was allowed at both of them and chose the not french one.

My grades got worse at the first year (Not straights A's anymore) and i felt really, really ashamed. I tried to hide my reports. I remember I started to cry one year and my Mom got angry with me. She soon made me visit a psycologist, I was told because of my bad grades and still don't know the real reason to this day.

My grades still got worse. I did not learn an felt desperate when I had to do homework. The last years were really, really hard for me, especially since my best friend  school and I was to shy to find new friends. I hid on the toilets during long breakes, so noone could see I was alone. I did not dare to sit besides another scolar. I don't know how, but I still finished school.

I got told by my parents and my teachers that was behaving inapropiately. I felt like the ""bad child"" and started to look for people to talk to on the internet. I never touched on my low self esteem, though. I was envious on my little brother. I felt he always got more support then me and was actually a part of the family. For example he was an exchange student in the US for one year, I did not dare to ask for anything like that. He also was one year in New Zealand, again I did not even ask for any financial support for anything. Don't get me wrong, I really like him and knew it was not his fault.

After school I was doing civil service in a kindergarden. I was mostly cooking and cleaning up in the evening. I remember that that was the time I started to feel really tired after each day. I also became very lonely since there was noone in my age working there and I stayed to clean up after everyone left.

When I got home I just sat on the computer. My parents told me, I am lazy, since I really did not like doing chores or talking to them. I was drawing Comics, but had no chance to show them to a lot of people. I never had the feeling that anyone cared about me and what I did and had suicidal thoughts during that time.

After that was finished I left my Home to study in another city. I did not really care, what and where I just wanted to get away. I did not get money from my parents, but a bit from my grand parents. Until I got some support by the state I had used up everything I earned and had some moments where I could not even get money from the bank. Gladly I took take a loan from my best friend so that helped me through.

I did not finish university since I still did not learn and most of the stuff felt either to easy or not relevant for me. I did make some loose contacts, but no real friendships. Eventually I got to know my girlfriend, on the Internet. I was 21 and really neverous since I have never been with a girl. I did not know what to do. It felt weird, that someone liked me and wanted to be with me, too.

Since my father is working at a museum he did recommend me studing something in that direction. I did move in with my parents again and started an internship at a very small museum. Since my application at the university got rejected, I stayed and worked there for almost a year. I did not have a lot to do and was mostly drawing my comics at home.

During that time my gf visited me at my parents', that led to a lot of stress. They did not know how to deal with her and I was to nervous to properly introduce her. My father tried to kick her out of the house one day and never apologised for that.

Eventually I moved out and tried to get into graphics design. I enrolled for computer science at an university, mostly to pass time and thought that maybe I'd learn something useful. I was rejected at every graphics design school I applied for and did not know why. I made a portfolio-course whith a very good reputation, got decent feedback there, but did never even get in the second round of any application process. I took the rejection personally and became felt worthless.

Finally I decided to enroll at a private school for Game Developement as an artist. I took a loan from my girlfriends parents, to pay for it. My own parents got mad and I did not feel like I could explain my decision to them and talk. They told me I never earned money and stuff like that even though it was not true. The first year was very good, I was one of the best in class. But my grades got worse and I really felt desperate and unable to do anything. I visited a psychiatrist and went to a psychological clinic and was diagnosed with heavy depression. I stayed for about three months and it helped me a lot. Unfortunaly I did not show up for a couple day and got kicked.

I went back to the gaming school but still could not participate as I wanted, so that semester went to waste. The school proposed to me I changed from the art direction to the game design direction, which is mostly describing the systems in an abstrac way and figuring out, how everything in a game will work.

I really felt relieved doing that kind of work and it fit me. I was proud of my archievement and did better then I tought.

I am now in my final semester at that school and feel like I am good at that what I am doing. I work on more stuff then I have to and have fun learning and researching and feel that my intelligence is actually useful for once. I still have a ton of problems, but I feel like I can solve them one by one and do not have to run from everything.

Thanks for reading. Keep in mind that I am not a native English speaker, so escuse mistakes :) It was really hard for me writing that down, since some of the feels I had in the past came back up, but I feel relieved now.

I am insured for another month under my car insurance; I plan on importing the car to Canada soon after I arrive.
I have a bachelor's degree in mathematics from an American university.

We haven't yet applied for him to sponsor me. He's technically not done with engineering school and is finishing up with internships. Is he eligible to sponsor me?

I tried looking all this stuff up online but it can get confusing and I'm always worried that I'll miss something. It's a long drive so if I haven't done something important before I leave I'm screwed.

Thank you so much if you can help and please let me know if you need any more information!"
334wqp,1,2015-04-19,I [19 F] broke up with my long distance boyfriend [19 M] of 1.5 years. He wants to try to get back together in a year.,longdistance2174,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/334wqp/i_19_f_broke_up_with_my_long_distance_boyfriend/,"I'll start with a brief summary of our relationship. We met in middle school and were best friends. Before high school, his family moved to another state (around 3 hours away). We kept in touch through facebook and kept that friendship alive, he was the person I'd turn to when I felt sad and just needed someone to distract me. Our conversations got pretty flirty, though we never meant anything by it. We would meet up whenever we could, about once a year, and enjoyed every visit.

I ended up choosing a college near his new hometown, and he went pretty far away (3 hour flight) for a 2-year college. The summer before freshman year, we had internships in the same city, and started going out together. Neither of us really wanted a relationship at this point, the thought of trying to stay in a long distance relationship scared us. So we just went out and had fun, usually getting lunch together then going out and trying something new (museums, movies, laser tag, rock climbing, etc.) Sometimes we'd just go to his apartment and watch tv and talk. There was incredible sexual tension, but we ignored it. At the end of the summer, we said our tearful goodbyes and headed off to college.

We missed each other a lot, and after a few weeks started videocalling regularly, just to talk about our lives. We built up to the point where we were calling every night, and throughout the day I would look forward to hearing the skype ""log in"" noise that night. We were deeply in love, and even though we didn't want to do long distance, we had no choice. He came home once every two months for a weekend or two, and I would always spend as much time with him as I could. A few months in, we started having sex, and it was mind-blowing. Everything about the relationship was perfect. 

Later that year, I felt that I wasn't missing him as much as I usually do. I felt the love that I had for him fading. These moments wouldn't last long, but it happened each time he left. I didn't miss him, need him, as desperately as I did before. I shook it off, telling myself that our time together was perfect, and everything I'd want in a relationship. When he jokingly mentioned spending the rest of our lives together, I just thought that I would like nothing more than that. I wished he was serious about it (he might've been, but it's not always obvious when he's joking). 

We spent the summer together again (planned this time) and it was the best summer of my life. I had never been so happy at any point in my life. I loved everything about him, from waking up in the morning and seeing him next to me to going to sleep at night in his arms. When August came, I started dreading the day he'd have to leave again.

The next few months, I started feeling the love fade, more and more. It got to the point where I couldn't ignore it. I didn't see myself being able to stay with him for another year, especially since I didn't know where he would go after college. It was unfair to lead him on, since I was losing feelings for him. I didn't want to let it build and cause a bad breakup... I just wanted us to go back to being friends, like we were in high school. Three months ago, I called him and told him we should break up. He was completely blindsided by this, and fought back initially, but agreed it was best for both of us because he also didn't want to lose the friendship. He made a few comments about trying again later, which worried me a little; I wasn't so sure that I'd ever feel that way about him again.

We agreed not to talk for two months, and try to use that time to separate the relationship from the friendship. During that time, I had some casual hookups with a guy at my school and he's tried dating some girls at his school. It seemed like we were both over it and ready to be friends. That went well, and for the last month we both had what we wanted-- the friendship we missed so much during our time apart.

He's graduating soon, and taking a job in his hometown (where I go to college). We were talking about the job offer yesterday (he accepted this morning), and he said he wanted to try dating again once he moved back here.

Reddit, I don't know how to feel. The time I spent in that relationship was the happiest in my life. I've told him things about myself that I couldn't imagine saying to anyone else, even another long-term partner. During the breakup, I told him that if I could somehow love him again, get that initial spark back, I would want to marry him. We're both still (physically) attracted to each other, and we'll live in the same city for the next few years.

But I don't want to jeopardize the friendship. If he's asking me this, he still has feelings for me; if we date and it goes poorly, our friendship might not survive the second breakup.

Should I say no, and keep the friendship? Or say yes, and risk it all on the chance of an amazing relationship? Should I stop dating until he gets back?

**tl;dr**: Broke up with long-distance boyfriend because I lost feelings for him. He's moving close to me soon, and wants to try again. I don't know what to do."
33530c,9,2015-04-19,WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU EXPECT,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/33530c/what_the_fuck_did_you_expect/,"I love you friend, but sometimes, you're a fucking idiot. I wish I could express with words how much of an idiot you really are with this entire fucking issue. 

Last semester, you did the following:

- Browsed Tumblr

And that's really it. No friends besides me, my girlfriend, and your roommate. You had a profound sense of entitlement and expect the world to bend over backwards to accommodate you (""Wow this person didn't look at me when they made my burrito, I can't believe she would do that, what's her problem?""). You have self-pity up the ass. You pride yourself on your intelligence whilst immediately assuming your viewpoints to be absolutely correct. 

YOU LITERALLY SPENT THE ENTIRE LAST SEMESTER GETTING WORKED UP OVER POINTLESS NONSENSE, BROWSING THE SHIT OUT OF TUMBLR, AND WALLOWING IN SELF-PITY WHILE DOING NOTHING TO HELP YOURSELF.

So when you told me that a few months ago, my girlfriend approached you about this stuff, when I learned that my girlfriend tried to let you know that you were heading down to a bad, lonely place, and months later, you STILL feel like your ENTIRE FRIENDSHIP IS INVALIDATED BECAUSE IT WASN'T HER PLACE TO CRITICIZE AND SHE SHOULD MAKE TIME FOR YOU, WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU EXPECT ME TO SAY.

YOU KNOW MY GIRLFRIEND. YOU'VE BEEN FRIENDS WITH HER AS LONG AS I HAVE. I am biased, but *come the fuck on*. My girlfriend cares so much about other people that she plays the Sims 3 as a benevolent god.

I was going to kill a gnat the other day, and I asked my girlfriend if she was ok with me killing it. I was curious to see if she cared about something as insignificant as a gnat. I had to explain that a gnat was a bug, and she immediately became afraid of the gnat because it was a bug. When I showed her that the flying period hurt her, she was still afraid of it, yet didn't want me to kill it. ""It isn't hurting anyone. It's probably just hungry and wants food. Don't kill it unless it starts flying at our eyes or on our food or something"".

This is the girl that let you know you were in a bad place. The girl whose mission statement in life is literally ""I want to help people and make them happy"". 

Do you know *why* she did this? BECAUSE YOU WERE A COUCH BLOB WITH NO FRIENDS. Do you know *why* she had to explain that she didn't have time to help you? BECAUSE SHE HAS ACTUAL FUCKING PROBLEMS. THERE WERE SO MANY FUCKING THINGS GOING ON IN EVERY PART OF HER LIFE AND SHE GOT TIRED OF YOUR BULLSHIT. 

When my girlfriend has lived in an abusive household for her entire life, when she's been bullied and ostracized for seven years, when she's had to push through crippling anxiety on a daily basis, when she overslept for a midterm worth 10% of her grade and have to work your ass off to pass the class, when she had to deal with roommates who have screaming contests about the fucking *dishwasher* not being loaded, when she's had the umpteenth internship application get denied, it's hard to take your issues with the 7-11 woman being a bit rude seriously. My girlfriend has every reason to let you know that you were living in your own fucking world.

AND I COULDN'T HELP YOU EITHER, BECAUSE I HAVE ACTUAL FUCKING PROBLEMS. My uncle died, I was failing three classes, every piece of tech I had busted my ass for had broken, my roommate was a dick, and I gained seven pounds. Friend, do you know what happens if I fuck up with college? I *lose*. I have to find a way to pay a small mortgage with a minimum-wage job. YOU HAVE COLLEGE PAID OFF FOR YOU. You talk about having a cleaning lady like it's nothing; my mom's *job* is cleaning people's houses. 

It was *completely* your best friend's place to comment, in much kinder words than I would have, that you were becoming pathetic.

You fear change to such a degree that you still talk about your boyfriend at 12 and the guy who went on a date with you a year and a half ago. You live in the past because the future is uncomfortable and uncertain. You've told me that you've ""made your peace"" with my girlfriend not being as close to you as you thought. In other words, you would rather lose a friend because it's comfortable, rather than going out of your comfort zone for the sake of your friendship. 

I love you friend, but I am disappointed in you. I thought you were better than that.

My girlfriend passed the class, by the way. She got an 89."

I work at one of the big chains (if the name is necessary I can PM you). I've been here for 5 years as a tech, and recently got my intern license from the state (I start pharmacy school in August). 

I've told my district pharmacy supervisor that I have my intern license, and that I'd like to be upgraded in the system so that I can start collecting intern hours, as well as get the considerable increase in pay. 

The supervisor said he won't put me in the system as an intern until I start school, and that I should contact him again then. I have a couple concerns with this. First, I'm practicing (right word?) as a technician, yet I'm no longer registered as a tech in my state, I'm an intern. Second, most of my other future classmates have gotten their licenses and are collecting intern hours without a problem. Third, I'm missing out on a good amount of money by not being upgraded to an intern, which I'll need to pay rent and such. 

So my question is: do I have any way to challenge this decision? I'm not sure if there's a company policy or something I can refer to. The school I'll be attending made it seem like this wouldn't be an issue, yet for whatever reason I'm being blocked. 

Sorry for the long post, I'm just not sure where else to go, since my pharmacy manager in store can't upgrade me in the computer without the district pharmacy manager's approval. Thank you!"
335fiw,4,2015-04-19,Frustrated/Confused with job prospects: New Grad,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/335fiw/frustratedconfused_with_job_prospects_new_grad/,"Hey guys first post at reddit here,
I just graduated with my degree in computer science in Canada and have been feeling really frustrated with trying to get a job right now. Particularly a job with a company - I won't say the name for privacy reasons but its a Big Software company in the league of Microsoft, Apple etc. 

About me:
I completed an 8 month internship at a startup in my city and a 4 month stint with the CS department for a coding project to be integrated in the universities computer systems. I was also the system administrator for the CS Society at the university, maintaining our servers. 
I also took a part time job in technical support for the last 2 years at my university. Just to pay the bills and such. I took an 8 month break to work in my internship so its really 16 months. First part of my job was basically QA on technical issues with clients. 
However over the last 8 months I have been doing programming projects for the department I work technical support for. I made sure to put all that on my resume. In fact most of my accomplishments on my resume for the technical support job are about my programming projects. 
I completed some side projects on my own, nothing heavy weight and dibbled in mobile apps. 

At this particular company it seems I am only getting interviews for technical support roles. I applied for over 70 entry level software jobs there -over the last 2 years - many of which I was well qualified for. All without a single response or interview. I applied for only 5 technical support jobs for kicks and got 2 great interviews and 1 offer at a great salary. Its 65k and way higher than any starting offer a company in this region could offer. 

While i'm happy I got a well paying post graduate job, I feel really annoyed and frustrated that despite my good experience and relevant degree I just can't crack the software barrier at this company. To the point where I'm questioning whether something is wrong with me. 


Should I keep trying for a software job - I really don't like technical support I'd rather code - or take this one and hope I can later transfer positions internally in the company. I have other dev interviews for small/mid-sized company's that don't pay nearly as much as this offer. Only problem is this is very hard offer to turn down and I really want to work with this company because I see a lot of potential for growth in my career. 

**TL;DR**
I applied for a lot of positions at a company but only got ones in technical support. its frustrating. Should I keep trying to take the well paying technical support job for now. I have interviews in other companies but they don't offer as much as the company I want or seem to have the same momentum for growth"

I always seek out ""flow"" in life... anything that rewards me for continuous concentration. (like bicycling in a crowded city or a particular video game)  I get bored easily otherwise.  My ideal job is one that involves being ""in the zone"" regularly.  Is SE a good career path for someone like me? 

I'm aiming for a career that uses a fair amount of math and/or statistics and/or computer science, though am open to other ideas.  Biostatistics sounds really fulfilling, though I don't know if the day-to-day work as a statistician (or actuary, analyst, etc) tends to involve a lot more or less ""flow"" when compared to software engineering.  I love how SE sounds relatively meritocratic, and rewards continuous learning.  The problem solving aspect sounds great... I used to have a non-IT job that I'd brainstorm ideas/solutions for while in the shower, and I miss that.

I read from some of you here that some SE jobs are incredibly boring when compared to coding for fun.  I'm really afraid of that, and feel I won't know if I'm on the right path until after I get an internship or graduate.  The other day I read an SE here say that they have to regularly click on FB/Reddit while coding to keep their brain from drifting away during a monotonous coding task... that scares me.  I understand that most jobs in general involve a lot of boring work... but I'm hoping to choose a career that *relatively* minimizes that.  Could I avoid much of that by working towards the ""right"" SE jobs?  Any thoughts / comments would be really appreciated!"

I wonder how the time went from when I was younger. currently I am a sophomore mechanical engineering student at Binghamton University with a 2.65. I am lucky enough to have landed an internship at an Engineering Contracting Firm for the summer, but I still have to keep my grades up for the next two years. 

No, I don t have ADHD, but I take amphetamines semi-frequently to help me do the seemingly robotic calculations. My work ethic and school mindset has changed noticeably in the past few years, because I used to be very social, a loyal member of my high school track team, and also a recreational weed smoker. Life used to be pretty easy.

However, it seems sometimes that I am sacraficing a lot of weekends and social time for my degree, which I really don't mind. The only part that bothers me is the ""faith in the unknown"" which is assuming I will make a great salary once I graduate. Everyone has their stresses, and it can be hard growing up at times.

However, I still put my best foot forward with a smile on my face each day, partnered with the optimism needed to succeed in the field of engineering. I cannot help but ask others what their experience is within either engineering school, or an adderall dependence.

I am not against it if I can get busy quick and get some good experience. I have heard a few pay decent depending on the owner.

Anyway, I am VERY aware of burn out and injuries from working too much, too quickly. So how many hours do you recommend starting at per week? That is, if I even have an option.

I have only done (3) consecutive 1 hours with 30min breaks at our weekly school clinic as well as an 8 week internship of daily (4-6) 30min sports massages back to back. I seemed handled those fine as far as mental and physical fatigue.

10 hours/week over 3-4 days? Up to 20/week?

Help?",dating_idiot_,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/336clp/f25_future_spinster_school_teacher_has_never_been/,"(Using throwaway for this.)

Okay, so like the title says, I'll be 25 in a few weeks and while I do believe I want to be in a relationship, the idea of getting into one is incredibly stressful to me. For some background, growing up, I was never the type to fall head over heels for anyone, even in my crushes. They were usually fleeting and nothing I'd act on. My parents are together but have never shown intimacy at all, which probably doesn't help my views on dating. Also, I've always had self-esteem issues in regards to my weight (something I'm working on and have dropped ~20 pounds recently) but it's always been in the back of my mind that no one could possibly be attracted to me and therefore I'd dismiss the idea of dating. 

Through high school and college, I'd make excuses for why I wasn't dating ('too busy' 'internship is my focus' etc). Last year, I went on a date with a guy from OK Cupid, but never contacted him again after 2 dates even though he was a nice guy because I just wasn't as comfortable with intimacy as he was. We made out on the first date, which was something that made me really nervous because I hadn't even kissed someone before, and afterward I felt really uncomfortable about it. I don't know what my deal is. 

I'm a virgin, which causes me anxiety as well, as it combines my discomfort with my body and with the fact that I have zero relationship experience. I'm afraid if I tell a guy I'm a virgin, he'll lose interest because he'd be afraid I'll become the crazy clingy type. At the same time, since I'm a virgin, the idea of having sex is daunting and makes me nervous to move past a couple of dates because I fear after a certain point in adult relationships, sex is an expectation. (Maybe this is my blatant inexperience talking, though. What the hell do I know?) I feel like since I'm someone who doesn't fall easily for people, I need time to really figure out if I like someone. It seems like this is all way more complicated for me than it should be. 

Last night, I went to my friend's house for a party and after a few beers, was having a really good time joking around and making others laugh, which I enjoy.  There was a guy there who typically wouldn't be my type, but he really was hilarious and I enjoyed joking with him.

336fnt,31,2015-04-19,My [22F] ex left me [25M] after 2 years because I wasn't Indian,NopeNotMyChair,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/336fnt/my_22f_ex_left_me_25m_after_2_years_because_i/,"This is a long one.
Some backstory I first met her when she was an intern where I work currently. We went on a few dates and mutually decided that we'd start a formal relationship. I was her first everything (Kiss, boyfriend, etc.). Around our 6 month mark she tells me she loves me, and I felt that same so I say it back. As time rolls along I ask her why she hasn’t introduced me to her family. By this time she’s already met half of mine. She tell me that it’s because normally Indians don’t date and introducing me to them as her boyfriend would bring backlash. She instead suggests that she introduces me to them (Mother, brother, and sister) as her friend. Once they get used to the idea of me, then we can move on to telling them that we’re actually dating. I agree to this. Well, months passed and there wasn’t really any progress. They still only saw me as a friend. So I talked to her about it and she tells me that she is afraid that if she tells them the truth that they’ll be very angry at her. Then she starts tell me stories of her cousins who married outside of their race and who've been disowned by their immediate family. I’ve met both her sister and brother, who are very educated, and they seemed like level headed people who could see her and I as a non-issue as long as I myself am decent, educated, had a job etc. She also felt the same, to a degree. She finally told them that we were dating about a year into our relationship. The brother didn’t really have much to say other than he didn't think it was a good idea, the sister was neutral, and the mother was against it 100 percent. She told my ex, without knowing jack about me, that I was a bad guy and that I was going to cheat on her because that’s what American’s do. So my ex stopped talking to them about me and led them to believe that we were done.  

Fast-forward to 8 months later (over a year in the relationship). I planned a nice camping trip for us up north for the weekend. A day before the trip she calls me saying that he brother decided to come up to her place the same weekend to stay because he had something for work in the same area. She then says to me that that we can’t go and that should just be friends. Let’s just say that I was beyond pissed at this. We met that same weekend to talk about what just happened. She brought her brother, and I asked to speak with him so that he could see that I’m just a regular person. Needless to say he wasn’t having any of it. I could tell that my ex was affected by all of this. She felt like she was put in a position to choose, which I guess her family made her do. She even asked me secretly that she wanted to marry me one day. So after our meeting I assumed that she was going to try to talk to her family more about the situation. The next day her entire family came to our meet up and she tells me that she choose neither of us. She was going to spend less time with her family and no longer be in a relationship with me. Her family then came to me and verbally berates me and make her confirm to them that we are done. I should have left it there, but she asked apologized for everything and I took her back about a month later.

Fastfoward to now (2 years into the relationship). She left me last week for reasons that I find really hard to accept. It started by me talking about my feelings about recent things (lack of intimacy in the relationship, and lack of communication), she took this as me saying that she was doing things wrong and started making a lot of excuses about what I was saying. She said that she feels like we do this a lot… Talking about how I feel… She said that the lack of intimacy is due to the fact that she doesn’t know how we’re going to be together. She says that she has started listening to this Indian-American podcast recently it got her thinking about her future children. She says that she wants to be more in touch with her culture and wants a husband that can help her teach her child about Indian customs. She also wants to reconnect with her family. The people who berated me because I dared to love her. She has never brought this up until now. I told her that makes little sense. If she wants to teach her child about Indian culture, she can do that, and I’ve encouraged it. I’ve made every effort to learn about her culture as well. Apparently that’s not enough. I’ve treated her with respect, love, commitment, understanding, and patience all throughout this relationship. We did so much together, and I did so much for her. To just end it like that is just confusing to me. It’s almost like she didn’t care about me or how that would make me feel. I don’t even know what to tell my family. She didn’t want me because I was born the wrong race/culture? I just don’t know what to think.

TL;DR: Ex left me after 2 years because I wasn’t Indian. According to her I was perfect otherwise. I don't know what to think or how to accept this."
336iqc,11,2015-04-19,"Didn't get internship that was ""hand crafted"" for me. Completely devastated.",Tufox,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/336iqc/didnt_get_internship_that_was_hand_crafted_for_me/,"In June of 2013 I underwent a major surgery that required a medical implant. Later that summer I was in a domestic violence situation, which resulted in having to go back to the operating room for an emergency modification. The following week I began my semester as a transfer student at a prestigious business school. Midway through the semester I began experiencing horrible pain that wouldn't subside. My doctor took me back to the operating room one last time and replaced the implant, and that solved the problem. I later finished my semester, making dean's list in the process. After that surgery I became a huge advocate for my doctor and the surgical correction. I underwent a transformation becoming the person I always wanted to be. I have dedicated the last eighteen months to promoting  doctors, orchestrating webinars, building websites, and talking to patients. I've done all of this work pro bono because I care about my doctor and simply want to help people. Aside from school this is my life. 
In January I was informed about an internship position with the company who made my implant. From my understanding this position was ""Hand crafted"" for me as it would allow further development in my academic career while continuing to help the cause. I went through the four month interview process, complete with a 20 minute self presentation followed by four hours of in-person group interviews. This required extensive preparation like nothing I've ever done before. After waiting three weeks I found out that they gave the position to someone else who was a ""better fit"". They didn't offer much else in the way of feedback. This came as a huge blindside to everyone involved, including my doctor who I've become quite close with. Everyone was banking on this, and I am simply devastated. Now I have to figure out if I even want to be an advocate anymore and what I'm going to do with my summer, as I didn't apply for any other internships. This was supposed to be the ""full circle"". On top of it the company utilized one of my ideas that I spoke of during the interview. I'm still sitting here in disbelief that I didn't get the job.

TL;DR Didn't get the job "
336lye,6,2015-04-19,"Leasing my horse out for the first time, advice?",miosgoldenchance,Equestrian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Equestrian/comments/336lye/leasing_my_horse_out_for_the_first_time_advice/,"I've decided to lease my horse out for this summer. I have an internship and don't think I'll have time for him / don't want to move him to a barn I don't know at all. I asked my former trainer if she had any use for him and she says she has a nice girl riding for her that wants something to show hunter hack on this summer.

Although I haven't shown in several years and my horse isn't in show shape, I think they would do okay assuming she's not trying to go to AQHA World or whatever. I trust my former trainer completely, and she would be giving weekly lessons, have him at her barn and supervise all shows.

So I'm basically looking for advice on a couple of things:

1. Sharing / separation anxiety. This horse is literally my baby, I have had him with me everywhere I've gone for 9 years. I am not ashamed to admit I am a crazy overprotective horse mom - I'm going to vet school basically because of this animal. I love my trainer and I do trust her but how do you deal with letting someone else take care of your horse?
2. Lease agreements! Does anyone have any example contracts or know of good resources to find contracts? I will feel a lot better if I have a well written, well thought out lease agreement. Or any advice on things to take under consideration while writing the agreement.

Thanks and any other advice is welcome!"
336mpk,20,2015-04-19,"4.0 Computer Science CC student here, got rejected from transferring to UC Davis and UC San Diego and looking for advice.",NeedCS_CareerAdvice,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/336mpk/40_computer_science_cc_student_here_got_rejected/,"Hey guys. Recently both Davis and San Diego's admission decisions came out and I was waitlisted for both. I know UC San Diego's CS program is top-notch and also impacted so I wasn't that surprised to get waitlisted, but when I saw that I was waitlisted for Davis I was absolutely devastated and quite frankly shocked as this was my fall-back. The only reason I'm thinking that I got waitlisted for Davis is because I'm missing linear algebra and my last chemistry course, but advisors at both Davis and my community college have been giving me the impression that I'd more than likely get in.

I'm still waiting on my last school that I applied to which is USC, but after these two waitlist offers, I'm feeling really down and I don't think it looks good. I did get accepted to UC Santa Cruz which I had never even considered at this point in attending...  I just can't help but feel that I should have been accepted into a better program and school that better reflects my grades and all of the hard work I've put into my schooling over the past two years. My biggest regret now is that I didn't apply to more schools, but I really thought I would get into Davis at least.

I would take a third year of CC, but honestly I'm so incredibly worn out at this point just trying to maintain my 4.0. Last quarter I was deathly afraid that I was going to lose my GPA to the point that I was losing sleep (this is not an exaggeration - I'd just lay in bed for 4-5 hours unable to sleep thinking about the next day's exam and then go on to take said exam on 2 hours of sleep.. and this happened over and over and over again). Funny enough, I ended up getting all A's, but the quarter took a very hard toll on both me mentally and physically. Honestly at this point I'm just sick of caring about my GPA. I want to move on from pre-reqs like chemistry and physics that I feel barely relate to my major and that I feel like I'm taking solely for the grade. I actually had a lot of fun in my data structures &amp; algos class a year ago, but that feeling in school seems completely foreign to me now, especially since I've finished all of my CS-related lower div courses. I love everything about CS and I know this is what I want to do with my life. Nothing at all gets me more excited, but I feel like I got caught up way, way too much in the school aspect of things and striving for a perfect 4.0 and it ended up hurting me. Especially now that I didn't get into Davis or San Diego.

But am I selling myself short for possibly going to UCSC and not taking another year of CC and re-applying? Or am I just feeding into the sunk cost fallacy with this mindset? I'd likely be able to graduate in 2 years at UCSC and apply for jobs right away, and really I'd just be banking on the fact that SC is so close to SV for networking and getting employed or an internship.. but I *still* can't help but feel in the end that all of my intense studying and work was for nothing..

If I do go to UCSC, will I need to work harder to stick out to employers among other applicants from maybe Stanford or Cal or San Diego? Should I just really focus on side projects in my spare time that can be listed on a future application? Or should I just tough it up and go another year at CC? 

If there is any other insight or advice you guys may have, I would really, really appreciate it. Thanks everyone."

336sw2,2,2015-04-19,Stuck in a negative feedback loop and don't know what to do,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/336sw2/stuck_in_a_negative_feedback_loop_and_dont_know/,"I figure I'll post this here since I've been feeling very suicidal lately and want to get some sort of perspective.

For the past two years, I've been having trouble shaping my life the way I want it to be. I had an amazing year before that and things seemed to go downhill afterwards.

Basically, my last semester as a full-time student ended and I moved back in with my parents. I finished my remaining credit hours as a part-time student and got my degree last year.

During this time, I've worked at Walmart and now I currently work at a grocery store. It's really depressing for me. I went from being happy in college and having a decent social life to being isolated and feeling stuck in my situation.

It's not that my job sucks (the Walmart one did, though), but I feel like life is passing me by. I can't afford to live on my own due to wage I make and my student loans. I can rarely go out anymore because I hardly make any money. I want to date, but what girl is going to want to date a guy who lives at home? Not to mention, I'd like to get some one night stands as well, but living at home makes that impossible.

I've never felt more suicidal than in the last few months. Part of the reason is because I turned down a chance to teach English in Japan. Now, you'd think I'd be trying to make that happen again, but honestly, I want to find a job here in my country (U.S.), work there for a little bit, and make some new friends. My social skills have went to hell these past few years. I'm not saying I was at the level I wanted to be before that, but I was much better than I am now.

However, I wouldn't even know where to start for a job here. My field was in Asian Studies and while that certainly helps with getting an English teaching job in Asia, it makes every other option for me here impossible. I really regret not taking an internship or maybe majoring in something that would get me a job (i.e. Computer Science). I also wish my Japanese was better, otherwise I could get a translation job, but that's my fault for procrastinating and putting off my studies. Worst part is, nobody seems to have an answer for me on what to do. I wish I got into an office job in college instead of pushing carts the first half and spending the other half being unemployed. All the jobs I've ever held, a high school student could do (in fact, at my current job, almost everyone there is in high school).

Like I said, usually, I'm suicidally-depressed. I wake up in the morning and feel like a complete failure. I lay in bed and don't get breakfast. I surf Reddit on my phone and feel even more neurotic reading about people having better experiences than me and being happy. I would see a therapist, but I have absolutely no health insurance (I work part-time; no insurance). This is another reason finding a full-time job would benefit me, since many of them offer health insurance.

I feel isolated from everyone around me. I rarely initiate anything unless someone talks to me, and whenever I'm feeling particularly depressed, my responses to them are always robotic or seem like I'm giving them the cold shoulder. I'm at this new job, and I'm already isolating myself from everyone. I don't even know what I could say, ""Oh, sorry that I'm acting this way. I think about killing myself everyday and it makes it hard for me to even function like a normal human being.""

I really have no idea what I can do. I want to go to a Meetup, but due to the fact that I work at a grocery store (this was the case at Walmart, too), my schedule is always changing and makes going to a lot of them impossible. Not to mention, I don't even have a car anymore and I have to rely on my dad to drive me everywhere; at age 26. The fact that I don't have a car doesn't bother me too much. If I lived in the city, I could just rely on public transportation, which is a big reason why I want to get the hell out of this suburb.

I just sit in the house feeling more and more isolated; and going out doesn't exactly solve anything because I'll still be lonely, only now there are people everywhere. I need a social context. Last Friday, I went to a bar by myself and sat outside. I saw a girl from work and her friends seemed to be friendly with me. But then, they just ignored me. I tried talking with her again, but she seemed reluctant to talk with me. So I just scrolled through Imgur on my phone and continued pounding down the beers. I felt like such a loser sitting by myself at the bench when they seemed to be having such a great time over at their table.

So, where do I even begin? I just feel like if this continues, I'm just going to end up dead, because being bored out of my mind and slowly watching my youth waste away is so painful. I want an answer; a real, concrete answer. None of this ""it get better"" or ""life has phases"" bullshit. I'm not getting younger and I don't want to finally get my life sorted out and then be that creepy old guy at the bar. And if it gets to that point, then I'll just end it."

**CPU:** I know a lot of you guys are going to be freaking out about how I'm able to get a 4690 for just $111. Like I mentioned above, I have a lot of family friends that work at Intel who were kind enough to give me a sweet employee discount. Words can't describe how grateful I am for this.

**Motherboard:** I'm obviously not going to be overclocking, so I didn't see the need to drop $90+ on a Z97 motherboard. Instead I looked for one with great reviews and with USB headers. Plus this one is made by MSI, which I've heard nothing but great things about, which is why I chose it. 

**RAM**: Nothing to explain here. Just your standard 8GB DDR3  @ 1600 mHz.  

**HDD**: Again nothing to explain here, just your average 1TB 7200RPM HDD thats on basically every build in this sub. A 128 GB SSD will be an upgrade next year for sure. 

**Case**: Has good reviews, ATX, looks like it handles cable management pretty well from other builds I've seen on PCPP. Plus it has USB 3.0 headers and looks clean.  

**Power Supply**: 500 watts is way more than enough for my build, and the fact that it has an 80+ bronze rating plus its made by Corsair is great for me. Oh and did I mention it's *Semi Modular?!*

**GPU**: I feel like I could really make my money go the distance if I opt to buy an R9 280 off of /r/hardwareswap for $125 shipped (thats what I see them frequently go for). To me this is a much better decision than buying an R9 270. 

**Monitor**: I honestly just need something thats 60 hz and 1080p. I might upgrade to 144hz next summer, but for now this will do the job great. 

***I know this is a huge wall of text,*** but I think I should give some insight to why I chose the parts instead of just pasting in a build and giving no backstory to what the PC will be used for or why the parts were chosen. If you actually read all the way down here, thank you so much. 

Again, I'm only 14, and I fully expect there to be mistakes in my part decision. If anyone could make reccomendations or corrections, that would be great! 

Sorry for any grammar/spelling mistakes, this was written very quickly without any proofreading. :)


**Edit:** Reading this back, it seems like I actually built the PC already. This is not the case. I just have all the parts ready and am looking for feedback/criticism on how I can improve my build before I order parts.

I think I'll try and start posting these at a reasonable hour again, assuming you will humble me and allow me to continue doing so. It's been quiet these past four days, and I suppose it will be somewhat more calm for the next 27 days or so. 

Holy shit, I have less than four weeks to go in this internship! Good grief!

The two year anniversary of Communitystuck is in a couple of days but, given how shitty I've been with the count, I imagine that it's a dubious honor at best; God only knows how far off that count is. 

Anyway, I spent a decent portion of the last couple of days driving. I also went to the bar with a couple of coworkers on Saturday to watch part of the Stanley cup playoffs. While it was fun, I dismissed myself a bit early, because of the aforementioned driving, and because that game was a fucking blowout. Git gud Detroit. What are you, casual? 

My drive back was totally silent, at least on my end. I didn't say a word, I didn't even listen to music. It felt like a part of Marble Hornets where one of the characters is just driving in his car. Not even a peep out of him. 

I find Marble Hornets to be strangely artistic. It makes the Slenderman- excuse me, Operator seem like a fairly believable concept, even if the acting and some of the effects are subpar. It makes a tense, palpable atmosphere, and has some good scares in it. 

I bet it could be trimmed down to a feature-length movie quite nicely.

Come to think of it, I'm surprised Hollywood hasn't taken a shot at that yet. God knows if they'd do it any justice, though.

[Hey newcomers and lurkers, can you do a comment here any justice? I'd like to see you try! Comment talking about your day and have a chat with someone. Maybe brew some tea and try to pretend that your partner(s) in conversation are across the table, speaking with you in real time, and count yourself lucky that I didn't talk about Bloodborne tonight.](/kv)

You can also answer *and submit* questions of the day. We do them every single day (for the most part) and it allows a nice springboard into conversation. Mostly, anyway. I've been away a good minute, so let me know if I've reused any questions tonight.

QOTD1 (*from /u/totallynondairy*): What is your least favorite thing about this sub, and what do you think could be done to improve that? Gotta keep it positive, man.

This feels especially relevant lately. This drama is crazy, and I can't really say I pick a side in it. Yeah, these kids are being pretty prolific, but they also aren't really breaking any rules. Some of it's even pretty nice art. Maybe they just tone it down a little? I don't know. What if they just posted a shit ton of links, or compiled it all in a single post on their own tumblr? I have no clue. 

Then there's the shitposting. I don't even know what to tell you about that.

Do you know what can improve all of it?! PUNS. MORE PUNS. /u/TrustThisDinosaur I'm counting on you!

QOTD2 (*submitted by /u/aberrantArtificer*): If you had to choose to be a spy in a foreign country, an astronaut, or one of the mythbusters, which would you choose and why?

I like your name! In any case, I'd choose to be a spy. Spies get all the girls, right? Actually, wait, no, fuck! Is it too late to change my answer? I'm too paranoid to enjoy being a spy! How about an astronaut? Wait, fuck! I'd be too scared that something would go wrong! Gonna be one of the mythbusters. Because they get to fuck around with *science* all day.

**WE'RE ALL STILL FRIENDS HERE, RIGHT? GOOD.**"
336zbk,9,2015-04-19,I [19 F] broke up with my long distance boyfriend [19 M] of 1.5 years. He wants to try to get back together in a year. (x-post r/relationships),longdistance2174,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/336zbk/i_19_f_broke_up_with_my_long_distance_boyfriend/,"I'll start with a brief summary of our relationship. We met in middle school and were best friends. Before high school, his family moved to another state (around 3 hours away). We kept in touch through facebook and kept that friendship alive, he was the person I'd turn to when I felt sad and just needed someone to distract me. Our conversations got pretty flirty, though we never meant anything by it. We would meet up whenever we could, about once a year, and enjoyed every visit.

I ended up choosing a college near his new hometown, and he went pretty far away (3 hour flight) for a 2-year college. The summer before freshman year, we had internships in the same city, and started going out together. Neither of us really wanted a relationship at this point, the thought of trying to stay in a long distance relationship scared us. So we just went out and had fun, usually getting lunch together then going out and trying something new (museums, movies, laser tag, rock climbing, etc.) Sometimes we'd just go to his apartment and watch tv and talk. There was incredible sexual tension, but we ignored it. At the end of the summer, we said our tearful goodbyes and headed off to college.

We missed each other a lot, and after a few weeks started videocalling regularly, just to talk about our lives. We built up to the point where we were calling every night, and throughout the day I would look forward to hearing the skype ""log in"" noise that night. We were deeply in love, and even though we didn't want to do long distance, we had no choice. He came home once every two months for a weekend or two, and I would always spend as much time with him as I could. A few months in, we started having sex, and it was mind-blowing. Everything about the relationship was perfect. 

Later that year, I felt that I wasn't missing him as much as I usually do. I felt the love that I had for him fading. These moments wouldn't last long, but it happened each time he left. I shook it off, telling myself that our time together was perfect, and everything I'd want in a relationship. When he jokingly mentioned spending the rest of our lives together, I just thought that I would like nothing more than that. I wished he was serious about it (he might've been, but it's not always obvious when he's joking). 

We spent the summer together again (planned this time) and it was the best summer of my life. I had never been so happy at any point in my life. I loved everything about him, from waking up in the morning and seeing him next to me to going to sleep at night in his arms. When August came, I started dreading the day he'd have to leave again.

The next few months, I started feeling the love fade, more and more. It got to the point where I couldn't ignore it. I didn't see myself being able to stay with him for another year, especially since I didn't know where he would go after college. It was unfair to lead him on, since I was losing feelings for him. I didn't want to let it build and cause a bad breakup... I just wanted us to go back to being friends, like we were in high school. Three months ago, I called him and told him we should break up. He was completely blindsided by this, and fought back initially, but agreed it was best for both of us because he also didn't want to lose the friendship. He made a few comments about trying again later, which worried me a little; I wasn't so sure that I'd ever feel that way about him again.

We agreed not to talk for two months, and try to use that time to separate the relationship from the friendship. During that time, I had some casual hookups with a guy at my school and he hooked up with a girl he met (or multiple, we haven't talked about what we did, I just got this from a mutual friend). It seemed like we were both over it and ready to be friends. That went well, and for the last month we both had what we wanted-- the friendship we missed so much during our time apart.

He's graduating soon, and taking a job in his hometown (where I go to college). We were talking about the job offer yesterday (he accepted this morning), and he said he wanted to try dating again once he moved back here.

Reddit, I don't know how to feel. The time I spent in that relationship was the happiest in my life. I've told him things about myself that I couldn't imagine saying to anyone else, even another long-term partner. During the breakup, I told him that if I could somehow love him again, get that initial spark back, I would want to marry him. We're both still (physically) attracted to each other, and we'll live in the same city for the next few years.

But I don't want to jeopardize the friendship. If he's asking me this, he still has feelings for me; if we date and it goes poorly, our friendship might not survive the second breakup.

Should I say no, and keep the friendship? Or say yes, and risk it all on the chance of an amazing relationship? Should I stop dating until he gets back?

OP: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/334wqp/i_19_f_broke_up_with_my_long_distance_boyfriend/

**tl;dr**: Broke up with long-distance boyfriend because I lost feelings for him. He's moving close to me soon, and wants to try again. I don't know what to do."

This is my best chance at getting an internship, and really don't want to screw it up. I have been an avid lurker at posts regarding important things to study. 

Unfortunately I am also studying for exams and don't really have much time to prepare thoroughly for the interview. It is about 2hrs long at a small company doing software development. I would assume that it will be mostly technical.

So, I was wondering if you guys could basically give me advice on important things to go over. Really important things that I would have time to go over and key things to remember. Thanks"

3376lm,0,2015-04-20,Stop fucking stalking my reddit account,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3376lm/stop_fucking_stalking_my_reddit_account/,"I knew something was up when you blocked me and unfollowed me and stopped talking to me after we broke up; I didn't mind much, but it seemed weird in context since I hadn't done anything wrong. I just was friendly to you. I thought you wanted to keep in contact with me.

Then you sent that email, and I think things finally clicked. I remember a long time ago you had found out my reddit account. It didn't really bother me since I had nothing to hide from you. You said you never even checked reddit. I knew you weren't the type to stalk my accounts.

But after we broke up I think you might've gone a bit crazy. Really, was muting me on Twitter not enough? You admitted yourself that you were still obsessively checking my tweets. Was unfriending me on Facebook not enough? Did you really have to block me? Did you find yourself obsessively stalking my public Facebook page -- knowing well that I never post publicly?

Well, if you're reading this, fuck you. It's not my fault you're so fucking salty. You're just bitter that I'm happy and successful. Honestly, I don't know if it's good luck or hard work but I am so happy now. And I think you still might be the same place you were a year ago. Do you know why? Because you're afraid of change. You can't grow if you're scared to change.

Fuck you - I've refrained myself from talking to you, when you're obviously blocking all my attempts to rekindle any kind of meaningful relationship with you, fuck you, I'm not going to chase you anymore. 

If you're stalking my reddit account, then you're the one wrong here. And so I'll kindly update you on all I've done since you left me.

I found a fucking bomb ass summer internship in Philadelphia. Guess what? They also pay for my housing and flight. I'm gonna be making thousands this summer. And I just switched to Computer Science last quarter. I love it. It's a good major and it intrigues me.

I have a new boyfriend now. He gives me free reign. He's down to party and at the same time he's a fucking genius. 

We party together. I've done drugs now. Remember you wouldn't even let me drink? Yeah, I've taken some pretty fucking powerful hits from a bong now. Every time I go visit him and his roommates I'm surrounded by the smartest stoners I've ever met. I've dropped acid, I've smoked weed, and I've gotten absolutely shitfaced. But throughout all of this, I've stayed myself and I had an awesome time.

I met awesome people this year. Oh, I should add I'm gonna be an officer for one of the biggest clubs on campus next year too. So that happened.

Stop stalking me. Move on. You're better than this. 

I'm successful and happy and there's no other direction I'm going to do. So when you've decided that you're done being immature and jealous about my happiness, feel free to block me, you fuckboy.

PS. My dog is cuter than yours"

#/r/AnimalCrossing 

**44,480 villagers** spamming ""A"" for **4 years!**

You open your eyes and find yourself on a train going.... where? You're not quite sure. In the corner of your eye you see a blue and white cat eyeing you up, before getting up and sidling towards you. He asks you for the time. You tell him it's about 2:55PM. He asks if he can sit across from you. You still don't know where you're going or who this animal is. For some reason, this all seems perfectly normal to you.  He asks for your name. You repeat it back to him. You remark that you think it's quite a cute name. He agrees, saying he thinks you're a ""pretty cool gal."" Wait a minute. You're a guy. You correct him, resulting in him apologising and confirming your gender one final time. He asks you where you're going. You realize you get to *choose* where you're going. You tell him a generic town name, not realizing this is one of the most important decisions you'll ever make.

He shows you a map of the town you claimed to be going to and you confirm the map is accurate. Suddenly, a chime plays and the train comes to a halt. You get off the train after saying goodbye to the cat and exit the train station. A group of animals await your arrival. In hushed voices, they discuss something before shouting greetings towards you. A dog starts yapping things to you about your mayorship. You're quite confused. You still don't know who any of these animals are. After dwelling in thought for a second, it occurs to you that there was a monkey driving the train you were on a minute ago, and that everyone around you is an animal of some kind. The dog whisks you away to the town hall, yaps some more things you don't really listen to, then tells you to head up to a real estate agent in the upper part of town. Before you take your leave, she subtly mentions that you are now officially the mayor of the town.

You head up to the train station where you arrived not minutes ago and cross the tracks. You spot a unit named ""Nook's Homes"" and head inside. An overly enthusiastic raccoon somehow sells you a house and you now have a temporary home in the form of a tent and a sizable mortgage in the town's official currency, bells.

It's been about a year since you arrived in the town. You're still somehow the mayor. You've completed quite a few projects in the town, like a coffee shop *( where you now work, )* some benches, a campsite and a dream suite. Your bell count is a number too big for you to be able to count. You've been to a tropical island where you met the former mayor and earned some sweet rewards. You've caught every bug and fish in the book. You've paid off your mortgage and have started paying mansion tax due to the sheer size of your house. You think you've finally made it.


In reality, you're just getting started.

Welcome to the life-sucking void that is Animal Crossing.




/r/AnimalCrossing is a tight-knit community revolving around the Nintendo game, Animal Crossing. With posts ranging from [artistic interpretations](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/225jxb/recreated_a_beautiful_drawing_as_best_as_i_could/) to [frog death threats](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1gyjdw/extra_bells/). Everyone is always [happy to help](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/30nin5/do_villagers_always_move_into_the_same_plot/) with any questions, concerns -- or anything really. Even the villagers [chip in](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/30n4bw/so_i_sent_a_letter_to_this_villager_when_i_was/) with your problems sometimes. Sister subreddits include /r/ACTrade, ( allows for easy organising of item trading ) /r/ACTurnips, ( helps you to top the stalk market ) /r/DreamCrossing ( to visit others towns ) and /r/RateMyMayor ( a quite clever rating system used to determine the legitimacy of individual players, determined by ratings left by other players. ) Of course, as with every subreddit, /r/AnimalCrossing has [its](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1gvs99/not_what_i_thought_it_was/) [own](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1h8tyh/oh_retail_xpost_from_rgaming/) [humour](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1gklwi/told_my_wife_to_visit_my_house_and_lie_on_the_bed/). One of the best parts of Animal Crossing is the level of customization given to you in your house. With that in mind, there [certainly](http://imgur.com/a/X3M98) [isn't a](http://imgur.com/a/yOGEd) [shortage](http://i.imgur.com/trp089x.jpg) [of inspiration](http://imgur.com/a/Pvyez) [for your](http://imgur.com/a/zu9cc) [latest crib](http://imgur.com/a/uPwZ3)! 



I sat down the lovely moderators for a coffee at the roost and asked some questions.



&gt; #1. Tell us a bit about yourself!

 &gt;&gt; **/u/LadyDrac**  I'm a late 20-something residing in the state of Washington who enjoys Animal Crossing just a wee bit too much. My dog is learning Pavlovian theory for nerds. The sound of my DS closing makes him extremely excitable because he knows that it means it's finally time to go play outside or do something fun together. Husband has also started to become trained and now knows to take a detour through the McDonalds when we drive by for ""that streetpass thing."" I would make Kapp'n proud with my job in the cruise industry and I only wish I had a ship of my own to christen as the Cucumber of the Seas.

&gt; #2. How did you initially get involved in the /r/AnimalCrossing community?

 &gt;&gt; **/u/LadyDrac**  I would not be happy with my game until I had obtained everything... and part of everything was grabbing an elusive 7-11 set before duping was commonplace. Naturally, Reddit was the place to come! Eventually, someone decided it would be a good idea to make me a mod since I was always involved with answering peoples' questions about the game or sharing new information based on what I had learned in my own game or research I had done.

 &gt;&gt; **/u/E_lucas**  I started this subreddit a while back when talking with another redditor around /r/gaming or something, and we realized there was no Animal Crossing sub. It was started then had absolutely no community for a year or so. Began to pick up around the launch of New Leaf, and even those with previous iterations only discovered the sub late (and now their online capability has been shut down ;_;)

&gt; #3. If you have one, what is your favourite post of all time on /r/AnimalCrossing?

 &gt;&gt; **/u/LadyDrac**  It's too hard to limit two years of participation down to a single post. There have been so many posts here that have restored my faith in the goodness of others, made me laugh hard enough that I couldn't breathe, or impressed me with a skill or talent that truly took dedication to master. Each post here truly captures that so many different people with so many different interests and so many different play styles can still come together as a community over something as simple as a video game.

 &gt;&gt; **/u/E_lucas**  I don't think it's possible to pick a single post that stands out. My favourites will always be fan art and comics. You can almost project your own emotions on to how people interact with their villagers. Everyone constantly talks about their ""dreamies"" and their best possible population. It's hard to explain the connections you make with the NPC's, but they have so much personality that they become a huge part of what the game is. When people put down on paper how they feel when a villager does something awesome, or dumb, or moves away, everyone who plays AC can relate.

&gt; #4. A very important question; who is your favourite villager ( or other character! ) in Animal Crossing?

 &gt;&gt; **/u/LadyDrac**  There are too many characters that I truly enjoy to pick just one so I guess I will share my top three favorites. I'll start with the NPCs first. Phyllis is probably my all-time favorite just because her snarky remarks just crack me up. She's admittedly lost some bite in New Leaf so I really miss the ""real"" Phyllis from games past but I can understand why Nintendo made the effort to tone her down... children really wouldn't understand the ""disgruntled postal worker"" vibe she gives off. Next up, I have to admit Celeste is just too adorable for her own good and is probably my favorite ""sweet"" character to balance out Phyllis' bite. She is just so beyond cute in the Animal Crossing Movie that if I lived in the town, I would probably spend a lot of my time in the museum with her! For my favorite villager character, I have to admit Vesta has been my favorite for a while now. She loves to sew and craft just like me and she always seems to be positive even if it's a crummy, rainy day.

 &gt;&gt; **/u/E_lucas**  Genji is my favourite villager and gym bro, Brewster, because I'm a coffee addict, and Pascal, because he's just so chill.. maan. Of course KK also has a special place in my heart, but that's a given for everyone.

&gt; #5. Is there anything else you'd like to share?

 &gt;&gt; **/u/LadyDrac**  I guess I'll end this by saying I am so proud to be part of such a caring community and I feel honored that so many people (around the world even!) look to me for help or reliable knowledge in the game. I am honestly just a girl behind the screen with an intense love for Animal Crossing but so many people have put their faith in me to provide accurate information and keep the community running smoothly. It's just very humbling and I very much appreciate all of the support and encouragement I have received from the community. Lastly, I would encourage anyone who checks out /r/AnimalCrossing to also please check out and support our sister communities linked in our sub wiki. We all work together to truly make the Animal Crossing Reddit community a safe and enjoyable place and they deserve just as much credit, if not more, for making this little corner of Reddit worthwhile &amp;lt;3

 &gt;&gt; **/u/E_lucas**  I just want to shoutout to the Animal Crossing community as a whole. I don't think there is a gaming community out there who is as nice and ready to help out a fellow villager/mayor at any moment. From all the boards, IRC's, etc. that I've been a part of over the years, the community really becomes as much as a village as those in our games.

Now, excuse me whilst I go attend to my weeds.

*writer's note: Hi! I'm Superburke -- a new intern at SROTD. I'm a something year old working as a full stack web developer for a relatively large corporation. My interests mainly include programming and gaming, so you'll probably see a lot on those subjects from me.

Any thoughts on this?

In regards to the program, I don't want to just be doing small front-end changes to websites...hoping for something more substantial, but if anyone has experience or knows about the program, I'd appreciate input.

**Also, don't want to come across as a pretentious asshole, but it might anyway - I'm at a pretty top CS program, but all the past interns I've found are from pretty much local schools/midwest schools, and so if that changes anything I would like to know. If not, disregard."

I've reread this to try and proofread it, but I'm sorry, it's still so fresh in my mind that I'm having a hard time retelling it, even through typing. So sorry if this is a rambling mess. 


I'm (m/33) not really sure how to begin. I've been dating a girl (f/29) for almost 6 years. And I planned to marry her - and was actively ring shopping. We had been talking about it for a while as well.


Anyways, around 19 months ago she decided that she wanted more out of her career and to get her MBA, and I supported her knowing it would likely put a huge strain on us. I was a drop out, but had done so to pursue another career, and she had always supported me in that. 


She worked really hard, and got into a school on the other side of the country on a full scholarship. She contemplated not going to be closer to me (and going to a local school without a scholarship) but in the end even I agreed it was an opportunity she couldn't pass up. I applied to her school as well, just to keep our options open.


And the story goes - We moved across the country together to go to school. She went for her graduate program, and I went to finish my undergraduate degree. I guess the sage advice of not moving for a significant other was true for us...


But cut to about 9 months later, and we've just broken up. We had a long history of fighting (and almost breaking up multiple times) due to her drinking. She used to get horrendously black out drunk, and it obviously caused a lot of problems for us. 


Every time it happened, we would fight and I would make a stand about not wanting to be with someone like that, and she would promise to change. It would always be almost a year or so before it happened again. But gradually she'd slowed down, and for about 2 years, she was pretty good about it. We started staying home more, and in my mind, I thought we really became a lot closer. We were seriously talking about the future now, and I thought we were pretty set in stone. That's how I had enough confidence in us to make the move.


Now, about a month ago, she started really heavily drinking, and staying out extremely late. I chalked it up to business school, and the networking it required, and tried to be as nice about it as I possibly could. But we started really getting on each other's nerves, and for a few weeks we were at each others throats for the smallest things (chores, taking care of the dog, sharing our car...etc). I chalked it up to the pressures of her program, and my own heavy school load as well, and didn't think much of it. 


Then, three days ago I was studying for a midterm that was the next day, and she comes home at 2am, extremely wasted. I try to play it off, and let her sleep. But right before she falls asleep, she calls me by someone else's name, someone I didn't know. I get pretty angry, and try to talk to her about it, but she's belligerent and half asleep so I decide to just leave her be and go back to studying. 


However, I had apparently woke her from her stupor, but not from her drunkeness, and now she's being actively drunk and trying to pull me away from my studying, and this only makes me more mad. My telling her to stop and leave me alone makes her mad, and she starts screaming, which makes me start screaming, leading to a really dramatic fight about how I have a test in a few hours and how she needed to stop drinking so much.


The next day, she can barely remember what happened, but I'm still angry, and carefully remind her that she had promised to be more careful with the alcohol. This turns into a long, dramatic 20 hour fight, where I remind her that we fight about this too much, and that she really needs to stop.


This opens up a can of worms about how for the past 3 years, she's been trying to be someone she's not to please me, and that she's in business school and she wants to enjoy it. Then she admits that the past few weeks she has been staying out late to avoid coming home to me, and she realized that this was who she was, instead of who she's been pretending to be to be with me.


And after about 3 whole days of fighting and arguing and bargaining, we basically understand that it's probably time to say goodbye. Now she's staying at her friends, and I'm home alone with the dog we dragged across the country, trying to force myself to let her go. I'm really torn, and completely at a loss. I'm so far from home, and now I'm completely alone in what I thought was a move as a ""family.""


She has an internship a few states away for the summer, which probably made her decision easier, but also makes it a lot tougher for me to let things go. I know if she leaves, then I'll be saying good bye to her forever, but I'll also be here by myself, wondering why I left my previous job to go to school so far from anything I know.


There's a lot to blame on myself, but I can't help but feel completely blindsided by this, and I really don't know what to do, or where to find the strength to do it. I honestly don't know how I ended up here... When I was literally ring shopping just a month ago.


Should I talk to her? Should I just let it go? I honestly don't know if there's anything I can do anymore. And all I know is I feel completely lost...

337j5n,7,2015-04-20,"[day 1] It's time for me to take a break, once again... not my first rodeo and disappointed at my lack of self control",massifjb,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/337j5n/day_1_its_time_for_me_to_take_a_break_once_again/,"I've had an interesting relationship with weed over the past three years. I'm a college student, a 2nd year. Last year I smoked a lot of weed during winter and spring quarters, lined up nothing for the summer and ended up smoking a lot of weed by myself.

This year things have gone better. Last quarter I wasn't smoking too much - maybe once a week, sometimes twice. I got my act together, applied to internships and actually lined something up for the summer. Unfortunately I also started smoking weed during finals week and continued smoking a lot over spring break. It's been three weeks since then and I've had easy access to weed and have been smoking essentially daily.

My health and stress has suffered significantly. I make myself very busy, and smoking is a very time consuming affair - it screws with sleep and produces a surprising dependancy. I come home exhausted, wait around until I smoke weed (usually late), stay up even later because I'm high, become sleep deprived because I'm up late... cycle continues.

The past three days have been extremely taxing. I let my friend borrow my car and she got into a major car crash, not her fault in my opinion and I don't blame her. (thank goodness no injuries) This created a LOT of stress on friday and saturday. I worked all day saturday, and drank and smoked a fair amount on saturday night - despite having been coughing and sneezing pretty consistantly for the past few weeks.

Today has been real rough, I've been sickly as hell, feel like shit, I'm behind on a lot of work. My health is taking a major toll and this quarter is just getting started. I have a lot to do, and the thing I needed the most this weekend was some sleep and rest; unfortunately I went to bed past 4am every night and am still sleep deprived as hell.

Anyway, I'm stopping. I have no weed, I will make no effort to get any and I will use my health as motivation to not smoke with people. I'm worried I'm going to fail... the next few days wont be hard as I'm sick as shit and busy as shit. The problem is once I start healing, once I have less to do, once people start hitting me up and I run out of valid excuses... weed is going to be real tempting.

We'll see if my self control is any better this time around. Good luck to all and have a good night."

337qq7,2,2015-04-20,My Wife (27F) told me she doesn't love me any more and we are getting a divorce (11+ years together),ihopeicancontinue,Divorce,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/337qq7/my_wife_27f_told_me_she_doesnt_love_me_any_more/,"We are together since High School (~ 15 years old) and we were really partners all this time, we spent most of the time together.

A few more facts:

* We ""quit"" our friends during this time, and we didn't have much social life (I had a few ""friends"") but she never went out with friends, because always I was telling her ""stay with me"" and she agreed. (This is one of the reason she was complaining for, that she want to have a normal life)

* We never cheat on each other, the only issues we had was that I tried to have female-friends but at the end they wanted something else, and I of course said no and continue with my girlfriend.

* Since we were spending 99% of the time together, we used to have stupid arguments, but after a few minutes or sometimes hours we forget about it.

* After graduating, she was not very happy with her career, because at the beginning she didn't want to study anything, and her career was kind of a new thing in our country, so she spend 1 and a half years to find a job, after this I got the opportunity of going to another continent for a internship (6 months), was really difficult to be separated, we talked everyday. She was alone in a new-shitty city.

* After I came back, I knew I had the possibility to come back to this new country for a PhD, so I asked her to marry me, she cried and say yes...we had an amazing time, of course, she didn't invite her friends, because she didn't have...only family, I had a few friends that she was spending time with, so was kind of ""our friends"".

* We arrived in this new country, full of dreams...and hoping to start a new life but at the end we figured out that for her to study or work will be impossible, since her career was not recognized in this country.

* During ""the talk"" she told me that we were really distant, which is true, I mean, we  were this kind of couples that sometimes watch a movie/tv show together, and never go out. Besides this, she told me that she was not happy, that we need to take care of ourselves, because she was always thinking First in me and second in her. I ask her if this was because she didn't have any possibility of growing professionally here, and she told me that was also ""one of the reasons""

The most difficult part, was when she told me she doesn't love me any more, and after coming back the wedding and leaving everything behind was too fast (just a couple of months).

You will understand how I feel...I really don't know how to continue, she looks really calm, she will find a job back in our country, live with her brother and take care of herself, but I will go there to stay with my family/friends for a month, but I decided is better to come back finish my PhD, since If I stay there I will meet her on the street (I'm pretty sure) and I really cannot handle this situation, of maybe in a few months, she will have a new person in her life....is too much for me...

Here in this new country, I have only 1 friend, and he is leaving in July, and I really don't know what to do....there are more than 11 years of memories, she was my +1, my companion, was not just my wife.
Of course our ""friends"" and family are really shocked, and they are really sad for this, because we were always like an example for family and friends.

Of course I'm not being mean, or something, I want the best for her, I want her to be happy, and if this happens without me, I will understand.

I asked her about being a time separated, but she told me that She doesn't love me, just care for me, and she don't want to be with me any more.
Of course she refused to ""start again"" back in our country too.

Any word of advice will be welcome....

337r7u,1,2015-04-20,"[M4A] Sex, Dry-Cleaning, and Rock'n'Roll",MattNCL,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/337r7u/m4a_sex_drycleaning_and_rocknroll/,"The wild guitars and reckless lyrics of Eat Your Peach hummed quietly from the new CD player in the dash of my beaten up old car. It’s a song that should really be played at earth-shattering volume through a tower of amps and speakers, but I’d turned it down so as not to draw too much attention to myself. I checked my watch again. 2:26 AM. Was this guy even coming? He was already almost half an hour late. This wasn’t how I’d pictured my first job out of high school - sitting in the parking lot of a closed fast-food restaurant, waiting to buy… well, who knows what, although I’d assume it was some form of drugs. 2:27 AM. I cautiously turned up the music just a little and shut my eyes, just for a moment.





Cardinal Sin had been my favourite band since I was 13 and a huge part of my life over the last five years. Sure, their particular brand of swaggering, boastful, oversexed and underwritten rock'n'roll wasn’t exactly in-vogue these days, but I loved them. One of my first acts of masturbation was in the middle of the night to the raunchy video for On The Pole with the sound turned down. I’d taken my first girlfriend to see their Seduction tour. I even lost my virginity with their album Deep &amp; Slow playing in the background. Most people loved their singer, Johnny Kill, but I had always idolised their kick-ass guitarist, Atticus Filth, not only because he actually wrote most of the songs, but because of his well known accolade of ‘the biggest cock in rock’. As an awkward, shy, but very well endowed teenager, he was my hero and made me feel like less of a freak during those uncertain years.





When I got my internship at the record label I was thrilled. Despite lacking any musical ability of my own, all I’d ever wanted to do was work in the music industry. When I was told that Cardinal Sin were working on a new album and I was to help Atticus write it, I almost had a panic attack. I had imagined myself knocking back beers with my hero, giving notes on his lyrics as he experimented with the new material in the studio. The reality however, had been a little different.




Mostly, I was an errand boy. I’d pick up his leather pants from the dry cleaners, go out to buy him booze or cigarettes (which was often difficult without any ID), or search through shops to indulge his every childish impulse purchase on the label’s credit card. Other nights, like this one, I’d spend my time hanging around in sketchy parts of town waiting to pay for and collect various ‘packages’. My musical hero turned out to be a spoiled man-child and addict who was happy for me to work 18 hour days but hadn’t learnt my name in six weeks. I hadn’t even got a glimpse of the inside of his studio either, having to settle for the occasional snatch of screeching guitar noise wafting down the halls of his tacky mansion. But the most demoralising revelation of all was the one that came from his wife;





“The biggest cock in rock and roll? Ha! It’s just a bunch of socks that he rolls up and stuffs down there love.”





She was the only thing that didn't disappoint and often the only thing that kept my motivated through the exhaustion and tedious tasks. Penelope Filth was undeniably stunning, even as she spoke in voice like a Dickensian cockney street urchin and sucked down cigarettes with a sexy scowl. I’d had a crush on her ever since she appeared in the video for Bad Confession, swinging around a pole on an alter in a skintight latex nun’s outfit. It was a ludicrous bit of male fantasy but having now met her, I wouldn’t be surprised if she picked the outfit herself. Her daily attire seemed to exclusively consist of low cut leather pants, showy bras beneath sheer tops, spiked heels and assorted sexy PVC items. Her dress code was all black, all rock and roll, all the time. In fact the only colour she seemed to allow for, beyond her shock of blonde hair, was her bright red lipstick and nail polish. She’d been my point of contact most of the time, with Atticus locked away in his home studio, as she bossed me about with a temperamental attitude that made me a little nervous. But, god did she look [great](http://40.media.tumblr.com/090dae0c1d644d6263a9afe9cd874c1e/tumblr_nmx03voxWm1sv481xo1_1280.jpg). Sometimes I couldn’t help but stare at her in awe. At first she barely seemed to notice me, drifting in and out of rooms to give me orders or mundane tasks, but slowly she began to actually talk with me, clearly bored senseless with her husband locked away writing and recording day or night.





“I might as well not exist whenever he’s working on a new album” she’d once told me in that fantastically blunt and brutally honest way of hers, “Even I’m not allowed in the studio. He says I’d be too much of a distraction from his muse, but I think he just doesn’t want anyone to realise that his songs sound shit without the rest of the band”.




And so it was her that I thought about as I shut my eyes and waited in that dimly lit parking lot for some unpunctual night-owl dealer. I had thought that I was going to be living the dream, but it turns out that rock and roll isn’t that fun unless *you’re* the rockstar. Little did I know that later that night she’d give me an opportunity to know what feels like to be Atticus Finch. Even if I couldn’t ever stand on a stage and shout the chorus of Ten Ton Tongue to a sea of screaming fans, at least I would get to be the *real* ‘biggest cock in rock’."

For example when a colleague comes over and we attempt to trouble shoot some code, I seem to stumble and have difficulty saying the right words/terminology as we step through code. Like I would say 'member' instead of 'field', 'invoke' instead of 'field access' etc. And this makes it hard for the other person to follow what I'm trying to get across.

Any tips or suggestions on how I can improve my communication skills with describing code?

I do not know if any of you guys remember me but a few weeks ago I had an interview for Deloitte without any clear areas of preference. The just called me and i did it and it seems I did great. 

Today the called me and offered me an internship for a new department so called DxD, which is an IT department made for IT people. The thing is, I studied business management and I am kind of confused. Dont get me wrong i would love to get that spot but I would need way more training than an already tech undergraduate. 

What is happening, what would you guys do?

3384wb,313,2015-04-20,Don't be a (Bad)min...,Toakan,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3384wb/dont_be_a_badmin/,"Hey Guys,

It's been a while as i've been caught up trying to stabalise my work and 'Other-work'. For those who don't know, I was an Intern for a global technology company. However at night, I run various services including VoiP, Web and technical support. This story comes from the latter.


I do have one key note about this story, that i may write up properly after this.

Now the clients email is rather strange and requires backstory, I'll cut out the details but essentially their old Web Admin was rather bad at being a Web Admin, and one day decided that he wanted to run the business since he hosted all the services from his hosted rack.

This happened when I was visiting the company for other business, however I overheard some of their suggestions and was quite vocally dismayed at what I heard. I took over service that day.

-------

Friday night, about 11pm. Just turning all the systems off for the night and heading to bed.

Time from attack start : 5 minutes

My phone pings. This ping is recognizable as it's from my alt-work account. No one uses that unless it's urgent.

&gt;Damn...

Open it up, Nagios host reports connection time-out errors to Primary Production server. Various other minor details, yada yada...

Two minutes later, I get an email from a VoIP client, service is offline. Then another follows.. Yeah, that notification was silenced very quickly.

So I do what any technically responsible person does; Turn my system back online, and open a can of red bull.

Reading through the emails, I notice this charm.

&gt;Toakan,

&gt;Our old admin just came onto the VoIP and stated his intention to remove service to prove he was correct about being the best host we require.

&gt; Service has now gone dark. Was this planned or has he actually done it?!

Well crap, ok so I now have a starting point. After checking the nagios logs, it seems that there was a lot of traffic being sent to the primary machine, and none was coming back. 

However the way the Primary is setup, is there is a second hardwire into my failover box (Local network). So i jumped on the Failover and see connect through the LAN. 

Apparently this DOS was killing the NIC in the Primary machine, which couldn't then failover as there was no connection. (My mistake, which i've since corrected)

Kicking up wireshark on Prod, lo and behold there is a lot of packets being sent from an 81.xxx.xxx.xx address, not a usual address for a DOS attack to be sent from, however with the source IP, I quickly setup a rule within the router to ignore all traffic from this address. 

I'm pissed at this point, because it's already caused 40 minutes of down time and this guy is still sending the DOS (It's impacting the routers now).

Time from attack start : 45 Minutes

I decided to reverse lookup the IP on a whim, a few dns entries for Badmins websites and even better, it turns out that it's not from a VPN or company, but rather a client connection from a Telecom company! It even had the connection point and Telecom ID for the line!

I decide to call the Telecom, as their online attack form is diabolical...

&gt;Tele : Hi this is %Telecom, what is the nature of your enquiry?

&gt;Me : Yeah, Hi. I'm currently being subjected to a DOS attack, is there anyway you can throw me to your network guys so we can get this stopped?

&gt;Tele : Have you tried restarting your router?

I don't have time for this... I know that a smatter of you guys on the phones read this sub, and i know it's a script, but ... Gahhhh...

After a brief explanation of how serious this is, and that I don't have time for the common user support.

&gt; Tele : Oh, can you hold a minute please?

&gt; Tele : I'm transfering you to 3rd line now.

Time from start of attack: 1 hour 10 minutes 

&gt;3rd : Hi this is 3rd, what can I can do for you.

&gt;Me : Currently being DoS'ed, please can you verify the traffic from $IP$ and stop the service.

&gt;3rd : Under the Data Protection Act, i can't give you any information about the client or account details however. 

&gt;Me : Not a problem, however this is business impacting of just over 1 hour now, I have a 2 hour window for this type of incident.

&gt;3rd : Yeah sure, the monitor shows there is a lot of traffic from that account, hang on i'll get the tools running.

&gt;3rd : Alright, I've verified that it's pointed at your address, i'm closing the connection now. You should see servive restore in a couple of minutes.

&gt;Me : Yep, system is back online and services are restarting, thanks for your assistance.

Time from attack start : 1 Hour 30 Minutes

Great, so service is back online all clients are connected and happy. No more flags from the alerting. Time to fix those environment issues and write up the incident.

The bit I feel bad about? Badmin also had clients running from the $IP that was disconnected. Hopefully his clients took it as a sign to come away from him.

338l09,6,2015-04-20,Dating my friends girlfriend,machartm,polyamory,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/338l09/dating_my_friends_girlfriend/,"Whew, where to start. I suppose I should start by clarifying the relationship between me and my ""friend"".

I wouldn't necessarily classify him as a friend the way I refer to my best friends. Instead he is actually the roommate of my bestfriend. Him, his girlfriend, and my best friend share a 3 bedroom apartment together. The four of us together were actually going to get a 4 bedroom together but I had to bail out because I took a 6 month internship and would be in a different city for half of the academic year.

Me and this guy don't hang out exclusively one on one, but whenever I'm over visiting my best friend the three/four of us all hang out together and have a great time. He's a great guy, very funny with an incredible wit. I never have a dull moment around him.

As for his girlfriend. She's incredibly beautiful, has a huge heart, and an inspiring personality. I recently found out that the two of them have this sort of pseudo-open relationship. He allows her to cuddle and kiss other guys, but nothing more really... so no sex or the sort. They also take a kind of ""don't ask don't tell"" approach. He allows this, but doesn't really want to hear about it or interact with the other guys she cuddles/kisses with.

Well, one night me and his girlfriend decide to cuddle. I had been feeling a little on the depressed side lately due to some other recent girl problems, so when I found out that she'd be willing to snuggle with me I had to take her up on it. Not to mention I've had a crush on her for years.

It's been a week since we've cuddled and since then we've spent 6 of those 7 days together. Yesterday only 2 hours, but some days we spent 6+ hours together. And over the course of this week, the feelings have been explosive! Neither of us can get the other out of our heads and we've both confessed that we really like each other.

Anyway, since her and her boyfriend have an open relationship, and they have good communication... plus she hates lying or keeping things from him. She hasn't told him she has feelings for me yet, but she's been honest with the fact that we've been cuddling and have kissed and made out.

Well then came the ""moment of truth"" if you will. She was performing in a campus event. Her boyfriend was obviously there, I also went, plus my best friend and some other people in our social circle. Me and her were expecting things to be pretty awkward. He had seemed to be in a sub par mood as of late. But to our surprise, it seems like nothing has really changed between us. In fact he was engaging me in conversation.

We've only been seeing each other for a week now, so we're at no where near considering a relationship, but we have been talking about it. She says her boyfriend would never go for a poly relationship while both me an her are all for it (she was basing this off of what I mentioned early, his desired to not hear about or interact with her other partners). However, I had pointed out that all those other guys she's cuddled with or kissed weren't friends with her boyfriend before it all started, while I was. And after seeing how we interacted on Saturday, I explained that its possible that I could be the one that changes that for him.

I know some poly relationships don't want any of their relationships intersecting, others want everyone involved to me romantically/sexually involved, and some just want their partners to be friends.

I had mentioned before he's got a great personality, and I know the both of us have a cheesy romantic side, so I'd be excited to see what two romantic guys could pull off together for a girl they like. I feel like being in a relationship with the two of them could be exciting as well as comforting, like living with close friends instead of just one significant other.

My question for you is, how can we bring him on board? Her and I are okay with it, but he's always been a monogamist. I don't want him to feel like he's being alienated or replaced. Should I try to spend more time with him too? Anything we can say or do? Any good resources? How slow should we take it or how long should we weight?

338pep,2,2015-04-20,"Me [30/M] trying to find time in the busy schedule of my new girlfriend [30/F], a medical resident",returnoftheporla,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/338pep/me_30m_trying_to_find_time_in_the_busy_schedule/,"So I've recently started dating (about six weeks ago) a lovely woman who is just finishing her first year of a three-year residency in internal medicine at a local hospital.

The good news is that everything is going pretty wonderfully so far -- we have great chemistry, she's very affectionate (in addition to super kind/smart/funny/pretty -- whole package), and we both genuinely enjoy (or at least, it seems like she enjoys) the time we spend together.

Of course, it's still super early with us -- we're only seven dates in at this point -- though things look promising.  The only problem is that, since she's still just in her intern year of residency, she works basically all the time (~80 hours/week).  This does not leave her with a lot of free personal time, and I have definitely appreciated that fact that she does make time to see me about one evening a week so far.

The only potential problem is that although for me one night a week is totally fine for a more casual relationship, I think this could have the potential to become something more serious, in which case I would want to see her ideally 2-3X a week.  Residency is the most challenging and demanding time in a doctor's career, so I know for a fact that this won't always or often be possible.

I don't know how to broach the topic that I would like to see her more often without it coming across as clingy/needy or even just putting her under more stress or obligation.  I work a 40 hr/week job so I can be pretty flexible with my time, but I'm looking for ideas of how to try to ask for more time with her without her feeling constrained or compelled.  

If this is the most time she can spare, it would be good to know, because it's likely things won't change much over the next couple of years (though intern year might be the most demanding in terms of sheer time).  

Ideas are appreciated.

**TLDR: Just started dating a medical resident.  Want to spend more time with her, but residency sucks and she has limited free time.  How do I ask her for more time without her feeling obligated?**"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Noma and Mikkeller are probably the biggest names when it comes about the new wave in danish cooking &amp; drinking. What do you think about pairing craft beer with food (I know that you had a partnership with Mikkeller at Noma\)? Can the beer replace the wine as a companion of food? And how do you see this craft beer movement in Europe, because in US it is a phenomenon?  How did Noma managed to recover after the scandal from 2013, when over 60 people became sick after eating in your restaurant? Can a scandal like this ruin a 2 Michelin Star reputation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih8c7?context=5)|1) Here's a few: **San Sebastián**, as a destination in and of itself, it needs to be tried. Coming to **Copenhagen** in August or September when the game season starts is really nice, although Copenhagen is not at all on the same level culinary wise as San Sebastián. It's great to visit it now to see the beginning of something that's still quite new and fresh. Then there's also La Boqueria Market in **Barcelona**. Wine bar hopping in **Paris** (there's a real boom of small fresh wine bars popping up), kick the experience off at Chateaubriand or Verre Vole with a lunch or dinner and have them recommend the next places- have them pass on the baton (it's a good way to travel, by letting the locals decide).  2) The craft beer movement is a real phenomenon here and has been for the past ten years. I don't think that beer will replace wine but I do think it will be more present going forward. It's a phenomenon that I personally really like, to see a bigger range and diversity of beers.  3) I think any restaurant can get over a tough moment like that but you have to be totally honest and tell everything the way it is to the public. Don't try to hide any details. Then people will quickly see that it's a situation that's almost beyond any chef or restaurants control.
[As someone who himself staged at some of the best restaurants in the world, do you have any particular perspective that you would like to share?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih53m?context=5)|Hey there,
[On a similar note, what is the typical experience for a stagiere at Noma?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih53m?context=5)|1) I loved being a stagier myself, it was an opportunity to travel and learn without the grueling responsibilities of being a full time employee. Back when I did it it was on my spare time, unlike today where staging is usually part of school program and I don't see it going away anytime soon. I think that it's a good way for young chefs to get a taste of real kitchen work. We see that from time to time interns are surprised that the reality is so different from their ideals, what they see on television, or what they learn at school about professional kitchen life.
[Do you believe that this is something that is possible in every location, so long as one just looks hard enough?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih53m?context=5)|2) About foraging: to me it's an extraordinary way for a cook to connect themselves to the place they're in but roaming about and tasting the different seasons, the plants, the mushrooms, the berries, the leaves. Throughout the year you really get connected to the place. I believe there's a wealth of forgotten ingredients still, and I think it should be as normal as peeling carrots for any cook to be able to (responsibly) harvest things in the wild. 
[Hi René, I'm a huge fan with a few small questions.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih7er?context=5)|Hey!
[What's your favorite ingredient to use?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih7er?context=5)|1) I don't actually have a favorite ingredient, but my favorite range would be anything from the plant kingdom.
[What are your favorite restaurants?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih7er?context=5)|2) Again I don't have a favorite restaurant, but I enjoy any place where food is cooked with generosity and honesty.
[What cookbooks do you recommend if any?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih7er?context=5)|3) If you're a budding chef then you should start by reading some of the classics, get a sense for sauce (or vinaigrette is), and after that head over to some of inspirational chefs of the world.
[What current big chefs are you a fan of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih7er?context=5)|4) There's too many to mention so I'll just focus on some of the up and coming ones: He may not be a -huge- world famous chef... yet, but Matt Orlando from restaurant Amass in Copenhagen ([Link to www.amassrestaurant.com](http://www.amassrestaurant.com/)) he is truly a talent and I love going to his restaurant. There's also Tatiana Levha from Paris, and the guys from Sixpenny in Australia. 
[Hello Rene, I am a very big fan of ours and I really hope that I will be able to visit your restaurant this year!  I have three questions to you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih4xc?context=5)|About the Michelin guide (or any rating system), that should really be a topic of its own because there's much to say-- to much for a quick answer! But basically if you go to work with accolades in mind as your primary motivation then I think you're on the road to a burnout. Go to work and find a way to make yourself happy in what you do. If the guides tap into it and like it then that's an added bonus.
[What is your opinion on the Michelin Guide and their rating system?   I’m coming from Poland and I read that you came a few years ago to my country with the Cook It Raw event.  How did you like Poland and our cusine?  And my last question how was the trip to Japan with the whole crew?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih4xc?context=5)|The trip to Japan was the biggest experience in my professional and private life. Being together with the team so intensely was inspiring and touching- even when I think of it just now I get the chills.
[Hi Chef, what's the best advice you have for someone who wants to quit their day job and go to culinary school? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqiipgq?context=5)|A lot of my cooking friends would say don't: don't because you're going to work 85 hours a week for no money, you're going to have cuts all over your body, and the chance of frequent humiliation from some chef is almost 100%. Yet this is the trade that I totally love, and I don't know anything else. It is a lot of work, yes, but it is extremely gratifying in terms of teamwork and friendship, and the fact that you get to make people happy every day, twice a day. If you do it well you'll end up being part of a community of cooks from your restaurant, former cooks, the farmers, some of your regulars... it becomes special. Something I can't be without. 
[I’ll be at noma on May 22, but what is another restaurant in Copenhagen that you would highly recommend I try while I’m there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqihn27?context=5)|Hey there,
 |You should definitely try [Relae](http://www.restaurant-relae.dk/en/), and  [Amass](www.amassrestaurant.com). Besides that there's [Geranium](http://geranium.dk/) as another fine dining option, and also [Kadeau](http://www.kadeau.dk/kbh_english.php) (especially if you go to their second location which is on Bornholm island, a short 15 minute flight away). For more casual dining check out [Bror](http://www.restaurantbror.dk/), or for breakfast go to [Cafe det Vide Hus](https://www.facebook.com/detvidehus). [Democratic Coffee](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Democratic-Coffee/147810001973306?fref=ts) has the best croissant in town. 
[Hi Chef! when is it a good time for a cook to leave a restaurant for another one? 1year? 2 years? when he stops learning?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqiicn5?context=5)|That's a good question! Me personally, I've only had a few jobs in my career. I've always stayed a while and each of the places I stayed in, there was more to learn. But a year is definitely the minimum if it's a place that follows the seasons and cooks up a full range of what's available... then you need a year to see everything, and in your second year you'll start to get more comfortable. We have people who have been in our kitchen for 7, 8, 9 years, and we're still all learning!
 |Find a place where they're really cooking and changing the menu and stay for a while. Stay for years. 
[Hi Chef Redzepi! You probably don’t remember me, but I took you to an espresso place with Lars in LA in 2012 to do some planning for food and science course at my university. I would just like to thank you for inspiring me to pursue a career in cooking instead of engineering.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih50m?context=5)|Hey Chef Jon! Thank you for coffee-- did I ever say that? ;-)
[What was going on through your head when you met Jiro?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih50m?context=5)|1) Meeting Jiro was truly nervewracking, I was awe-struck. Interesting note is that you're not supposed to shake his hand when meeting him because he doesn't want them polluted before touching the rice. I got to shake his hand though and as soon as I remembered I wasn't supposed to do that-- I almost shit myself, literally on the spot diarrhea. It's mindboggling to have two hours privately with a man that is full of wisdom the way he is.
[What’s the next step after Noma?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih50m?context=5)|2) I'm very happy in my situation doing Noma, the next step for me is doing the same, but better and better.
[What are some of your greatest failures and successes?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih50m?context=5)|3) Too many failures to talk about. The biggest joy I have running Noma is seeing staff fueled and ready to attack the world!
[Hello Rene. I am fairly new to the industry. I've been cooking professionally for a little over two years without any prior education in the field. A year and a half in I landed a gig as the executive chef of a restaurant that had a poor reputation with food and a limited kitchen in the basement. Almost exactly a year later we are moving forward with building a brand new open kitchen upstairs and have become known as one of the best restaurants in our town and surrounding area. My two questions are: how have you dealt with success and maintained a level head? And what is your secret to keeping your staff happy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqiho54?context=5)|1) Success is great but it comes with complications. Will you get absorbed in success and have that be your guiding light? Or will you just keep focused on why you entered cooking? Which for me was a wish to explore ingredients (and the seasons), be with people, and also because I love eating.
 |2) Keeping staff happy is also one of the keys to a great success and it's always hard striking that balance between a work with pressure and high intensity and also a good spirited, nurturing environment. It's difficult in the kitchen. But one thing you shouldn't do, and take this from a guy that's been a fucking lunatic for many of the opening years (at Noma): don't start shouting! It doesn't do anything good to your team or anybody else. Find a way to get your message through without being a fucking asshole. :)

338vpw,7,2015-04-20,"23 Living in London, Need help and advice. (Warning long post....",viv_richards,IndustrialDesign,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndustrialDesign/comments/338vpw/23_living_in_london_need_help_and_advice_warning/,"Hi everyone,

I have a bit of a strange situation here…. I am desperate to get into Industrial Design / Product Design but feel as though I have very little options available to me…

Firstly, a bit of information about myself. I’m 23 and grew up in Perth, Western Australia. I currently live in London after moving here 9 months ago. Both of my parents are artists and have always been surrounded by a design culture.

I worked in Perth as an artist’s assistant helping build and (some) design development on small and large scale public artworks. I worked mostly hands on in the workshop in the construction phase, but I have always had a love for design and engineering. I love building and developing ideas then turning them into reality in a workshop, playing with different materials. Testing what works and what doesn’t.

I originally studied architecture after taking a gap year from high school. During the gap year I travelled through Europe and America and really began to take a large interest in design and architecture.

 I deferred my degree after completing 1 semester. I had planned to transfer to a university in Sydney, but a breakup with my past girlfriend put that on hold whilst I planned to travel again.

After returning from travelling I worked for an artist who was just beginning to explore kinetic sculptures and artworks. I realised that I had great interest in industrial design / mechatronics. I contemplated enrolling in a mechatronics degree back in Perth, but I’m not 100% sure that would be the right path for me.

My father always pushed the idea of industrial design, but in Perth it never seemed like a viable career option. There isn’t much of a manufacturing industry and the university course offered back in Perth at Curtin University is sort of a large joke… They have bundled fashion, jewellery, furniture and product design into a sub-par course that would be a waste of a lot of money.

Anyway, after moving to London I worked for a really interesting company that was working on some cool artworks. I began to discover how large of an industry industrial design is around the world and learnt some really amazing things. I freelanced for a few companies, putting some sets together for a few photo shoots and a couple of other interesting projects.

I have a little bit of self-taught experience with solid works, sketch-up and some Autocad. Always eager to upskill and learn more. I also have some coding experience with javascript and I am well versed in HTML5 and CSS.

After working for a few of months, having the time of my life, I had a workplace injury and was all of a sudden unable to work for two months… Now I’m stuck working a depressing IT job to pay the bills and rent. I am going insane!

I have tried to explore what options I have to break into the field in London… And this is where I feel quite limited.

I can’t study over here at a university as the £16,000 fee for international students is extremely expensive. I am unable to access public funds or get a loan to study unless I have been living here for 3 years.

I applied for an apprenticeship and was called the next day saying I would be a great candidate… But again, you must have been living in the UK for 3 years to be able to get an apprenticeship.
I’m not really sure what I can do here. I am extremely keen to learn / and develop myself in any way possible. 

What should I be exploring? I am more than happy to work as a receptionist / intern / anything that would help me get a foot in the door. I am an extremely hard worker, I just want to be working on something that will help me move forward. I can’t wait 2 years to be able to study again whilst working a dead end job. I would love to earn a degree, I just need to find a way to keep progressing while I move towards the 3 year mark. If anyone could offer any advice, or let me know of any other options I have missed I would be extremely grateful. 

I love browsing this sub-reddit, and I am always fascinated by the work you guys do and the insights you are able to offer other people who need guidance.

Thanks for reading!

**TL;DR:** Want to break into industrial design in London. Study and apprenticeships aren’t an option for me at the moment. What else can I do?

My boyfriend and I are moving to DC this summer for internships, and we have not had any luck finding an apartment. We are looking to relocate early June and stay until mid to late August. 

**Location:** My office is downtown (near Furragut West metro stop), so preferably somewhere in the area or within a short train ride. 

**Floor Plan**: one bedroom/studio. However, not ruling out shared two bedroom apartment

**Price/Budget**: &gt;$1800-$2000

**Other**: Prefer furnished, with Wifi included. 
We really need a furnished apartment, or at least one with a bed. We live in the midwest so the less we have to bring, the better.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! I have tried Craigslist, but nothing has worked out (scams, not within our time frame, etc.).

I'm wrapping up my second year of a double mechanical/electrical major with a comp sci minor. 

I'm doing very well; finishing off this year with above a 3.8. However, I'm finding it very hard to find a company that will hire me.
I have plenty of electrical and mechanical experience as I did FIRST Robotics in high school and have two labs weekly. However, I've applied to over 40 places and have only heard back from 2. Many want a student who already has technical work experience.

So how am I supposed to get the first internship if no one will take me without previous intern experiences?

I appreciate any insight and help.
Others are free to post their work experiences also. I'd love to get some opinions.

Also, if there is a better subreddit to post in, just let me know.

Thanks!"

Does it take up so much time that living takes a back seat?,Lagsta,TheAgora,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAgora/comments/338z30/whats_the_point_of_the_working_fulltime_life_does/,"This is a bit of a... controversial question. It's not something my parents and I see eye to eye on, and I get a strong feeling it's something most people may think about when it comes time to start working full-time.

I've decided to have a discussion here in the hopes I can get some interesting and varied responses from people in different stages of life and their careers.

_



I'm 24 and my working life is fast approaching the full-time shedule. I've always dreaded this stage and I've enjoyed part time and casual work because of the freedom it offers you.

Lately I've been doing an internship for 2 days a week and it's given me the first taste of the professional 9-5 working life.

Currently I wake up at about 8am and arrive home at roughly 7:30pm (9:30am - 6:30pm working hours). That's 11.5 hours of my day dedicated to work. Obviously I'm not working all those hours, but the preparation and transit time is a write off in my books. I then might go to sleep at 12-1am giving me approx 5-6 hours of 'free' time.

The 8/8/8 day split works on paper but I can't see it happening much in the real world.

_

I was chatting with my aunty the other day and she talked about her job she recently retired from after 30 years and said: ""They don't call it work because it's fun"" and it really stuck with me. Is the general consensus among average, 1st world citizens that working full-time, 10-12 hours a day for 5 days every week for the foreseeable future a necessary burden that you need to carry?

I feel that working 5 days a week and living for 2 just doesn't make sense and (here's the morbid part) does that really make life worth living at all? Do we need the constant drudgery and mundane lifestyle to make the fun, free times feel more precious?

I just want a place to vent and see if someone else who has been in my situation has some insight.

I have been avoiding looking at my bank account for about a week now because I knew I wasn't going to be happy with what I saw.  After I pay my car payment, rent, and utilities, I will have $188 in my bank account.  

Everything was going fine until a few weeks ago when the transmission on my car went out.  $5000 to fix a car that was worth maybe $7000.  So I had to put down a down payment on a used car which really set me back.

I had an internship up until Friday that was allowing me to just stay ahead of my bills.  It had the possibility of an extension which I desperately needed or else I didn't know what I would do.  Well here I am, with no idea what to do. 

I'm a college student, without a job, and I'm not going to be able to pay rent next month. Let alone my car payment.  

Under normal circumstances I would have my parents to fall back on, but my dad has been out of work for almost a year now and I'm sure they are in the same financial situation as me.  

I feel like I have no where to turn and I honestly don't know where I am going to be in two months time.

Does anyone have any suggestion for what I can do?"

I think it's time to call it quits on my job hunt and find something else. I'm a little surprised that after a year that I can't still secure a job in what's supposedly a ""high in demand field."" I had some close calls, but for one reason or another, the potential employers can't/won't hire me.

I saw that a lot of STEM majors end up getting jobs outside of STEM, [according to this article](http://www.governing.com/news/headlines/gov-where-stem-graduates-are-finding-jobs.html). The article admits that the numbers might be skewed because the definition of a STEM job isn't very solid and other factors. But I'll go with the assumption I'm that 1 in 2 computer degree that can't get a job in his field. Or at least, I'll try to find some solace in that.

I tried what little advice I could find for people like me in this subreddit. I wasn't looking to apply to the Big 4 or that nonsense, but there were some useful tidbits here and there: Work on projects. Put them on GitHub. Post on LinkedIn and Dice. Get your resume checked. Try a staffing company. Read Cracking the Coding Interview. Etc. None of that worked.

I read Jeff Atwood's post [""So You Don't Want to be a Programmer After All""](http://blog.codinghorror.com/so-you-dont-want-to-be-a-programmer-after-all/), and I was hoping to brainstorm some ideas of other possible jobs. I think I have to put my dreams of getting into software development on hold. While I didn't do many internships, I did a lot of customer service and tech support work. I hope to leverage that. Any suggestions?

EDIT: Resume in PDF form is ~~here~~. All kinds of redactions (out of my own paranoia), so if anything reads funny, just ask."
33997b,12,2015-04-20,Feel like I'm drowning under all this stress,throw_me_away1739,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/33997b/feel_like_im_drowning_under_all_this_stress/,"I'm a college student, and spring semesters are always harder for me for some reason. Currently I have several long essays that are due in about a week or so, and I haven't really started any of them and can't even motivate myself enough to start caring enough to work on them right now.

But that's just normal baseline stress, I thought I could handle it. however, a few days ago, I got an email from the manager at the apartment complex I was supposed to move into this may, saying that it is 'against their policy' to rent to undergraduates, even though they never said anything in the contract/application, and didn't mention this when I put down my deposit and signed my lease agreement in January. In my state, students aren't protected under fair housing laws, so they can discriminate against me based on my undergraduate status. Now, I need to figure out how to find a place to live in 10 days, which I think I can probably manage but I just feel so let down by this loss. I was really excited about finally being able to rent an apartment by myself (no roommates) in a perfect location, and that was something that got me through a really difficult semester and annoying roommates. I feel anxious about finding a new place to live, and I'm fairly certain I won't find anything better. They also haven't definitively gotten back to me from the original place (they're considering exemptions for juniors and seniors) but I really wish I could just know so that I could react accordingly. I can't figure out if this is worth getting a lawyer over, but it probably isn't. 

In addition to that, I can't stop seeming to loathe my body and obsessively exercise and count calories. I weigh about 117.8 and I'm 5 ft 4, so by no means and I fat or even close to chubby, in fact I'm skinnier than I've been for most of my adult life. I can't get past it though. I think its because over winter break, I was visiting home and some guy I had a huge crush on in high school commented about how I lost a lot of weight since high school and looked a lot better now. I thought was over him, but this sparked a desire in me to be even more thin because I wanted to be more attractive. As a result, throughout this semester, I've been very stressed and felt a lot of guilt surrounding eating, which has resulted essentially in no net loss or gaining of weight because I'll do that stupid thing where I'll severely restrict myself for a few days, followed by an inevitable loss of will power and binge eating where I tell myself that I should just accept myself. Neither is really healthy, but its like I can't really stop.

Another kind of constant stress that I have been feeling lately is that stereotypical college student stress. I decided to switch majors this year, but i'm a junior so I feel weird because I'm in my 3rd year of college with the useful skills in my desired field about equivalent to that of a freshman. I'm taking classes this summer - I knew I should probably have tried to apply for internships, but I didn't believe in myself at all or that anyone would think I was worth anything useful, so I didn't bother even applying. I also feel like I'm going to be in school forever now. I'm blessed to be in a very good place financially, with parents who can support me in school for as long as I need to, but I'm starting to feel like I'm going nowhere in life and don't even know what I want. I don't even know if I like the field I'm going into, but I just want to fucking stick with something I know is decently hirable instead of switching around and being in school until I'm 30 or something.

Also, I'm worried that I won't have very many friends next year. I actually had friends this year, but it was primarily because I was really involved on the debate team, and went to all the tournaments over the weekends, traveled with the team, etc. and I know I can't handle doing that much again, but I feel like that was how I made and continued to maintain friends. I know I need to cut back on that because I was way overcommitted this year, and as an introvert I found it particularly exhausting, but since I'm not good at making or maintaining friendships, I'm  worried about keeping the friendships I have if I cut down on that main avenue of socializing with them. 

So, you probably didn't read this wall of text, and I don't really blame you. I just needed to get it off my chest and I had such a high baseline of stress, and I was so excited about moving into that new apartment, that finding out that its apparently against their policy to rent to undergraduates and that I have to find a new place to live in 10 days was just the last straw for me. I just feel like I'm drowning.

Tl;dr: college student with a high baseline stress due to school/finals/essays/friends/social anxiety/depression/existential crises, recently found out that the amazing apartment I was going to move into (and live alone for the first time) in 10 days decided they don't lease to students, and dealing with the letdown of not being able to live alone somewhere I was really excited about and having to find a new place to live is just pushing over the edge. I feel like i'm drowning."
339a0o,24,2015-04-20,My Vanishing Rosary,CustosClavium,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/339a0o/my_vanishing_rosary/,"In 2006 I purchased [the rosary](http://i.imgur.com/Ze4F2) from a mail-order catalogue that I had gotten from some Franciscan Friars after submitting my email address to one of their websites during an online purchase. I had many rosaries at the time, having very recently ‘reverted’ to Catholicism after several years of atheism, but I really wanted it and it was only $9. It was made at a Benedictine monastery in Brazil. 

The beads and crucifix are wooden and it is strung together with a simple cord. Inlaid in the centerpiece and in the crucifix are small Jubilee Medals, which were designed by the Benedictine order in honor of their founder. It is a small rosary, just large enough to wrap around my wrist twice. Probably designed for a child’s hands. I just thought it was neat, and wanted something I could carry in my pocket and not have to worry about getting hopelessly tangled with my other belongings; something rugged and durable that I could take anywhere and not worry.

And so I did. It went with me on hikes and adventures in the woods of South Carolina with my dog. I’ve seen Flogging Molly about 6 times since I got it, and it’s survived all of my shenanigans as I fought for or maintained my position right in the front row of every show. It’s been on many camping trips and treks through the desert and mountains of Arizona. Countless plane trips. It was with me in college, which is where it got interesting. I ended up going to a college run by Benedictine monks. It survived drunken and stoned trips to bonfire parties in the woods on campus. It made it through countless dorm moves and parties and road trips. I always felt good knowing it was right there in my pocket.

It’s been with me through many events and helped me through them by doing what it was made for: being a devotion to pray with. It has been prayed with many, many times since 2006. Prayed with before and after confessions. Before and after major exams. Strains with friendships. Vocational Discernment. Death in the family. Depression. Thanksgiving. All the reasons one might pray, and with it I did. An internship in college took me to yet another Benedictine monastery where I was working alongside monks and other students. One of the monks became a good friend, something like a brother to me. Upon his ordination to the priesthood, I realized I had never had my rosary blessed, so he did me the honor. Now the rosary was not just a source of comfort to me, not just a useful and valued tool for prayer, but it was a reminder of the things I had done during that internship and the friendships I made, especially with this monk. 

As you now know, this rosary is very, very important to me. Here, 9 years later, and it is in my pocket right now. So what is the glitch? Months ago I moved into a studio apartment. I have one main room, a closet, and a bathroom. I live simply: I have a TV, a bed, a dresser, coffee table, and a bookshelf for furniture. I keep things mostly organized. Not neat, but organized. If I misplace something, I can easily find it. Every night, I keep my rosary wrapped around my wrist. It’s only put aside for a shower. After mass one Sunday I decide to go see a movie. I live right next to my parish, and the theatre is less than a 15 minute walk from my apartment. I had to hop a small brick wall there and back. I came home, went about my business for the day, and settled in for bed that night. I reached into my pocket: no rosary. I figured it was somewhere inside, shrugged it off, and went to sleep. 

The next day I searched but could not find it. When I came home from work, I decided to turn my apartment upside down. I checked every counter in the kitchen and bathroom. I checked every drawer, cabinet, and shelf. I rifled through every pocket in every pair of pants and shorts I owned. I even checked inside of socks in case my rosary somehow fell in and somehow landed in a perfect way to get inside a sock. I took the pillows off my bed and removed the pillow cases. I peeled each blanket and sheet off the bed, shook them out, and cast them aside on the other side of the room. I pulled up my mattress and box springs, scanned the floor, flipped them over, and put them back. Nothing. Nowhere. My rosary literally vanished from the apartment. I went back and retraced my steps from my apartment to church and then from my apartment to the theatre and back. I checked the theatre’s lost and found. Twice. It simply vanished. 

About 6 weeks passed. I had cleaned the apartment a few times as part of my normal routine and given up hope long ago after a prayer to St. Anthony and St. Benedict seemingly went unanswered. I figured it has slipped out of my pocket in the theatre and someone else found it. I hoped that whoever had it was praying with it and that it was helping their faith in some way. One night I got a call from a friend I had a pretty hard crush on, and he said some things that really upset me. I was sad and hung up on him. I went to collapse on my bed in a fit as the tears began to well up, and upon collapsing onto the best, I felt the cold, smooth surface of the beads against my hand, and looked down in sheer disbelief as I grasped at them, hearing that all-to-familiar clicking as beads hit each other. There it was, my rosary, laying right on top of the bed I had neatly made that morning and slept in ever night for the last 6 weeks. 

I don’y know if this classifies as a glitch in the matrix or just St. Anthony and St. Benedict being bros and taking their time about it, but it certainly stunned me. I still don’t know what to think of it. "

Todays episode: The Intern returns for one more battle.


[In our last episode](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/32mdjx/the_security_filter_the_manglement_and_the/) our brave adventure Shane/Gandalf the Grey, the coding wizard was kicked out of his job in his local call centre for a Gambling Company that we will call GamblingHQ and was hired back the next day working in IT support and security.


Shane was hired as an intern who had a huge array of knowledge for programming, the guy was fluent in Assembly, Basic, C+, Haskell, HTML, Python, Java and Java Script. He worked as an intern for about a month, getting to know the local systems, getting tested to see how he could handle hardware and to see what type of work he would be best suited for.


They soon found out that hardware wasn't a big strength of his and trained him for a while, but more importantly they promoted him to a development position where he would monitor company data as a sysadmin as well as develop new software. (The companies betting software was, at that time, mature at best)

Now he would monitor times for calls, data speeds, MB size of transmissions, heat readings for server rooms, log in times for employees as well as filters for the local internet. He even monitored cameras to the call center itself so he could see if there was a physical explanation for any anomalies.


Fortunately a lot of the work was run by well made, audio alerting scripts that made some humorous alerts (If there was a download cap was broken at a computer, they had Nelly's 'Hot in here' play or if one of the staff was locked out of their accounts, the system rang out saying 'Unlock the door, open the latch' in an automated voice) so most of Shane's work involved developing the new software.


However, Shane was the inquisitive type and noted a couple of anomalies that weren't picked up by scripts and yet would still look ok if you didn't look too deeply.


The first matter that came to attention was the filter system, now GamblingHQ had an internet filter system that worked on keywords showing up. I.e xxx, games, computer programming and so on.


But more importantly, **the filter was calibrated for each specific member of staff**. 


Now the frontline staff taking bets all had a blanket ban on most obvious sites but they could put in requests with their manager for access to certain sites once they passed the 2 month internship and were made permanent. I.e They could request access to Reddit for example.


And these access changes could be made by managers as well as IT staff. If you've read the previous story, you know where I'm going with this. Remember how staff were fired if there were too many hits on the filter, whether they were explainable or not?

Well Shane had a look through the filter logs and spotted that a set of specific staff were having their filter's keywords altered in a way that would make it next to impossible not to trigger the filter. 

Keep in mind, this is a betting company, they took bets on Horse Racing, Football, Basketball, Tennis and any other list of bets you want to make.

**The keywords were being changed to football result pages for certain staff or for Basketball team names. It would even generate hits on the sites own website**




Shane checks the logs for previous employees and soon noticed a pattern emerging, the changes were coming from two main managers, lets call them Wilma and Wendy (not their real names obviously), and he recalled that those two managers werent very fond of the agents that are having their filters changed.


He believes that the two managers are changing filters so employees they dont like are removed from their jobs, but of course, he was fired from their call center, it could be seen as a conflict of interest. **Furthermore, Wilma was the manager who originally gave him his marching orders.**


So he goes to his boss (first rule of IT: Cover your ass and document everything) and explains the situation and says that he wants to run an audit of all call center managers e-activity, not just the two floor managers. He believed that there may be more than just the filters that were being changed.

Fortunately, the log system was very comprehensive throughout the building, they had logs for call times, when you log in, when you use your access card, who you've called, your hours worked, every and any bit of data, that went through a computer or server on the public network was logged. The company was very cautious over records as they had been sued before over betting issues.


*And just in case you're wondering, all of the staff were aware of most of the logs, a few of the new staff didnt know their access card use was logged but that was about it.*

So an audit request was sent through, it took about a week for clearance as all managers had to be made aware of the audit and some reports had to be signed off on as they dealt with sensitive informations i.e Pay, Address, hours, disciplinary reports and so on.

But soon, more than a few patterns were emerging involving a group of 5 people.

* Wilma and Wendy: The floor managers. Mgt1 + Mgt2.
* The accounting manager, we'll name her GinnyAC. 
* One of the frontline staff, we'll call him DeanFL.
* One of the HR managers in charge of both hiring and dismissals, Amos. HRD.

What were the patterns? The log in times didnt match, filters were changed consistantly, staff were working suspiciously long hours and making large bonuses for good statistics and an embezzlement scheme was shown that in a period of 2 and a half years, **more than 200,000 euro was stolen from the company and over 37 staff may have been unfairly dismissed.**

&gt; Shane: Hey boss, come check these figures, there are huge discrepancies here.
&gt; Bossman: Oh oh is the system auto locking again?
&gt; Shane: Just come look...

TL:DR Gandalf is reborn as Gandalf the White and comes back to fight his old foes the Balrog and his Uruk-Hai for one last battle, what happens to the beasts is yet unknown.......

I have been in IT for about two years, my first year was in an internship, which I enjoyed but there was alot of down time and felt I didnt learn much hands on. After the internship I landed a pretty decent job as a network admin. But to be honest my job duties feels alot like technical support. On top of that there is alot of down time as well (find myself bored). I do study on my down time and have built a few labs, but to me thats not the same as hands on type of stuff.
I am starting to look for a job, if I look for a similar job title, the scope of the work they require is above me. So should I look technical support job or a help desk?? When I do look at these I feel like I am over qualified and will not learn anything.
Its like im stuck somewhere in the middle and don't know which route to take. I would even take a pay cut if it allowed me to learn and grow my knowledge.
Do I take a step back to help desk or a noc position and hope I can climb the ranks there?"

I was wondering if there are any Computer Science majors on here that could offer some insight on what you like or dislike about your Computer Science program at NKU.  How are the computer science faculty there?  Do they help students find internships? How hard is it to get a job working at the Center for Applied Informatics or work with a faculty member on CS research?

I'm a fairly high level software developer at a start up.  Not top of the pile by any means, but I do interviews, have a say in our hiring choices, manage key projects etc.

Here's my situation:  My company is awesome.  Our culture is great, our work is interesting and its just a pleasure to work here.  Our dev team has a lot of talent, smarts and personality.  While other parts of the organization have representation of both male and female employees, the dev team does not.

I've brought this up with my manager, who was in complete agreement that this was an issue that we wanted to tackle.  During our last hiring run (interns, and one full time position) we sent out multiple emails, postings etc... to various women in tech organizations seeking resumes for interviews.  While we received multiple strong candidates, I didn't see a single resume from a female candidate.

I can't hire a person I can't interview/talk to/see the resume of, so I've identified increasing the number of qualified female candidates that we see as the primary first goal for solving this.

Is this a good starting place?  Should I be thinking about this differently?   How would you recommend I go about achieving this?  I feel the problem must be that we're not finding the audience, not that the audience doesn't exist."

Takes a few seconds only!,SmilingMango,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/339w84/simply_vote_and_you_can_help_pay_for_my_study/,"Hi everyone, I posted this a few days ago but I had permission to post this again. **Please, I need all the help I can get!** We are currently in 2nd place and we absolutely have to blow this out of the water in order to win. The competition is fierce and we're really close. Thanks so much! 

I'm currently a third year undergraduate college student majoring in Public Health Sciences. This summer, I will be studying abroad in Bali, Indonesia, where I will be interning with an NGO (non-governmental organization) to complete the fieldwork requirement for my major. It's a really wonderful program. I will spend 5 weeks getting hands-on experience doing what I love, exploring my career path, and developing my character. In addition, I will be traveling and exploring the beautiful island of Bali with my lovely girlfriend, Public Health professor, and a handful of other students who are also doing the program. In addition to the internship, there will, of course, be lots of fun activities throughout the weekdays and weekends as well as many tourist attractions. I'm 20, I live in the US, and I've never been outside of the country! It's a great opportunity for me to step out of my comfort zone, and I really believe that there's so much out there that I can learn and grow from. What a way to spend my summer, right? 

Here's the thing: traveling 9000+ miles is *expensive*. Fortunately, I'm currently partaking in a scholarship competition where the grand prize winner will receive FREE round-trip airfare to his/her study abroad location of choice. My girlfriend and I worked together and created a video that I believe embodies three key aspects of international study: 1) Understand and appreciate cultural differences, 2) Be courageous and unafraid to get a little uncomfortable, and 3) Encourage students to be see the best in others. Although we both worked on the video together, I turned in the submission, and.. we made it to the Top 10! Now is where things get a little tough. I need your help, Reddit! The only way to win is to get the most Likes and Shares out of everyone else on the Top 10 on the Summit Global Facebook Page. Subsequently, the winner will receive the grand prize (allow me to reiterate), which is a fully paid-for plane ticket to Bali and back to the US. This will definitely help alleviate the financial burden on my girlfriend and I.

Here is what you have to do. Just click the link below, and it will redirect you to a Facebook photo on the Summit Global Education Facebook page. Scroll down, hit the Like button, and you're done! If you want to, you can even share it and it will count as an additional vote since votes are based on Likes and Shares. I would be eternally grateful if you could take just a few seconds out of your busy day to participate and help me pay for my airfare.

**Voting ends on May 1st, 2015!!**

If you have questions about the program, studying abroad in general, or anything related or unrelated to ask/say, please feel free to do so in the comments or personally message me. I'll be more than happy to share with you everything I know, and I am more than happy to hear your thoughts and opinions. Thank you again, I truly appreciate your help! :)

339wkw,16,2015-04-20,[Tinfoil hat post] Something abnormal I've been noticing at College Confidential.,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/339wkw/tinfoil_hat_post_something_abnormal_ive_been/,"What if, just what if, there is a large-scale conspiracy at CollegeConfidential.com. We've all had our motivation crushed at one point because we came across a post where a kid with a 36 ACT, 4.0 GPA, multiple international awards, and published papers asks whether he can get into his local college that has an acceptance rate of 85%. But what if it's just a huge hoax to stop somewhat qualified people to applying to selective schools? I've noticed a few, somewhat suspicious trends there...

Firstly, the awards people say they gotten are vague or just outside-the-ones-that-get-listed-online that verification is almost always impossible. Go check out the SCEA results of [MIT](http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/massachusetts-institute-technology/1717092-mit-class-of-2019-ea-results-thread.html) or [Harvard](http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/harvard-university/1714730-official-harvard-university-2019-scea-decisions-only.html). Look through them and try to look up their awards. Nada. I've only came across ~~one~~ two students that had their award come up on the Internet. 

Another trend I've been noticing is the lack of a distinct standard distribution. I see three types of people that say they've gotten accepted (well actually four but I'll get to that). The first type is the person with about a 2200 SAT, a 3.9ish GPA and a state prize and a few internships; the type of student that you say ""Oh! Wow!"" to but not “holy shit you’re probably an alien”. The second type is the person who has been the secretary of a senator, 4.0 GPA, 2400 SAT with 4 SAT Subject Tests over 780, a few publications in Scientific Journals and placed 4th or 5th in National competitions and got accepted. Basically a person that you cannot comprehend how they're not giving ted-talks. And finally the third type: the type of person that beat the first type in almost everything but didn't get in. This type has stats slightly lower than type 2 but much higher than type 1. Why did they get rejected instead of the group 1ers?

Another thing I noticed is the people precisely fitting, and exaggerating, racial stereotypes. They are either Asians with REALLY higher scores, basically like the people in group 2 but that have gotten rejected. Another common reoccurrence I see is African-American/black people with REALLY low scores that have gotten accepted. Are these stereotypes sometimes true? Yes but The GPAs to acceptance for different races aren’t as dramatic as CC posts show them to be. Just check the Decisions threads and you'll probably see this. A few students claimed to have SAT scores of under 1800 and mediocre extra curricular activities but yet claim to have gotten into Princeton, all of them claiming to be black. Also, in another thread, an Asian with jaw dropping everything didn't get into a single school, and got wait-listed at Hopkins. Check the treads out and you'll see quite a few examples of this.

And lastly, when results threads are posted in smaller sub-forums, the thread starts with a lot of group 1ers then evolves into the classic overtake of the thread by group two and three-ers. Check our results threads in the India or Canada sub-forum for example; you’ll see this trend. 

Cunning tactics are nothing new to selective college additions; there have been an uncountable number of acceptance scandals; people paying to get their essay written, bribing councilors, cheating on the SAT… there has literally been a scandal for every single thing that carries weight on college additions, so why not a little forum manipulation to discourage qualified applicants in both themselves and the application process? I haven’t slept in like two days so this might just be the rambling of a sleep deprived brain rapped in aluminum foil but what do you think? Have you noticed anything like this?


**TLDR: Maybe there is a large-scale conspiracy on collegeconfidential.com trying to discourage qualified applicants from applying by making it seem harder than it is and to make people lose trust in the application system**

1) I'm at the gym and can't concentrate. You're on the bike in front of me, wearing yoga pants with ""JUICY"" on the back and bending over to accentuate those gorgeous curves. You know guys come here solely to look at you riding a bike, wishing you were riding THEM.

I'm one of them. I'm 6'3"" with blonde hair and brown eyes, and was thinking about quitting the gym until you showed up. I'm single and mortal, so I kept coming at the same time every day just to see you work on your perfect body.

Finally, after what seems like an eternity, I work up the courage to say hi. I wait until you're done (out of courtesy, of course!), and I walk up to you with what seems like the whole world watching.

""Hi,"" I say, somehow managing to not stammer. ""Seen you around a lot. You new to the area?""

---

2) I've taken a side job editing video for a shady client. It pays good money, and I just found out why: He's the manager for local strip clubs, and these are audition tapes he sends up the food chain to his boss.

In doing this, I discover that you, an intern at the office I work in, are also stripping on the side (and possibly doing other things, too). The sight of you grinding on the pole and on the big cock of some guy judging lap dances, all with your big breasts and out-of-this-world ass barely covered by a bikini, makes me REALLY turned on.

It's 5:30, nobody's in the office but us, and I've decided to let you know I know your dirty secret.

---

3) You're at a wild party or club. Take your pick: Pool party, nightclub, strip club, etc. Wherever you are, you're wearing that one outfit in the back of your closet. You know, the outfit that does a great job of covering up very little. Maybe you're a horny college co-ed on spring break, or part of a bachelorette party, a cougar looking for a young guy, or, if you want to get really raunchy, a stripper/hooker who just wants cock.

Regardless, you see me. I'm easy to spot: I'm tall (6'3""), with blonde hair, brown eyes, and a VERY big erection in my pants. I'm in the VIP area, with plenty of booze to go around. Come see me, have a drink (or seven), and let's get filthy.

---

4) You're the neighborhood MILF and you know it. You spend days on end lounging by the pool in your bathing suit, which barely covers your gigantic fake tits and shapely ass. One day, I see you from out of my apartment window. Your husband is never home, and you've resorted to exhibitionism, pleasuring yourself in full view of many apartments.

---

5) Anything you want that fits into the below kinks!

---

Turn-ons: Dirty talk (an absolute must), big breasts/titfucking, oral (both giving and receiving), bad girls (the raunchier the better; I've got a smoking fetish, and it's fun to work alcohol into these stories, too). If you're interested in RP'ing with a particular look, some of my current favorite porn stars are Phoenix Marie, Madison Ivy, Kianna Dior, Sandee Westgate, Brooklyn Chase, and Amy Anderssen.

Turn-offs: Animals, blood/gore, scat/piss, BDSM."

He is currently doing an internship about 150 miles away, but we usually see each other about every two weeks for a day or two. He has been gone since January and won't return until August. I could deal with this, except he's asked to do an open relationship while he is away. He's never really had any physical relationships with other women besides just a one night stand one time, so I can see why he'd want to play the field a little bit before deciding to take it to the next level with me (we have discussed living together, engagement for the future but he's not ready for that yet). An open LDR is not really something I want, but he's amazing in so many ways and it devastates me to think about leaving him over this.

The problem is that I'm having a really hard time dealing with it because I have always tended to be the insecure one in the relationship. It's really hard to trust that he's not going to find someone better, especially because we no longer get to have that intimacy that we used to have when we could physically be together. Has anyone else done an open LDR? How do you deal with the jealousy and insecurity?"

Some background: I have an engineering degree in an unrelated field from one of the best schools in Canada. Shortly after graduating I started regretting the discipline I chose, and as I'd always found programming interesting and enjoyable I decided to enroll in a second bachelors. I transferred most of my first year credits(intro to compsci/some math courses), and just finished two semesters of full course load. 

Some of the technically relevant courses I took are:
A still relatively introductory CS course (Python)
A more advanced software dev course (Java/Android)
A course in computer organization

Originally I was planning on not looking for a coop or internship until after second year, but my financial situation has taken a turn for the worst and I've started considering my options. Is an internship at this stage of my education a realistic option?

I feel very comfortable with data structures, basic algorithms, and was planning on working through Cracking The Coding interview over the summer, as well as starting up on CLRS (recommended by some upper year friends). I read somewhere when searching for related questions that a sign of being ready is ability to do well in an interview, if I have a good grasp of the more common questions do I have a chance, or will my lack of experience in actual applications of computer science fail me.

I don't have any personal projects outside of coursework, as I was planning on using this coming summer to start up on some ideas I have. 

Sorry for the wall of text, I've searched a lot for a Q/A that has addressed the finer points of what I'm asking (having a previous degree) and couldn't find. Would appreciate any insight anyone can provide to someone new to the industry/scene!"

To those of you who are doubtlessly wondering ""goodness, when will this #&amp;%! come to an end?,"" I can thankfully promise you that I will definitely make the fifth update the final one. Regardless of how this whole thing ends, I really do owe quite a bit of gratitude to everyone here on /r/confessions for putting up with me even when I begin to sound particularly fatalistic or neurotic. 

My circumstances are not improving markedly, but I suppose that this shouldn't be entirely unexpected. Just a few days ago, I visited my doctor again for the follow-up visit I was required to schedule at my last appointment (apparently, for anyone who comes in with the symptoms I originally complained of, a follow-up visit is strongly recommended). I asked my doctor about the HIV test I took - according to her, it isn't necessary for me to wait three months and take the test again. She claimed that my exposure (i.e. non-sexual contact with unspecified blood) was ""low-risk"" and ""extremely unlikely to result in infection;"" additionally, I was told that the 4th generation HIV test is ""extremely sensitive"" and should give a valid result after a five week period. This is actually a pretty confusing matter - the fourth generation test is not commonly used at health clinics/doctor's offices here in the US, and I only had access to it because of my university's medical center. Since the fourth generation test isn't commonly given out here in the US, there aren't many official guidelines about *when* its results can be considered conclusive - however, in the UK (where the test is *commonly* employed), it still remains common practice to only consider HIV test results conclusive after a negative result three months following initial exposure (the fourth generation test is offered to patients falling within the window period, but the results are always confirmed by a second test.) Some patients take as long as six months for detectable antibodies, but those are usually rare cases involving patients with leukemia, transplanted organs, or PEP treatment. At three months, I can be about 99.1% sure that I do not have HIV, and for all intents and purposes, that would be the limits of medical accuracy. 

Despite my doctor's reassurances, I don't want to live with the knowledge that I might have a 15-25% chance of having HIV (if it were any other condition, that sort of uncertainty might be tolerable, but with something like this, you absolutely do not want to take chances). I'm planning on finishing off the testing within the three month anniversary, and finally, I will submit to a final battery of blood tests for other viral/bacterial illnesses transmissible through blood that might result in my symptoms (fever, headache, groin pain, sores on my chest/mouth, and fatigue) - that's a pretty long list of potential causes (unfortunately, some of them can also be acquired through sexual contact, although thankfully, none are nearly as bad as HIV). Thanks to our wonderful healthcare system here in America, even though I'm paying for a lot of this without the usage of insurance, my future insurance premiums will absolutely skyrocket as a result of having an HIV test (among other *things*) on record - merely having this kind of lab work performed is enough to get me sorted into the ""high risk"" coverage pool. On the bright side, my previously frugal/miserly habits are really benefiting me - if I hadn't saved up so much in the past, then it would be impossible for me to even research the cause of my illness due to financial concerns.

Now, as for the school front, I'm not sure what to make of my present predicament. My grades still aren't fantastic, and I'm not sure if I'm even passing one of my classes at the moment. Finals are in May, and even if I do pass all of my current classes, I will still probably end up being forced to take a break from campus for a semester or two (assuming that I don't just get kicked out if I end up flunking another class).

It's crazy that my life became so screwed up from just leaving home and heading to college - when I was admitted into this university, I lucked out - most people would love to have the kind of opportunity I was granted (in fact, I'm pretty sure that you, random reader, would probably have accomplished more with it than I have so far). All I had to do was pass my classes and stay away from risk behaviors (which, as I've discussed in the past, I certainly avoid - my family has a history of alcoholism and clinical depression, so I stay far away from drug usage and/or drinking), and my life should have turned out fine. Unfortunately, as many of my friends are now preoccupied with internships, romantic relationships, and video games, I have a cracked, crumbling sky above my head (medical problems) and a cavernous abyss beneath my feat (academic struggles). Although my life was always pretty dominated by severe depression and anxiety, I do wish I could go back to a time before everything collapsed - things weren't right back then, but they were never like this.

I genuinely wish I could smile and laugh again without feeling guilty for every bit of happiness I have and sadness over every potential outcome from my situation, and I can't help but imagine what my 12-year old self would say if I traveled back in time and told him ""You are going to successfully gain admission to one of the best colleges in the country; however, after you do that, you will start flunking pretty much every assignment you have, and your health will go straight down the toilet."" Even back then, I had my suspicions that I'd never be the type to settle into a normal life - however, at that point in my past history, I just always assumed that my depression and anxiety would eventually bring me down, not something *real* and *tangible* like a viral illness. I also never saw myself as an academic failure - although I had my difficulties in my past educational history, my grades and test scores were usually good, and I always imagined that I would readily adapt to college and probably even end up with a graduate degree by the end. Unfortunately, that was nothing more than my own hubris at work - sadly, we idiots tend to continue believing in our own competency even after witnessing obvious proof of our aforementioned idiocy. I'm not like my friends at all - they are relatively intelligent, highly-motivated people who seem to lack any mental disorders and possess a good deal of competency in their chosen fields. I'm not even like my parents - they didn't even receive the opportunity to go to a university like my current one since they didn't come from middle class households, but they still managed to gain their degrees (and, in my father's case, graduate with honors). I feel like I've screwed up so significantly in my life even though I've lived so little of it, but what would I even do to escape the waking nightmare formerly known as my life?

If you made it through this mess, then you have my congratulations - I sure as #%&amp;! wouldn't bother reading a random wall of text from some anonymous crazy person on the Internet.

33b242,0,2015-04-20,Prospective student here - A couple questions!,Superalex121,UCSC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/33b242/prospective_student_here_a_couple_questions/,"Hey everyone! I know there's a megathread but it seems I missed the initial influx of questions so I doubt anyone is still checking up on it.

I was offered admission for electrical engineering and have a couple questions:

1. How easy would it be to transfer from electrical engineering into computer science? 
2. I've heard there are tons of internship opportunities (obviously being within such close distance to the silicon valley), does anyone have first hand experience? 
3. What is there to do? I haven't visited yet, but from what I can tell, it seems like the school is in the middle of a forest. Does it get boring? And how close is it to the city? 

Any general statements/opinions that could give me some insight would be greatly appreciated as well. Thanks everyone!"

I am currently a college freshman finishing his first year as a cs major with a math minor. I have applied for a few (maybe 3) summer internships just to see if I can get lucky. I am wondering what the best way for me to get involved and/or get an internship that would help me in the long run finding a career. I am planning in joining an on campus cs club next semester but I do not know what else I can do. Please help! Any and all advice is appreciated.
33b6xj,5,2015-04-20,Is it even worth it ? How could I be with him ? [Spain/USA],AnnaHondier,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/33b6xj/is_it_even_worth_it_how_could_i_be_with_him/,"Hi ! I figured out I might get some advice from this subreddit so here I am :)
Alright so me and my boyfriend are in a LDR,he's American. 
I've been looking for ways to be able to stay in the US to be with him and eventually look for a job and stuff,but I don't think I'll be able to get any kind of visa ( except the 90 days tourist one). 

The thing is,I would need to complete my degree to get the work visa but I have to choose between going to the US to meet him or my ( private,expensive) school. This school requires me to do a three months internship during the summer,during all the holidays I have,and I haven't found anything in the US. So,if I go there this summer even on the tourist visa,that means I'll have to drop out. If I don't,I won't be able to visit him until the end of 2016 and I don't think our relationship is going to survive that. It's been a while already and it's hard for us both.

I don't know if it's worth it and I'm just so scared,I sort of have to choose between my education and the love of my life. This degree isn't important to me ( it's sort of dead end,art stuff) but even if I manage to go to the US and get the spouse visa ( that's the option he's been thinking about) I'm not even sure I'd find a decent job without a degree in anything. 

Any help would be welcomed,worth it or not worth it ?

33b9fj,4,2015-04-20,Help! Credit Analyst in need of career advice.,RedRaiderATX,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/33b9fj/help_credit_analyst_in_need_of_career_advice/,"First Reddit post!

To quote Forrest Gump: “I am not a smart man.” At least I wasn’t in high school. I was lazy, unmotivated, and had a bad attitude. I was more interested in playing videogames and partying than studying. Unfortunately this was a trend that continued through most of undergrad. I didn’t have any career prospects. I was premed and then ended up prelaw. I eventually graduated with a liberal arts degree with a mediocre 2.8 gpa. It wasn’t until senior year that I started to get my act together. After a graduation and six months of unemployment, I decided to take some graduate business courses. I did well and managed to get accepted in my schools MBA program. The acceptance rate was 18% - I consider myself quite lucky.

All my hopes, aspirations, raw ambition, competitiveness, business acumen, et cetera – it all started coalescing in graduate school. Business school was a cathartic experience. Honestly, I am disgusted by the person I used to be. I’m a new man now, a better man. B-school was a very successful endeavor for me. I was awarded one of my university’s highest accolades – the congressional internship and scholarship. I lived in DC and worked full-time in the US House.  It was one of the greatest learning experiences of my life.  I finished my MBA and got a job as a Commercial Credit Analyst for a mid-sized community bank in Lubbock, TX. It’s a long story, but my ex gf and I finished our master degrees at the same time. She wanted me to stay and eventually get married.  I turned down several great jobs in Dallas. Big mistake because we broke up three months later… I left my job, moved to Austin and got another Commercial Credit Analyst position – this time with a much larger bank. I enjoy the work. I’ve learned more about finance and accounting than I ever thought possible in school. I have over a year of financial analysis experience now, three if you count grad school.

Credit is one of the central pillars of the economy and it’s given me a very diverse and quantitative set of skills. However, I’m far more interested in areas more aligned with investment banking – equities, sales &amp; trading, hedge funds… I get far more excited about financial markets and macroeconomic events than commercial lending.  I definitely do NOT want to become a lender. I’m not sure where to go from here. I want to make the transition but I don’t know where to start.  I wasn’t one of those driven academics in undergrad – the ones who graduated with multiple internships and knew what they wanted in life, and how to achieve it. How do I compete with that? I feel like my academic past is a huge albatross around my neck.  It seems like regardless of my personal victories and growth as a professional adult, I’m still haunted by my past. How do I convince people do give me a chance? How do I get past my crummy background? I welcome any and all advice.  It’s greatly appreciated.

Sorry for the length.  I definitely was not trying to write a sequel to “Ulysses.”

I'd like to formally welcome you all to the Cardinal Regiment. My name is JOJO, and i'll be your regiment leader for this amazing war. 


If you have any difficulties/ struggles of the sorts over the coming months then I'm your man, along side all of your fellow troops.

As a fresh regiment at the beginning of the war there are a few things that we need to achieve in order to get a start on winning this war

#1 if you haven't yet subscribed to the no fap war and this sub reddit and have been assigned to this regiment then go ahead and do so.
#2 We need to build up our leadership team to facilitate the needs of the soldiers. If you have the skills required and the desire to serve your regiment then go ahead and message me as to why you should be appointed a leadership position as a moderator.

currently we need a leader capable of editing CSS to renew our barraks to a fresh look. we don't need to strut around our old look from the previous wars.

If any of you are good at photoshop and would like to design a banner for the regiment then send a link in response to this post.

I need to appoint my second and third in command who's duties are to assist in the upkeep and discipline of our soldiers. message me if you have what it takes and would like to intern as a platoon leader for future wars.

#3 don't die! this is a strict order! your in this war as much for your fellow soldiers as you are for yourselves. lets make this the best regiment it can be and fight out way to the highest ranks. We've won this war in first place before, do us proud and we will win it again! Dismissed. "

33bgwe,2,2015-04-21,"Back to school for second degree in CS; working full-time, would love some advice on BS vs. MS, value of internships",gw2380,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/33bgwe/back_to_school_for_second_degree_in_cs_working/,"Quick background on me; I graduated from with a BSBA from a pretty good state university in 2003. I blew off college for a number of reasons, and didn't really think through what I wanted to do with my life (sounds dumb now, but didn't put much thought into it then). Skipped my way through classes towards a 2.30 GPA.

Since then I have been working in marketing for a variety of companies. I fell into this profession because I have a bit of a background in doing things like graphic design, web design, etc. on my own. I've done okay - I make a comfortable living at 30 at around $50k, and could continue down this career path and end up doing well for myself.

That said, in September of 2013, on a trip to see my sister graduate top of her class from one of the top law schools in the country, my girlfriend and I had a long conversation about life, which ended up with me realizing that I wasn't doing something I really loved. I felt that whereas my sister had a career and accomplishments that she was truly proud of and had worked for, I had lacked the vision and drive until that point to achieve that. Until that point, I'm not sure I had ever really had more than a fleeting thought of what it was that I really wanted to do with my life. In the back of my mind, I had always kicked around the idea that I should have worked in Computer Science - logic, mathematics and computing are three things that I would say I am very skilled in. I decided that day that I wanted to go back to school for a second degree, bust my ass towards a top GPA and honors, and get a job that I loved doing. I enrolled in January of 2014.

I'm proud to say that I have accomplished my goals so far. I'm around halfway through my degree program with a 4.0/4.0 GPA. I've found a passion for programming, and have really felt like I have made a great choice. That said, while my situation is not entirely unique, it is different enough that I have had a hard time finding advice.

My first question: I work full-time at a job that will have little to no overlap with my new career. However, it is a low-stress job that pays fairly well, I enjoy my work and my coworkers, and I get five weeks of vacation a year which has helped immensely with having to take off for finals, for random study days, etc. My current plan is to graduate in December 2016. It seems that internships are very important to working in the CS field. Would it be to my best benefit to leave my current place of employment in Summer 2016, work the summer as an intern, take a final semester of school in Fall 2016, and then look for jobs upon graduation that December? 

My second question: My school offers an option for those who have had a previous undergraduate degree to skip the BSCS and go for an MSCS with high marks in certain courses. I’m fairly confident I should fit that, but I am worried that applying for jobs as someone with a BSBA, little to no practical work experience, and an MSCS will leave me as a weird profile and I will struggle to find jobs.

33bmi7,0,2015-04-21,Projects and Trendy Technologies,curiouscat321,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/33bmi7/projects_and_trendy_technologies/,"It's pretty common fact on this sub that projects help get jobs and internships. Jobs and internships look for experience - that means either a previous job or some kind of project. What isn't common fact are the types of technologies and projects that you should be building.
   
   
I firmly believe that projects built with trendy technologies look far better on a resume than those built with older technologies. First, I want to prove to all of you that this is true:

   
1. Shows that you keep up with industry news
2. Shows passion towards keeping up with the industry
3. Shows you're capable of teaching yourself (older tech can be more easily taught because more people know it).
4. Shows you can build something with the knowledge you've acquired and aren't just relying on libraries or regurgitating code from slides.

Now, what constitutes a trendy technology? Ideally, this is a well-known piece of the stack that is still fairly new, has momentum behind it, and is being used by large companies. Here's some examples:

* Node
* Python (Python is great, some of the libraries, like Django are on the edge)
* Ruby, Rails (on the edge)
* Backbone.JS, Angular, React, Javascript 
* iOS / Android , if sufficiently complex
* Haskell
* Golang
* Rust
* Docker

What doesn't count?

* C#, .NET, Microsoft stack
* Java, JREE, JDK, Other J-words in caps
* COBOL, FORTRAN
* SQL ( on its own)


If you think of others or are unsure, feel free to post them. We can make our best guesses.

Basically, list any technology that has been on the front page of Hacker News for the past month or so. Those are the trendy technologies. 

All of these have enough documentation and online tutorials that you should be able to learn what you need to learn.

Now, what is a good project? There's a million ideas out there and don't be afraid to steal or rebuild the wheel. The ideal project should have the following things:

* **Shippable!** Startups especially really care if you've shipped code (put it online, in a package manager, or on an app store). It shows you can follow through to completion of a project.
* **Easy to explain the technical side at a high level.** There's a fine line to walk between explaining something and making it sound trivial or not explaining how technical it is. Use the technologies to describe the project. Say things such as ""Used React to format the data of a Mongo db"" or something like that. Don't talk about individual functions. Make it somewhat clear that you understand the technology and aren't wowed by simple things.
* **Not too academic.** Don't make your projects sound like class projects. Class projects are sort of frowned upon because they don't show one's ability to program. Don't talk about textbook algorithms you've implemented or the specific data structures you've used. 
* **Full-stack.** If possible, try to show that you have some breadth in your project. That's why websites are so cool. You get to go from rendering HTML all the way to grabbing information from a database/API. Basically, don't just build one part - just the views of a mobile app or just the database of a website. 
* **It doesn't have to be polished or launched** If you've worked on it, put it down. I know, this goes against the first bullet. But, many companies don't care entirely if something has shipped and nobody cares if it isn't polished to full professionalism. Something is way better than a to-do.

Let me know if anybody has any questions! I really feel that side projects have gotten me to where I am, so I'm glad to help!

33c0ve,2,2015-04-21,How do I make the most of my competitive nature without it killing me?,[deleted],selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/33c0ve/how_do_i_make_the_most_of_my_competitive_nature/,"Hello people of r/selfimprovement! I appreciate the help you have given me in the past.

I am a 19 year old university student in an accounting program. I have fairly good grades (~3.4), a lot of volunteering and club involvement, and a lot of sports stuff (soccer and running). Plus I am studying abroad this summer, and have an interview for a dream internship that I am hoping to land. My business school basically has a case competition team that travels to compete with the best schools on the east coast. Basically, after contemplating whether or not I wanted to do it, I tried out and didn't make it.

This personally made me feel awful. I felt like I did really well in the interview (aced both logic questions), and I also did my best to make a good impression on the professor and captains of the ""team."" It's not like all the people that did make the team have internships at goldman sachs and 3.9 GPA's, hell, I have better marks than probably half of them. What hurts is that it feels like this is someone saying ""you're not good enough."" How am I supposed to have a successful career when I can't even make a stupid case team that you do for FREE??

These events lead me to have a lot of emotions. On the one hand, I took it gracefully and thanked them for their consideration, etc. I can still join the debate or sports section of the business competition, I just didn't make the academics side. Conversely, I have a feeling of rage towards the people that 1. made the team over me 2. didn't pick me. This leads me to have nasty thoughts about how I'm better than them because of all these egotistical and elitist reasons like looks or my family's social standing.

So clearly I can't handle defeat. It just hurts when you're basically rejected, especially since most of my peers who tried out made the team. I took a personality test for this class once and it said ""competitiveness"" was my most prevalent trait. The strange thing is that most people wouldn't know that I'm such a competitive person, I guess I just don't show it and it eats away at me."
33c48p,3,2015-04-21,I [17M] want to break up with my suicidal girlfriend [16F] of 8 months,lockdoor55,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/33c48p/i_17m_want_to_break_up_with_my_suicidal/,"Two days ago, my girlfriend tried to kill herself in front of me by running out to the balcony of my apartment. 

To give some background, this girl, we'll call her Amanda, is my first girlfriend ever. Amanda was my first hug, hand hold, kiss on the lip, and pretty much any other thing you can think of that a high schooler would do. I wasn't Amanda's first for any of that, but I didn't care so much because I was crazy for her. 

Time flew by and I got to know her more and more by the weeks we were together. Finding out that she has been constantly abused in both physical and emotional ways by her parents, it only fueled my love and care for her. She's even told me she tried to strangle herself with a volleyball net in the past. I remember that Amanda and her father got into a heated argument sometime before Thanksgiving and the father ended up literally picked her up and threw her across the room. My girlfriend ended up staying over my place for the night because of obvious reasons. Just to give a little more taste of her ""pain"", she's of middle child of three sisters. The oldest sister, we'll call her Michelle, is in my graduating class. Michelle has been the ""favorite"" of the three because of how much of a success she has grown to be. Student body president for two years in a row, various high level competition awards in academics, and hell, she's currently getting paid to intern for the governor. Then, we have the youngest, Hope. Hope is the cutest little girl ever! She's absolutely brilliant, and exceptionally skilled in gymnastics for her young age. Amanda only sees herself as a stump in comparison to her two sisters. 

Going back to our relationship, it was crappy. During the winter season, there was constant self cutting by her because I didn't ""love"" her back. Now, I'm a really honest guy. When I make a promise, I intend to keep it. When she first cut herself, I asked her to make a promise to me that she would never cut again. She promised me, but ended up cutting anyway. That was strike one for me. In early March, I asked for a break, but she threatened to kill herself. I didn't understand as to why she was doing that. That instance was strike two. It's sad to admit it, but the majority of the relationship was complete disagreement on everything. It only took me two weeks ago to find out that what Amanda was doing was unknowingly manipulating me. I've always felt bad about her crying and always blamed myself for all of it.. I reflected on times when I had absolute priorities to tend to, but she didn't approve of any of it because I would be spending time on other things but her. A specific time was when I had to rush home after school to finish a paper worth 20% of my grade, but I couldn't because Amanda was forcefully keeping me down while sitting on me. I didn't want to push her off because that just isn't how I was taught by my parents. She even knew how much I needed to finish that paper... That was just an example of one of the many times she forcefully made it her way. Strike three. I had enough of it all.

Fast forward to two days ago, I attempted to break up with her.. Only to end up with her attempting to jump off my balcony. When I asked her what she was going to do when heading for the railing on my balcony, she replied with, ""You already know what I'm going to do.."". For the first time ever, in any circumstance, I used brute force on somebody to stop them. I forcefully grabbed Amanda and pulled her away from the door. I didn't want to find out what would have happened if I let her alone. 

Later that day, she wanted a compromise on the breakup. I was still in shock that she could have killed herself, so I agreed to whatever she said. For the next three months, there are boundaries, but I don't see her as the person I once loved. I still care for her, but I don't want to be with her. I'm the only one who knows about her suicidal side... She doesn't want me to go out to seek help, let alone tell anyone about this. I don't know what to do anymore.



   
**tl;dr**: I want to leave my girlfriend, but I don't want her to kill herself. what do I do?"
33cft3,1,2015-04-21,Considering (temporarily) going into credit card debt for the first time - is this relatively financially sound or am I deluding myself?,this_lil_turtle,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/33cft3/considering_temporarily_going_into_credit_card/,"Let me start off by saying I've always paid my credit card bills in full and on time. I managed to graduate college with no debt. Currently, first year after graduation I'm living halfway across the world in Israel doing an internship, through which I receive housing and a modest living stipend (equivalent to about $350USD per month, which just about covers food, transport, and my phone bill). I saved up about $3000 last summer which I've been using to supplement my living costs, but after 8 months here and some splurging, I'm down to my last $500 or so, which realistically will be down to not-a-whole-lot by the time July comes around and I go home.

I'd really like to take a short trip to Europe while I'm still (kinda) in the region. I know I can't afford it based on my current account balances, BUT here's the kicker: I have $2500 coming into my account sometime in August and I'll be starting a job ($15/hr + living at home) once I return home as well. Said trip would cost me maybe around $800 but I'd have to carry a balance on my credit card for a month or two (hopefully paying it down somewhat once my first paycheck comes in). Is this an advisable thing to do or am I an idiot/scared shitless of any debt whatsoever? Thanks.

33cgxb,5,2015-04-21,Me [23 M] with my GF [22 F] 2 years in college - going on break,break_time123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/33cgxb/me_23_m_with_my_gf_22_f_2_years_in_college_going/,"So I've been dating my GF for a couple days over 2 years now. We met in college and currently live in the same apartment building each in our own single. A couple days before our 2 year anniversary she was acting strangely and more distant than usual. I asked her if something was bothering her because it was obvious to me that something was. She denied anything and then when I asked her again a day later, we had a talk. We decided to go on a break for the summer and now she has declined seeing me and talking to me even before the semester is over. Our single apartment's are next to each other and the doors to the hallway are relatively not sound proof. I overheard her voice talking to some unknown male's voice about dinner that was had last night. 


One thing that was mentioned in our chat is that she loves me and does not want to string me along. This seems like exactly that though. I am planning to call her today and tell her that I am not okay with the break, especially if she, 2 days after we go on break, is having dinner with some unknown male. I want to give her an ultimatum that if she loves me, she would stay with me, and if she doesn't, then we are done and she can go enjoy whoever she wants to.


We had almost broken up in December because she was not happy with how often I was seeing her while we were on break and I was working and that I was not communicating enough with her. She changed her mind after she brought it up and started crying. I did very little to convince her to change her mind.


Would it be advisable to give her an ultimatum and ask her about the dinner she may have had with someone else? I can give more information if needed, but I just wanted to give a basic overview.
   

tl;dr - GF who lives in the same apartment building in a single next to mine wants to take a break over the summer while she stays at college taking courses and I go work an internship ~2 hours away. She says she needs a break so she can be sure that she isn't just with me for the wrong reasons (because she's lonely, etc). I overheard her talking to some unknown male voice in the hallway 2 days after we decided to go on a break. I want to call her and admit I'm not okay with a break and that if she loves me (and she said she does/cares deeply for me when we talked), she would stay with me. I am not okay with her going to sleep around this summer just to get back together at the end of the summer. Is this right/advisable?


UPDATE: for those who care - I had one last chat with her to formalize our separation and it was very liberating and  amicable. We decided to remove ourselves from each other's lives for long enough that we will both be comfortable being friends. Thanks everyone for your interest and advice."
33cjdc,5,2015-04-21,Help me choose between two offers for summer internship (Europe),catslovemetoo,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/33cjdc/help_me_choose_between_two_offers_for_summer/,"So, I'm a engineering physics student doing my masters in financial mathematics. I have 1 year till graduating and this is thus my last opportunity of doing an summer internship. I wish to work in the banking sector later on, with analysis and technical work involving a lot of programming and mathematics (a quant if you really want to use that label). 

 &amp;nbsp;



I have been offered and accepted an internship position as a electrical market analysts at my countries biggest energy company. The position would involve computing regressive analysis and using optimization models. I have done some courses in optimization but did not find it to stimulating. I figured this job would help me gain some knowledge in analysis and optimization.  I have accepted the offer in an email but have not yet signed a contract. I told the recruiter I had an other interview upcoming and asked for some time before I accepted or rejected the offer, but they wanted me to answer on the spot. As I did not have any suitable offers at the time, I accepted. 

&amp;nbsp;




The other offer is a summer internship program at a large commercial bank. I will be doing risk calibrations from a large quantity of different data and learn tons of how to apply my math skills in practise. This summer job is more in line with what I want to do in the future than the one at the energy company. 

&amp;nbsp;

I am planning on calling the first company and explain in some way I have gotten an other offer I would rather take than their one. What is the protocoll for doing this? Is this acceptable? What job would you recommend for me, given my aspirations?

I'd grateful for any advice! Thank you in advance!

33ctm1,0,2015-04-21,My[25M] SO of 7 months [20F] lives with her ex[39M] who wants her back and tries belittle and demean her and me.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/33ctm1/my25m_so_of_7_months_20f_lives_with_her_ex39m_who/,"So I apologize if this becomes a wall of text and if there are some formatting issues as I'm on mobile. I'm using a throwaway because she knows I use reddit and sometimes plays around on it on my phone. I'm not doing this to hurt her and she said I could talk to anonymous people on the internet about it. I really debated ever doing so, but I need advice.


So, to preface this all. Around July of last year I started using an online dating service. At that point I had never had a relationship, been kissed, virgin, etc. My love life was nonexistent and I wanted to try it out. I talked to a few people and finally had the courage to go on a date with a girl we will call Sam.(All names will be changed). We went on a date in mid August and hit it off. She was the one to mention going out again at the end. It was great. We casually dated for a little while before deciding to go exclusive in mid November. 


For the most part it's been a real dream. We always have a great time together. Rarely have any issues. We even talk about our future together and could really see each other together for at least a long time if not forever. However, her past has really been a big point of contention.


Before I get into the biggest issue I'll mention that she is a very open girl. She has told me an extensive amount about her past with relationships and otherwise. In the beginning I wanted to know more about her so I was fine with this. After we went exclusive it kept going. It would be everything from ""oh me and so and so went there"" to pretty descriptive comments about sex with people in the past. For the most part I was ok, but it started to get old as every time we were together the conversation would inevitably turn to topics involving her exes. 


Now, Sam didn't have a lot of friends and most of her exes were friends before they got sexually involved so I get this. Most of her past includes her exes so she doesn't have a lot of other experiences to pull from. She still talks to a couple of them and I'm mostly ok with it, but there's been times that I'm not. Most of her exes were not good people. She may not see it this way but from how she describes it, most of them used her for sex and treated her fairly poorly including demeaning her and cheating. I decided it's her life and her decision who she talks to. I said I was cool with it when she started talking again to John who had just ended a relationship with a girl who forbade him from talking to other girls. At first it was fine, but then he almost immediately showed his true colors that he wanted to hook up with her and me out of the picture. She immediately shut that shit down and now he's completely out of the picture. However, now she is talking to Tom again. Tom wasn't exactly an ex. He was kind of just a booty call and, as she explained, those calls only happened when he was in the mood and never when she was. He made one semi sly comment that made me think he was heading down the same road John was. I discussed me being uncomfortable about this and me and Sam hashed it out. She doesn't want to be paranoid and wants to hold on to the few friends she has and if they try anything, shut them down. It's not an active, daily talking thing and she tells me all about it so I decided to leave that topic alone and let her do her. I don't want to be controlling. 


I say all that to share that she has kind of a weird relationship with her exes and other people in her life even if they've fucked her over. Sam is an absolute sweetheart and believes in people. It's one of the reasons I love her. 


Now we get to the meat of the story. Sam lives with a guy, Jim. Jim is 39 years old. During the casual dating phase I asked about if anything had happened between them. She told me that one time her, Jim and her best friend had, had a threesome. I thought this a little weird, but whatever. I'm a pretty open minded guy. It was a drunken thing. Well, that was only the first layer. I had asked if her and Jim did anything else and she had said no. After dating a bit and becoming exclusive she came out and told me that they had, had a sexual relationship for the entire year she had lived there and ended things in June before she went on the dating service. Ok. Not completely cool with it, but I remained open and learned to accept it. It started to make more sense why Jim didn't like me and her together. Jim had feelings for her and wanted more. I understood. 


Cut to a couple weeks ago. Everything had been going amazing for months. Jim hadn't been giving her too much shit about our relationship. Things seemed to be looking up. We were having a casual conversation and I asked about her and Jim's relationship and how that all started. Then she dropped a bombshell on me. Her and Jim had, had a relationship for 2+ years. It wasn't just a purely sexual thing. She had once loved him. I quickly realized the math didn't add up. She was dating Derek before her and Jim moved in together. Then she admitted that she had cheated on Derek for three months with Jim before breaking up with Derek. My heart sank. We had discussed this stuff before. I despise cheating. I watched my friends get destroyed by it and am almost positive my mom was cheating on my dad leading up to her asking for a divorce. Derek had been kind of an asshole who made her feel like shit if she didn't have sex with him so I can kind of understand even though I don't think that excuses cheating. This is why she hid this all from me. She didn't want to scare me away because she made mistakes in the past. She's right. If she had dropped this on me in the beginning I would have ran. Then I pried a little deeper. It turns out they were still having a sexual relationship while I was talking to her in early August and were still sleeping in the same bed(non-sexually) until September until after our second date when she decided she liked me and wanted that part of her life finally over. 


This was a lot to take in. I was wounded and felt betrayed. In a completely dumb move I decided I needed a stroke to my ego and asked her if I was her best sexual partner because she had seemed really into it with me and had bragged about it to her friends. Turns out the answer was no. I was ok with that, but she wouldn't tell me who was. My mind was eating itself worrying that it was Jim. I pried and she told me no it wasn't, it was Derek, but then a few sentences later she admitted it was in fact, Jim. My whole world was upside down and their whole relationship and living situation distorted and morphed. I freaked out and shut down. 


We talked a lot in the next few weeks. Tears were shed. Feelings were hurt, but we both decided to move past it all. We both love each other very much and I'm willing to accept she made youthful mistakes and that she will not lie to me like that again. She's been very open and really doing a good job in repairing the trust that she broke. 


However, there's something else about Jim. He is a severely depressed person. Didn't lose his virginity until age 34. No real friends to speak of. The reason she finally ended it with him is because they had agreed to an open relationship, but he became possessive. She would do her thing and he would attack her verbally. They tried to be exclusive but he was so insecure that everything she did for him was never enough. She admitted he made her cry more than anyone else. 


Here's where the real tension comes in. She still tries to be friends with him. She tries to help him out on dating sites. She tries to go with him to his hobbies when no one else would. She sticks up for him. What does he do? He berates her. All of his texts when me and her are together are ""I'll never have fun again"" ""I'll never have anyone again."" He makes fun of me(until she finally told him to stop). He gave us shit last weekend because she had the audacity to hang out with me for a few days on my birthday weekend. He still wants to be with her and he does everything he can to tear her down and make me feel unwelcome. The only thing she can do is sit there and ignore it until he tires himself out. Right now she isn't making much money where she is. Their arrangement is he allows her to pay a very little amount of the rent. He also makes her feel bad about paying so little because he doesn't get sex anymore. She can't live on her own. She's just finished school and needs to do a year internship in her field before she could land a full job in her discipline. The internship pays well, but she's not sure where she will end up finally after all of that and doesn't want to have to keep packing up and moving. I've offered to move somewhere with her, but she's understandably afraid of ending up in the same situation she's in with Jim if I somehow end up turning into an asshole. She doesn't think it will happen, but I can't blame her for being hesitant. Our relationship is also still young and that's a major step. I just feel so useless and handcuffed. I get to leave and she's stuck there. A prisoner in her own home. And sometimes when we are together he says something shitty over text that upsets her and I feel like shit because our time together is tainted by him. 


I just don't know what to do. I've told her she can't stand for this, but she has nowhere else to go. I have no plans of breaking up with her, but I fear that this guy will be here forever and I really don't want him in either of our lives. I don't like that she still tries to be friends with him even though he treats us all like shit and doesn't care about how she feels. I'm just frustrated and overwhelmed. She is my first relationship. My first everything. This is so much more than I ever thought I would have to deal with right out of the gate. Any help would be amazing.   


Tl;dr older roommate and ex wants our relationship to be over and for her to go back to him. Belittles and demeans us both.

I recently got an email about this ""opportunity"":

I'm looking for 4-6 programmers to work on an app for the IOS and Andriod platforms. The work itself is not complicated, as all of the facets of the app have been done before in various programs. Target launch date would be mid to late summer, earlier if possible but before the start of fall semester in order to work out any bugs before the heavy use begins. Target audience would be college students and young adults in densely populated areas. Compensations for work is a share of the company. Details will be disclosed after an intellectual property agreement has been signed. I am hoping to conduct interviews as soon as possible.

Do you guys think it would be worth going for something like this? Its not paid but the experience could be worth it? I'm sure the ""share of the company"" is complete bullshit but I really need some kind of internship experience developing software. Should I say screw it and keep applying elsewhere?

Now, if I want a big Silicon Valley internship next summer, which of these two companies will look better on a resume? Do people in the Valley look down upon banks?"

33d3bc,1,2015-04-21,My codependency,the_emily_force,Codependency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Codependency/comments/33d3bc/my_codependency/,"So here I am. It's been a constant debate in my head lately if I really wanted to come out and share my story. I know many people decide to use throw away accounts to discuss their situations and for a long time I thought I should do the same because my boyfriend knows of my account. But I don't want to hide anymore and I want him to know how I feel and get help. 

**I'm sorry for the rambling and appreciate everyone that takes the time to read through. I don't know best how to put into words my current situation but I hope someone will understand.**

I've always been codependent in my relationships, though I didn't realize there was a term for it until a few months ago. I'm 24 years old and have been in long term relationships since I was 16 years old; 5 relationships to be exact all lasting at least 1-2 years long. All my relationships have been based on me wanting to date to fix and feeling helpless when things don't go my way. 

I feel like a lot of my codependency comes from growing up in a single parent family. I had no father figure and I don't know what to look for in a man. I don't even know what a good man is. Every time I get into a relationship its a jump from one to the other. I think the longest I've ever been out of a relationship was 6 months.

In terms of my current relationship things have been difficult. We just had our one year anniversary in March and it has been an uphill battle the whole way. We met when he was engaged to someone else and I had just gotten out of a two year relationship in which I still lived with my ex. At that time they were still together but he had thoughts of leaving. They were in an open relationship and I partook in that. This isn't something I would normally do. I consider myself fairly conservative and have only ever had one partner at a time but I was still in college and I really just wanted something new. I was also leaving soon to do an internship at Disney and wasn't planning for it to be anything long term though I did really like him and we had a lot in common. Long story short he decided to break off the engagement and we started dating shortly after. I felt like I had to rescue him from this girl he no longer wanted to be with. I wanted him to be happy so I could be happy. 

I graduated from college and moved to Florida for my internship. During that time I began to become depressed. It was hard for me to be by myself. I didn't know what to do because it felt like part of my was missing him being all the way back in Michigan. Even though I liked my job, I loved the people I worked with, and I was finally out of the town I hated so much I felt like I didn't belong there.

I started making excuses as to why I should go back to Michigan. I can't even recall what they are now, which means they probably weren't good enough reasons to leave the place I loved. 

Half way though my internship my boyfriend admitted that he had began drinking heavily. For me that was the straw that broke the camels back. Again, I felt like I had to go back and rescue him. I had to fix this situation that I felt responsible for. I resigned from my internship and went back to live with him at his parents for the summer; jobless and even more depressed. 

My boyfriend had to continue school so we moved back to our college town and moved in together. This was in August. Things were difficult because he was constantly gone at work and school while I was stuck at home trying to find a job. I constantly was depressed about leaving Disney and kept blaming him for making that decision for me. I felt like everything was taken from me. 

In October things really hit their breaking point. My boyfriend got pulled over for a DUI and sent to jail. I had to bail him out the next day and I had so much anger and hurt that I couldn't deal with it anymore. I desperately wanted to leave but felt that I had to stay to help him get though this. To go to AA and have him recover. I should mention that his father was also an alcoholic. 

The whole summer I had hid from everyone that my boyfriend had a problem. I hid from my family, from my only friend, I hid from my coworkers that anything was possibly wrong. I had first talked to his parents and they said that it was reasonable for me to leave if I needed to, they didn't expect for me to stick around after everything that had happened; that I should do what is right for me. When I talked to my mother it was another story. She said that I should stop running away from my problems and work through this. I listened to my mother. 

I thought that once he stopped drinking that things would be better but they didn't seem to go that way. He did stop drinking and seemed to have a better demeanor but then it felt like he ignored me completely. Before I had to constantly tell him what to do and cover up every single mistake he made. I felt I had to do this otherwise I wasn't a good girlfriend. Then when he started getting happier and making friends and understanding his alcoholism he started to bring me down about my codependency and my depression. 

He always says that I have a severe case that I need to get help. That once I get help we will be better together. For me that is hard because there aren't any CoDA groups around. I read Codependency No More and I feel so inspired but every time I start to focus back on our relationship I just swirl back into doubt.

Lately I've felt depressed about my weight. I began overeating when I began getting overwhelmed with our relationship. I am by no means overweight but I've always struggled with my self image. I feel like my boyfriend cares a lot about how I look even when he says that it doesn't matter to him. He always spoke of how his ex had gained so much weight that he didn't find her attractive anymore and I worry that I could become the same.

Recently I've felt like theres a lot of emotional backlash between us. He constantly said that he tried to let me do what I wanted and it seemed to fail. I don't even know what he means when he refers to that. When we talk about anything serious we fight. 

The other night we were supposed to go out with friends but when it came time to go out I couldn't find any clothes that fit and I got very upset. My boyfriend went into straight rage because he said that I never want to go out with his friends and I always make excuses for everything. I told him that he could still go but he didn't want to at that point. He stormed off and said he would go to AA instead.

This happens frequently. I get upset about something and instead of us having a discussion he gets mad and comes back after cooling off and apologizes. He says that I was right and that he didn't realize that was how I felt. It feels like he really doesn't care or listen to my needs but just wants me to be there for him all the time. 

I really don't know what to do anymore. When things are good they're good but most of the time it seems like they're not anymore. Even if I do get help I don't know if it would make our relationship better. "
33d3r9,1,2015-04-21,Internship around full-time job?,chavez5159,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/33d3r9/internship_around_fulltime_job/,"I'm just wrapping up an Associates in CS (already have a Bachelors in unrelated field). I'm looking to transition into a career in programming, but I do have an existing well-paying job that I don't want to completely compromise. The schedule is 9-5 and that's creating some issues.

The college I'm attending currently places students in internships based on their resume and qualifications. I have maintained a 4.0 so I figured I would be in good shape to land a position. I was unfortunately told there are no internships available that fit around my existing work schedule. 

I have also contacted several companies on my own based on their internship listings and thus far the conflict of hours has been an issue with each one. Should I turn my attention to side-projects instead? I assume on-the-job experience will be crucial since I don't have a BS in the field.

TL;DR Am I grasping at straws trying to find and internship that will work around by steady 9-5 job?"
33d7jn,44,2015-04-21,I want to make a life change and need advice from someone who's been in my shoes...,flawless-system,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/33d7jn/i_want_to_make_a_life_change_and_need_advice_from/,"Hi everyone - I've read some really lovely and supportive posts on here in the past and thought it was time I came out and asked for your help for myself this time. Warning that this might be long. (throwaway account because reasons...)

This May, it will have been 2 years since I've graduated college. TWO YEARS! I can't believe that I am where I am right now after 2 years out of school. I HATE my job. I had a series of internships and short term positions in very various fields (marketing, publishing, journalism, museum research, etc.) so I have very minimal and peripheral experience in all of them. I didn't really love any of them enough to want to go further in the field. (I also had a hard time securing any full time positions at any of these companies and I don't know whether it was a lack of open jobs or whether no one wants me to work for them.) I got my first real full-time job through a family friend. I work at a car manufacturer in the customer service dept working with customers over the phone about concerns they have with their cars. It was initially just a short term thing but they kept me on cause they needed me and they paid well so I stayed - it's been 7 months now. I hate cars. I hate talking to these customers about their trivial problems. I know I am more intelligent than this. I spend most of my day surfing reddit or watching Netflix because I'm able to finish all my work before lunch. There is no challenge, no desire to take on extra work, no desire to move anywhere else in the company. I want to quit SO BADLY.

I obviously need a new job. I have been applying for jobs here and there for the past several months but only been on 1 interview which I was overqualified for and was offering less pay. I don't really know what field I want to work in which makes applying really difficult. Where do you look if you don't know where you want to go? I'm normally goal oriented, so not having a set ideal in mind is driving me crazy and making this really hard for me. I don't even want half the jobs I apply for, I just apply because I want so desperately to get out of my current job,

My major in school was English, I'm good at writing but it's just a skill not necessarily a passion. I have always been a very high achiever. I won awards all through high school, was selected for research projects in college, was a member of multiple honor societies, president of a non-academic club, etc. etc. I never imagined I would be the person clocking in and out from 9-5 at a mind-numbing desk job that requires such brain activity. (No offense to anyone in this line of work, the job is extremely difficult as we have to deal with irrational customers all day and work really hard to solve technical issues with their cars. But for me this is like the bottom of the barrel. I'm a highly academic person and this in no way interests me or takes advantage of any of my skills). 

I need to make a LIFE change, not just a career change. I feel like I'm dying at work 5 days a week, only to be able to relax for 2 days and then go at it again. I've gained weight and my posture sucks from sitting at my chair all day, my vision has deteriorated from staring at a computer for 8 hours straight, my mind is numb and I find no interest in doing anything outside of work except trying to exercise and get  moving a little bit. The problem is I don't know what to do or where to start. 

TL;DR: Anyone have any advice for trying to figure out what to do with your life? I feel so lost and don't know what direction to go in. I don't have any real work experience or training in any given field but I know I'm smart and I'm a hard worker when I care about something. I want a life that is fun, not one where I drag my self to work and back on weekdays wondering how I got where I am. If you were ever in my shoes, how did you find a way out? What changes can I make? What can I do to learn about what options are out there? I need help!

EDIT: Thanks for all of your thoughts. I seem to be the only one of my friends in this spot so it helps to know that so many other people have felt this way and have made it work some way or another. I really don't feel that forcing myself to get used to this lifestyle is the right path for me so I'm in the process of looking into alternative options with all your suggestions. "

33dbjt,57,2015-04-21,"I Received My Purple Belt on Sunday, Here's What I Learned During My Time At Blue Belt",argunaw,bjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/33dbjt/i_received_my_purple_belt_on_sunday_heres_what_i/,"I'm not one to share personal BJJ stories on Reddit, but I had a very interesting journey from blue to purple over the course of four years, characterized by many school changes and lot of growth.

I received my blue belt the week I graduated college. Since I didn't have a job yet, I moved back home and trained at a school near me. A couple of months later, I got a job in New York City (I'm from New Jersey) and starting training in NYC under Shaolin. I was really stoked to start training under him because I am a huge fan of his BJJ and MMA career, plus since I'm a girl, I knew they had a bunch of other girls training there.

I was so unbelievably stubborn during my first year as a blue belt, and consequently, during my time at Shaolin's. I was just focused on my ""A Game"" and making sure it was good. I avoided playing guard because during my first blue belt tournament, I got my guard passed repeatedly until I was submitted via kimura. So instead of working my guard, I just tried to stay on top and pass. This resulted in me just being stubborn about going for the knee cut pass and getting so frustrated I barely applied any adjustments I had to make to make the pass better. I kept getting stuck in closed guard and being unable to pass; this is what happened to me during tournaments during my first year at blue belt.

As a result, I lost about 5-6 tournaments in a row, all in the first round. In fact, I went from losing by advantages to losing by submission. I literally felt like I was getting worse at jiu jitsu when in fact, I was just being really stubborn. Shaolin is such a great teacher that I regret having that mindset during a time when I had the chance to train under him.

My job in NYC ended (funding ran out) and I ended up with a part time, unpaid internship in NYC. This meant I could no longer afford to train at Shaolin's and starting training again at the gym near my house. I slowly became less stubborn and began opening up my game. I still favor passing, but I began developing a more advanced guard game beyond the basic stuff I had learned at white belt, and learned what guard games I like and work best for me. I also started ""chaining"" techniques together, so figuring out what my Plan A, B, and C were for each position I was in. This really helped me advance and made me more ready for competition. I continued competing and managed to take second place in the my division at the Chicago Open. 

Then, the school near my house closed down! They ended up re-opening with a new instructor a month or so later, but this wasn't initially stated. I had about 6 weeks before I moved for graduate school, and still really wanted to train. A few other students and I found a Renzo school nearby. I trained there for 6 weeks before moving a little bit north for graduate school at Rutgers.

I found a BJJ school near Rutgers, it's an Alliance affiliate in Dunellen, NJ. It's a small school and the instructors there are awesome. Having Nelson (of Inverted Gear fame!) and his brown belts Andrew and Dave teach the classes really helped me continue to open up my game and progress. I was able to fine-tune my guard game, open up to other guards that I really hadn't liked a couple of years ago, and be exposed to a variety of different games through the other students. I didn't compete as much because of school, but I managed to take third at nogi pan ams back in September.

I had planned on doing New York Open last month, but I fractured my ankle on March 14th, and had to wear a boot for a while. (what an awful thing to happen on Pi Day!) I took it easy and didn't train. However, about 2 weeks ago, I went to my doctor and she said she could no longer see the fracture and that I could take off the boot, but that I should still take it easy. I started going to BJJ again but just doing the technique. Last week, I started going to BJJ and light rolling. 

I had already planned to go to the school's promotion ceremony on Sunday to support my teammates. Since we have belt testing, you are told in advance if you are testing, so people know if/when they are getting promoted. I was watching all my teammates do their testing and cheering them on. When everyone was done, Nelson said ""We have a surprise test today"" and pointed at me. Naturally, I was quite surprised! I was able to do all the takedowns, guard passes, sweeps, submissions, etc. and passed my belt test. 

It was an awesome surprise and very satisfying to get my purple belt, as I truly did not expect it. I feel like I gained a lot of insight as to how to approach jiu jitsu, how to improve, and how to mitigate my own frustration."
33ddx0,0,2015-04-21,How should I go about buying a house?,Chisoxguy7,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/33ddx0/how_should_i_go_about_buying_a_house/,"Hello PF,

I am a 23 year old college junior who, at present, is renting an apartment in a college town for around $450 a month after utilities.

My mother is a real estate agent who has suggested to me that buying a home may be possible. We have looked at many homes and I have a general idea of what I am looking for now: my plan is to purchase a suitable home and to rent out a large amount of space to make the mortgage and property tax payments. I am looking at properties with the idea that I'd like to make $1600/mo from rent and make $1200/mo mortgage and property taxes.

For financing, my grandparents have agreed to loan me the down payment on the house, which I would pay back over 4 years at low interest. I would do this by taking the overflow rent money (~300-400) and add a payment for myself (300), as I would essentially be living rent free on the property. My grandparents have also generously agreed to co-sign on the mortgage with me.

My financial situation is this:

Checking: $3300 ($50 balance transfer to savings / mo)

Savings: $900

Income: $1500/ mo (900 employment, 600 internship [+performance bonuses])

Roth IRA: ~$12,000 , + $50 contribution / month

Student Loan Debt: $5500

Credit Card Debt: $0

Expenses:
Car - 0 (Paid Off)
Insurance - 37/mo
Rent+Utilities - 450/mo
Other Monthly Expenses- 400-600/mo

It is very likely that I can reduce my miscellaneous month-to-month expenses, and I would like to do so badly.

I will accumulate a little bit more student loan debt before I earn my Bachelor's at the end of 2016, however my out of pocket costs for the next two semesters will be completely covered by a scholarship. I will also attend graduate school in this city, so buying a house here would not be a short term investment. I believe I can pay most houses here off with a 15 year mortgage with what I want to do.

I am eager to invest in property and my goal is to rent out this property until it is paid off, at which point I can either sell it off, retain it for renting, continue living there, etc. What this plan allows me to do is live rent free while also building equity in property.

It's been suggested to me that being a landlord may make my life more difficult, but I am up to the task. I also have a resource available that would allow me to communicate with potential tenants that are university employees working on a one-year contract. I likely wouldn't have to rent the house out to students.

My question is: What do you make of all this? Is my plan for obtaining the mortgage feasible? Is there a way I can allocate my finances better? What am I not thinking about yet?

EDIT: I should add that my mother and father also own and operate their own business as general contractors, so any repairs to the house would be through their business and would likely save me a lot of money. For this reason, I am not against purchasing a fixer upper. If there is feedback to be given on this topic, I am also interested in hearing it."
33dfk5,1,2015-04-21,25 [M4F] On Power and Submission,AColorfulLife,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/33dfk5/25_m4f_on_power_and_submission/,"I haven't been very active on DPP in a little while, but I thought I'd try and jump back in with a couple of prompts I tried to get going a long while ago.

I tend to enjoy well thought out roleplays with defined characters who have distictive personalities and desires, not just one-dimensional sex objects. Or at least, not at first. I primarily enjoy the reversal of control, the manipulation that can go into taboo relationships, or power dynamics that are inverted, tied up, made to beg to be gagged, and firmly punished. 

And for the prompts themselves, with the requisite cheesy title factor.

### Just a Ride Away
 (*based in part on a true series of encounters*)

&gt; The commute my school takes fifty seven minutes, door to door. I get out of my apartment at 7:03, swipe my metrocard through the turnstile at 7:10. The M train arrives between 7:11 and 7:14, never earlier, never later. I make the transfer to the six at 7:32, and you get on and sit next to me at 7:34, one stop later. I know the reason why, I've seen the leers that women get on the morning commute. The way that you like to dress, the hordes of sexually and emotionally stunted middle aged men in suits that ride on the train through midtown? I'm surprised you haven't given up on commuting completely with all the overt staring and the 'accidental' pressing against you when one of them inevitably sits next to you. At least you can relax a little bit if I'm by your side. 

&gt; At school, of course, it's a different story. The same reasons I'm worth something to you on the Lexington Line are why I'm invisible to you once we get to school: relatively harmless, relatively nondescript. Safe. Nice. *Boring.* You've fallen asleep on my shoulder more times than you've ever spoken to me. I don't think it's unreasonable for me to get something out of whatever safety I grant you every single day we go to school. And so one day, as we're getting off, I slip you a note.

### Therapy
 (*based in part on a prompt from a month or two ago, taken with permission and gratitude*)

&gt; &gt;*Hi, Michael. I hope you're doing well. I am, if you hadn't heard, I've recently followed in your footsteps and have started my own private practice here in the city. I hope you don't mind that I haven't contacted you in so long. My gratitude cannot be overstated, but I have a husband now, and the power that you had over me... Well, I think that it's enough to write that I still think of you often, more often than I have any right to. Anyway, I know that you've moved on in your professional career. Teaching, now, isn't it? Your lucky little undergraduates...*

&gt; &gt;*Anyway, I've been having some trouble with one of my oldest clients. I tend to specialize in adolescent young women now, and, well, one of them reminds me of myself ten or fifteen years ago. I've worked with her for two years now, and have hardly made any headway, despite my best efforts. Anyway, please find enclosed the files I have on her. If you think it possible, perhaps a treatment like the one you provided me would be appropriate. I know it's a hassle, I know that you don't do this anymore. But if you could make this one exception, for me, I would greatly appreciate it.*

&gt; &gt;*Thank you. If you agree with me, please get in contact with my secretary regarding an official referral.*

&gt; It had been two weeks since I had received that letter. Right in the middle of midterms, as I've been buried under my coursework. And yet I've made the arrangements, even going so far as to avoid talking to my former client on the phone, going through all the silly little loopholes to make this work. And I've put aside my grading for the evening, rearranged my home office to accommodate a private patient again. And now it's twenty minutes after the agreed upon start of our first session and yet you're no where to be found.

### Heat

&gt; The mirepoix's sweating. Mise en place done. Station spotless. Towels doubled up. Knives sharpened, apron clean, cutting boards sanitized, pans ready to go, stove ready to fire. I've been here three weeks so far, and there hasn't been a single day you haven't barked at me before service even started. And there hasn't been a single day I haven't found myself struggling in the weeds. I need this job, or I'm going to have to move, yet again. I'm new to this city and my resume got me a gig here, with you, and I thought having a female boss would be nice, for once. Nurturing, maybe. A little more easy going than the psychotic hardasses that make up most of this industry. And I'm good looking, too, I take better care of my body than the usual line cook and the way my tattooed, ripped forearms look when I'm working the saute station has convinced many a waitress to let me fuck them. Charming you shouldn't have been any trouble at all. 

&gt; And yet, here I am, terrified that you might be paying attention to me at all. All your presence does is distract me, I'm making mistakes that I haven't made since I was fresh out of high school slaving away at an Applebees. If I lose this job I'm *fucked*, you're the only chef in this goddamn city who knows my name, and if I can't get a reference out of you I'm going to have to get in on dishwork and pray I get enough hours to cover my rent. And it's not like I have any secondary skills to fall back on, unless waitresses here are pulling in enough tips to want to hire male prostitutes... Expo is calling out our first order of the shift. I hope I still have a job tomorrow. 

***

I have a few other ideas bouncing around too - I love a good old-fashioned intern roleplay, and incestuous relationships seem to be easy to have fun with as well. In terms of short term scenes, I love cheating/taboo characters, especially if I'm a close friend or sibling of the person being cheated upon. I'm extremely open to other creative ideas, so please don't *too* feel bound and restricted by what I've written, as much fun as it may be. I do like writing sexy things of all sorts.

I don't have any particular preference for duration or frequency of responses; I care a lot more about quality than about quantity. In terms of specific kinks, I tend to enjoy exploration and a lack of inhibition. Not many concrete boundries, but I promise to respect yours. 

If you have a character you think fits in with any of my scenes, or would just like to chat to gauge possible common interests, please let me know. If you've made it this far: thanks for reading!

### SPECIAL BONUS FUN

For any interested party, particularly those who are interested in playing a submissive character. I would love to extend the offer of tying into my posts a series of directions - controlling your pleasure or pain as I see fit.

1. Buy a car that costs around $2.5K-$3K and then sell it once I don't need it anymore. I figure at that point the depreciation won't factor in THAT much when I sell it.

2. Rent a car for the 3ish months. From what I calculated, it would cost around $2K

3. Take a family to where I live. We don't have an extra car at home(Dallas) but my mom suggested I take her car for the summer and drive it back to where I live. It would be around a 3 day drive. Once I'm done with it, ship it back home.

What's my best option? if you have any other suggestions, please tell me! Thank you guys in advance!"

I recently accepted a 10 week internship in Louisville and I'm very excited to move to a new city even if it is for a couple of months. 

As an intern on a budget (and with no car), I have to conserve my resources but I do not want to miss out on experiencing everything this city has to offer.

I would love to hear your thoughts and advice on how to make the best of my summer at Louisville. 

I do have a few questions to get started:

1. Where is a good location to sign a short term lease for an apartment? My dad has agreed to help me pay for housing so I can afford to stay in a safe neighborhood with easy access to public transportation/grocery stores/entertainment etc. How much would I be looking to spend on such a location?

2. I've done some research and the general consensus seems to be that one should avoid 'West of 9th'... What other areas should I avoid and conversely, what should I not miss out on?

3. How do I get around town? I need a reliable transportation system to get me to work and to other places I want to visit. Any info on buses/subways/etc will be helpful

4. Most importantly, I do not want to make a fool of myself! I've never been to Kentucky and I've lived in the US for only a few years. Any local customs and phrases that a tourist needs to be aware of? 

5. The usual stuff: What are the nicest bars, the best restaurants, the sights and social activities that make you love your city?

I'm looking forwards to your responses! Thank you! "

I'm wondering if once you have intern status if their is ever a need for a tech license. Can interns be hired as tech's even without a license? Can tech jobs count towards intern hours?

33dwc6,1,2015-04-21,Evaluate this career goal?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/33dwc6/evaluate_this_career_goal/,"I'm a SWE based in the Valley with about 2 years of experience planning the rest of my career. I'd like to maximize earnings while minimizing job risk. I'd prefer to work 40-60 hr weeks while I'm young and have that drop to 35ish hr weeks after a few years.

**Things I like:**

* I enjoy building things from the ground up: planning, design, implementation, shipping.
* I enjoy highly visible projects.
* This means I've gravitated towards mobile apps or building small websites. 
* I've been teaching myself AWS for mobile app support as well.
* I really enjoy mentoring students and interns. 

**Things I don't like:**

* I find making not very visible contributions to a large system less rewarding. 
* Management, while lucrative, strikes me as draining. 
* Balancing customer requests with developer skills and traits, hiring/firing, keeping people happy while extracting as much work from them looks stressful.
* Job insecurity. 

**Therefore, I've set this as my goal:** 

1. Gain as much experience in building applications and programs from start to finish in the next 3ish years. 

2. Start a consulting/contracting business on the side. 

3. If I get enough side work, switch to contracting full time. 

4. Otherwise seek a position as some sort of developer/mentor outside of management.

5) Otherwise become 

**My questions:**

What sort of role would 4) be? What sort of preparations can I make now that would make getting into that role easier later?

Would working as a contractor or consultant for a significant period (2+ years) harm future job prospects should I wish to return to non-contract work?

Right now mobile applications are taking off, but that model may or may not last. How can I ensure I stay relevant in the tech scene while still gaining deep knowledge of one particular platform? (How to I grow the '-' in a 'T'-shaped developer while still growing the '|' ?)

Any general advice or suggestions are welcome.
**TL;DR** Any advice for someone seeking a non-management career while maintaining the option to go freelance.

33e7ko,94,2015-04-21,My experience live-posting DSLR photos on social media with an Eye-Fi card + an iPhone,b1jan,photography,https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/33e7ko/my_experience_liveposting_dslr_photos_on_social/,"So, as some of you may know, I work for eco fashion week in Vancouver. Part of my job is getting great photos- either of backstage, guests, sponsors, or a couple from the runway- onto our social media stream before anyone else.

This requires a bit of finessing- it is important that they get online quickly, but the system has to be robust and able to work in areas that are heavily congested with network traffic.

I shoot with a D600, and this season brought along two social media interns to handle the copy-writing and posting aspect. I came up with a pretty simple and effective system that you guys may at some point find useful:

My camera settings:

- First off, I use two memory cards. Slot 1 is a 32GB card, Slot 2 is the 16GB Eye-Fi  
- I have my camera set to 1:RAW + 2:JPEG so it saves a raw to the 32GB and a JPEG to the Eye-Fi; I put my JPEG settings to Basic because, as this is for SM, I only need the lowest quality and it'll look stellar  
- I have my Eye-Fi card set to broadcast its own network, and to upload photos to the connected device as soon as they are **locked**  
- I pair the iPhone with the Eye-Fi card by downloading the app, logging in, and selecting to be the receiver of photos. If you have two phones (as I sometimes used my own device), you have to switch which device will receive the photos back and forth.  
- Once the Eye-Fi has be initialized on the phone, it will install a profile and should automatically connect. When connected to the Eye-Fi, the iPhone should still be able to send and receive data on the Mobile network (necessary for uploading the photographs to SM)  
- For runway shows, I fire at CH, for around/venue stuff, i fire at CL. I also use 3D autofocus tracking for the runway shows which works quite well for me, YMMV  
- In case you care, I shoot the runways with a 105mm DC. It's not the best runway lens in the world, but it does the trick, and is sharp as a tack. I fire at F4;1/1600th;800. I bump ISO in exchange for shutter speed to freeze any movement in the pieces.

Procedure for Runway (backstage and other stuff is this but less time-sensitive, obviously):

- It is important to have your uploading device close-by. The files aren't huge, but you don't want to deal with any lag in time-sensitive uploads.  
- After I fire off a burst and have a moment, i flip forward (as the camera will display the latest RAW) and select the BASIC i want to upload. I lock it. The Eye-Fi network should start up, and the iPhone should connect. I always keep the eye-fi app open, so i can flip over to it to make sure the transfer happens (for this part it's great to have someone else so you can have your eye on the runway).  
- Once the file is uploaded, or even if it's not quite yet, but the photo has been chosen, I delete everything else off the Eye-Fi card. This is **very** important, as it makes flipping to the END of the SECOND card a LOT faster. Your RAWs stay untouched on the main card, but the second card needs to be free to access the end of. ***If someone knows how to ""jump to the end"" of a card on a Nikon, please enlighten me!***  
- Rinse and repeat.

I was truly surprised at how well this system worked. A big part of it is having a) a main card that lets you fire away and capture the stuff you need. B) having a second person to handle the actual posting. C) the 'Lock to upload' system that ensures you are not constantly uploading every shot, only the ones you want to.

That's about it- a few steps of prep make the end result that much faster. FWIW i saved this setup to my U2 user preset and for daily/nightlife shooting (2nd card acts as overflow and shoot RAW only) I can flip back to M/U1 and not worry about fiddling with settings.

Cheers, enjoy, and take from this what you will!

Happy shooting!"
33e7uq,1,2015-04-21,"21, about to start my first ""real"" job, get married, and grow up. HELP?!",tallenbear,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/33e7uq/21_about_to_start_my_first_real_job_get_married/,"I'm looking for some guidance, since this next year is going to bring a lot of changes to my personal life and finances. I've been following this subreddit for a while so I have a vague idea of what to do, but I need more specific advice for my circumstances. 

I've worked at restaurants since I was 16. I'm a pretty practical person by nature so I've been about to support myself, buy a used car, and keep some money in savings along the way. But now that I'm looking at a full-time job with benefits next month, taking out my first large loans for school and a car, and growing up/ starting a life with my soon-to-be husband. We are doing a courthouse ceremony sometime this summer, since it will dramatically improve my FAFSA numbers for the fall.

**Jobs:** I'm starting a nutrition related position at a very elite hospital in town. They will be paying me $12 an hour so just under $25k a year. Last year, I made around a thousand more waiting tables, but the benefits, PTO, work, and experience are all things I really need. He just started at a new location of a nice deli/cafe. He is getting paid $300 per week now. The owner wants to have him supervise once the restaurant starts making more. He will be paid about $550 a week hopefully starting in the next month or so.


**School:** I'm looking at 1 more year of community college ($3k) and 2 years at university ($13k per year) for my bachelor's degree and then 1-2 years more on an internship to become a Registered Dietitian. Depending on what internships I can get or want, I could be paid, or *more likely* paying up to 20k for a combined masters program. There is a chance we would need to move states to where I can intern. I have been in college for 3 years (switched majors) and I have taken out around 3k in a subsidized student loan. My new job will reimburse a little over 5k each year for school. My tribe will likely give me a scholarship for around 2.5k when I enter university. I could apply for more scholarships with Native American organizations.


My SO wants to be a teacher and will be starting community college this fall. This will hopefully be 6k for two years of community college and 26k for two years of university. He does not have anything besides financial aid to help. If I somehow get excess money in scholarships and I spend it on his education, does it get taxed?


**Healthcare:** I'm covered by my mom's plan but he will age out of his dad's plan this February. I could enroll in health coverage when I start, or during open enrollment this November. I was thinking about enrolling now, so his orthodontist is cheaper for the rest of the year. Otherwise, he rarely needs a doctor. I have food allergies and asthma, so I usually have a few doctors visits and testing done each year. My new job offers 2 options. One is a typical healthcare plan, then the other has a healthcare spending account. The company will contribute 2k each year (prorated this year) for a family. This would have higher deductibles and copays though. I'm not really sure how an HSA works or what option is most beneficial. I know there is a limit to contribute tax-free but I have no idea what that means for me. There is some wellness incentive program that will contribute 1.5k for either plan. I'm leaning toward the HSA plan since we may have kids later on (much, *much*, later) or god forbid, an accident. Does this sound right?


**Auto:** I have the most beautiful 95' Pontiac Bonneville. His name is James Franco. Great car, but over 230k miles so I'm not sure how many years he has left... This is the only car and with my SO starting school, it would make our lives much easier to get a second car. I would like to get a used Prius to save on gas since I drive a pretty good amount each year. He would drive James Franco. I would probably spend about 10-12k total, with 1k down. I do the only driving now, but I got a quote for adding a *new* Prius and his name on the insurance and my rate would only go up around $120 a month. Is this feasible for our income? Should I wait until the Spring?


**Current finances/credit**
Right now we have $1873 combined in cash, checking and savings. There is $300 on the credit card but we pay it off every month. I've had the card for almost 3 years and I added him to it so he would have a credit history. The current limit is $2,750. Capital one credit tracker estimates my credit score at 689. I would like to bump this up before I get an auto loan. Should I get another credit card? I bank with Chase so I thought about trying to get a credit card from them, which would look better on my auto loan application.

I have the option to set up a 401k. For up to 3% of pay, they match 100%. For the next 2% they match 50%. I plan on putting in 5% to get the match. Since I'm really not making much, will this really make an impact for my over time? I know having a 401k is a good idea but do I just put money in and forget it until I retire? Or is it more involved than that?


I would like to own a house someday but I'm not really in that stage of my life yet. How will I know a good time to stop renting? I'm in the Phoenix area so houses vary a ton in price. What kind of down payment should I really aim for and when?


Thank you for your time! Let me know if I left out something or if there are questions. I really will appreciate anything you guys can help me with."

I've received and accepted an internship offer with a company that works on a military base. This was about 3 weeks ago and since then I have been interviewing at several other places in anticipation of my record preventing me from working there. Since then, I've received 3 other offers (one of which I decided to inform the HR of my background ahead of time to get an immediate answer). The military base background investigation sounds like it has barely even started, the first steps going on later this week. Company B has an *outstanding* offer and wants to know my decision by the end of this week. My question is, considering I already started filling out the application and employment forms for the on-base internship, what would you do in my situation? Company B has a background investigation of their own as well, but given the company has about 20 employees, I feel it might be more lenient.

The situation really is quite depressing and a huge let-down every time it prevents me from pursuing something. If I don't end up being able to follow through with any position this Summer, I think I'm going to give up on internships until it's expunged from my record. I don't want to get to the front door of several companies for them to have in their records I was rejected as the result of a background check. Do you guys feel this is probably best?

Thanks a ton for your advice everybody.

A side-note: Since the event I've been unable to work at 3 different locations, one of which was a pretty large company. If you're over 18, and plan on looking for a job anytime soon, stay away from cannabis or be ***very*** careful with it. "

I understand that people have posted about similar topics but mine is relatively specific so hopefully if you're in the industry or have had experience with this - that you might be able to help. 

I interviewed for a summer internship via Skype around early April (the 2nd?) at one of the major agencies (NYC). 

It was for one of its ""branded entertainment"" subsidiaries so it was more of a general internship (not specifically account management, copy, art, etc.). I received the interview due to networking and I still haven't even found an application online (for this specific subsidiary) on the firms career page. 

I interviewed with two relatively high up people (consecutively) and felt that overall both went very well - although the second interview may have gone slightly better. In terms of my resume/experience, I think it's pretty applicable and felt decently confident after the interview.

Anyway, they told me that I was one one of the first to be interviewed so I should not worry if I don't hear back right away. I also sent ""Thank You"" emails after.

Here's my question. The person who set me up with the interview also works in this specific subsidiary (although is not as high up as the people I've interviewed with). 

I'm wondering do you guys think I should contact this person and ask if they have any updated information? Or should I simply just wait it out?

Also, do you guys have any idea when these decisions will be made? Late April? Early May? I was pretty surprised that I was the first person to be interviewed as I thought that it was already kind of late - close to the summer. 

All in all - this is my dream internship and I would love to do whatever I can to increase my chances. 

Any information/advice you guys have would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

33ekjj,11,2015-04-21,[NJ] going to trial for suspended license.,5DollarLunchSpecial,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/33ekjj/nj_going_to_trial_for_suspended_license/,"I'm a student in college and I come back from studying abroad and insure my car again for the next six months- one lump sum payment. I don't live with my parents as I'm away for college but my mail gets delivered to my parents house. 

Fast forward about two months- February. I get pulled over. 
Officer: ""your car is coming up uninsured.""
Me: ""are you sure, it's been insured since December *hands insurance*""
Officer: ok I took a look at it and called your insurance company, seems like there was an error in communicating with the DMV and they told me it got squared away. 
*lets me go, no biggie*

About two weeks later, same situation, I tell the officer my car is insured, it seems like my insurance company didn't contact the DMV like they were supposed to. 


Two weeks later again, I get pulled over, this time I get a ticket for Driving with a suspended license because of an uninsured vehicle. After your car is uninsured for so long for failing to provided proof of insurance, yet still registered, they suspended your license. 

I immediately contact the DMV and after waiting some four hours on the phone got my license restored right on the phone. 

I went to court today for the suspended driving ticket and found out that in NJ it is a $560 mandatory fine and 6 months mandatory suspension of license for driving on a suspended license. 
Nearly shitting my pants at this point because if I lose my license I can't afford to work at the internship I worked so hard to get into. 

The judge says that I should have came to court with the restoration letter. But my parents house never received a restoration letter. 
Nevertheless, I plead not guilty, and that I am representing myself on trial. 
Judge said to come back with the restoration letter. 

I am now waiting for my trial date, and probably going to be on the phone with the DMV for a couple of hours just so that they can send that stupid letter again. 

My insurance card says that my car was completely insured every time I've been stopped, it's valid from December to June. Additionally, it's a lump sum payment so my car didn't all of a sudden become uninsured because of delinquent payments. 

What do you guys think? Think I'm pretty much screwed?

33enr6,12,2015-04-21,Should I leave my job at a startup?,csthrowaway6554643,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/33enr6/should_i_leave_my_job_at_a_startup/,"I'm asking this because I'm becoming increasingly disillusioned with the startup I joined right out of college. Problem is that, being my first real job (excluding internships), I don't know if my experience is normal or not.

After graduation I did some contract work for a startup that was in its very early stages. Long story short, I ended up sticking with the company as the first engineer. I accepted a small amount of equity in the company in exchange for a salary ~35% under market value for the area with no other benefits (health, bonuses, etc.). With the understanding that my salary would increase to market rate once the company had raised funding which it had plans to do in a few months time. Please don't tell me this was a bad decision; I already know that. I'm looking to mitigate damage at this point.

The company was doing well enough to continue operating without needing to inject investor capital so the decision was made to hold off on doing a seed round. It's been almost a year now and I have not received a salary bump or more equity and the plans for raising funding are continually delayed since it is not needed to keep the company moving forward. The opportunity cost of this for me is huge.

On one hand, I work from home 95% of the time which is a big plus for me and as the only engineer, most engineering decisions are left to me. The future of company appears stable so I also know there is potential for me to be in a leadership role as the team grows. However, as of late, the founders and I clash over various topics on a nearly daily basis, I don't get to work on the stuff I want to work on and think is important, and feel as though I'm simply an assistant for the one founder to get his work done with constant ""urgent"" feature requests around stuff that is more IT management than actually working on our product.

Is this just the way software engineering jobs are? Or is this a toxic environment I should get out of? I'm generally increasingly unhappy with the way things are here, but I don't know if it's actually bad or just the usual ""I dislike my job"" feelings everyone gets. Is it time to leave or should I stick it out?"
33ep6e,1,2015-04-21,My (F/23) inappropriate Ex-Boss (M/46) is harassing me and manipulating me about not responding to an email.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/33ep6e/my_f23_inappropriate_exboss_m46_is_harassing_me/,"I'm looking for some guidance in a situation that I am in, any advice or guidance would be extremely appreciated! I know this is going to be a wall of text but I want to paint a clear picture of the situation.


3 years ago I started working at a small mom and popshop in my town while I was home from college. I would work part time while still taking classes nearby. There are only about 4 employees at this boutique, including myself. The two owners are husband and wife; we'll call Jim and Sarah. They were great people to work for we maintained great relationship throughout my time there. 


Throughout my time working there, there have been some instances where I would question why I was working there or Jim’s intentions…

-Jim would constantly tell me what I need to do with my life, tell me I should break up with my boyfriend, where I should move, etc. 

-He would text me a lot. For example, when he asked how a job interview went and I said ""Not too well, Just gotta keep looking"" ha said ""There’s something better for you. Just make sure to consult with me first."" 

-He would say/do things that made me uncomfortable. For example, I said ""I bought some overalls"" and he would say ""you can't wear them here I love girls in overalls"" 

-I was slouching one day and he came up to me and pulled my shoulders back and said ""I know you have those weighing you down""(Pointing to my chest) and laugh.


I always thought that these comments were in good fun, they always made me uncomfortable in the back of my head, but I would just tell myself he’s like that with everyone. My boyfriend would always feel uncomfortable about it too. He would constantly tell me that he thought what Jim would say to me was inappropriate and creepy, but I never really saw it until this incident. 


So, when I quit Jim and I had a “business meeting” if you will, he is always coming up with these ideas for new business ideas and he had a new one and wanted me on board. He told me to email him in a week if I were interested in partnering with him. Long story short, I never emailed him back, I had quit the shop and I was busy applying to jobs and going to interviews. In retrospect, I definitely should have at least let him know that I wasn’t interested in doing it and good luck. They had done a lot for me over the years and I definitely should have just told him.


So, fast forward to yesterday, I text Jim letting him know I put him as a reference for this job I had interviewed for. He told me that he needed to speak with me, so I agreed to come in after I got off my internship. So today I go into the shop and he looks at me and shakes his head and say were going to talk outside. 


We sit down and he immediately starts yelling at me. Asking me to explain myself as to why I never responded. Telling me that I have a good side to myself and a bad side and that I have insecurities and confidence issues, I have burned my bridges here, he’s going to give me a bad review, he thinks I’m a terrible person, etc. I am shocked. I didn’t know what to say. I know I should have emailed him back but I didn’t think it was going to be this big of a deal. He kept asking me why I didn’t get back to him or what issues that I have that make me this way. He looks at me and says “After 3 years I feel like I don’t even know the real you.”


At this point I get upset and start crying. I finally get the courage to say to him, “You constantly try to tell me how to live my life and who I should date and every flaw that I have and honestly that isn’t your place as my boss.” He says I’m right and he understands but that he doesn’t like being an actual boss, he wants to be more of a friend. So, at this point he asks if I want to rebuild this relationship and start with a solid foundation. I didn’t know how to tell him no and that I want to just move on with my life and put this shop in the past. So I tell him that I’ll write him an email explaining my feelings on everything and where I think things should go from here. He also reminds me that I owe the store $200 for a mistake I made with the cash register, and asks me how I’m going to repay him and that we need to come up with an agreement. 


So, now I feel terrible, stuck and scared. My mom is telling me that I need to mend my relationship with him because I don’t want to lose that reference. My dad is saying that he is being extremely inappropriate and that he is harassing me and I need to cut him out of my life. My boyfriend thinks he’s manipulating me and taking advantage of who I am as a person because he thinks Jim wants to have sex with me… 


I honestly don’t know what to do. When he was yelling at me it really felt like his motives were more because he felt hurt that I betrayed him, but did I really betray him that terribly? It felt like a jealous boyfriend getting mad at me for not texting him back. 


If anyone has any insight on how I should handle this or go about it that would be much appreciated. I hate having issues with people but I don’t think I can feel comfortable being in the same room with him again. I have no idea what to do…Should I email him back? What do I do about the money I owe him? I feel so upset and sick to my stomach about this.


TL;DR: My, at times inappropriate, ex boss got extremely angry with me for not replying to an email about a business opportunity with him and yelled at me and attacked my who I am as a person.

First of all I’d like to thank anyone who can help or just give some advice.

So I am a high school student planning on going to college, and i have so many questions. Since I was a kid I have wanted to create a game, a video game I could play, so as I grew older that career path started to become a programmer. I have started to learn the very very basics of it online and would be happy to learn much more before I even start college. But now before I commit that to myself and sign up for those classes I have a million and one questions I would like an answer to. Anything will help and if you can only answer one or two that's completely fine I'm just happy to hear anything. I will try to organize the questions into sections so if you can only answer one section or graze through and pick a few that is fine.

Also I plan on posting this on a few subreddits just to try and hear back as much feedback as I can, I apologize if you see it pop up on several subreddits you are subscribed to.

**Average day:**

* Do you get to work from home very much if at all?
* If you are going to the office, do you get to dress casual or in a suit style?
* Do you have a “cheat sheet” of sorts or do you just have to memorize most of what you use? Also a side question, how many different commands do you use in a normal day (a lot or a few)?
* How often do you work with your team compared to alone coding?
* Do you normally enjoy your job?
* Just what is your average day working like?

**Education and getting a job:**

* Where could someone like me be able to learn a lot online (hopefully for free)?
* How do I actually go ask for an internship do companies have an application form or something?
* People love these huge universities and talk about how great it looks to go to a well known one, but how much does that actually matter? 
* Most colleges say they have a great technical program, but where actually does have a program that can benefit me greatly in my job.
* How hard would you say it is for an average programmer to get a job?
* I have heard that large gaming companies have a bad rep, why is that and would you say that not working for them is suggested?

33ewk8,4,2015-04-21,Professional and Academic Woes of a 31-year old,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/33ewk8/professional_and_academic_woes_of_a_31year_old/,"Hey there, thanks for reading.

I think that I went about my education and professional life wrong, and everyday I have panic attacks I'll never get anywhere, professionally. So here's my baggage.

NOTE: Through all of the following I worked as a server for money, but while I LOVE serving tables (I really do, its fun and good money), I am not willing to put this on my professional resume... I have a separate one for the service industry. I am sometimes ashamed of the 15 years I've spent in the industry. I can't be the only one.

I was an adult, non-traditonal student in college. I went back at 24 and graduated in 2012... When I did, I knew I wanted to study environmental science, but no specific subject. After studying abroad, I chose a very ""loose"" major in college... Global Resource Systems. GRS is a dynamic and cutting-edge degree that culminates all the levels and pieces of globalization, but doesn't focus on one technical area. Because of this widespread course load, I have basic training in general areas (ecology, anthropology, politics, economics, engineering, agronomy...), but I am not truly specialized in any one area. I did two internships abroad working with sub-tropical forestry, and while they were amazing research opportunities and life experiences, they are not directly transferrable to the professional realm here in America and were each just 3 months in duration.

Anyways, out of college I applied for jobs in every corner of the US and Canada that had anything to do with entry-level work in areas that I truly believed I was ""qualified"" for.  Crickets. After awhile I got extremely depressed. I cut off friends, moved out of a house I was co-renting and back into my parents basement... I just sunk, deep into a hole. I felt like a huge failure, there I was, a fresh college graduate who has traveled and studied the world... and I can't get a freaking interview. I was crushed.

A little bit down the road, I got an email from a friend who said she could get me a job in a chemistry lab. I flunked chemistry in high school and struggled in college, so, I said no at first because, well, I suck at chemistry. Eventually I caved and took the interview because no one else was calling. They gave me the job on the spot, mostly out of desperation, but partially because I am a great small-talker (thanks serving). SO I played ""fake it until I make it"" and picked up the techniques as I went along, but clearly it was not a field I was going to stay in. So my back-up plan was applying for grad school. I got into one, but it was completely unfeasible financially as I didn't receive an assistantship of any sort, and it was located in one of the more remote and expensive US cities. So, instead of sinking back into a hole of defeat, I moved across the country in search of work... I figured, if I'm going to be serving and doing work that I could care less about, I might as well do it in a scenic area. SO, I headed to the Pacific Northwest and fell in love with the area. But again, I was serving, and getting rejected, full-time. Not such a deep depression, but still horrifyingly bleak most days.

Once again, a shining angel came to my rescue, in the form of my paternal kin... she told me her friend was hiring a recruiter for a study abroad organization, YIPPEE! I've done that, thrice! I was late to the applicant pool, and while I wasn't the first person they offered the job to, I did eventually get it and am currently with the company. 

Just my luck though... within a month I realized this company is sinking, and fast. Jumping ship before it takes livelihoods away is imminent. The CEO is a madwoman, the VP is a wandering mind and spirit, they are in major financial and legal trouble, my boss and secretary have both quit, I'm carrying a majority share of the work... I'm miserable. I LOVE the type of work I do (academic advising, study abroad) but the place that I work is unbearable and I fear I won't be able to take it much longer, because I'll go mad.

SO... Once again, I've been applying jobs. Almost nightly for the last 3 weeks, at least 1 a week before that for 4 months. I don' t qualify for anything above entry-level, and even then, folks with their masters' are going for those, so my measly and loose bachelor's doesn't stand a chance in the pool of choices. I am also applying for serving jobs again. I always made decent money and its usually less than 40 hours... even if it is part time as I phase myself out of my current position... its there.

I guess its obvious I need to go back to grad school or a technical degree, but I need it to work out financially. I have taken this winter/spring to plot out my favorite programs and the logistics for application season this fall. The kicker here is... I am bad a standardized tests. My GRE scores are nothing to brag about. 60th percentile. While I did get into a program before, I think I didn't get the TA &amp; RA positions because of my low score. SO I'll be applying, but I fear it may cost me an arm and a leg, for a still uncertain economic climate.

On top of all of that, I'm single and 31 - I'm not necessarily sad about my age and disposition, but my friends are getting married and buying houses (their having kids too, but I choose child-free... so that doesn't affect me as much), I'm barely getting by and, honestly, floundering professionally and mentally. I just don't stack up against my peers. I know they don't love me any less, but it seems I do.

The one upside of all this academic and professional mess... is my best girl, my dog. I adopted her my sophomore year and she brightens my day from the time I wake up, to the time I go to sleep, every. single. day. She is my best friend and road dog. But because of her, I can't necessarily move over seas permanently. She was horribly abused  and had huge trust issues when I got her, and just our move recently has brought up issues of anxiety and agitation. I think it might be too hard for her and I'm not giving her up.

So there you have it... these are my burdensa... I feel better, for now, at least. I still have hope, I still have serving, I still have Lu and there is always grad school... but DAMN IT, if I could turn back time... I think I would do it a bit differently.

Cheers to you all."

I never really liked that degree and thought they didn't teach us enough but I felt pressured into finishing it. Since then I haven't been able to find any work. I mean, nothing at all. I can't even get casual work in retail etc. because I've only had one job in fast food, an internship and one short stint as a volunteer. I'm on unemployment and as part of that I have to apply for so many jobs every week, but it's either no response or a straight up no, even for things that say 'no experience required'.

I have no interest in trying to get into my degree area, even if there was any jobs. I started studying graphic design whilst finishing my degree and I'm supposed to be finishing in August but I've also lost interest in that. I haven't done any work since last year and can't muster up the motivation to start. I'm studying online and I hate it but my parents are trying to force me to finish it. I did talk to a design agency a few months ago (the only success I've had, aside from an interview with a teenie chain clothing store) but with nothing new to show them I don't think I'm going to be a potential employee. I've always loved being creative so I thought a career in that area might make me happy but now I hate the industry and am finding the whole thing impossible.

I can't seem to get a foot in the door anywhere. I hate myself because all my friends have lives and jobs and are supporting themselves and I'm stuck inside by myself doing nothing all day.

One thing I considered doing was applying for a traineeship in freight forwarding (I could be paid to learn, maybe work my way up eventually, and I could move back to the city), but the ads all say they are suited for high school leavers and I have long been and gone from that. I am also considering teaching english in south korea but it is a very intense application process and I have no work experience and I also need two letters of recommendation which I don't have.

Maybe I could go back to uni but I feel like there's just no work anywhere. I don't want to spend another 3 or 4 years at school and still not be able to find work. I just have no idea what to do and I'm sick of people asking me about it. "

I started an internship with the provincial government one and a half years ago. among the few people i work with is nancy, who works in communications. nancy fits in pretty well with the office. she generally works by herself, so people dont have much experience in dealing with her.


 last fall, nancy offered to rent my girlfriend and i an apartment adjacent to her home. nancy owns the apartment and her garage is situated underneath it. at first, i had no problem with nancy. she was polite and i quite appreciated her offer to rent us the apartment, at a very slightly discounted rate. we live in a city where it is difficult to find a decent apartment and nearly impossible to find a decent one that is not ludicrously expensive. so my girlfriend and i are quite happy with the apartment.


nancy has shown some behavior towards me that has increased over the past year and a half. first of all, im an intern (i am well paid and have full benefits, it is not a typical internship but more like being an articling student). so i am happy to do odd jobs here and there that people need help with around the office. for example, moving a desk or running an errand. nancy initially asked for help here and there with small things like this, which didnt bother me at all.


sometimes, nancy's husband was gone for a week and nancy asked me to help bring pellets into her home, which i didnt mind doing. she also asked me to bring out her trash. at first, i thought this was a bit strange, but since i am a helpful person, i just went with it. i dont mind helping people who need help.


her husband has gone out of town pretty regularly over the past few months and it has become a bit of a routine for me to help her with pellets and garbage when her husband is away. once, however, she asked me to come to her house twice late at night to fix her childs bed. this greatly upset my girlfriend, because we were trying to put our own child to sleep in our apartment, and my coming and going disrupted my childs sleep.


nancy also recently asked me to help her bring her groceries into her home. like, two medium sized bags of groceries. at this point i am becoming a bit puzzled and slightly disturbed by this trend.
she also does this with food. she will give me some food here and there, like a half finished box of berries or a small smoothie that she had brought to work with her. i really am confused about these offerings.


yesterday, as i was walking by her office, she said 'ive got a cookie for you' and gave me the last cookie in a box. i gladly took the cookie, but she handed me the whole box, clearly wanting me to dispose of the box. im left thinking that she only gave me the cookie because she wanted to get rid of the box?


also, she closes the door to the garage quite loudly. we asked her and her husband to please close it more quietly in the future because it can wake our child up. her husband closes it quietly now, but she does not.
we plan to leave the apartment in a few months, but obviously i will still have to work with her. not living beside her will make the worst of this go away.


i dont mind helping people who need help, but i know nancy is strong enough to bring in her own groceries, hang her own pictures on her office wall, or carry out her garbage. i feel like an indentured servant at home. my girlfriend is pissed and im also slowly getting angry about this. i really dont like being taken advantage of! 
   
**tl;dr** im still seriously confused about what is going on here. any insight would be highly appreciated. "

I'm 90% certain I will not get a full time offer. I'm also certain they will not give me a good review. A month in and I'm still in the same spot. I don't know much more than I did before and its frustrating. Tired. I haven't done anything here. I haven't learned much at all.

I haven't done anything here. I've been given an assignment, and I'm not far at all on it. I feel so pathetic since its a relatively simple task. I keep asking questions and trying to get where I need to be-but I'm falling short each time. Further, its like I'm not actually doing the assignment, but rather the people I'm asking are(more on this).

So with that, my day also isn't very productive. I do maybe about 2 hours of work--MAYBE. The rest of the time I'm trying to teach myself things about the company, learn how they are doing other work(not related to my tasks), and general reading/asking questions. Makes me feel unproductive. Now, I've asked for more work, but I can see the hesitation in my boss's eyes because I'm not versed in this engineering discipline so it will take a lot of work to get me up to speed. 


Now, back to my assignments. I ask for a lot of help. Even on the most basic stuff. I'm trying to learn, but at the end of the day it seems like I'm just transcribing things that my coworkers have said. I feel like they are doing the real work here. I'm also always asking for review of my work. Always. I'm not sure if I should be, but I always do, and there is always mistakes. 

Further, there's two other interns. Both are masters graduates, and this is their second internship(different companies) and I am always bugging them for help. I ask them all the time for review and things since they work on similar tasks. I feel bad because I'm eating up a lot of their time, and then they even present things very professionally and mine are sloppy. Everyone likes them.

And that's another thing. I don't think anyone likes me. I feel like they think all I do is sit around-true, but still. To add to that, I'm the only one who hasn't been invited to any social event that they've had. I'm also trying to fit in but when I talk or make a joke(similar to the ones made) it falls very very flat. My boss doesn't really like me. I know he's disappointed in my progress. I know he wants me to be better in meetings and presentations but I let him down every time.




Sorry for the long post its just how I'm feeling. I'm going to get a bad review for sure. I'm assigned relatively simple tasks but the subjects are things I've never seen. I spend a lot of the day circling around reading, and then confusing myself. I ask a lot but then feel like I'm not doing the work but rather the people I'm asking are. My assignments have been torn apart before and I'm reworking them. I just don't know, I'm not productive, I haven't done much, I don't spend my time well, etc.

Feels good to let it out, but I'm looking for any advice?"

I have been accepted into two colleges in the US, [Gettysburg College](http://www.gettysburg.edu/) and the more well-known [New York University](http://www.nyu.edu/). My problem is that I cannot decide which college I want to attend. To better inform you, heres a breakdown of the facts -

______________

My major- Computer Science.


Gettysburg - 5 hours from home and will cost around 16,000$ (which my parents will be paying in full) a year after I received a 44,000$ grant from them. A great school for history related majors, and is ranked among the top liberal arts schools in the nation. Attending this school will leave me with no debt after college, but could be harder to find a higher paying job with a degree from here. The starting salary of a Gettysburg graduate is about 55,000.

 

NYU - Only an hour from home, but will cost me personally 28,000$ and thus will leave me 113,000$ in debt after college. The benefits are the amazing experience of living in NYC during college, the internship opportunities, and the chance of getting a very high paying job immediately after my graduation. The average starting salary of a NYU graduate is 75,000.


My ideas- I love NYU and would go there in a heartbeat if the price was lower. Gettysburg is also a very nice school, and I think I could be happy there, but NYU is my dream school. 


_______________


So my question to you is, does it really make sense to go to NYU instead of Gettysburg? Does the NYU degree really make up for all of the debt? What should I do?

Thank you for all of your help!"

I am a PhD student in an applied STEM field, and I would greatly appreciate some help/advice/ and guidance I’m in the end-of-the semester jams. It’s very hard for me to be open about this because I realistically probably should have talked to my advisor about all my insecurities, concerns, and questions back in September, or at least in October after I initially struggled (which I had expected). Now that I’m ~8 months in to this academic year, I may not be able to return next year, unless I can do something shape up.


I started doing research in my 3rd year, which started this past August, after finishing other hoops to jump through like coursework and TA'ing. I also did an internship that lasted 1 year during this time which was great in many ways but did not give me ultimately research experience without feedback, which perhaps was the most valuable thing I could have gotten. It was only even “research” in that it was essentially an unsupervised R&amp;D project, deadlines were not enforced.

The way it works in this department for starting grad research is that you must essentially present some ""research summary"" of the field you'll be working in early on. Granted this is limited in scope but it's a “formal way” to hit the ground running. Expected work time is maybe a month or so and then you present the research findings of some relevant papers in your field. Some students finish this as early as their second year, though it can be done later. My deadline for this hoop to jump through is this semester. I'll refer to this as project Q.

For my project Q, initially I found 3 papers I went to my advisor that weren’t actually that well written, IMHO. The methodology seemed good in probably one of the three papers I chose, so I expected I could do much better, and I aimed to present perhaps a new method for my project Q (at least new compared to the original ones I looked at). I aimed to get a better understanding of the context of those papers, and I proceeded to read, understand, and take notes on the order of about 50 papers in the area. I took notes on the principles behind their methodologies and started writing my report across these papers ( different journals ). 

While working on project Q, I’ve also been doing some work on another project that I joined (Hereafter called project R) very soon after deciding my topic Project Q. Project R involved programming something using some data centric technique, and it wasn’t really clear how to do this at first. I tried using many models last fall. After 1 semester of research: some failed attempts working on the Project R and an incomplete Project Q, but lots of writing and background familiarizing complete.

In January starting up again this semester, I actually figured out a method that ended up working for Project R. After  much additional effort, working straight away through march, I was able to present some preliminary research to other interested parties (other grad students, some professors, and some others). There were a few quirks with my presentation, but overall the work was positively received and I received some interesting suggestions as to where to go from here. I have begun developing the mathematics behind how that would work, or how it could be utilized.

The specific problem: Fast forward to today and I’m just rushing to complete project Q in time, with not many days left until I must complete finish it. I’m getting closer, but my simulation does not work still, and it will still take a solid week  to get it working, get the results, and add them to my currently incomplete report assuming things go smoothly (hopefully!).

Question: 
Okay so while I do believe I’ve accomplished a few good things this academic year but realistically it was a complete mess, but how did I end up in this position and how could I realistically (!!) have done better? At no point in time did I have any confidence in myself and I still don’t about my ability to do research. I can’t tell you how many times I said to myself “What is research?” this past year because I still don’t know. Most applied research as far as I know in abstraction is about trying a different technique or applying some ideas here and there. Every once in a while you get a really neat/novel idea but most of the time they just make glorified academic case studies, depending on how applied the research is. The grimy details though are so different though and I can get so stuck for durations, and I tend to work realllllly slow, and I lose sight of how this is supposed to be research at all. I also tend to get distracted by learning some techniques that I’m unfamiliar with that I should probably know, so I’ll revamp on those (again, switching fields: there’s still lots to learn that I should probably know, even though I’m technically done with required classes.). 


Other Thoughts that could be potential problems: 
One goto thing to blame for not being able to jump through this hoop would be that I added more stuff into my project Q than I should have. While I agree it added time, I completed this step of familiarizing myself with the research area last semester, I don’t think that’s really what’s taking so long because I didn’t get stuff on any theoretical understanding: I got stuck implementing the thing. If I write more unit tests, I should be able to find the problem :/  (something else I learned a little late in the game about programming / implementation skills). 

I don’t communicate with my advisor unless it’s necessary. And my advisor is pretty relaxed in general and I don’t really know if I’m on track at all. I feel like when I meet my advisor, I sort of become a shell of who I really am, because I don’t feel comfortable talking about the things I really need help on.. We don’t meet on a regular weekly basis or anything but if I have something I want to show him, or if he’s curious about results, he’ll want to meet. Generally  I tell him what I’m doing but, and this is I’m pretty sure my fault, I don’t necessarily feel comfortable expressing my concerns about my abilities. I’m not really sure what an advisor’s role is in my research duties, but I’m pretty darn sure I’m not learning anything from mine, and the kicker is that it’s probably my fault. I can’t just ask “Am I supposed to go to a conference at some point?” “What question should I be asking you right now?” “What am I doing wrong?” “Why am I so slow at making progress?” “I have no idea what I’m doing?” 

...

It kind of irks me to my core that there isn’t some more systematic procedure for all of these *structural* issues. I thought research was supposed to be more structured than this? Why did I need to go to grad school if this  is what scholarly research consists of? 
The rabbit whole of what I don’t understand/don’t feel comfortable with about this so called “academic research” goes pretty deep. I haven’t published anything after toiling away and I don’t really know how to change this. I know a master’s student who already graduated that published twice in a period of about 6 months, and he told me “I think you’re making it harder than it really is.”  Made me feel really good. /s 

Trust me though, I’m generally in sync with what a PhD program aims to do: teach one to produce novel research. I just have no idea how to do this though, and I don’t know what to do about it.

The motivator I have to keep going is that I’m gaining skills all over the place by doing this stuff,whether it’s research are not, and it’s obvious to me that the skills are highly translatable to a job in which I’d work a boss telling me to “build ____ for me and make it work this well, etc.” whether research is involved or not. I’d love to publish though and end up in a job where I can work on state of the art in my area. But my big deficiency in either academic research, or said hypothetical job, would be that I don’t know how to organize large projects I set out to finish, be it a personal, professional, or academic one. I magically know the next step. I have plans but I get stuck somewhere and I don’t really know how to respond other than progress slowing down massively somewhere. Sometimes this is I think because I see a “right” way to do a which takes a long time to do when you’re learning it as you go, rather than more iterative progress, but I can’t really psychoanalyze myself.
Closing thoughts:

[Dr. Phil Guo]( http://www.pgbovine.net/index.html) just made some relevant posts on precisely what I struggle with:

&gt; What is the immediate next step to suggest for the student to take at this time?

&gt;Assuming that a project idea is well-conceived, completing it is simply a matter of consistently taking one step after another, and intelligently course-correcting along the way. Thus, the primary role of a research advisor is to think about the immediate next step at every stage of the project, and to communicate suggestions in the proper way to motivate students to make steady progress on it.

&gt; Let's look at two extremes of this idea. First, imagine an ultra hands-off, super-chill advisor. Here would be the directive to each student:

&gt; * Step 1: Think of a good idea.
&gt; * Step 2: Publish the paper on it.


Yep. That’s about what research looks like to me. That’s the entirety of all I know about how to perform academic research: those 2 bullet points.

Anyway, this is really embarrassing; any feedback would be much appreciated.

Actually we have a pretty good relationship but something that bothers me is that my SO still has contact with several ex-lovers. Most of them are really just friends and I know about those men. But some are really sketchy guys. We've talked about them and I never had the reason to mistrust her. She was always honest to me. 

I'm currently doing an internship in another town and we only can meet on the weekends. In the first month there still was a lot affection, we talked about how we miss each other and so on. But suddenly it dropped down to almost zero. We still had a great time when I was with her but our communication during my absence changed. It felt like she couldn't stand the intimacy of a relationship anymore.So I tried to talk to her. She told me that everything is fine and she's just under a lot of pressure. She has two kids and a huge house so there's a lot to do. I told her that I understand but I feel like she doesn't wants to text me anymore. She stated that she needs more space because she doesn't wants to redo the mistakes she did in her marriage. She told me that she gave up herself back then and now she wants to stay herself. That was okay for me since she meant doing stuff alone like gardening, girls night etc. I couldn't really understand why she wanted to suddenly text me less, just because of this but I labeled it as arising routine. It all still bothered me a bit and I thought something is off. 

Even though she always told me that everything is fine (had several talks) I still felt something is off. At first I labeled it as my own insecurities but the more time passed the more I felt that it's real. So... This weekend I got a grab on her phone. Yes, that's the worst thing you should do but I needed certainty. I had to find out myself what's going on to safe our relationship. I suspected that it's all about that space-stuff and I was quite right. So I opened some chats and my heart dropped. She wrote with several guys saying stuff like ""would you have sex with me?"", ""I'm free next weekend, you want to come over?"" or ""I think I really like you..."". So yeaaaahhh, I was crushed. The messages were a bit older (about a month), some of them were from the time before I left for my internship. So she wrote some of them while I thought everything was totally fine... She never met those guys, at least that's what I can predict from reading them. I don't know if there were phone calls as well... But most of them didn't elaborate on this stuff and the topics changed back to ""normal"" conversation.


So my heart feels like a stone and I fucked up. I don't know if she cheated on me. It could be a way to vent. I get that she has a lot trouble to trust again after a marriage of 18 years. Commiting is hard after such a long time. It could also be a way to seek validation without the ""stifling"" boundaries of a relationship. I don't know what kind of feelings she has towards these guys. And maybe someday a fantasy/outlet leads to something real or a real need for it... I'm in love with her so I don't want to break up. I actually still trust her in some ways. I tried to talk about it a bit (as much as I could with out admitting I've stalked through her phone). I just told her that she should tell me if she needs even more space and wants to meet other people. I asked if she misses her adventerous days. She told me that she would definitely talk about an issue like this and I don't have to worry. Everything is fine and she doesn't needs an adventure, that's what she told me. But those messages speak another language...    
I can't confront her without breaking her trust in me. But I think that's the only thing I could do now. Talk to her in a calm way. I want to safe this relationship. If she really cheated on me, I don't know... maybe I would find the courage to break up. But at the moment I just want to be with her and safe our love. My heart is pounding like hell since three days and I feel guilt, anger and belied.

I'm back at workand I'll see her again next weekend. I still love her deeply and it's possible that this stuff is just an outlet for her fears. But it's wrong of her. I feel so hurt right now. I can't eat, I can't sleep. It saddens me that I may lose her. But I can't forget this and act like it never happened. If I try to forget there may be a bigger bomb someday. So I'll have to sort it out now. And I hate it. I hate to know that maybe I'll lose her if we can't sort this out. I'm so in love but sometimes that's not enough... So I'm currently at work, waiting for the weekend and I can't get a thing done. I'm going crazy. I feel alone and tired. I would love to cry. But I have to act strong at work. 

So any advice for me? Any counseling? I've never experienced something like this before and it rips my heart out.

---   
**tl;dr**: SO acted off, i got crazy and snooped through her phone. Found disgusting messages where she planned to cheat on me. Don't know how to handle this without losing her."

I'm not one to share personal BJJ stories on Reddit, but I had a very interesting journey from blue to purple over the course of four years, characterized by many school changes and lot of growth.

I received my blue belt the week I graduated college. Since I didn't have a job yet, I moved back home and trained at a school near me. A couple of months later, I got a job in New York City (I'm from New Jersey) and starting training in NYC under Shaolin. I was really stoked to start training under him because I am a huge fan of his BJJ and MMA career, plus since I'm a girl, I knew they had a bunch of other girls training there.

**I was so unbelievably stubborn during my first year as a blue belt, and consequently, during my time at Shaolin's. I was just focused on my ""A Game"" and making sure it was good. I avoided playing guard because during my first blue belt tournament, I got my guard passed repeatedly until I was submitted via kimura.** So instead of working my guard, I just tried to stay on top and pass. This resulted in me just being stubborn about going for the knee cut pass and getting so frustrated I barely applied any adjustments I had to make to make the pass better. I kept getting stuck in closed guard and being unable to pass; this is what happened to me during tournaments during my first year at blue belt.

As a result, I lost about 5-6 tournaments in a row, all in the first round. In fact, I went from losing by advantages to losing by submission. **I literally felt like I was getting worse at jiu jitsu when in fact, I was just being really stubborn.** Shaolin is such a great teacher that I regret having that mindset during a time when I had the chance to train under him.

My job in NYC ended (funding ran out) and I ended up with a part time, unpaid internship in NYC. This meant I could no longer afford to train at Shaolin's and starting training again at the gym near my house. **I slowly became less stubborn and began opening up my game. I still favor passing, but I began developing a more advanced guard game beyond the basic stuff I had learned at white belt, and learned what guard games I like and work best for me. I also started ""chaining"" techniques together, so figuring out what my Plan A, B, and C were for each position I was in. This really helped me advance and made me more ready for competition.** I continued competing and managed to take second place in the my division at the Chicago Open.

Then, the school near my house closed down! They ended up re-opening with a new instructor a month or so later, but this wasn't initially stated. I had about 6 weeks before I moved for graduate school, and still really wanted to train. A few other students and I found a Renzo school nearby. I trained there for 6 weeks before moving a little bit north for graduate school at Rutgers.

I found a BJJ school near Rutgers, it's an Alliance affiliate in Dunellen, NJ. It's a small school and the instructors there are awesome. Having Nelson (of Inverted Gear fame!) and his brown belts Andrew and Dave teach the classes really helped me continue to open up my game and progress. I was able to fine-tune my guard game, open up to other guards that I really hadn't liked a couple of years ago, and be exposed to a variety of different games through the other students. I didn't compete as much because of school, but I managed to take third at nogi pan ams back in September.

I had planned on doing New York Open last month, but I fractured my ankle on March 14th, and had to wear a boot for a while. (what an awful thing to happen on Pi Day!) I took it easy and didn't train. However, about 2 weeks ago, I went to my doctor and she said she could no longer see the fracture and that I could take off the boot, but that I should still take it easy. I started going to BJJ again but just doing the technique. Last week, I started going to BJJ and light rolling.

I had already planned to go to the school's promotion ceremony on Sunday to support my teammates. Since we have belt testing, you are told in advance if you are testing, so people know if/when they are getting promoted. I was watching all my teammates do their testing and cheering them on. When everyone was done, Nelson said ""We have a surprise test today"" and pointed at me. Naturally, I was quite surprised! I was able to do all the takedowns, guard passes, sweeps, submissions, etc. and passed my belt test.

It was an awesome surprise and very satisfying to get my purple belt, as I truly did not expect it. I feel like I gained a lot of insight as to how to approach jiu jitsu, how to improve, and how to mitigate my own frustration."
33gipp,2,2015-04-22,What to do with this girl?,Gerr1dan,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/33gipp/what_to_do_with_this_girl/,"So a few months ago I met this girl on an internship. At first I didn't pay much attention to her. Focusing on my work and such. Then near the end of the internship a good friend of mine (from the internship) invited me to join them for drinks. The two gals were shopping in the city. I said yes and joined them for the evening. We had a lot of fun and apparently I didn't notice that that one girl was hitting on me. This hasn't happened to me before, so of course I didn't notice... My friend told me thankfully, and thus she ended up joining me home for the night.


The following months we chatted a lot, went out for dinner, watched movies together, I cooked for her, we went on walks, celebrated her Bday and mine. She was extremely gratefull for everything and thanked me multiple times, kisses/hugs and all. Everything was going great, the sex was amazing, we had great conversations. I went completely out of my way for her, and helped whenever I could (Even picked her up in the middle of the night (3am, I was asleep and normally I would not have picked up my phone at that time) when she called because she missed her bus and was nearly freaking out, didn't do it instantly tho). She looked after me, she even dragged me home when I was completely of the map at a party etc.


Now three weeks ago she asked me how I feel about her. So I was honest, and told her that at first it just enjoyed the fun we had together, verbally and physically. She agreed on that. Then I told her that I've developed feelings for her and really really like her, she made me feel like a (super)hero, as lame as it might sound. She said she didn't feel the same on that end, and thus decided that it would be better if we stopped talking. So we said goodbye, had one last hug and kiss and went our own ways.


Now I haven't seen her or spoken to her for three weeks straight. I really miss her, she's unlike other girls and truly made me happy. Now what should I do? I'm trying to move on but somehow she keeps lingering in my mind, since we shared a lot of the same interrests and everytime I do one of these things, like watch a certain show or go out to do things with friends etc etc.


Is there any chance of us getting together? What should I do?


Thank you all for your time and possible advice, it is much appreciated.


Kind regards,

My degree is in Tourism and Business. I wanted to work in museums but it’s likely that I’ll need to do a Masters in heritage before I can do so and I just don’t have the time to be out of work anymore in unpaid internships and placements.

I can’t even get an interview with the travel agents- I’m either overqualified because of my degree or “not experienced enough”. I found out from one recruiter that they’d tossed my CV right in the trash because, even though I have bucket loads of sales/CS experience and experience working with travel and tourism on locations they’re only interested in people who already know their booking systems and are moving from other travel shops into the same job but at a different location.

Recently, when I went to McDonald's I saw on the menu that you could have an order of 6, 9 or 12 Chicken McNuggets.
I asked for a half dozen nuggets.
'We don't have half dozen nuggets,' said the
teenager at the counter.
'You don't?' I replied.
'We only have six, nine, or twelve,' was the reply.
'So I can't order a half dozen nuggets, but I can order six?'
'That's right.'
So I shook my head and ordered six McNuggets

I was checking out at the local Wal-Mart with just a few items and the lady behind me put her things on the belt close to mine. I picked up one of those 'dividers' that they keep by the cash register and placed it between our things so they wouldn't get mixed. 
After the girl had scanned all of my items, she picked up the
'divider', looking it all over for the bar code so she could scan it.
Not finding the bar code, she said to me, 'Do you know how much this is?'
I said to her 'I've changed my mind; I don't think I'll buy that today.'
She said 'OK,' and I paid her for the things and left.
She had no clue to what had just happened.

33hc7q,1,2015-04-22,[support] ACoN vent,[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/33hc7q/support_acon_vent/,"Hello. Finally decided to write this up. I've been lurking around for a while now. I guess I didn't fully identify as raised by narcissists. ~~roll credits~~ I decided that staying in bed and crying is not preferable to writing this today.

I don't know where to start. When I was 6 months old my mother dropped me from her arms on my head. After six more months I rarely saw her again. My father didn't want a second child. The first labor almost killed my mother. She pleaded, promised to raise me... when she came out of maternal leave she got a good job and, I imagine, never looked back. 
I was a loud child at first, full of curiosity. My parents got me books. That made me more quiet. I got beaten up a lot growing up. By my dad at first, then at school. I was exhibiting narcissistic traits. I was smart and I wanted to show everybody. The first incident changed me from the GC to the shitty child. My sister coming out of puberty probably helped too.
I tell this story a lot, hoping that sharing will make it stop the pain. Or is it suffering at this point? I can't tell...
It was the 5th grade. We had, for the first time, end of semester finals in the mother tongue and in maths. Our rating system goes from 1 (cheated, got caught), through 5(barely passed), to 10 (great work/ we stop making an accurate rating past this point). Our head teacher decided to show us the grades for both subjects at the same time. I got 9 at -mother tongue- (I still believe i should have gotten 10... old hag of a teacher) and 10 at maths (our head teacher's subject). The rest of my class failed at one or both (4 and below). A girl, a neighbor of mine, went through the class with kleenex, giving it to the kids crying. Their parents would kick their collective asses for this. It was not a good school in a good neighborhood. When she passed me, I said: ""give me a tissue, I want to cry of happiness"". It is the last thing I remember. My dad found me not even able to cry anymore. I was beaten up by 30 people. While I believe that showing no empathy towards my fellow pupils was my fault, my parents made it abundantly clear that they share none of it. Every time I got beaten up after (and before tbh) was entirely my fault. Bullies found me in my new school. I refused to defend myself. I had seen what violence does to man and I didn't want any part of it. I got beaten up a lot. What is memorable from this is a girl who asked the bullies to stop. I still dream of that. The first touch of kindness from a person I had no relation with. I poured all the love I never allowed myself to feel for myself into her. Being bullied makes some people afraid to touch another human being. Maybe if I had conquered that fear earlier things would have been different. Maybe... Instead I felt love I didn't know how to communicate. It was a blessing and a curse. I had no love for me, but the feeling was somewhere my parents couldn't get to. Loving was a habit they couldn't take from me. Thank you, girl. It took a dozen or so more years to start moving that feeling towards myself. 
But I'm getting ahead of myself. The next few years in school and high school were pretty much hell. I started drinking at 14 (I stopped at 18 after downing a bottle of bourbon and half a bottle of absinthe without getting dizzy or drunk). In the 9th grade another kid showed me that I should (and how to) defend myself. I got beaten up a lot less.  spent the last 3 years of high school in a park reading. I couldn't go to class. I couldn't study with people. I felt scared and drowned out. I guess this is the point where I talk about my sleeping problem. I would fall asleep at around 6 am. School started at 8. I slept ~2-3h a night for 7 years. It was bad. My parents told me they believed that I didn't have a sleeping problem. I would stay up to read or play computer games. Trying to explain it was the other way around was like talking to a wall, only less cathartic. My mother decided that the best way for me to study was abroad. Not because of some enrichment experiences... she didn't like the friends I made. They never liked my friends. I rarely had them over, mostly on my birthday, if my parents were away. 
I went to sunny Greece. I decided to study psychology. I wanted an explanation for my thoughts and behavior. I wanted to know why I couldn't sleep. I was alone. I felt, like I always did, abandoned. The 2nd year of studies summer holiday I spent with my sister in Paris. She had found tumors and needed treatment. A part of me was jealous... still is... My parents understood her problem and were helping her. I got no such luxury. My dad couldn't find it in him to come assist us. That summer took so much out of me. I was already slipping. Years and years of not sleeping were starting to take their toll in a huge fashion. I had predicted before that summer that I would crash right after graduation from my BSc. After that summer I knew I would not make it to the finish line. I doubled my efforts to understanding my disorder, and through some miracle (I was barely operational at that point) I found it. Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome or [DSPD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_disorder) . I went to a psychiatrist to get properly diagnosed and get some treatment. He recommended that I spend a year recovering. I got a paper for my school which helped freeze my year, and I went home at the end of the first semester. My parents were furious. They told me how much money they had spent for that college. I felt guilty, incapable, sub human. I couldn't sleep In their house. I had constant fears they would kill me in my sleep (sleep deprivation leads to hallucinations among other things, but that is another story). I went to a friend's house every night to get some rest. My parents saw this night activity as a sign that I was better and sent me back to study after just 1 month. 
I cracked. I cannot explain it very well. I was amnesiac, with few if any memories of who I am, was... I still mourn all the knowledge I had accumulated from books, from human contact, from seeing and imagining. I cannot form mental imagery anymore. I feel half empty all the time. The better half, the one they could not get to is gone. With little to no money, and no idea what to do, I gathered my stuff and took a bus back home. Well not exactly back home, to the friend that had sheltered me while I was back to recuperate. I stayed there a week before going to my parents to tell them what happened. I was terrified. It was a huge mistake. At first they seemed concerned, asked me to move in with them. Told me they would take care of me. I even got an MRI of my brain and discovered the culprit to my sleeping disorder. (pineal gland cyst that blocks the release of the sleep hormone). That was the last we spoke of my sleeping problems however.
I was easily influenced at that time. They convinced me to join a university in my home town and get a degree. I just wanted to rest. I did get it, thanks to a wonderful girl I met there. I did 3 years in 1 and had over 50 exams. I couldn't have done it without her. I got a job working at a kindergarten, with the reassurance that my parents would help me move out. They didn't. After a year I had had enough. My parents were fighting all the time since I had left for Greece. It was a toxic environment to live in. I gathered whatever money I could... I even got a guy to lend me 800 euro (one of the advantages of being raised by narcissists is picking up powerful persuasion tools, i guess) and went to get a CELTA English teaching degree. If my parents wouldn't help, I would move out by myself... see the world in the process. It was the best month of my life. When I went home, I decided to wait past my birthday to start looking for a job in Korea or Latin America or something. But my mom got me the best present ever (is a little bit of sarcasm allowed here?).  After 3 years of stopping to take tests, she took my moment of liberation to check for cancer she knew she had a high risk for. She discovered a few tumors. I spent the last year, all of it, unemployed, barely functional, taking her to get chemo and radio therapy. My dad wouldn't do it because they were divorcing. 
I cracked again. Psychotherapy kept me from killing myself. The constant abuse... I will relate just 1 incident because I prefer not to remember. We were walking down the street. A wild woman, what remained of my psychology training immediately identified her as schizophrenic asked for a cigarette. Cigarettes are anti-psychotic so I naturally gave her one. My mother, walking by my side was furious. Told me to mind my own business (which I totally was). Shouted at me the whole way home. Ah, the shouting... the insults... How many times can you hear ""you never do anything from me"" from the person who you gave a year of your life to help get better before you want to punch crush destroy obliterate and hulk-smash everything in sight? I am mercifully not violent. My experience, as much as I managed to gather post-amnesia, has made me see folly in all violence. But I turned all those feelings on myself. All the self worth I would have gotten from this sacrifice was washed away. I have no self worth, or self esteem. I remember just one moment in my life when I did, completely, honestly love myself. And I had to lose all my memories to achieve it.
My mother, a highly influential person, promised me a job and a place to stay for my efforts last year. So far I got less than half. I do have a studio, half furbished, which my grandmother let me use when we took her to a hospice. My mom got me into 2 internships which proved unchallenging and unsatisfactory. Basically secretarial work with no chance of hire. I get some money monthly to cover most of my expenses. I am trapped. I wake up twice a week and cry. I go to sleep crying. I feel trapped.

this is my rant

33hhlx,2,2015-04-22,Small Engineering business looking for a file serve system,Harshdog,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/33hhlx/small_engineering_business_looking_for_a_file/,"Hello All,

I am an intern at a small engineering consulting company and the boss put me on the task to find a better solution for handling our files than what we're using now. 

Firstly I'll begin by explaining a little on the type of work we do and the ecosystem of the office. 

We are a small start up company with about 15 engineers. Around half the engineers are veterans of the business and are very good at what they do. We primarily do work in the heavy industrial department like cement plants. We all use Autodesk software so there are a lot of dwg and pdf files floating around. Since there are only 15 of us we are pretty good about communicating with each other about who has what file open, so there haven't been many issues with project files getting overwritten and such. 

Now, here's where the problem is. We are using Dropbox as our file server.. Yes.. And whats worse is the fact that we're using a single user account to sync across all of the computers in the office... What??

It actually Isn't horrible but it definitely causes a lot of frustration as you can imagine. 

The main problem we have is due to the sync time when pulling a file from the cloud. We tried to have our PC's in continuous sync but then we fill up our local drives with unnecessary data. 
I'm surprised we made is this long actually. 

Ok, so a little about my own background. I'm the intern in training to eventually become an engineer. I have pretty extensive knowledge in terms of computer hardware. I run my own side business building high-end workstations and gaming desktops. I've actually built most of our workstations here at the office. I worked for a while assembling server hardware for AT&amp;T for a few months when I was younger. The only problem is I lack knowledge on the software side of things when it comes to file serving, file check-in check-out systems..etc. 

Anyways, we need some sort of system for serving our files but we're not ready for a full blown server. I have been researching NAS options as well as other cloud services such as SharePoint online. A NAS seems to be a pretty good option for the office but two of my coworkers occasionally work away from the office when traveling and they need remote access to some of the files. 

Just hoping to get some suggestions on what route to take. 
revision control would be a plus but I'ts not entirely needed. 
Again the main issues are having to pull files from the cloud just to work on them is a hassle and the need for remote access for those of us that work away from the office. 

How well do the Synology NAS systems work? 
Sharepoint Online?

Any suggestions are appreciated,

I'm very eager to learn. We are doing a server migration for our intranet site. The move is from ColdFusion 7 on Windows Server 2003, to a box with Windows Server 2008 and ColdFusion 8. We've copied over all the site directories and files, but when we try to access it, we are denied permission to all files except those that end in cfm (ColdFusion files).

The browser displays, ""Server Error 401 - Unauthorized: Access is denied due to invalid credentials. You do not have permission to view this directory or page using the credentials that you supplied."" 

We checked the IIS MIME Types settings and all looks good. I emailed our dept's system admin and he said ""you should be full to everything as far as Windows in concerned, so check ColdFusion"".

Could anyone provide any clues or links for further research? thanks!

edit: I should also mention that I'm still trying to find the relevant log file to get the rest of the code after 401. It appears that ColdFusion didn't start http error logs until version 9 and we're on version 8, but I'm sure if I keep digging around on the server I'll find it somewhere..."

I feel it would be useful to get some insight on what companies are offering to interns this year!

33i2gv,2,2015-04-22,Alternatives Careers to Production Management (25)?,[deleted],findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/33i2gv/alternatives_careers_to_production_management_25/,"Hi guys! I normally don't like to post kind of thing but my current job has me on edge and I would really like some advice / input on my current career situation. Basically, I have been working in operations as a production supervisor for 2 years and the gig is wearing me out to the point where i am to look at other career paths 

To begin, I graduated in 2013 with a nontraditional engineering degree from a Big Ten School (think industrial engineering or an engineering/supply chain hybrid) and got a job immediately after school as a production supervisor. At the time i wanted to jump into an engineering role but for most industrial engineering positions I understood that 2 years of production experience was typically necessary before moving into an engineering position so I accepted the production supervisor role with that ultimate goal in mind. Since then I have worked for 2 different companies as a production supervisor since then and I feel like the gig is killing me.  

What bugs me the most about the job is the stress associated with getting more product out the door (at the expense of employees) coupled unpredictable hours and varied working hours. It kills me that i need to force employees to work 3 or 4 16 hour days in a row just to meet a production demand and it kills me that I will get berated and chewed out from my bosses for not having an ideal production run due to a mechanical failure that i have no control over. When I do have time to recharge I often have to come in for an hour or two on my day off to help with training exercises because it is on a regular workday and the rest of the world is running like normal. I dread going into work on ""Monday"" and I am honestly scared about what all the stress and off shift work (mostly 3rd) is doing to my health. Recently my boss told me I am not cutting it at work so I am taking as a sign that I need to start looking at other opportunities come October when my 1 year moving commitment is burned up. I am grateful to have a good paying and reputable job where I can grow and learn but  I want to find a less stressful / more work-life balance oriented position that might be a better fit for me. 

So Reddit anyone have any insights to a potential career change for someone with 2 years of manufacturing leadership experience in the food industry +1 year of internships as an industrial engineer? Currently I am not the best gear head in the world but I feel like I am a good people person and enjoy working as a member of a team where i can feed off the energy of my teammates. I don't mind being on the road for work or away from family or friends if I believe my job is a good fit so moving is always on option for me.  Personally I have thought about getting some formal education in software development and going down the computer science route but I thought i would see what else anyone may have to suggest

Appreciate any input!

I am a recent graduate with MS in applied mathematics and statistics from a top state school in NY. My gpa is decent at 3.27. I also have a BA in sociology. I know SAS, R, Python, Excel, SQL to an intermediate level. The graduate classes i took were basically standard classes lile expermental design, regression analysis, intro to probability, categorical data, theory, foundations to quantitative finance, statistical computing, etc.

My only work experience is from a internship at a village which was just explaining statistical terms in english. Rest of my experience comes from class projects and I havent been exposed to any really big data. 

Due to some personal circumstances, I work at retail to pay bills.

I have been getting interviews from all kind of places like Capital One, Citibank, EMC, etc. But all of them dont go further than phone interviews with the hiring manager. The only interview that I badly flunked was as far as I remember one with state street.  All other interviews, I dont think I have managed to mess it up any other ways. I also have visitied few recruiters, but they dont follow up at all.

So my question is, what can i be doing wrong? I realize I havent given all the info but apart from i might not be presenting myself right, what else can i be doing worng?What can I do more to make people think I am a better candidate?

I have no restrictions on fields that I want to work to apart from it involves a fair amount of statistics and some proramming which is also not set to hard on stone. I am pretty flexible with this. 

Any suggestions to companies i can apply to that hire entry level candidates?

tl;dr - recent graduate with a MS in applied mathematics &amp; statistics, get job calls, dont hear back and cant seem to get an in person interview. suggestions to make this situation improve."

I'm a bit worried my cover letter is coming off too much like ""give me a job"" and not enough like ""I'd love to learn from you"".

Here is the listing: 



Wojcik | Seay casting will hire paid interns for a 4-5 month training program begining in May of 2015 . Time commitment is 2 to 3 days/per week. Duties to include office work and assisting at casting sessions as well as training in all aspects of casting for both commercial and legit projects. A permanent position is possible based off of quality of work so ideal applicants should be looking to begin a career in casting. Interested parties should have a strong knowledge of the musical theatre cannon from classic to contemporary, exceptional organizational skills, excellent phone manner and proficiency with Microsoft Office suite software is required.


Here's my cover letter:

Hello Mr.Wojcik and Ms. Seay, 

I was excited to see your listing for an intern at Wojcik | Seay Casting on Playbill.com, as I am pursuing a career in casting, and looking for a company that I can grow with.  

While interning at Binder Casting, I was responsible for the daily operations of a busy office. I was tasked with scheduling auditions, preparing audition materials, and handling all calls and emails for the office. In addition, I worked as a monitor for many of their larger auditions, including; The Lion King, Dames At Sea, and The Little Mermaid (tour).

I also assisted Mikie Heilbrun and Alison Goodman at the CW during the several months of its bustling pilot season. I was given the ability to observe sessions and read with talent, which helped me learn about working with clients on a more personal level.

I believe I would make a passionate and dedicated member of your team. I have included a copy of my resume for your review. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss my background in greater detail with you over the telephone or in a personal interview. I will follow up with you in a few days to answer any preliminary questions you may have. In the meantime, you may contact me at the number or email listed above.

Kindest Regards,
whersmacheese

Below is a transcript of a recent text conversation. Her, a fanatical pentecostal born again virgin from America. Him, a working class Agnostic from Britain. (Female=V Male=M) M-So Samantha is really up for joining a gym here and i would love to surprise her with complete sets of workout gear. I have no idea whats comfortable or practical though. What do you wear, as a point of reference?

V-as far as workout clothes...i remember seeing sam in the free t-shirts they'd give us at school and bermuda shorts.

V-is buying workout clothes really the best way to go?

V-most girls tend to feel offended, as if you're pushing them into working out.

M-ordinarily i'd agree with you. but without prompting she's said joining a gym is something she wants. Apparently this internship has highlighted the need for an expected appearance? Anyway, she's a student with limited funds, so if i can help out with something i always will. lol it's not like it will be her only present, don't worry.

M-i don't think she's telling me i stink when she buys me cologne.

V-never that. Men don't read onto things like we do

V-now if it was deodorant, both genders can agree it's insulting

M-I object to your idea. Sexist, generalizing nonsense. there is no reason why thought patterns should automatically be assumed as different because of gender. I didn't think you were that sort of person :/

V-sure, go ahead and label me like you've done with the rest of samanthas friends

M-I will. If you're going to tell me that men and women will view the same thing differently. And they'll do so simply because of their gender.

V-I apologize if i offended you, i was just projecting my feelings onto the scenario if i received gym clothes as a gift

M-that's insulting.

V- I'm starting to think you're too sensitive then.

M-no, i'm liberal. i believe in gender equality and equal rights. i believe to treat both genders as equal, they must be seen as the same. To highlight personally conceived differences between the two only enforces other peoples negative stereotypes. Equality must be embraces fully, or it is non existent. Further to that, if a person dares assume a persons thoughts based on nothing but their gender, then that person is free to judge me solely on my gender. Which is insulting. Genitals do not dictate who i am, same as yours do not dictate you.

M-rant over lol. that's my stance though.

V- You can't write , ""rant over"" if i didn't get to express my side

V-I already wrote i apologize..

M- your side was made by saying ""men don't read into things like we do"".

V-I am not trying to dictate how you think.

M-no i know :) but you're generalizing me simply because i have a dick.

V-that was my stance on it. And it's not just because we're anatomically different. I've befriended plenty of men to know we do not think the same way. Society has molded us to think differently to our counterparts.

V-so how dare you think i'd place the value of your thoughts being different from mine because of your dick.

M-very true. i'd grant you that many people act, and i do mean 'act' a certain way as they feel that is the social norm and what is expected of them to fit in. But, someone who can't see or think past that must surely be regarded as close minded and naive. If however a person is a free thinker, capable of independent thought (and so some would argue the more intelligent) and were able to realize that gender is not a stereotype, a system of thinking or a social grouping...

M...then it is only fair that they take offense to the fact that someone believes that because of their gender they, and all people of that gender, must think the same.

M-like you said, you were projecting your own experience. Fine. On your own limited interaction with the male population of the world that's been your experience. But it is the minority. The majority should not be judged on your interaction with the minority.

V-Look sweetheart you're annoying me with your judgements... i'm ending this conversation. Come to any conclusions you'd like of me. I don't care about them,

M-Just so we're clear, your bottom line, darling, is that men and women think differently, regardless of the individual?

M-this is all going on reddit. i would love to see what other women think, as they all, apparently, think the same..

--no response has since been given--

what are your thoughts? Will sexism and the divide continue to exist while people seek to find and highlight the differences? Or are they in fact genuine and must be accepted? In an example of buisness if you choose to acknowledge differences, there is a best way of doing something and another way. If someones gender influences their thinking, then can they be as productive in the workplace?... GO!

All of my friends are successful with amazing careers and futures ahead of them, and then there is me. I'm an IT major at a good university and I am set to graduate in December. The only problem is that I need to complete an internship in order to graduate. So starting in January, I started applying to everything I could get my hands on through my schools job posting website. I've only had 3 interviews thus far. The first two interviews were alright, got a denial letter from the one and didn't hear anything from the other. This one company though, I really had a great phone interview with them. I waited weeks and weeks for a reply and finally got it. They wanted me to come in for an onsite interview! I had an amazing feeling about this one. So I had a panel interview with 3 people who are coordinating the internship program. The interview went so well, I was confident, responded appropriately to any question that they threw at me and we seemed to really hit it off. ""Since you're the last person we are interviewing, you should hear back from us by the end of the week"". ""This is great"", I thought to myself and walked out of the office on cloud 9. I contacted the administrative coordinator (who I've been in touch with through the whole process) and sent her a thank you letter to forward to the team members that interviewed me. The end of the week comes, nothing. I am obsessively checking my e-mail every hour, half-hour...nothing. Fresh week starts, I tell myself ""It's fine, they're probably dealing with more important matters than the internship program"". Continue to obsessively check my e-mail. End of the week comes, nothing. I'm starting to slip into a dark place with the realization that if I don't get a summer internship, I won't graduate on time. Monday of the FOLLOWING week comes, nothing. Tuesday, nothing. I couldn't take anymore of this.Today, I finally e-mailed the administrative coordinator a well written e-mail requesting for information regarding my status for the position. She doesn't fucking respond....she always responds. I'm starting to lose my fucking mind and realizing that NOTHING works out for me, ever. I'm a Marine Corps veteran, a former customer service supervisor, I'd like to consider myself a well rounded and confident guy. 

How could they fucking do this and just flat out ignore me? After this two+ month process, don't I at least warrant a ""Fuck you, you didn't make the cut""? 

I'm having fantasies of e-mailing this piece of shit and telling her what is really on my mind. I've been in a dark place for a long time and I am starting to slip back into it faster than I could have ever imagine. Suicide is crossing my mind frequently. I am 26 years old, broke up with my girlfriend to move in with my parents and pursue a challenging degree that I've always had an interest for. 

I don't want to go out in fear of people asking me what I'm doing with my life. I am ashamed, I feel like I have failed everything. Please, any advice would be great. "

Ok, I'll post my curiosities. Ma gandesc ca nu stau HR-ii la panda pe aici, iar daca stau, throwaway ftw(desi ma indoiesc ca isi pune cineva /u/-ul dubios pe linkedin sau cv :D).

* 1) Esti multumiti de ceea ce faci? Munca iti aduce satisfactie, sau participa mai degraba la simptome de ""corporate depression""?
* 2) Cum ai ajuns sa lucrezi la firma unde esti acum angajat?
* 3) Ai aterizat in firma fara experienta?
* 4) De unde ai pornit? Facultate tehnica/info/altceva?
* 5) Intrebari de interviu. Experiente. Ce fel de teste se dau, daca se dau.
* 6) Munca in echipa: avantaj sau bataie de cap?
* 7) Activitatile mai sociale din cadrul firmei.
* 8) Ai considerat si alte domenii inainte de a fi atras de asta?

Pun intrebarile astea fiindca e momentul sa ma gandesc si eu la o cariera, si nu stiu pe unde sa o apuc. Nu am fost vreodata pasionat la maxim de domeniul programarii, but then I didn't hate it either. Imi place si electronica cat de cat, dar la faculta mi-am dat seama ca nu se lipeste prea mult de mine, desi am fost cu ciocanul de lipit in mana de prin clasa a 4-a. De obicei cand am in cap un proiect, ma documentez specific pentru proiectul ala ca deja sunt pe net zeci de tutoriale si construiesc bucata cu bucata ceva nou. Ce-i mai departe de asta se numeste cercetare si I'm not a man of theory. Oricum electronica analogica e a thing of the past, cat mi-am dat interestul mai mult a fost pentru Arduino si Galileo.

Am facut si niste javascript(internship) la o firma pe domeniu webdev si mi s-o parut super interesant, da parca jumate din mine era nemultumit. Ii fain ca acum poti integra js-ul cu tot felul de chestii de cand cu nodejs, da nah. Pare prea... *soft*. In schimb am fost si la o firma la extrema opusa: asamblare pe linie, scheme de orcad etc. Really not my type.
Adica no, la urma urmei, bani sa iasa si iti poti continua pasiunile separat, dar nu vreau sa regret later in life.

I have done undergrad and worked for about 2 years as an environmental engineer which is completely irrelevant to CS, so I think that I should work as an intern before working up to a full time dev position in order to gain experience. However, it seems impossible to find any internships for people who aren't undergrads. Am I thinking of this correctly?

I have taken an intro course in C++, am familiar with Python, and am going to take a Data structures course this summer in Java (which I audited last year).

I still feel so incompetent to even undergrad CS majors because I don't have the same background as they do. However, working full time in a career path I don't like saps up all my time in the day. I just feel very overwhelmed and unprepared. Any advice, help, or criticism is welcome."

My name is Martin, a Dutch 22 year old. disregard the username, didn't know Reddit would get me hooked so much haha.

First off, hello, I am relatively new to the community and about 1.5-2 years into becoming a 1st AC.
I used to have these big time DoP ambitions, romanticizing the whole job.
But after a 9 month internship at a rental house things changed.

I've been sent to a lot of 'pro-level' (I at best saw a few Epic's up until then) sets to work DIT, spark, 2nd AC, runner... that kind of work.

I started to see that I was really shining more on the assistant jobs, so I started meeting people who were 1st AC's, they told me how their job works and what you need to do to get good at it.

Halfway through the internship I was focused, learning camera's in and out (Which in a rental house I had great opportunity to).
Putting gaffa around my house to stop at to guess distances.
I even got a wicked Stanley Fat-Max 5m as a parting gift from the rental house I worked for, something I still never leave for work without.

Now my biggest job yet is on the horizon (will post setphoto's end May) while I am fumbling to combine it with my last 3 months of college.

But if there is one thing I want to get done for college is finish my thesis, which is on... you guessed it, being a first AC.

I've been sourcing information and interviews at the rental house I worked for and got great answers, DoPs and Operators I worked for and 2nd AC's that worked for me, all helped me out a bunch.

But the goal is to make a document, which people read and at the end have an idea of what not just a good but a great AC makes.
From contact with rental houses to focus pulling I want to know it all.

So here is where I'd like to ask you, this great community I'd like to be a bigger part of, for information.

Anything helps, and if any I am very grateful and will even attempt to translate the whole (probably at least 50pages worth) from Dutch to English, which might just take a while but it would be the least I can do.

How to work within the hierarchy, how far do you go vertically and horizontally.
How to do delegate work with your 2nd AC, when would you use a monitor for pulling focus?
How to be most efficient at your prep days? What's on your toolbelt, and why? Got any crazy exotic tools you bought as a goof but chose upon keeping around in your toolbag?

In short I got a lot of questions, any part of your work you can go into detail with I'd love to know.
I'd love to quote you with your name in the thesis as well, so please leave your name and job title at the end of a post.

I've been seeing a lot people doing a lot of awesome stuff on this sub, so I'd love to learn from you all.

Thank you all a great deal in advance and I am anxiously awaiting your posts.


**TL;DR**

Looking for information to complete my thesis on being a 1st AC to in turn become better at my job and finish college."

33jee5,4,2015-04-22,"Biggest kick in the balls by University.. Still jobless, but now completely hopeless and demoralized..",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/33jee5/biggest_kick_in_the_balls_by_university_still/,"So, things have been going pretty fucking shitty for me this past year. I am luckily able to stay with my parents while I'm jobless (Didn't qualify for unemployment because I applied three weeks too late..) and become poorer and poorer. To top it off I just got a huge kick to the balls from a university I applied to.

&amp;nbsp;

Lets start with the job front: 

&amp;nbsp;

I graduated in 2014 with my B.Eng (with 1.5 years work experience through internships) and have not been able to get a job. Heck, I'd fucking settle for a god damn rejection email once in a while.. It has been going so shitty since August (last time I had an interview) that it actually hurts to continue to apply to jobs knowing I have a 1 in 1000 chance of even getting an interview.. I have submitted at least 280 job applications, that's from the files I still have, don't know how many files I deleted, maybe 50-60+.. I've met with my university internship coordinators and career counselors and had them review my resume and cover letter for specific jobs with job ad in hand and they have no idea why I'm not even getting called back for interviews. And the fucking thing that pisses me off is that where I live there are agreements that state that companies are supposed to offer jobs to qualified local residents over non-local applicants as long as qualifications are similar, yet half the people from my class that got a job here aren't from here; they got offered the job while on their last internship, so apparently companies can just go around that fucking rule..

&amp;nbsp;

So, since I can't get a fucking job with my B.Eng, I figured I'd try part time work.. That was fucking useless and incredibly demoralizing. I passed out about 20 resumes in my area within walking distance (because I can't afford to bus or cab or drive anywhere) to local retail places. I got 15 of them handed back to me since I was overqualified for any position they could offer and they knew that at any point I could be gone with an engineering job.. the other 5 I'm pretty sure were thrown out because when I called back a week later the people I spoke with were hesitant to give me an answer as to whether they had a chance to look over my resume and if they had any upcoming opportunities.

&amp;nbsp;

Now for the school part:

&amp;nbsp;

So, back in February I decided that I'd apply for graduate studies since I can't get a job. I decided on a university in Ontario and I applied to do a M.Eng in Aerospace, because that's what I wanted to do for as long as I could remember. Two months go by and nothing. Then last week I got an email saying there was an update to my online submission. I checked my account and I was accepted. It was the happiest moment of my life and I almost burst into tears because I have been feeling so worthless lately. I was beaming from ear to ear with a smile for the whole day. My parents and girlfriend were super proud of me and wanted to know if I was going to accept or not. I told them that it depended on funding, but if I could get at least 50% funding I'd do it without hesitation.

&amp;nbsp;

So last week I emailed the graduate office asking for clarification on funding since nothing was mentioned in the offer letter. Today, I still hadn't received any feedback so I emailed the person whom the first email was forwarded to. This person got back to me within an hour and said that there was an error and they have been trying to fix it so I could see my funding allocation online. So, this person tells me that I'd be eligible for $6000 in funding.. spread out over four full-time studies semesters equally. I felt like I was going to be sick. $6000 wouldn't even cover half of the first semester if I was given the whole amount upfront (have to move out of my province to another province and live in residence). I almost cried when I read it. In my application form I stated that I had $0 to contribute and that I may not be eligible for student loans and grants since I had received them for my B.Eng. So when I got the acceptance letter I instantly thought that I was going to receive substantial funding and not have to worry about loans as much as for my undergrad. But today, that was all ripped away from me and my dream of becoming a propulsion engineer in the space industry was crushed. Why the fuck would they offer me acceptance into their program when I couldn't afford it? I would have been happier now if they just fucking rejected me and stated it was because of funding issues..

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Honestly, I just fucking give up. What was the point of working my ass off for 5 years to maintain a 3.4/4 GPA when people with 2/4 GPAs have well-paying jobs across the country? I never cheated a day in my life, especially in university, yet half the people from my class who have jobs cheated in almost every test! Heck sometimes I'd notice them cheating off me and I'd adjust myself so they couldn't see my answers.. I spent 5 years spending on average 14 hours/day in school and upwards of 22 hours/day when it got to crunch time, yet the people who slacked off and didn't give a fuck got offered a job when they graduated..

Fuck this world, and fuck this ""It's not what you know, it's who you know"" bullshit. I'm sick and tired of being this honest, hard-working individual when it's clearly given me nothing to show for it. Honestly, some days lately I just don't want to go on anymore.. I'm a failure and a pathetic excuse of a human being.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Sorry for the wall of text; I needed to rant."

I can't decide if the program and internships at Purdue is worth upwards of $100,000 of debt, especially if I can find just as good internships at OSU. If you went to OSU or are currently attending it would be really helpful for me if you can let me know what kind of internships you were able to find at OSU.

I want to better my judgement for myself and any future relationship i may have.  I also apologize about the length.

This starts during summer break.  I had met (let's call her) Cara at my current university before she switched to one out of state.  Cara said that she hated it and that's why she applied to other schools. She had asked me to look at all the schools that accepted her and rank them in my opinion from best to worst.  I had ranked my current university as second to another and so Cara accepted to offer from what I had ranked over my current university.

It was great in the beginning but it took a turn south.  I had been working full-time as an intern at a company and going to school full-time so I never really had time for her (which I had warned her about in the beginning of the relationship).  So to surprise her I bought plane tickets to go and visit her during Valentines day weekend.

A few days after I had bought the tickets there was an incident where I thought Cara wanted to get back with an ex of hers.  She told me that an old ex-boyfriend of hers got in contact with her and one night she put our skype conversation on hold to go chat with him.  I wait from about 11pm until 3am and all I got was a message saying something to the effect of 'He started talking to me with the intention of getting back with me' and never came back that night.  She didn't even attempt to contact me for the next 24~ hours.  I couldn't sleep after seeing a message like that.  I was just there on hold until 7 am when I had to get ready to go to school.  I took this as an indication she wanted to break up since and I ended up doing so.  Looking back that was a hasty decision.  She was pretty upset and explained that she never came back because Skype never picks up calls that are on hold when hang up on your current call anymore.  I apologized about doing that and we (at least I had thought) ended up getting back together.  This was in January.

Fast forward to Valentines day.  I had (to try and cheer her up a bit after I messed up) told her I already had plane tickets booked to come see her.  She was pretty happy and I went down there and stayed with her.  During my Friday-Monday stay we had slept together (no sex, just sleeping together) and I thought that it was okay to go in for a kiss but she turned her face away.  I asked why she did that and it ended up in a long conversation about how we weren't dating.  I was pretty devastated.  Mostly because I felt betrayed that I had slept with her when we weren't dating.  So I moved from her room to the spare room after this, spent my last night at her apartment, then left the next morning.  She came in (after knocking and asking if she could come in) a few times to try and talk and get me to spend more time with her before I left but I always told her no and just wanted to spend time by myself until I had to leave for my flight back home in about 15 hours

From then on our conversations always went horribly.  Most if not all of them ended up in few words spoke followed by long awkward silences.  I would get frustrated because she would never open up to me.  And every time she would say ""You might as well hang up"".  So I do.  Then Cara always says that I shouldn't hang up and so I ask what she wants me to do.  All I get from her is 'figure it out yourself'.  I just end up getting frustrated and end up in the position I am now.

**tl;dr**: My ex blames me for everything and I can't read between the lines.  What is she saying and how can I better myself?"

My highest ACT score was a 27. I have been awarded around $15,000 in academic scholarships from my private university that I will be attending in the Fall of 2015. I figured I would make a post explaining how I got into a fairly selective college (44% rate) after having horrendous grades and attitude my freshmen and sophomore years. It seems like everyone on this subreddit screams community college every chance they get and I just wanted to offer some insight into my situation and how I avoided going to community college when I clearly should have. 

My junior year I decided I would get my stuff together and worked towards raising my GPA from the 2.0 it was at. I worked my ass off however at the end of junior year I realized that it is really fucking hard to increase your GPA. I refused to go to community college and during my senior year I applied and enrolled in a local state university. I took college level classes in the classroom for dual credit while also attending to my senior year classes part time. Many colleges have programs for non-degree seeking high school students to take dual credit classes on campus, the trick is just finding one locally and getting accepted. I loaded up on 10 credit hours and again, did anything I had to do in order to be successfully in these classes. I finished with a 3.6 college GPA. Not only did this prove that I could be successful at the collegiate level, but I was also able to get incredible recommendations from my professors who were blown away at having a high school student in their classroom. These dual credit classes also were calculated into my high school GPA and were weighted as AP classes, helping to inflate my GPA because I was taking more classes than a standard student would in a semester. 


The college GPA and recc. were fundamental aspects of my application and the sole reason I got accepted and among the toughest freshmen class in terms of admissions in the history of the school. Of course, there is the reality that I got denied from many other schools that I applied to but you only have to find one. 


One thing to remember is that your entire application will need to be focused around your transitional period, take responsibility and explain yourself and your mistakes. Then show your college GPA and present it as the ethos to back up your claim. Work to get the best recc. you can get from people you know, and make sure you have plenty of interesting EC's. Also, don't be afraid to file a letter of appeal, these letters usually give you unlimited or much more space to tell your story and explain yourself. Plus, if a college has a deadline that is before your Fall semester of your senior year classes are over with, you should be allowed to include it in your appeal since admission decisions are usually released well after December. 

If you want to go to a four year university straight out of high school you have to realize you will have to work your ass off. If you don't think you could handle the college classes then yes go to CC and learn those skills. I was able to get about 1/4th of my tuition paid for through scholarships because of the initiative I took and most importantly the incredible networking I did with my professors. Perhaps you might even get lucky enough to have one of your professors be an alumni of a school you want to attend... You'll never know if you don't try. 

I am now about to take my last final at this university and will have completed 3 semesters of coursework. Reflecting back now, there are several things I would have done differently that probably would have made my life easier and application even better.

* Go to class, I got knocked down from a A to an A- in my intro Psychology class simply because I missed class about 4 times. When you are counting your GPA so closely, this can make a big difference, especially when you don't have a full 15 credit hour semester.

* Get connected with your field and participate in activities and events that your college offers. I regret not going to job fairs and mock interviews put on by the department. Even though you are a high schooler, this will do nothing but impress professors. Employers will practically beg you to work with them since very few high schoolers that show this level of initiative.

* Do an internship. Yes you are in high school and no you might not have all the qualifications for the internship, but it shouldn't matter in your case. Send a letter to the HR director or see if your Career center/professors know anyone in your field that have a job and would be willing to let you job shadow for a week or do an unofficial internship. If you do a job shadow, even for just a week, you can earn recommendations that will be priceless in the future. The whole purpose of this is to network in your field, you might not even contribute to the company, but asking questions, attending meetings, and simply observing will impress nearly everybody.

* Be stubborn (or persistent) The summer following my sophomore year was when I realized that attending a 4 year university straight out of high school was a unlikely possibility for me. I felt like a failure and a looser who had wasted their life, it was without a doubt the lowest moment of my life. Balancing college classes with your normal senior and junior year coursework is no joke. You have to be completely dedicated to this. You also have to realize that any mistakes you make with your college classes will be on your permanent record. So don't fail. You will need to be stubborn when applying to colleges as well because trust me, you will get denied from a lot of places.

* Don't give up, seriously. Not many students even know that they can take college classes on campus while in high school (unless your state has a Running Start program), use this to your advantage. Keep reminding the admissions office in your application how you have demonstrated your ability for success at the collegiate level. Lastly, expect to be denied and plan accordingly. Your application is going to be viewed as ""nonstandard"" by the admissions board and may subsequently be thrown out just based on your GPA, without consideration given to the rest of your application. The university I am attending next year denied me, however I petitioned for an appeal and won. Don't rely on an appeal though, the odds for my university were about 1 in 20 for a successful appeal. I even wrote letters to professors in my major at the university expressing my interest for the program at the university in hopes that they would put in a good word with the appeal committee. 

One last thing, make sure you spend the time researching the college you want to take your dual credit classes at. It is perfectly acceptable for it to be a community college. Look for satellite campuses of big state schools, generally satellite campuses have higher acceptance rates than the main campus. Make sure you contact the admissions office and see if they have a special application for non-degree seeking high school students and of course get it approved with your high school's administration/counselor.

33k72f,22,2015-04-23,How I got into a 4 year university with an acceptance rate of 44% with a 2.38 GPA and 27 ACT,[deleted],ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/33k72f/how_i_got_into_a_4_year_university_with_an/,"I am currently a high school senior who applied to several colleges with a 2.38 unweighted GPA, and a 2.75 weighted. My highest ACT score was a 27. I have been awarded around $15,000 in academic scholarships from my private university that I will be attending in the Fall of 2015. I figured I would make a post explaining how I got into a fairly selective college (44% rate) after having horrendous grades and attitude my freshmen and sophomore years. It seems like everyone on this subreddit screams community college every chance they get and I just wanted to offer some insight into my situation and how I avoided going to community college when I clearly should have. 

My junior year I decided I would get my stuff together and worked towards raising my GPA from the 2.0 it was at. I worked my ass off however at the end of junior year I realized that it is really fucking hard to increase your GPA. I refused to go to community college and during my senior year I applied and enrolled in a local state university. I took college level classes in the classroom for duel credit while also attending to my senior year classes part time. Many colleges have programs for non-degree seeking high school students to take duel credit classes on campus, the trick is just finding one locally and getting accepted. I loaded up on 10 credit hours and again, did anything I had to do in order to be successfully in these classes. I finished with a 3.6 college GPA. Not only did this prove that I could be successful at the collegiate level, but I was also able to get incredible recommendations from my professors who were blown away at having a high school student in their classroom. These duel credit classes also were calculated into my high school GPA and were weighted as AP classes, helping to inflate my GPA because I was taking more classes than a standard student would in a semester. 


The college GPA and recc. were fundamental aspects of my application and the sole reason I got accepted and among the toughest freshmen class in terms of admissions in the history of the school. Of course, there is the reality that I got denied from many other schools that I applied to but you only have to find one. 


One thing to remember is that your entire application will need to be focused around your transitional period, take responsibility and explain yourself and your mistakes. Then show your college GPA and present it as the ethos to back up your claim. Work to get the best recc. you can get from people you know, and make sure you have plenty of interesting EC's. Also, don't be afraid to file a letter of appeal, these letters usually give you unlimited or much more space to tell your story and explain yourself.

33k7p9,0,2015-04-23,"Me [21 F] with my boyfriend [22 M] of 3 years, feeling lost on what to do.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/33k7p9/me_21_f_with_my_boyfriend_22_m_of_3_years_feeling/,"I [21F] have been with my boyfriend [22M] for 3 years. Throwaway because he reddits and I feel really dumb posting this. Sorry this is kind of long, I feel like our background is a little necessary.

I started dating him when I was 18 when I was a senior in high school, and he was a freshman in college. We were long distance for about 10 months, and for my spring semester of my freshman year of college I transferred to his school. I didn't transfer for him, it had the exact program/major I was looking for and I really liked the campus. I have been here ever since, and up until about a year ago everything was great with us.

Around this time last year I was struggling hard with school. It was caused by a mixture of depression/anxiety and unsure of what I wanted to study. I had not been doing well all school year and I had a bit of a breakdown. My boyfriend suggested I move back home (and 2 hours away from him) to figure out what I wanted to major in, and get my anxiety and depression under control. I figured it was my best option, so I quit both my jobs, dropped out of a college I loved, and moved back home from June 2014-August 2014. This was supposed to be a permanent move until I graduated school.

Honestly, the summer sucked for me. My boyfriend and I had some issues before I moved, but we really never worked on them. Over the summer, I was driving 4 hours total every weekend to see him. Every weekend we didn't do anything except watch Netflix, or I watched him play video games. The one time he came to visit me he tried getting out of it by saying he was sick (a few months later he admitted he wasn't sick this particular weekend.)

I had enrolled in a couple summer classes at the local community college and those were going surprisingly well. I felt better about every aspect of my life except my relationship with my boyfriend. I couldn't get him to text me more than a few times a day. He said we'd talk on the phone everyday, but that happened only a few times a week, and only after he had been drinking. I asked him a few times to Skype with me, but he always made excuses not to. I felt really lonely, and at a complete loss. I decided to move back to my previous city and start classes at my previous college in the fall. I thought that this would fix things for us.

Nothing changed when I moved back. There were quite a few times where I asked him to hang out after class, and he would tell me he can't because he had to work on homework. Later on, I would find out that he was actually drinking with his buddies. I tried talking to him about how I felt about this, and I tried so hard to fix the issues we had, but the effort was all one sided.

I'm not proud of the next part, but about a month and a half after I moved back I ended up kissing one of his friends. It was at a party, after I had been drinking for 12+ hours. I felt really guilty about it, and it was a wake up call to me that our relationship needed to end. So, I ended it and told him about the kiss, it was literally a 5 minute conversation, and I was taken aback by his apathy at me ending our 2.5 year relationship. A couple days after I broke up with him, he asked to see me so we could talk. He apologized for not appreciating me and taking it for granted. We parted ways not really talking about our future. But, a few days later, he wanted to talk again. This time he told me he forgave me for what I did, and he wanted to work on getting back together. I agreed, because I really did want to get back together.

So, we talked about what needed to be fixed in our relationship. He wanted me back in therapy, and he wanted me to work on my negative attitude. I wanted him to spend more time with me, and I wanted us to start going on dates again. I also said he needed to plan some of these dates. He agreed and seemed willing to change. So, we get back together, but not ""officially"" (we agree to be exclusive, and the only difference between us and an ""official"" relationship is that both our facebook pages say we are single.)

Which brings me to where we are now. I've been seeing my therapist regularly, and I've tried really hard to be more positive. For example, If I complain to my bf about something negative that had to do with my day, I try hard to also say something positive that happened in my day. I've also planned all the dates we have been on so far (about five) and I have paid for all of these. I had been working two jobs, so paying wasn't an issue for me, but I did recently quit one of my jobs. He doesn't work, but he has a lot in savings, and his parents send him money regularly. 

Two weeks ago he told me he wanted to talk. He said he wanted to get back together, but I needed to work on my negative attitude. I agreed, but I was also upset because I have been trying really hard to be more positive. I was surprised that he said I still needed to work on my attitude so I didn't bring up my issues until a couple days later. When I finally did, I told him that he needed to work harder on planning dates for us. He hasn't initiated a single one yet. I also told him he needs to make his new Skype account (he can't remember the password for his old one), which I had asked him to do back in July.

In about three weeks he will be graduating and moving back home (about two hours away from me.) It will take at least two more years to finish my degree (because of my bad grades last year). Next year, I may even have to move out of state for an internship. So, I am nervous about how long distance will go. He hasn't made a lot of changes these past few months, and I'm starting to feel like how I did before I broke up with him. I plan on talking to him about this, but what do I say? I feel like we've come a long way, but I don't think it will last.
   
Again, sorry for the wall of text. This kind of just turned into me ranting, and I've had some wine. Hopefully it makes sense.
**tl;dr**: With my bf for 3 years, soon to be LDR, but not sure it will work because of previous bad LDR experience and other issues."

It all started in the spring of 2013, my junior year of college.  I’ve always struggled with grades, since early high school.  I hate myself for filling that stereotype of people with ADD who can do standardized testing and other shit really really well, but who can’t hold their classes and obligations together.  I hate being a stereotype so much.  Anyway, things were going alright, my roommate was working out fine and whatnot.  But then a friend of my roommate came back from studying abroad and we all started hanging out pretty frequently in the room, drinking late into the night.  This led to me missing class once in a while and rationalizing it.  
Eventually, one by one, I stopped going to classes, about a month and a half into the semester.  I would imagine going and feeling the crushing humiliation of seeing my peers’ faces, knowing I could outperform them if I gave a shit, but knowing that they looked down on me as a fuckup.  I couldn’t take that type of feeling, so I just withdrew.  Not literally (academically, that is), but personally.  I just would wake up, watch TV, listen to music, and do anything else I could to try to push all my obligations to the back of my mind.  
After that semester, I passed one two of my five classes with Ds.  This landed me on academic probation with a semester GPA below 0.5.  I lied to my parents, my friends, my girlfriend, my fraternity… everyone.  I lied until I couldn’t anymore.  Eventually, once my parents figured things out, my mother, who works at a hospital, connected me with a behavioral therapist specializing in ADD.  This specialist wound up doing more organizational garbage like the class I was mandated to take, like goal setting, studying, setting time limits, shit like that.  I appreciated the effort, but nothing really tapped into the issue.  I briefly considered the fact that I might be depressed, but dismissed it because I never really felt sad.
Anyway, that semester, I ended with below a 2.0, the threshold to stay in school while on probation.  So I took a year off, worked three jobs, lived on my own, and tried to find my own ways to cope.  
**If you want the meat of this post, it's down here:**  
This past winter I applied for readmittance to school and made it back in.  I was doing fine, attending every class until a few weeks ago, when I started to slip up on assignments.  Now, it’s been three weeks since I attended one class, two for another, and I’m freaking out.  Since December, I lost all three of the jobs that I had, either because I stopped caring, or because I was afraid people would judge me.  One time, my car broke down and I was too afraid my employer would think I was lying, so I just didn’t tell them.  For another, my school schedule conflicted, but I thought they would hate me, so I just didn’t show up.  ANYWAY, I’m supposed to graduate after this semester and an internship, but I have no internship lined up for the summer, everyone else is figuring their lives out, and I’m in a pit of self-loathing so deep that I don’t want to do shit.  It’s a mixture of soul-crushing guilt and embarrassment that is keeping me from doing anything.  When I should be meeting with professors to catch up or try to do something, I find myself sitting on a couch doing fucking Sudoku on my phone.  I just don’t know how to cope with this shit.  I just today looked up the symptoms of depression for the first time in years and realized that it may be the case, and I’m still not sure how to handle it.  I plan to go to my university’s health center tomorrow or the day after and seek counseling, but what could that really do for me?  It’s not like it will save my grades, especially after I get fucked in the ass by my grades and my finances this semester.  I just don’t know what to do."

As a child, I may very well have been on the autism spectrum. I simply did not ""get"" socialisation.  I learned very early on - from adults and children alike - that I was different, or deficient, and that this was not o.k. 

At 14, I was sick and tired of it. I decided to ""study"" people in order to be a cool, or at least normal, person. I read a lot. I observed. I devoted enormous effort to fitting in. 

My mother moved overseas for her career, and I went with her. This was an opportunity to reinvent myself. I encountered moderate success. I worked hard for some semblance of a social life. I hung out with the cool kids. But it was exhausting, and by that point, it was too late. 

By then, I had a thoroughly warped view of myself, and of other people. The damage was done.

I'm 26. I've achieved nothing. The only real work experience I ever had lasted 6 months - one internship 4 years ago (a prestigious one, not that it matters now), back when I could still kinda keep it together. That was my last real achievement. Since then, I've moved countries and dropped out of university twice. I can't support myself financially - I rely on my family for that. I feel like a worthless, guilt-ridden mess. 

I've been going to therapy for a few months. So far, all it's achieved is to uncover layer after layer of pain. All of which takes place against a background of terrifying emptiness. 

I feel like I'm standing on the edge of a precipice and the ground is shifting beneath my feet. I yearn to be a functional adult. I crave change. I need to grow. But I'm stuck. Something is holding me back and I don't know what it is.

To make things even better, I think my girlfriend of 4 years has fallen out of love with me, or at the very least, is no longer attracted to me. She is reconsidering our future, she feels like she's been growing without me, and she says she wants to travel alone. It hurts, but I've seen it coming for a long time. I can't force her to stay; all I can do is work on myself and try to find some kind of inner strength to carry me through. 

Maybe I can change fast enough for her to change her mind. Maybe it's over already. Either way, I need to stand on my own two feet. But how do I do that when I can barely hold it together as it is? "

“Whenever a thing is done for the first time, it releases a little demon.” - Emily Dickinson


6:30 AM Monday Morning September 18, 2011

	His eyes open slowly as the light creeps over the foot of the bed. The familiar sticky taste inside his mouth reminded him of the last night’s final decision to have that last drink. 

A mistake, of course.

	Charles Weston was 57 years old, greying slowly in his age, albeit gracefully. He stood once at a solid six foot, with a surprisingly trim build for a man of his age and profession. He was a homicide detective, and seemingly to spite his silent internal disdain for the job, he was constantly inundated by a large caseload of violent crimes with plenty of hideously remorseless faces attached to them. He often wondered late at night to himself what it was that kept him from retiring, maybe something a little less taxing, all the while swilling 18 year old whiskey around in his rocks glass, and then he would remind himself that the look of pain on each and every face he put away kept him coming back the next day. Unfortunately it always kept him up far too late as well.

	The first leg slid off the right side of the bed tentatively, as if it wanted to test and see if the floor was still solid beneath it. After a moment, the second followed. A brief stretch and crackle of vertebrate later and it became time to rise completely from slumber. a shuffle to the bathroom, immediately followed by a wretching hack and spit. A quick look in the mirror confirmed the thought that had just rushed itself through his head regarding the last night’s decision making processes.

	The sickly thud of the footsteps transition off the cold bathroom tile onto the wooden floor of the bedroom almost seemed welcoming. A hard stomp down the hall and into the kitchen for coffee and sustinance- the greasy cure-all for last night’s indiscretions. Three slices of bacon, a cup of coffee and an egg later, the pounding upstairs had decidedly lessened. Finally.

	After a shower and failed consideration to shave his gravel-colored stubble, he dressed himself for the day, choosing a white shirt with light blue pinstripes and charcoal grey suit. He meticulously buttoned each hole and stared into the mirror and sighed slowly before tying his  shoes, threading his tie then knotting it, then moved back through his kitchen and into the den. 

	He opened the front door and walked outside, then bent to pick up the plastic-rolled newspaper nestled on the cracked concrete drive next to the street. Removing the blue cellophane, the paper slowly unrolled into its full shape and glory. Back inside to the naturally lit den he trekked, to plop down for another cup of joe and a skim over the paper. It would have been much easier to simply look online and filter through one of millions of news sites for his daily intake, but somehow the paper seemed to be much more satisfying. The texture of the pages, the way the cheaply manufactured ink rubbed off onto one’s fingers, the smell of crisp rolled paper merely hours off the press. Simple creature comforts like these were hard to come by in this day and age he thought.

His reading chair sagged as he sat back fully into it, a worn, brown leather arm chair complete with equally worn and matching futon. Both smelled of spilt coffee and years of set-in tobacco smoke. Charles reached into his inside jacket pocket and pulled out a soft pack of Lucky Strike filterless, gently tapped the pack on the back of his left had, and pulled the protruding cigarette out with his lips. On the coffee table to the right of the chair there sat a end table, devoid of anything save a telephone nearly as old as its owner and a half-full box of two hundred wooden matches, out of which he pulled one and lit up his morning routine. After skimming briefly accross the front page for a content overview of the previous day’s events, he had almost made it off the page when he decided to re-read the top story again. Usually murder cases didn’t phase him, as his line of work had numbed his senses over the decades. What he saw made him stop, place his coffee down on the table next to him and tamp out the nearly half of a cigarette in his hand. He reached over and picked up the phone and dialed the presinct captain. 

	“Fucking hell”, he muttered as his smoke yellowed fingertip pressed the last button on the handset.

This was definitely not going to be a typical day at the office for Detective Weston. No, not this go around.

The phone clicked to signal te other end had picked up.

	“Captain Stephens here,” the voice on the other side barked.
	“Captain, it’s Weston.”
	“Charles, what is it? Why the hell can’t you just come in like a normal person?”
	“He’s at it again.”
	“Who’s at it again?”
	“You know damn well who I’m talking about sir. The nurse who was found dead wrapped in the sheet in the alley near the hospital. Front page of The Chronical this morning.”
	“Yeah, I saw it. Some of our boys handled that yesterday morning. Why? And who the hell are you talking about?”
	“Azriel.”
	“Christ Almighty.” wheezed the captain.
	“Quite the opposite sir. More like the Devil is back in business again, and this time, from the looks of it, he’s pushing the limits again. Have you read the initial report from the crime scene?”
	“No, it’s in a file on my desk, but I haven’t cracked it open yet.”
	“Wait until I get to the station if you don’t mind.”
	“Sure, how long do you think?”
	“Half an hour, maybe forty five minutes. Depends on traffic.”
	“Alright. Want me to send one of the interns down to O’Rear’s for coffee for you?”
	“I’ll just drink my own piss, thanks. It’s a higher octane anyhow.”
	“Don’t doubt that a bit. Say Charles, just why do you keep obsessing over this guy? What I mean to say is, what makes him different than any other psycho out there?”

	Charles hung up the phone before Captain Stephens got his answer. He sat back in his chair again and lit up another smoke. Most definitely not another typical day at the office. 



3 AM Saturday Night September 16, 2011

	Ricky’s diner wasn’t much to call home about. In fact, it wasn’t much to call anyone about at all. The main redeeming factor was the desert. Blueberry pie, flakey crust, gooey insides. But with coffee like gasoline, orange juice that spurted inside of a fountain that looked like it had seen better off seasons, and torn red pleather booth seats all rounding out this dingy little joint that looked like it was straight out of a Hitchcock-esque movie. Frank Sinatra’s “Strangers in the Night” whined from a nearly dead jukebox in the corner, while pale off-white tables filled the gaps between the booth seats, matching the countertop that sat in front of bar stools apholstered with the same red plastic leather cover. 

	“The whole place had a smell like burning eggs,” Grace noted to herself as she pushed the door open with her back as she closed her umbrella and shook the rain from it. She wiped her feet on the dirty mat by the door and looked fleetingly around for a seat. It was easy to find one, as it appeared that Ricky’s busy hours didn’t include the three AM slot. 

	She walked over to the counter and chose a seat left-center. Aside from Grace, the place was relatively empty, save for a an elderly regular whom Nancy recognized worked at the hospital she was employed as a nurse. The only other patron in the diner was a man of late middle age, maybe in his 50’s, seated in a corner by himself. Grace looked him up and down slowly, noticing his strangely dry clothes and neatly groomed appearance. He was wearing a brown fedora tilted down low, as if to block his upper face from view, and western-style duster overcoat to shield from the weather.

	“Hmm, wonder how long he’s been in here?” she pondered to herself. “Must’ve been a while, it’s been raining for almost two hours straight now.”
	“What’ll you have sweetheart?” Denise the waitress broke Grace’s thought train.
	“Sorry Denise, didn’t see you there. I was thinking about something. I’ll have the usual, coffee this time too.”
	“Oh honey, you’re foineee”, Denise blurted back in her northern voice, nearly as oddly boisterous at this time of night as it was contrasting to Grace’s own light southern drawl.
	“Need anything special tonoight?” 
	“No, just cream and sugar please, cup of water too if you don’t mind”.
	“Watah? Watah’s just foine too, sweety. Comin right up!”

	Grace waited until she walked away to resume thinking to herself again. Denise was such a character, what with her late night energetic nature and matching levels of caked on rouge. Her lips were bright red colored by makeup, contrasting her equally white teeth that shined bright behind her lips with a nearly joker-ish leer at times. Her tight waitress dress seemed dated, but then again so was the diner; they most likely hadn’t updated anything inside the dump in decades. Whatever it mattered to Grace. She was just here in between shifts.

	“Here yah go honey!” Denise broke her concentration again, and plopped the drinks down in front of Grace. “Yah look distracted. Everything alright?”
	“I’m fine, thanks. Just been a long night. Damned rain means car accidents, and those always keep us busy late.”
	“Rainy nights keep me lonely. I wish I had someone to cozy on up with if yah knows what I mean, hehe.” Denise cracked a large smile at her own statement. Grace barely parted her own lips.
	“I know what you mean.” Grace sighed as her brief smile faded. Her husband and college sweetheart had caught her in bed with another man only just a year prior. They divorced shortly after, leaving behind only tears and no children to show for it all. 
	“Sorry honey, I forgot...” Denise trailed off. “I’ll be right back.” She moved to the older man, and handed him his check for his food. “Here yah go sweety, you comin back to see me soon?” she preened her hair a bit while she winked at the gentleman. He proclaimed he would, with a laugh and winked back at her. “What a harmless old coot” she thought to herself. He paid and left, still smiling. 

	She closed her til drawer and walked to the stranger in the corner, looking at him with a smile as well. He didn’t return hers, at least not at first, and seemed to peer straight through her with a lazer-like gaze. He blinked twice in quick succession and looked up at Denise and broke a sly smile himself. 

	“How yah doin over here honey?” She asked. 
	“Just fine,” he answered, his smiled dissapearing just as quickly as it had appeared. “Another cup of that stuff you call coffee, though.”
	“Sure, sure. Just a sec, dawl.” She grabbed his mug and took it behind the counter and filled it again, grabbing two sweet-and-low packets for him as well, just like the first time. She brought it back over and sat it down in front of him. “Need anything else?”
	“Just the bill will be all,” he responded without even looking up at her.
	“Comin right up for yah.”

	Denise began to feel a sense of unease for the man, whom she had never seen before, but had no real basis to understand why. Something about him just seemed wrong. Off. Maybe his elevator didn’t go all the way to the top. Maybe it went a bit too high. Who knows? Either way she totaled him up for everything and moved quickly back to his table. She placed the bill on the front end of the table, smiled briefly and walked back over behind the counter and leaned up on her elbows, putting her hands under her chin and looked back at Grace.

	“Honey, have you been dating ANYONE since, well, yah know?” she pried.

	Grace stared back just as intently and paused just a moment before answering “Well, I’ve been out a few times, with a couple of nice guys, just hasn’t panned out to anything more”.

	“Aw honey, it’ll work out. Plenty of nice guys out there. Just try not to keep thinkin about that prick all the time”.
	“It’s not as easy as you think.”
	“Sure it is, been hitched twice now. It’s as easy to forget about ‘em as it is to find ‘em in the first place.”

	“Wish I had your sense of drive,” as it was Grace’s turn to smile and laugh. She reached out over the counter and pulled an ashtray closer to her seat. She dug into her bag and pulled out a pack of smokes, tapping one out and gingerly placing it between her lips. She lit it and took a big drag, pausing before her exhale, “You know,” blowing the smoke out, “maybe something will happen soon. I’ve been getting a good feeling about meeting someone new lately, more of a sense of peace about the whole thing.”

	“That’s the spirit, hun.”
	“It’s something, thats for sure.”

	Denise moved now to the kitchen window and picked up the slice of pie Grace always ordered and snagged a roll of silverware to accompany it. She slid the plate out to Grace, who thanked her and slowly unrolled the utensils.

	Denise walked back to the kitched and made small talk with the younger hispanic cook for a bit, She awaited the sound of the bell above the door to jingle, signaling new customers entering, but it didn’t come. Just the ding of the bell in front of the counter, the sound that Grace was ready to check out.

	“Everything alright tonight?”
	“Just like always, Denise,” Grace cracked another smile, “But it’s back to work for me. Long night shift again, as always,” her smile fading again into nearly a frown. “This has been one of those nights.”
	“It’ll get better hun, just you wait.”
	“I sure hope so. Just seems like everyone that can come in fucked up on something or hurt tonight has, and it probably won’t be the last of them either.”
	“Well, there’s always more pie and coffee where this came from if yah need it.” 
	“Thanks, you know I’ll be back soon.”

	Denise handed her her change and watched as Grace moved to the door, unlatched the strap on her umbrella, and toed the door open in anticipation for opening the unbrella and shielding herself from the rain. She opened it, took a deep breath, and walked out into the storm, preparing for the three block walk back to the city hospital. 

	The stranger in the corner waited about a minute after Grace left, then dug some change out of his pockets for the coffee he had guzzeled, placed it on the table, and pulled his duster coat tight around his waist. He tipped his hat down even lower, as it to ready his face for the rain, and walked straight to the door and pushed it open quickly and walked out.

	“Good riddance,” Denise thought out loud, as she watched him go and picked up the change for the coffee. No tip left, and he was about ten cents short on the bill. “Fuckin typical, asshole”.
That visit to the diner was the last time anyone saw Grace Reed alive.




1 AM Friday night October 11, 1985

	The door to the bar opened abruptly, slamming all the way open and crashing with a metallic thud into the dirty brick alley wall behind it. 

	“AND STAY THE FUCK OUT!” yelled the bouncer, as he threw the man into the alleyway by the back of his shirt collar and belt. 
	“Oh, don’t worry I will,” he called back to the bouncer. “I’ll be sure to stay as far away from this place as I can!”

	The man drunkenly smiled, the moonlight gleaming from the blood that covered his teeth, chin, and the front of his shirt. Waiting until the back door to the bar closed fully, he looked around to be sure no one was there, and reached into his pants pocket and pulled a small plastic bag from it. Tapping a bit of the contents onto the back of his left hand, he sealed the bag again using his lips and sat it onto his lap. He then pilled a small piece of a straw from the left breast pocket of his ruffled pink oxford and slipped the straw into his nostril, pinching the other closed at the same time. A quick sniff and it was off to the races again, as the pain in his mouth and face faded swiftly away. He slowly turned over onto his side and used his hands to scoot himself back into the wall behind him and lift up onto his feet and start the tedious lurch down the alleyway, away from the entrance to the Smoking Pig bar, pulling his shirt back into its proper postition. He peered back over his shoulder to ensure no one was following him, then shuffled to the curb to attempt to hail a taxi. 

	James hadn’t always been such a troublemaker his whole life. It just seemed that since he had come out of the closet at the beginning of the decade nothing had appeared to go the way he had planned for it to. Drugs and alcohol had mixed badly for him on a regular basis, and often got the better of him in public when it shouldn’t. Tonight was no different. Maybe that last shot of tequila had done it for him. Pulling the hot little piece of ass next to him in for a kiss after it definitely had. That little piece of ass had socked him a good one right back in his kisser, and had landed him face-first into that alley. 

	Several cabs go by, and after nearly twenty minutes of standing on the curb it begins to sprinkle lightly, at first. The downpour starts slow, but picks up tempo as the wind sharply increases, and he feels the temperature drop three degrees almost at once. His clothes become soaked completely, sticking to his thin body like wet sheets on a line, starting a race between the lines of blood spotted on the front of his shirt as they bled further down towards his beltline. 

	Suddenly a dark sedan slows and comes to a stop near the curb he is standing on. the front passenger side window slides open with a mechanical whine of resistance and from inside the vehicle he hears the words come out sharply.

	“Need a ride buddy?”

	At first he is taken aback by a stranger stopping and offering a ride, but with his luck so far with taxis tonight, why not?

	“Ah fuck it, sure,” he smiled coyly and opened the door and stepped inside. “Sorry about the wet clothes,” he muttered, trying to hide his obvious high.
	“It’s no consequence to me, the stranger said back. “Just looked like you needed some assistance, what with every cab from here to the capital passing you by like you weren’t even there.”
	“Well, I do appreciate it.”
	“I’m heading towards sixth avenue, are you close to that location?” asked the driver in a flat tone.
	“That works for me. I live off of ninth, so sixth will work just fine for me tonight I suppsose.”
	“Very well then.”

	The ride goes on in silence for a few minutes, with the only sounds in the vehicle coming from the squeaky windshield wipers beating off the rain, and a tape playing classic gospel hymns from the radio. “Just a Closer Walk With Thee” comes on, and for the first time since he got in, he felt uncomfortable in his skin, perhaps from the chill of the wet clothes, the cocaine, or the fact that he was a gay man in a stranger’s car late at night listening to gospel music. Perhaps a combination of the three. 

	Sixth Avenue comes and goes, and suddenly the man feels the sudden increase in speed from the driver’s foot pressing down harder. James felt a sudden rush inside him from adrenaline, and blurted out,

	“Hey, I thought you were only going to sixth?” he questioned the man.
	“I said I was going towards it. Not to it,” the response almost seemed a quiet hiss.
	“Oh, well, you can let me out here if you like.”
	“Oh, we aren’t there yet. No need to get more wet than you already are.”
	“Well, if you insi-”
	“I do.” 
	“Alright then... if it’s no trouble to you.”
	“It isn’t,” he shortly retorted.

	James sat back into his seat again, feeling a bit more at ease, thinking quietly to himself that this man couldn’t be all bad, a tad on the strange side, but probably just some religious freak.

	The car came to a stop under a streetlight at the corner of Ninth Avenue. James looked over at the man who had driven him home for the first good time since he had gotten in. Straight faced and clear-eyed, staring straight ahead of him. Not at all the type of friendly good samaritan he had been expecting.

	“Thanks for the ride,” he lisped out quietly.
	“Never a problem at all,” croaked the driver, who for the first time turned and looked James. His dark eyes stared out from underneath the brim of his hat like pieces of coal set into the face of a pale human snowman, and although James could tell they were looking at him intently, he couldn’t help but feel as though they were burning a hole right through him.

	There was an uncomfortable pause for a moment, and it was then that James decided to take an initiative and ask a very frank question of the man.

	“Do you often pick up strangers for rides late at night?” James pondered out loud.
	“You’re my first,” came the flat reply.
	“Well, it sure doesn’t seem that way,” he quipped back.
	“Trust me, you’re most assuredly my first. I try not to stray from my comfort zone often.”
	“Haha, is that so?” James began to lighten up a bit. “Sure seems like you’ve done this before, but if you say so... thanks all the same.”

	It was then that he looked down to reach for the door handle, located near the middle of the door, and noticed something strange indeed. The front seat was covered in what looked to be two towels of matching color to the seats layered on top of each other, with what also appeared to be a layer of sheet plastic in between them. Scrunching his face up tight, he wondered out loud to the man,

	“Hey, one last thing, are you some sort of neat freak or something?” 
	“Whatever makes you ask that?”
	“Oh just how you covered your seats like this,” he inquisitively noted.
	“Oh, I have to be careful you know.”
	“Careful for what?”
	“It keeps the seat from staining.”
	“From dirt? Paint? What are you an artist or some kinda construction worker?”
	“No, not quite. A different sort of preternatural fear entirely.”
	“Oh, well, to each their own I suppose.”
	“Of course. To each their own indeed.”

	James turned again to open the door, grabbed hold of the handle, and never saw the military-grade knife stashed so perfectly between the driver’s seat and center console coming as it plunged into the back of his thin neck nearly surgically, breaking the vertebrae with a twist of the blade and a resounding crunch. James fell forward, dead almost before he hit the dashboard. 

	The car started forward again, throwing the body back against the towel and plastic covered seat, then slowed to a near stop again, allowing the man to reach accross and buckle it in with care. He smiled to himself, and pressed rewind on the tape deck in the dash, stopping it again on the song that was playing when he picked the young man up that night. “Just a Closer Walk With Thee” scratched its way out of the speakers of the car as it entered a highway on ramp, heading out of town. The moon shown down on the darkened, empty road like a beacon from a lighthouse through the clouds as suddenly the tape made a chipmunk sound and the player spewed brown tape out like vomit, seeming to reflect the nature of the music versus the act that had just occured mere feet from it. 

	“Shit,” cursed the driver. “I suppose it’ll be time for a new tape soon enough then,” he thought.

	He looked over at his victim, posed as if he was asleep in the seat next to him. At least gravity was working in the favor of the driver, keeping most of the blood down in the body and off of the seat, a problem he would deal with later when removing it. He whistled calmly to himself, and pulled off the lonely highway and onto an equally lonely and empty street, headed towards a private boat dock nestled in a privately located bay, where he had already moored a rented boat earlier in the day. He parked next to the dock, and put the emergency brake on. 

	He walked to the boat, still whistling, and removed several items from it including a roll of duct tape, a sheet, and a six foot hand truck. He opened his trunk and removed a painter’s set of coveralls, and put them on, including a full hood and pair of rubber dish gloves. He then laid the sheet out flat on the wet, muddy ground, and opened the car door and unbuckled his passenger. Next he carefully pulled the towels beneath the body towards the door, making meticulous movements so as not to leave behind the layer of plastic in between the towels, lest the trickle of blood reach the leather of the seat beneath it. The body made a soft thudding squish as it, the towels, and plastic beneath it hit the sheet below. The package was rolled tightly together, resembling a human shaped rolled cigarette, and tightly sealed shut with the tape. The hand truck was then laid on the ground next to him, and the body lifted calmly onto it, and again taped securely into place. He lifted the makeshift gurney onto its wheels and pushed it trepidatiously down the bumpy wooden dock to the boat. He had set up a ramp beforehad, and used it to load his cargo. 

	The enging coughed and sputtered as it attempted to come to life, and eventually gave in. The driver lifted the mooring rope off the dock and began his journey out of the quiet bay and into the ocean. He didn’t travel far, as the rain had only subsided perhaps half an hour previous to his excursion. He rode the waves for twenty or so minutes until he was satisfied with the distance from the shore. He then dropped anchor, and lit a cigarette, staring up at the cloudy night, seemingly deep in thought. Upon the cigarette’s completion he tossed the butt into the water and knelt beside his package. He took his hand and rubbed the top of the victim’s head a moment and smiled.

	“You were indeed my first. A learning experience, this was. For everything you have taught me tonight will be put to good use. But for now it seems as though you have outstayed your welcome on my little vessel. Would you be a good sport and fuck off for me now? That would be quite lovely.”

	With that he lifted the handtruck back onto its wheels and tilted it over the side of the boat until it fell with force over the side, splooshing into the water and sending spray back into the man’s face. He wiped it away and watched the faomy sea water bubble for a moment, then return back to its black glassy self again. He returned to the helm of the boat and steered it back towards the bay as a large cloud of blueish smoke coughed from the carbuerator and into the chilled night air. A gigantic smile crept accross his face.

	This was only the beginning.




11 AM Wednesday May 23, 1990

	“I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,
dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,
Angel-headed hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection
to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night”

	That was what the note “pinned” by the switchblade to the chest of the prostitute read in clear, red typeface. The woman’s body had been found left in an alley, partially covered by garbage bags, as if to hide it. But that wasn’t the impression Detective Charles Weston got when he thought the scene over in his head again. Sure, the bags clearly were covering the body to conceal it, but that wasn’t the ultimate intent it seemed. In his report, Detective Weston would later write that the bags were placed in order to delay the discovery of the body until the appropriate time, not to hide the act from view forever. The placement of the note was proof enough of that. 

	The note was written on a peice of copy paper, and had obviously been made using such a machine. There were no fingerprints later found on the note, save those of the victim and the careless first response officer, a rookie, who pulled it off the body without thinking.  Weston had blessed the kid out for that one. What did they teach these kids in academy anymore? 

	“Did you guys check behind the dumpster next to her for evidence yet?” barked Weston. “This isn’t fucking amateur hour anymore,” as he shot another glance at the rookie cop. “We need to secure this area from press ASAP. Those jackals can’t wait to sink their teeth into a story like this.” 
	“Yeah, yeah, yeah, they got it. Ease off a bit Charles, let the uniforms do their jobs for five minutes before you jump down their throats will ya?” countered Detective Troutman.

	Weston’s partner at the time was a chubby, peculiar sort of man that watches police process a crime scene as one might watch a baker glaze a donut. Both of those things appealed to Phillip Troutman in the way that an overly eager child might anticipate Christmas. He stood to the side of the crime scene watching carefully as it was cordoned off and the necessary pictures were taken of the body and surrounding area.

	“Phil, sometimes I wonder if Marcy making you go to all those goddamned spin classes is starting to make you go all touchy-feely soft on me in your old age,” Weston chirped back at him with a smile. “It’s days like this that really make it hard to decide just who works for who,” he chuckled. 
	“Just another day at the office Charles. It’s what I’m best at.”
	“I sure hope solving crimes is what you’re best at.”
	“Whatever you say boss man.”
	“Cut the shit will ya? You’re starting to give me an ulcer.”
	“I’ll file that under “to do for later”.”
	“See that you do that.”
	“I’ll do what I can. Hey, so whaddya think this note business is all about anyway? Some fuckin psycho trying to leave a political statement or something? I mean, I’ve seen some weird shit in my day out on the beat, but something like that on a dead hooker? This is definitely a message. This guy’s done this before, obviously, but nothing I’ve seen recently fits this type of M-O. It’s strange to say it, but I don’t think this is going to stop here. Theres going to be something else happen.”
	“I hope you’re wrong about that. I really do. But something in my gut tells me that you’re right about it. This has serial killer written all over it, to save the pun.”
	“Guess we just get to sit back and play the waiting game while we sort this mess out then.”
	“Yeah, I guess so. What do you think so far?”
	“Well, obviously we have a dead hooker here, with no obvious signs of sexual assault or physical abuse, save that old shiner she has and the fact that she was apparently killed with the knife the killer used to stick the note to her chest with. Outside of that I don’t see any motive, it wasn’t a robbery, all her shit’s still here.” Detective Troutman took a moment to pop a piece of gum into his blubbery maw and think for a moment. He smacked his gum loudly as he postulated, “Honestly, I don’t really know what to think here. This is gonna take some time to sort out.”
	“Well, let’s finish up here and get to it then.”
	“Sounds good to me.”


	Following a two hour scouring of the scene, there was a pile of paperwork to do, and not a lot of evidence to accompany it. There were a few loose statements from the garbagemen who had originally found the body, and a couple of passersby who had just gotten hot dogs that heard the initial scream when the body was found. There were a few sparce notes on the rest of the alleyway’s contents and condition, but no other related evidence was found at the scene. 

	The official report of the scene submitted by Detective Weston read as follows: The body had been moved from a secondary site, most likely where it had occurred. There were lacerations about her stomach region visible above her waistline running up to her breasts.


	The two detevctives spent another two hours collecting statements taken by the other officers from the garbagemen who had found the body, and several other witnesses who had been close by when they heard the initial yell of discovery. They took a few notes over the placement of the body, and conversed with the crime scene unit to determine if the body had been moved there, or if the crime occured on site. It hadn’t. The prostitute was most assuredly killed offsite then placed carefully in her current resting location by whomever had perpetrated this act. Her grotesque stationary position indicated a clear level of detail and care. The degree of positioning and set up most assuredly showed that someone wanted the police to find her like this. They wanted her to be seen, posed and doctored specifically to convey some sort of meaning. As to what exactly that was, now that was the question.

If you guys like this I'll keep writing the story, as I'd like know what happens to Weston, and if he ever gets his man.

But being anonymous i feel like i can get it off my chest. I'm not entirely sure if what i feel is anxiety but it is making me really tired and I could use some direction. I feel whiny writing this but its 3 am and i cant sleep. A lot of things are going through my head right now so this may be incoherent babbling and i apologize.

**So** i'm in college I was getting close to graduating but I messed it up i needed to get a internship I told myself i would do it but i couldn't bring myself to do it. At this point I know i'm suppose to be job hunting or have a job lined up. I  feel like i have failed and I'm a huge disappointment to my parents and grandparents. I think about what i am studying and I don't like the subject matter and i'm not passionate or motivated to continue. At first i thought this is what it means to be an adult and i need to suck it up and grow up and do it. But as i progressed through out my college life i just feel miserable. I think about the future if i were to continue on this path and i just feel even worse about it. So naturally i try to put focus on what i want to do. The problem is I don't know what i want. So over the past couple of years I've been trying to figure out what i want while still continuing the same degree. I decided to join a club despite it being difficult to talk to people i forced myself to do it so i can make friends and hopefully learn something from what they have experienced. I never managed to make any friends from this but i did have a lot of people comment on how quiet i am. so i joined several more activity group type things and i always still felt out of place and awkward and uncomfortable. I eventually stopped trying. 


 **I've** always been a very quiet and shy guy who has floated along in life.  I never really know what to say and i feel people getting awkward when they talk to me and i fumble my words and make incoherent sentences. Despite this i somehow managed to make some ""friends"" (people who talk to me(what would you call this)) In some classes I am in (Rarely ever talk out of class and the discussion is usually related to classes). Every now and then they will make a joke about how quiet i am and i just laugh it off. A couple of weeks ago waiting for class to start He makes the same comment but continues it by saying ""man dude i feel as though you would shoot up the school if i don't talk you"". I just (awkwardly) laugh it off. I couldn't leave my room that weekend i know he was joking and i know i'd never do something like that. I stayed in my room i didn't get food i just stayed in my room i  couldn't stopped shaking. People have said i looked complacent, emotionless before and it never bothered me as much as this did. I guess i didn't like hearing he felt he was doing me a service because he was talking to me. This isn't the first time I've locked myself in my room for extended periods of time without eating it usually happens when things don't go my way or some big assignment is coming up. I freak out and I usually end up shaking and crying in my room and just fall asleep. I always hate myself afterwords for doing this because nothing gets done. I know this while it is happening but it still doesn't help. When i'm worried or upset about things i realized i like to escape so I read things about upcoming video games, weird facts, or random Reddit posts. thinking back i feel this is why I played a lot of video games I liked focusing on them, than face my problems.I left all my games at my parent house cause i knew they would interfere with my schoolwork. I probably just replaced them with the internet and mobile games to escape whats going around me. I feel really childish having these thoughts i'm being this huge crybaby. I'm Not sure what to do anymore I feel lost and stuck.

33kv9y,3,2015-04-23,"[M20] I LITERALLY can't stop thinking about this girl [F21], she likes me but is being weird! But I still live with my ex...",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/33kv9y/m20_i_literally_cant_stop_thinking_about_this/,"Hey guys, so this might be abit of a long one my apolgoies, I’ll make the TL;DR a good summary.
So basically, I’ve known this girl, let’s call her Hannah. I’ve known Hannah for a little over 2.5 years now. We met on the first day of our university induction. Ever since then we hit it off well whenever we spoke to one another (which wasn’t often). I thought she was really pretty, and used to stare at her a lot of times when we were in lectures. I caught her looking back at me, and I could tell we sort of had a ‘thing’ together. 

Like, when our lecturers told us to get into groups to work together, she immedietly called my name ‘OP’ 2 seconds later, and wanted to be in my group. I’m rambling, but anyways, whenever I saw her out in town when I was with my buddies drinking, she would always say hi, or give me an occasional flirty comment.

I meet this other girl at around the same time, maybe a few days before meeting Hannah at a dorm flat party. This girl turns into my girlfriend around 2 months later of going back and forth. So all is well, I stop talking to Hannah a lot after that. 

2nd year of university, me and my girlfriend get a house with 4 other people. By this point she’s saw me and Hannah bump into eachother again, and she could tell that me and her had a ‘thing’ also, so I felt guilty because I knew she was right, even though I never admitted to it. A few more instances where she meets Hannah and yeah, my girlfriend doesn’t really like me hanging around with her. So like a caring boyfriend, I don’t speak to her hardly ever. 

3rd year of university comes around, this time because of our circumstances, me and my girlfriend end up getting our very own studio flat together. 1 bedroom, 1 open plan room. So there’s not really anywhere for us to get our own space. I start working full time on an internship, which is happening until july. She starts her final year at uni, but she’s only in 6 hours a week. 

However, she also managed to land a job last year, also at the university. Now, at this job, long story short, she met a guy there. They happen to get on really well together, she tells me that he’s her new best friend, but there’s nothing to worry about. I see through all the red flags, and it’s pretty clear what’s going on. 

So last month, I happen to be away for a whole week, when I come back she’s moody and constantly on her phone to this other guy like she always is. When she’s asleep I snoop on her phone, a shitty thing to do, but it confirmed what I knew was already 99% the case. They want to be with eachother. So I breakup with her the next morning and she’s now my ex, but we still live together until July (that’s when we both have jobs until, and no, there’s absolutely nothing we can do about the living situation, I already went through all the options). 

Now…I naturally start hanging out with Hannah. It’s strange, she’s probably the funniest, and most sexiest person I’ve ever met. All my friends think she’s awesome, but….she’s also flirty with most people she finds attractive (a lot of my friends too). I like her a lot, she’s really physically attractive, but her personality is even better.  But she’s been giving me a lot of mixed signals.

So since the breakup, I’ve stayed at Hannah’s place a few times after drinking in town, either to crash, or just literally be alone in her room and talk things out, but we haven’t slept together. After a few drinks, I go to her room and ask about us. She told me that she doesn’t just want to be another rebound from my ex, she said she likes me too much for that, and that I should sleep with some other girls first. But she’s conflicted because she’s also seeing this guy in her hometown who she really likes, but obviously it’s not official or anything, they just go on dates. 

So obviously my ex got quite jealous when she found out I’d been hanging around with Hannah a lot, especially after stopping at her place. She’s stopped at her new guys place though a lot, and it’s clear that they want a relationship together, because she spends most of her time with him. So last night, we talked about it, and where we’re both at, and set some ground rules in order to clear the air a bit.

Basically, we both said that this situation sucks, that we still care about eachother, but at the same time, there’s nothing we can do about it. We set rules that we can’t bring anyone back to our flat, and that we don’t talk about our current affairs to one another. She wants to know what I’ve done with Hannah, I tell her we’ve kissed when we were both drunk, but we haven’t slept together, which is true. I ask her about her new guy, she said they’ve kissed but that’s it, and she doesn’t know what she’s going to do with him. I tell her it’s obvious that she wants a relationship with him, and that she doesn’t need to lie about it, she didn’t say anything. We argue that night but the next morning agree it was best that we cleared the air so we’re not looking over eachothers shoulders anymore. 

So with Hannah, last I heard of her, she texted me saying that she hasn’t laughed that much in ages (when we went out on Monday and she told me her worry about being a rebound). It was a really good night, but she hasn’t really texted me since. She’s been back in her hometown since Tuesday, and I know she’s been with this other guy because of the FB posts she’s been tagged in. I’ve messaged/snapchatted her but she hasn’t really replied to me since Tuesday morning, so I have no idea where I am with her.
Do I take it slow with her and see what happens? We both go back to university this September, and she’s in most of my lectures, so she’s isn’t going anywhere soon. But at the same time, I really want to hang out with her more, but it seems she’s never around. I have no idea what to do at this point guys, please help!

**tl;dr**: Met Hannah at around the same time as ex, ex got jealous when she saw me with her so we hardly spoke. I breakup with my ex a month ago and start hanging out with Hannah. My ex is hanging out with her new lover almost everyday, but we still live together for 3+ months. Hannah's sort of seeing someone else but invites me out a lot, and I’ve stayed with her several times overnight (not slept together though), she says she likes me too much to be a rebound, but she also likes this other guy, I haven’t really heard from her since."

He and I are pretty close and he was the one who inspired me to go into computer science (current high school senior, starting at a state school next year). He said in the next year or so he wants to take his savings and start his own firm. He said he'd be happy to let me intern to get a feel for the business as well as get some experience for my resume. Long term I want to work for Google, but I dont want to rush it as I have a very unusual opportunity on my hands.

Here's my idea: What if I work for him for my 4 years in college part time. Then, during my senior year I apply to work at Google. Having HFT on my resume should get me a phone screen (I hope). Then, assuming I can get an offer from them, I get my friend to write an official offer letter that gives me a salary of $150k + $100k bonus. I then present this to Google and ask them to counter it with a higher salary + more stocks and bonus.

My question for you is, would they entertain it? Would they even consider something like this from a new grad?

Thanks!

Like to flirt, tease, talk dirty, and play? You found the right person. Let's have a bit of a build up until we can't take it any more.

I have a few fantasies in mind, but I'm open to other ones. In general, my kinks are D/s, exhibitionism, dirty talk, ageplay, incest (Dad/dau), bondage, some rough play, cum play, impreg. Limits include toilet stuff and non-con.

Here are the fantasies I've been thinking about:

1) Dad/dau play. Maybe you're my secretary or a new intern. Maybe you're just playing hooky to come visit Daddy at work. While others may think you're innocent, Daddy knows what a dirty girl you really are. Or maybe you're just an out and out slut. Maybe we can have some people watch or join in? Or maybe we have to sneak around.

2) I read a cuckquean scenario the other night and it caught my attention. I don't have a lot of experience with this one, but it sounds like fun. You're the other woman--younger, hotter, kinkier, wilder. What would you do to tease my wife while we play? How would you drive her wild with jealousy or put her in her place?

3) It started off innocently enough. You heard Mommy and Daddy making noises at night. That led to listening and peeking, and snooping. You found the outfits, the toys, the porn. And you liked it all. You wanted what Mommy had, and you were convinced you could do it better. Kinkier, louder, dirtier. Anything with Daddy. So you stated to dress differently, act differently. Flirting led to touching, then kissing, then fucking. And you were right. You are better. Daddy now prefers you. You just need to find ways to sneak around and have your secret fun. How far will you go? How extreme, how blatant?"

I have two research internships under my belt (including one I'm doing this summer), as well as 2 semesters of research at my school. 

The thing is, I don't think I will be able to land an industry job out of college with research experience and no industry experience, and research jobs usually need a masters.

I had no idea she was like this before listening to the podcast, and needless to say my opinion of her has changed... Anyway...

In this podcast she spouts some BS again and again that has no evidence or is just wrong. Then Joe questions it and she just glosses over her bullshit. I lost count of how many times she said ""I was talking to this guy (about Syria, cops, whatever) and he said...""

1. Joe Scarborough is a murderer:  I looked this up, and it sounds fishy. But there's no evidence to suggest he had anything to do with it. Still she comes right out the gate with ""They say he killed his intern""... Thankfully Joe kind of shut down the bullshit by asking who ""they"" are. But he's forever a murderer to plenty of gullible JRE listeners.

2. OMG that video of Karl Rove trying to rap!: Um, no that's a comedian impersonating Karl Rove. She acknowledges this and keeps on pretending it's him.

3. That video where a cop deliberately runs over a guy. ""All he did was robbed a store or something"": The man had just committed armed robbery, was walking down the street firing a gun and pointing it at his own head. I'm no fan of cops these days, but the officer probably saved the suspect's life and others'.

4. 80,000 deaths in Pakistan Under the US war on terror:  Well first, I can't find this number anywhere. I'm seeing 49,000... ""Under the US war on terror"" is such a loaded phrase. That number includes deaths from fucking terrorist attacks and Pakistani military deaths in their fight against the Taliban! Abby suggests that every last one of the 80,000 supposed deaths is because of the US.


FINALLY i laughed out loud at her spirited defense of Vladmir Putin. When Joe said that he's supposedly worth $200 billion, she's all too quick to question ""WHO says that"". Nevermind every fact she produces came from some guy or ""they"". I'm sure that politically motivated murder in Moscow was in no way related to Putin, but it's high conspiracy that Joe Scarborough's intern died suspiciously.

Almost like Putin signed her paychecks...

33mpfd,6,2015-04-23,First Post -- My internet addiction: I think I need help to finally kick the habit.,EffectiveMan,nosurf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/33mpfd/first_post_my_internet_addiction_i_think_i_need/,"Hi everyone,

I would like to join this community and introduce myself! I’m really looking forward to discussing with you and to sharing experiences and strategies regarding our common struggle with internet (ab)use.

**My TL;DR:**
I’m in my late 20s, university student, a life-long procrastinator and an internet addict for approximately 10 years. In my case, procrastination as well as perfectionism and general “avoidance of discomfort/difficulties” go hand-in-hand with extreme internet use (avg &gt;40 hours / week).
I’ve found a few strategies that work for me (p.e. physical exercise, meditation, …) and consider myself about at about 50% of the way towards “normal functioning”, but have recently hit another plateau that seems hard to overcome.
On NoSurf I want to meet like-minded people that can understand my situation.

**LONG VERSION**

Like many of you (I suppose), I’m a twenty-something dude whose life is almost completely determined by my internet use. When I’m online, I mainly surf the web, watching Youtube videos and reading news and trivia pages — so I’m not so much a message board/online gaming/gambling/porn addict. I estimate that I surf more than 40 hours a week on average, with binge sessions of 16 hours on some days. 

**The negative:**

My own theory is that the internet is a safe space to which I can escape from everyday worries and conflicts.
I’m highly self-critical and a perfectionist, so my work life (I’m currently finishing up my Master’s thesis in a technical/mathematical field and have done a couple of internships in the real world) is always endangered by procrastination and bad sleeping habits.
At the same time I have developed a kind of social anxiety, worrying a lot about what others think of my personality and my accomplishments (or lack thereof).
I’m afraid both my parents are generally very unhappy, unhealthy people and have been medicated for depression. I’ve been in romantic relationships for most of my adolescent and adult life, but practically always with rather negative, sad/depressed and clingy girlfriends who depended on me for emotional support.
Subconsciously I feel like I always have to try and keep everybody around me happy and satisfied (even though I know from a rational point of view that is neither possible nor my responsibility, of course), and that I have to be an all-around “perfect” person. This is of course an impossible task and I probably try to escape from that pressure via mindless surfing.

The highest-risk time of the day for me is evenings and nights. I somehow want to avoid going to bed without the comfort of surfing, so just stay online indefinitely. Sleep hygiene is big issue and I’m probably scared of the thoughts and worries that may come to my mind while I lie awake in bed. I often surf until 2 or 3 a.m., sometimes until 6 or 7 a.m. or until I fall asleep from exhaustion. When I've had a night like that, usually the day after is messed up as well — I then wake up around noon and often immediately continue surfing on my phone. Sometimes it takes me up to 5 hours to finally get out of bed!!
I also procrastinate/surf a lot during the day when I should be working. I am long overdue with my graduation from university, all my friends have graduated two years ago and I’m still wasting much of my time on the internet. Surprisingly, my grades are very good (I’m a good student ONCE I sit down to do the work), but the long overtime that I have already spent on my degree doesn’t look good on my CV.

My social life has suffered, too. All the time I spend online would be much better spent with friends and family, or making new friends. Luckily I have a core group of friends that I trust, but no one in my circle has this issue of addiction.

The whole situation creates a vicious cycle of frustration/anxiety —&gt; surfing —&gt; frustration/anxiety, and it’s been going on like this for so many years already … it’s truly life-destroying. But it’s also a problem NOBODY ELSE SEEMS TO UNDERSTAND. I feel like an alcoholic, only my drug is the internet and not alcohol, and most people can’t even imagine that the internet can cause such huge problems. That’s part of the reason I want to join NoSurf, since you guys should understand what I mean.

**Now to the more positive stuff:**

I finally realised about 5 years ago that I have some kind of a problem. Since then I’ve been obsessed with fighting the surf habit by whatever means possible. For a few years I threw money at the problem and regularly spoke with a mental coach/therapist. It was nice talking about everything, but there simply was no long-term improvement.
About 18 months ago I started another focussed effort to kick the habit and finish my degree. Since then I’ve read a ton of blogs and books on productivity, habits, procrastination, well-being, etc. and have tailored myself a “system” that has helped me get along much better. The core components are habits of meditation, journaling and physical exercise. They have helped me with self-control and I've slowly improved my life.

**But recently progress has stalled.**

This year has been tough on a few fronts and sometimes over the last few months it has felt like I’m relapsing to my old self — which is EFFING SCARY. 
Furthermore, I’m getting increasing pressure to finish my degree because I have a job opportunity lined up — in order to start working there I need to graduate before summer. But I still spend 50-80% of my days surfing and wasting time for nothing.

So I would like to join this community, keep track of my progress and discuss with you guys (hopefully helping each other) rather than surfing on random sites.

My immediate goal right now is to limit mindless websurfing to 1 hour / day and get to sleep each day at 12pm. I think I can do that.

Sorry for the extra-long post, I've never summarised my situation like that. Thanks a lot if you took the time to read through it!

I'm looking forward to hearing from you guys!"
33mpfi,2,2015-04-23,What type of jobs or internships should I apply to?,my_coding_account,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/33mpfi/what_type_of_jobs_or_internships_should_i_apply_to/,"
Right now, I would like to have a tech job, but am not sure whether I should apply to an internship or full software job, or if I need more practice.

I have a B.S. in physics and have spent the past year or two learning programming on my own. I decided not to go to graduate school and picked software engineering as a goal career since I wasn't sure what I wanted to do instead. During school I took a lot of math and chemistry classes, and did experimental research where I built lasers and electronics.

I've got a few projects in different languages:

- Computational origami project, in python. This calculates the locations of origami folds needed to make the figure given. You draw a stick figure / tree in a gui, then it does circle-packing / optimization math and returns a new graph. It's hard to explain.

- twitter app, in ruby: input a user, access api and then it returns who they talk to (and who they talk to, to however many levels of recursion you want), + other info.

- Tetris. Converting a program somebody else wrote in Ruby to Java. (I thought this would be quick and easy, but it's turning into the hardest thing. I wish I just tried to write my own)

- in school I did some assembly programming in a digital electronics class. I made a stopwatch / timer for a final project.

Other experience I have.

- SQL, 1 open courseware programming class (Theory of Programming Languages, made a mini-language in SML, among other homework assignments), racket, algorithms/data structures (I've done some practice interviews, but probably need more practice), mathematica project, some knowledge of databases.

I don't know how much more experience I need. As far as what area of programming, I find mathematical stuff more fun, but am open to anything - I haven't seen any of it from the inside.

If this is more suited to resume advice, let me know and I can repost then. I live in Seattle."
33mvnx,2,2015-04-23,How should I deal with my Mother-in-Law?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/33mvnx/how_should_i_deal_with_my_motherinlaw/,"I know, I know, it's cliche. First, let me tell you a little back story.

I am a young adult, recently married and living with my husband's family. I came from an abusive home and was living in another friend's house for a little while before my husband's family took me in. I owe a lot to this family and to the mother-in-law for taking me in almost free-of-charge, giving me food, ect. They have been nothing but kind to me but lately my relationship with the mother-in-law has been extremely strained. The apartment we live in is small, there are six of us and so a little stress is to be expected. However, it seems like nearly everything I do results in this woman feeling deeply offended and a talk I had with my husband revealed to me that my mother-in-law doesn't feel like I respect her enough.

Now, I said I came from an abusive home-- I was literally my parent's parent. I was practically raised by cats growing up, so maybe my idea of ""respect"" is a little skewed. To me, I believed in giving the people around you deserved respect. If you are an elder, I will treat you well because I understand that you may be becoming a little senile, maybe your sick, maybe you're a grouch because of x or y reason and it's a little late to be expecting you to change your ways now. Fine-- but if you're a middle-aged adult and you treat the people around you like dirt, I expect you to know better and will call you out on your behavior. 

I wouldn't go so far as to say that this woman treated me that badly, but since I began living in her house she had been an overbearing presence. I can't tell you the amount of times she has made me cry-- including on my birthday or before/after work-- and she never felt the need to apologize for that. She constantly mocks my paranoia of spoiled food/germs (the woman leaves EVERYTHING PERISHABLE out of the fridge for weeks). She even calls me ""chubby"" and says that I am going to get diabetes while I am perfectly thin! She pressures everyone to act according to her wishes (with good intentions, I understand that) and she seems utterly inconsiderate. She's the type of woman that blasts her TV and talks in the kitchen (which is right beside my bedroom) in the middle of the night and as loudly as possible because, surely, if she isn't sleeping then NO ONE is! She also has a terrible habit of leaving trash everywhere she can and RARELY picks up after herself. I am talking about banana peels in the car for MONTHS. Yet she expects everyone to clean up after her!

Anyway, please excuse my rant. The point is that while she does all of these things that drive me (and her children, occasionally) insane, you are not allowed to correct her. To so much as tease her a little back for a joke she made would result in her heart breaking into pieces. Every single time I've accidentally offended her, I've always apologized. I've tried explaining my background to her, I've tried explaining that she took what I said the wrong way and this is what I really meant-- I feel like I've tried everything and it isn't enough! Today she refuses my apology and is walking around crying and complaining about me to her children. 

According to her son and what he says is ""their culture"", the way you show respect to your elders is by NEVER correcting them or suggesting a better way of doing things, NEVER point out a flaw they have, NEVER tease them, NEVER do anything they do to you back at them, NEVER expect an apology from them and ALWAYS apologize, and do whatever they say. 

This sort of thing is completely alien to me. I don't get the concept of obeying someone this way. I don't understand how I am expecting to suck up whatever she does but not point out the hypocrisy. My strategy right now is to flat out hide from the whole family. My husband is in college right now and I am in a Internship Program, so neither of us can afford to move out yet (and trust me, we are saving up). 

Is there something I can do in the meantime? How do I show respect to someone like this? Please explain it to me because aside from being polite and helping around the house, I don't know what else to do to prove my appreciation to this woman! "

My name is Noah Muth; I'm looking for a web development internship for this summer, preferably on a small team. I'm located in St. Paul, MN, but I'd love to spend a few months in a different city if possible.

Professionally, I am a full-stack web developer working with full-stack Javascript. I have almost a year of experience with Node+Express, Angular, and MySQL, but I've also worked with React, MongoDB, and Redis to varying degrees. My clients are mostly entrepreneurs fleshing out their product for the first time-- several of them from this very subreddit! Check out [my website](https://noahmuth.com) for more information.

Academically, I'm a junior, with a 3.7 GPA, double majoring in computer science and poetry at Hamline University. I write papers, poems, and compilers in equal amounts.

I'm looking for an internship with a team of happy people who like what they do. Programming is a craft, and like any craft, the best person to learn from is someone who truly enjoys their work. If that sounds like you, and you're interested in taking on a productive team member who is eager to learn, send me a PM! I'll hook you up with a copy of my resume.

Thanks for reading!"

1.Take some interesting 4th year cs courses to better understand computer science (compilers, capstone, principles of programming languages) 

2.Raise my gpa. Right not its a horrible C+ cumulative gpa

I could have potentially just graduated with my honors degree but felt I would not be as skilled as other cs majors. Hence I dropped 1 required course to extend graduation.

Now I am starting to regret this decision, because I don’t think taking these courses would contribute to me finding a job after graduation. I have been struggling all term to get a summer internship, even though I had a previous summer internship doing software development. 

I am also mentally struggling with things, like particular draining friendships and my poor fitness level. I think that this stress and the stress of studying and getting better marks is getting to me. Add to the fact I have 30k of student debt I constantly think about.

Lastly, I have am enormous amount of ideas that keep me excited for the summer. I want to launch an android app, a web app, improve my website, and work on my Arduino.  I have been dabbling in each of these things this year on the side. Unfortunately I find school to keep me from actually completing any of these ideas.

Therefore, I have thought about taking first term of school off, and finding an 8 month internship or 2 four month internships. I would also work on my ideas and finally ship something. I can also focus on finding a full time job without having school as a distraction, by reading cracking the coding interview and learning the skills that certain company’s actually want in order to make myself a more attractive candidate.

Would you consider this a good idea? Am I shooting myself in the foot for not taking important 4th year courses? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated."

Question 1: I was just offered an accounting internship for a successful IT/Advertising firm. It pays $13/hr. Not the best pay, but I'd be working/reporting directly to the Controller and other higher-ups on a daily basis, so it sounds like pretty good experience (I'd help with the annual audit process, AP/AR, reconciliations, etc) . **I need to respond to the HR director by tomorrow about my offer. Would it be stupid of me to deny this offer to interview with two more prestigious companies (one is a financial company, one is a publicly traded defense company)?**

The reason I'm asking this is because an interview obviously holds no guarantees. If I weren't able to get either position, I have a feeling that I would be out of luck for intern experience this summer as it is already late April. If that were to happen, I'm not sure how I'd be able to sleep at night, knowing that I pissed away an opportunity.


Question 2: If an internship contract mentions that expenses related to working for the company may be reimbursed, would commuting to the city each day count? I'd be spending ~$370 a month on commuting, and coupled with the fact that my pay isn't exactly competitive, this would be fantastic. 

I'd really appreciate any input here!"

33n8al,1,2015-04-23,[Comp Sci] Science Internship program vs. finding internships myself,uwodude,uwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwo/comments/33n8al/comp_sci_science_internship_program_vs_finding/,"I am just finishing 2nd year and thinking of doing an internship after 3rd year.

For someone in CS, is the internship program any good in helping get interviews with American companies (preferably in the Bay Area)? ie does it really make a difference compared to just going out there and applying on your own?


My biggest peeve with the internship program is this policy:

&gt;1. The student who enrolls in the Program, is approved - receives several offers in Round 1 and then turns them all down without cause;

&gt;The student is withdrawn from the Science Internship Program and Science 3391, and not allowed to apply for any of the postings in Round 2.

I understand that this also means that one loses the ""$700-$1200 administrative fee"".

So if some company puts out an offer but I do not want to work with them because maybe I don't like the project/company after the interview or maybe the offer is too low, then I can't just rescind and/or keep interviewing in ""Round 2""?

If this is the case then would it not be better to apply myself, and upon receiving an internship, just take the year after 3rd year off, do the internship and come back? Also this would allow me do multiple 4-month internships rather than one long 8-12 month stint at the same company.

Anyone have any experience with this?"

Now with that out of the way.. I'm a 22yr old US college student, working on getting a minor in Computer Information Systems. Why minor and not major? College bureaucracy bullshit, that's why-- but that's not the point of this. 

I currently work as a workstudy for the Desktop Support team at my university, when I graduate I will have done that for about 2yrs. Ontop of my workstudy I also intern with the SysOps team helping them with documentation and writing out their own policies and procedures. I spent 2yrs before college working in a mom-and-pop computer repair shop, and before that I worked my way through high school (+1.5yr) doing freelance computer repair work. 

I've taken multiple Windows Desktop, Windows Server, Programming, Linux/Unix courses and have been using Linux daily for the last 5yrs or so. This semester I took CISCO I, might take CISCO II.  

I've got an Arch laptop to my far left, a Fedora 21 laptop to my close left, a CentOS VM on that to play around with, and my desktop dualboots Win8.1/F21. And back at my house I've got a Fedora 20 server for ownCloud, VPN and minecraft.

I can compile software, i can build/config kernels, I've done Fedora and Arch packaging (working on getting my first package into Fedora main)

I'm a naturally curious person who loves setting up various services(LAMP, vpn, sshd, game servers, and QEMU/KVM are the ones off the top of my head) just to see if I can get them to work and configured properly. 

I'd love to one day work under the SysAdmin umbrella but I don't know if I've necessarily started down the right path for it. This coming semester / fall I was going to start trying to get my Linux Foundation, Red Hat, and Linux+ certs if they would help me get my foot in the door. Thoughts?"

i have been telling my therapist and myself that i was sexually abused growing up and i think im lying. i don't remember the """"""""abuse"""""""" very well, and i could have easily made up the few memories that i sometimes halfway believe in  because i wanted an excuse for me being a pervert.


i have been touching myself ever since i can remember, but i've almost always masturbated in a really fucked up way. I remember one time when i was like 8 and i put 8 or 9 super sized tampons inside of me until i was bleeding. I did stuff like that all the time, just putting crazier and bigger stuff inside myself when i was still in elementary school(20 some odd markers, a curling iron, pieces of polished marble). I still can't get off to anything that dosen't include pain or rape or just evil evil stuff. I still do sick perverted things i put two really big dildos inside that stretch me way out and i don't use any lube and push them until they're at my cervix and i keep pounding them into it and i know that its sick, really sick and probably also really dangerous since i always end up bleeding but i can't stop. i don't think i've ever came without fantasizing about rape or the like. everytime afterwards i just feel awful and i know that the only reason i made up all that bull shit about being sexually abused was to give myself excuses, some kinda out or a *reason* to like all this stuff and to make me feel like it wasn't my fault even though it totally is and im probably some weird new kinda crazy. maybe god is punishing me for being a liar id deserve it

it just feels like im obsessed with it, and i always have been and i just want it to stop but i cant. The lies i've been telling are that my mom was putting thing inside me when i was just little and had me eat her out and touch her breasts and then she touched me. and then, the lie goes on, she let her boyfriend have sex with me, but i don't think that lasted very long.

 The thing is, i didn't """"""""""""remember"""""""""" these lies until i was 18 and no longer in contact with her at all(largely unrelated reasons, she wanted to send me to conversion therapy b/c i was bi. im 22 now) . I' thought that maybe something had happened because of how sick my sexuality was but at first i thought it was a babysitter and then i thought it was another babysitter, and then i guess i decided that it was my mom, but im lying, obviously. I learned about False Memory Syndrome when i was like, 13, cus i did nothing but study AbPsych in my spare time, and its pretty obvious that that's what going on here. I would have know about this when i was growing up, or at the very least remembered it when i was trying to convince myself that my parents were abusive(they weren't i am a liar) and i kept trying to remember if maybe my dad had beaten or raped me so that i could tell someone and not have to live there anymore, but couldn't think of anything(because nothing ever happened and i made it all up to feel sorry for myself)

If nothing ever happened then i must have just been born evil or sick.

My question is, has any one else had experience with something like this? at all? I know ur going to tell me to tell my therapist, but i just can't tell her about the sicko masturbation stuff(i've never told anyone) and besides she's an intern and leaving soon. I just want to stop thinking about this. I'm sorry, I'm really usually more coherent and put together than this, and I'm sorry I lied about being raped. Please don't be mad at me.

**TL;DR** - A sicko makes up lies about being raped to make freaky sex stuff make sense, asks if others have ever heard of anything like this before."

Do you think it is possible at this point to find a CS-related internship before starting my CS program in the Fall?

**Here's my situation:** I left a job a couple of months ago due to some company culture/management issues. I'm currently unemployed, but have been accepted into a BSc in CS program at a state university. I am technically transferring in as a sophomore because I have a 2-year degree (only 44 credits were transferrable).

I'm self-taught for the most part and have a general/basic (if a bit rusty) understanding of OOP from the Java class I took. I've tinkered around with Python, C(++, #), JavaScript, Batch/Bash, etc also. However, as I won't start until Fall, I haven't taken any CS classes like algorithms, data structures, etc.

**Here's the issue:** I need some income over the summer, but trying to find work seems impossible right now. I have a 2-year degree with 2-3 years of experience in the IT field, but it seems questionable of me to seek out a full-time job only to drop it in 3-4 months when classes start.

With my experience and knowledge, would it be possible to find a developer internship? do I need more pre-requisite knowledge first? Is it too late?

Otherwise, what are my options at this point?"

Today marks the completion of my four year degree. 
 
You would think I would be happy. I would be ecstatic. I am not. And I really hate that because I *should* be. Most people *would* be. 
 
Instead I am nothing but anxious, uncertain of my future, where to go from here, what comes next. People today sounded like they had shit figured out: jobs lined up in our field, prospects, one guy came to our second exam straight from an interview. People talking about going out to celebrate, going out and getting drunk with their friends. So on and so forth. For a single moment some of their excitement and happiness rubbed off on me. Only for a moment. It was more as if I was excited *for* them. 
 
I am not going out, with anyone. The real friends I made...well, one is heading back home and has all their stuff packed up (hours away from me by car), another is heading off to celebrate and get drunk with his real friends, the friends you make in childhood. I wasn't invited. Why would I be? We live an hour away from each other and have never really seen each other outside of class. Yet this is who I call my closest friend at the moment. Two friends from high school are off doing their own thing and couldn't care less. I am okay with that. It's just the fact that I don't seem to have these connections that other people do, that other people make. 
 
No job lined up. No motivation. Only thing I have that may pan out is the lawyer I did my internship with. Pretty sure he was just being nice, but when I contacted him to check if I could volunteer again back in December he told me to check back when I finish school. I doubt that will pan out, but may as well try. I kind of made somewhat of a fool of myself during my internship. He is a nice guy, so I know full well he probably told me to check up just to be nice and give me something to hold on to rather than say no. 
 
I hate change. I hate uncertainty. I hate this depressive rut I've been in for the past few years. Why can't I just enjoy this moment? I feel like I have accomplished nothing. Finished a four year degree and all I have to show for it is sitting in the same room. Feeling the same feelings. Same shit, different day for me. Grandparents congratulated me today and I don't feel I did anything to deserve it. 

I don't think my grades will even be that spectacular. I started out quite well but each semester my overall grade just dropped and dropped. I am at a 72.8 right now. I hope I will graduate with at least a above a 70 overall. I honestly skipped a lot because I couldn't be bothered to commute the two hours there and back. Well, that and the *feelings*....you know them. I am sure I graduated, even as I sit here and wait for final grades....I just doubt I did well or even have anything to be proud of. This week was literally the first week in this entire semester that I went to class every day. I do all my assignments, the important stuff, but I just couldn't be bothered to show up. I checked out sometime in my second year. 
 
To be perfectly honest, I am not even sure that I left with more knowledge than I started with. I don't feel confident in entering my field with what I do know. That is common among others in my program, though. Most of our profs were shit and didn't teach us the proper material; they preferred to rant and even go so far as to lecture about shit that had nothing to do with the course. 

All I know for sure is, come October I will be writing the Law Society of Upper Canada's licensing exam for paralegals. 
 
But I got an expensive piece of paper (will get) from a post-secondary institution, so I got that going for me which is nice. 

Apologies for the length. This is the end of a chapter in my life I always wanted to end...and now that it is....I feel even worse than I did while I was in it. I am overcome with the anxiety, the depressive rut I am in, the uncertainty, the change...the loneliness. The feeling of always being less than and finishing the race, but barely doing so. "

Because of this I've become something of a hermit. My day-to-day life is always exactly the same. I wake up, go to work, come home, and go to sleep. I don't do anything on weekends, either. I don't hang out with friends (not that I have friends to hang out with). I don't go anywhere to eat. I spend my time at work to myself and I spend my time outside of work at home.

So why do I feel this way? There are many reasons, but I can roll it up into one sentence. I've constantly been belittled and put down for the things I care about the most. When I was an undergrad I studied economics. I absolutely loved economics. I really, really did. And I liked talking about. I wanted to talk about. But when people would ask me about economics they didn't really care what I had to say. They already knew what they believed and what I said never mattered. That sucked, and it sucked more because I really cared about what I was studying. But I made peace with it by telling myself that these people were stupid. They weren't as smart as me. That's why they ignored me and threw the things I said back in my face.

So then I got picked for an internship program in DC. I and a bunch of other students were selected to take classes and intern in DC. Getting in was tough, too: essays, letters of recommendation, interviews, volunteer experience... It took months. But I got in and I was fuckin' pumped. My heart soared when I got that acceptance letter. I was fuckin' pumped because I finally felt like I'd be surrounded by smart people like me. I mean, they went through the same process I did! They must be smart people! We'll have discussions! Things will be different. I was so wrong. They were even more obstinate and intractable than the people I'd me at school. They were even more adamant in throwing things back in my face. I had been so certain that things would be different and they turned out to be just the same. Actually, I'd say it was worse because I had my hopes crushed.

So after that I accepted the fact that other people didn't care about me or what I had to say and I started shutting myself off. I stopped reading and watching documentaries and caring about anything that happened outside my immediate vicinity. I started focusing on my little corner of the world. I told myself that even though strangers didn't care about what I had to say, my friends would. So I stopped trying to be an intelligent person (that clearly wasn't worth shit) and tried to be a loyal one. That went okay until last year. 

What happened was, in a nutshell, a girl. I fell in love with a girl, but once she realized we wanted different things she broke up with me. So I turned to my friends for help, right? That's what you do in that situation. But they didn't help. Even though I'd known them for years and I'd helped them countless times, they took my ex-girlfriend's side against me. They called me an asshole. They called me conceited. I tried to explain how I felt. I tried to explain why I felt. It didn't matter. They'd already decided their positions. They already knew what to think about me and my girlfriend and the relationship we had and nothing I said could change that.

So now I'm fucked. I've learned helplessness. No matter what I do, no matter where I go, no matter how close I get to someone, the things I feel and think and want aren't relevant. I feel that way because that's exactly how people around me have reacted when I've tried to share with them the things I hold close to my heart. Even my closest friends, people that I'd known and supported and helped for years, reacted that way. 

Now I'm scared and frightened and living in a tight little box of my own design because I don't want to get my head chopped off anymore. But I want more. I'm smart and ambitious and I want more out of life! But if I stick my head up I'll get beheaded 'cause no one gives two shits what I want! But I don't want to live in the box! And on and on it goes.

I guess that's it. Sorry for the long post."

As advertised, I've got five prompts here, and I'd really love to act some of them out.

---

PROMPT #1: You're a young intern (18-21) at the office I work in. We don't talk much outside of a few short conversations, but I (though a bit older) notice you've got a body that's absolutely built for sex.

Through some side video editing work I do for a shady strip club boss in town, I've discovered you're also stripping on the side (and possibly doing other things, too). It's 5:30, nobody's in the office but us, and I've decided to let you know I know.

""Hey, can I see you for a second?""

---

PROMPT #2: It's a wild party in the setting of your choice (nightclub, pool party, strip club). The drinks are flowing, it's late at night, and it's essentially turned into an orgy, with asses bouncing, clothes coming off, and people making out (and more).

Maybe you're a college student out on the town. Maybe you're a cougar looking for a younger guy. Hell, maybe you're a stripper or hooker who just wants cock. At any rate, you're wearing THAT outfit in your wardrobe that excels at covering up very little, and you're out for one reason: To fuck and get fucked.

---

PROMPT #3: You're the neighborhood MILF and you know it. You spend days on end lounging by the pool in your bathing suit, which barely covers your gigantic fake tits and shapely ass. One day, I see you from out of my apartment window. Your husband is never home, and you've resorted to exhibitionism, pleasuring yourself in full view of many apartments.

---

PROMPT #4: I'm at the gym and can't concentrate. You're on the bike in front of me, wearing yoga pants with ""JUICY"" on the back and bending over to accentuate those gorgeous curves. You know guys come here solely to look at you riding a bike, wishing you were riding THEM.

I'm one of them. I'm 6'3"" with blonde hair and brown eyes, and was thinking about quitting the gym until you showed up. I'm single and mortal, so I kept coming at the same time every day just to see you work on your perfect body.

Finally, after what seems like an eternity, I work up the courage to say hi. I wait until you're done (out of courtesy, of course!), and I walk up to you with what seems like the whole world watching.

""Hi, I'm Tom,"" I say, somehow managing a full sentence. ""Seen you around a lot. You new to the area?""

---

PROMPT #5: Anything you'd like that fits into my kinks; get creative!

---

Kinks: Big breasts/titfucking, dirty talk (an absolute must), bad girls (partying/drinking/smoking, open to drug use if it makes sense in the story), oral sex (giving/receiving), bimbos.

Dislikes: Animals, blood/gore, bathroom stuff, heavy BDSM.

Hope to hear from you tonight!"

I'm a senior CS major with no internship experience. 

1) Anyone have experience with this position or company?

2) Industrial engineering -- I have no idea what it is, or why they chose me to interview. Should I look for a purer CS internship, or just stick with this summer opportunity?

3) The HR said they can take phone interviews since it is located 30-40 minutes away from me. I opted to meet in person -- was this a bad decision? I felt like employers would appreciate it more if I am interviewed in person, as well as make a more memorable impact.

Thanks."

I switched over from bio and I've done quite a lot of research in the CS field. I was even able to get a software engineering internship as a bio major (which is what made me switch over to CS). Anyways in the fall I'll start working with a professor who does work in virtual reality and he will be mentoring me while I do a research project on realtime augmented reality mobile tracking. I love AR and emerging tech like IoT and my work in the field is probably what got me my internship. However today I had a conversation with my friend who told me that it could backfire. He says I'm wasting my time unless I go for a graduate degree because no one will hire someone with a BS to building anything in emerging tech like AR or IoT. I started to think about it and he does have a point. When I applied to internships they were all mostly front end and backend stuff. I don't currently see myself going after a graduate degree so am I better off focusing on doing projects in web applications rather than AR/emerging tech?

-----------------------------
Hey! First post to this /r/!

Now with that out of the way.. I'm a 22yr old US college student, working on getting a minor in Computer Information Systems. Why minor and not major? College bureaucracy bullshit, that's why-- but that's not the point of this.

I currently work as a workstudy for the Desktop Support team at my university, when I graduate I will have done that for about 2yrs. Ontop of my workstudy I also intern with the SysOps team helping them with documentation and writing out their own policies and procedures. I spent 2yrs before college working in a mom-and-pop computer repair shop, and before that I worked my way through high school (+1.5yr) doing freelance computer repair work.

I've taken multiple Windows Desktop, Windows Server, Programming, Linux/Unix courses and have been using Linux daily for the last 5yrs or so. This semester I took CISCO I, might take CISCO II.

I've got an Arch laptop to my far left, a Fedora 21 laptop to my close left, a CentOS VM on that to play around with, and my desktop dualboots Win8.1/F21. And back at my house I've got a Fedora 20 server for ownCloud, VPN and minecraft.

I can compile software, i can build/config kernels, I've done Fedora and Arch packaging (working on getting my first package into Fedora main)

I'm a naturally curious person who loves setting up various services(LAMP, vpn, sshd, game servers, and QEMU/KVM are the ones off the top of my head) just to see if I can get them to work and configured properly.

I'd love to one day work under the SysAdmin umbrella but I don't know if I've necessarily started down the right path for it. This coming semester / fall I was going to start trying to get my Linux Foundation, Red Hat, and Linux+ certs if they would help me get my foot in the door. Thoughts? Am I on the right path towards getting the 'sysadmin' title? Should I change anything?

33octs,2,2015-04-24,"Me [24 F] with my BF [25 M] of 2 years, found him attempting to reconnect with his ex. Do I still go on vacation with him?",fourthdown,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/33octs/me_24_f_with_my_bf_25_m_of_2_years_found_him/,"I've been with my SO for a little over two years now. We met at work when we were dating other people, but things obviously didn't work out for those relationships. He was in a LDR with a girl on the West Coast where she was unfaithful and I had broken it off with a long term boyfriend where we grew apart. We were always attracted to each other, and it just seemed to fall into place perfectly for us.
Or so I thought.


We went on vacation to visit friends, which was a something we had been highly anticipating. It was a much needed getaway and break we needed from our jobs and the holidays. The couple we were visiting had us over one night where things were really low key. The boys were playing video games for a couple hours, I was mostly watching until I got a little bored after my phone died. Boyfriend's laptop was sitting beside him, so I asked ""Hey, can I use your computer? My phone needs to charge."" 


""Sure no problem."" Hands the laptop to me, and a sudden panic runs across his face and he stuttered and said ""Uhh, actually let me just log out of a few things first.""


..What. Honestly the most I was planning on his laptop was to browse Reddit, so that set off a lot of alarms. To act that shady over your laptop? And not to mention to act like that in front of friends? I can only imagine they were thinking the same thing I was. Now mind you, we're pretty open about a lot of things. What porn we watch, what our dirtiest kinks are, our darkest secrets.. all things we've openly discussed. 


So it ate at me for the rest of the night. What the hell could he possibly be hiding from me that he couldn't tell me? We went to bed that night and he could tell I was upset by something. I told him how I felt about his behavior regarding his laptop, especially in front of our friends. Like, how did that look to them? Besides that, what are you hiding and is there anything I need to know?


He swore up and down there was nothing, he was just scared that maybe a porn link here and there might accidentally pop up and he didn't want his friends to maybe see what ""embarrassing"" sexual stuff he's into. Okay, fair. It still didn't seem like the whole truth to me, but I let it go during our vacation.


Two months later, I'm still feeling uneasy about the whole situation. And I fucked up, Reddit. I did the one thing I promised myself I wouldn't ever do. One day I was over his house while he was at work and.. went on his computer. Nothing incriminating really, I didn't dig through any of his files or Facebook. But his gmail homepage popped up. And I saw a lot of.. interesting things. Emails from adultfriendfinder type shit. Hurtful, but checking the sent folder is where I stumble upon him emailing his ex.


That's what was the real punch to the gut. Around December, he was messaged her asking ""Why can you be friends with your exes but you can't be friends with me? I've been thinking about you a lot lately."".  My heart fell to my stomach. December? Really? I was in such a hard place between graduating, putting in long hours at work, saving to buy him a fucking PS4. And he was thinking about her? He was MISSING her? They dated for a shorter time than we had now, only spent 3 months straight together (Summer romance from an internship out on the West Coast). She cheated on him for basically half their relationship and left him for somebody else.. but he was missing her?  I was crushed. I'm still crushed. 


He came home, and I just started off the conversation with ""I fucked up."" He asked how, I told him I violated his trust. And I told him exactly what I had done, and what I had found.  Now I'm not one to have a pissing contest about who-did-what-to-whom,  I will own up that I took advantage of a situation and messed up by digging through his emails. 


But I really am hurt, Reddit. He told me he contacted her to get over the past, to get closure. I asked him if he really did miss her, to which he paused and replied ""I miss the idea of her, and that summer. But not actually her.""


The idea of her? You mean a girlfriend? Like the one sitting in front of you?


Long story short, I went home not really sure if I wanted to continue this relationship. I told him I'm not the type of girl to be some sort of rebound, a silver medal, or to be second place to anyone. That's just not me. And it's ironic because anytime an ex has contacted me to ""reconnect"", I'd tell him about it and we'd kind of just laugh about it together. I'd blow it off and never respond because they're all exes for a reason. But my own fucking boyfriend is one of those guys we'd laugh about. I don't believe in karma, but wow. I felt like such a dumbass afterwards.


Weeks later, we're still trying to get over our mutual breakage of trust. The only thing is - before this all happened, we had actually had a plan to go on vacation out on the West Coast to see some of his old internship friends. No, she wasn't invited as far as I know... but I told him I no longer wanted to go. The idea of even going makes me physically ill. It's a trip I've always wanted to take, but the idea is just tarnished to me now. We had planned to go out with another couple, but I can't see myself going without internally freaking out the entire time.


He doesn't want to go on the vacation without me, after I told him he should go on his own to not let down these friends he hasn't seen in three years. I can always do something else the week he's gone. He fears this would just create more of a wedge in our relationship, that this trip was always about my first experience out there, that he couldn't go if I wasn't. But now the couple who was going to go with us want to plan dates. I don't think either of us know what to say in this situation. He hasn't tried to guilt me into going, but I feel like if he doesn't go there will be lingering resentment. The trip would be in about six months, but I'm not sure I'll be fully emotionally over it by then.. especially since we're going to her state, her city, where she can pop up. I don't know how he'll react, I don't know how I'll react, I don't know what the trip would trigger for him.


Reddit, do I go? Swallow my fear and suck it up to go on a trip I used to always want to take? Or protect myself and risk him feeling resentful for not wanting to go?


TLDR; Was going on vacation with boyfriend to WestCoast. Turns out BF had tried to contact/misses ex from the state we'd go visit. Do I still go?"

so I recently interviewed for a sports marketing internship at my college. I'm fairly certain I'll be accepted, because they said that most of the interviewees do.

I have a dilemma however.

The internship program puts you in charge of a single sport and you work on marketing promotions for the season. However, since football is so big, everyone works this one. This means that during gamedays, I can't go to the game or tailgate. 

I've already bought season tickets for the next season, and I really want to go to the games because there are some huge games next year. 

However, I also don't want to miss out on this opportunity. I'm only a sophomore, so I guess I could go for it my junior or senior year when I'm not going to worry about the games as much, but I don't know.

Does anyone have any suggestions? "

I'm a fermentation science student at Oregon State University and I've been on the hunt for internships with the hopes of a full time position once I graduate next year. I've already made contact with a few breweries, small and large, and haven't had much luck. I've had one previous experience in the commercial setting when I shadowed for a month 5 years ago, but apparently that doesn't seem to help.

There are a few things I'm just not sure how to address when the time comes, especially as an intern. For compensation, I know there won't be much or any at all, but how would I address that? I'd gladly work for it elsewhere in the company such as tasting room or restaurant but then there would be the conflict of available positions there. Plus, there is the worry of insurance if I were to work for free as an intern.

Next thing, how has your company handled interns or volunteers regardless of education? For those of you who have jumped over these hurdles already could you please share your experience?

Finally, any tips on maintaining contact with HR or owners and making the best impression? I've mentioned my previous commercial experience, school, and homebrewing. In addition to that, does anyone have leads to a work opportunity? My ultimate goal is to work for the same company I intern at once I graduate.

Thanks in advance and cheers!"

33oke7,0,2015-04-24,"After 4.5 years, I reluctantly left the WP camp",theseph,windowsphone,https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/33oke7/after_45_years_i_reluctantly_left_the_wp_camp/,"I was there at the AT&amp;T store when the doors opened on the morning that the Samsung Focus was released here in the U.S.  I was the only one there for a Focus and I actually switched from Verizon because they weren't getting any WP phones in the foreseeable future.  

Since then I've owned a Lumia 900, 920, 1020, and 1520.   I've been a very vocal supporter of the Windows Phone platform.  I've created a couple of YouTube videos demonstrating some of the OSes amazing features and elegant design.    

The screen on my Lumia 1520 started going haywire.  It would sense phantom touches all across the screen, swipe through pages, open apps and was acting possessed.  It wouldn't happen all the time at first.  But then it started happening more and more frequently until it finally rendered my phone unusable.  

My frustration with that issues was like a magnifying glass on the app situation.  I hated that the official apps for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and a host of other official apps were complete rubbish.  Missing features, poor performance ... If they were even available at all.  

I finally had enough.  With the new larger iPhone screen sizes and the availability of MS apps like OneDrive, OneNote, Word, Xbox Music and others I decided to give the iPhone 6 Plus a try.

My few days of experience so far have been a lot more pleasant than I expected.

I still use all of Microsoft's services.  The Outlook app is awesome, the OneDrive app syncs my camera roll, I still have access to my Family Room calendar and notes.... I even added the Bing app to the far right side of the home screen tray so I can have my search button.  The only thing I'm missing as far as MS services is concerned is the Xbox Video app.   

What I don't like about iOS/iPhone:

- No back button
- Low resolution pics (they look fantastic, until you zoom in)
- Copy and paste require long presses 
- Text select is inferior
- Autocorrect is much better on WP
- OS design is very boring and old fashioned
- you can't pin deep links to apps on the home screen
- Counts on app icons show number of unread items rather than showing new items since the last time you glanced at items in the app....  Makes it really hard to look at the apps and know which one has new items... ""Did I have 16 unread emails last time I checked or 13 and now I have 3 more?""
- no live tiles!  


What I like about iOS/iPhone:

- buttery smooth, 1st class, feature rich apps from all companies that provide mobile apps for their services.  Not a single app is missing.  That void is completely gone.   Would I like to have 6tag and Nextgen Reader on my iPhone?  Yes, but I rather have all the other apps on here!  


While I miss the sleek Interface of WP, I realize now that the annoyances of iPhone when compared to WP are completely washed away by the sea of wonderful apps on this platform.   And really, apps are where I live most of my smartphone life.   

I am pleasantly pleased with my switch.   the only thing that will bring me back to Windows on a phone is if they become the premiere platform for developers and start getting 1st class apps instead of the garbage that most companies leave up to their interns to churn out on Windows right now.

33ole1,8,2015-04-24,Amazon changing SDE interns to SDET interns?,636f7574,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/33ole1/amazon_changing_sde_interns_to_sdet_interns/,"I have heard a few people claim that Amazon hired them specifically as SDE interns (as stated in their offer letter), only to later be told they would be working as an SDET intern, even if they were already placed on a team as an SDE. From what I've heard they are allowed to do this because when you apply, you have to select the ""SDE/SDET"" application and then choose which specific roles you would like to apply for. (Also, at will employment apparently allows companies do whatever they want in regards to things like this)   

Would it be logical to assume that if someone was hired as an SDE and still not placed at the point that people start being forcibly switched to SDET roles, that they would likely be switched as well to an SDET role?

Is there anyone here who this has happened to that would like to confirm/elaborate?

One last general question: How would employers react to seeing an SDET internship instead of and SDE internship at a big company when applying for a developer role?"

But I have no friends at all, and probably never will.  I'm gay, and my parents think I'm going to hell.  I'm not religious, but sometimes I feel like I'm going to hell too.  College has made me so cold and narcissistic.  I lost everything I liked about myself from high school.

I honestly don't give a single fuck about my studies anymore.  I don't care about anyone else at all.  I couldn't get close to someone because I refused to date them and insisted on FWB, which blew up completely.  I have sex with tons of random guys, and sex is the only thing I find interesting anymore.  I've lost all of my interests besides having sex with every guy I see and generally just being an asshole.

I used to be intensely emotional, but now I don't feel anything anymore.  I thought it was just growing up, but it's not.  My life is so empty and I've thrown away everything I was given.

I recently was in a position of responsibility and let a lot of people down and I'm feeling really bad about it.  You all probably hate me a little bit too.  

I always tried to push it down, but for a while I've felt like killing myself.  I don't do it because it's irrational and I know I should just walk away from everything.  But I still fantasize about it a lot.  Everyone would be better off if I were just dead"

Recently been stressing out about the prospects of going to B-school, worrying about being too old.

Currently pursuing a degree in B.sc. in Mech. engineering and next year will go for an M.sc. in Industrial Engineering (B.sc + M.sc. is required in my country to become an engineer, also gives me more time to get great internships.). Also, getting a degree in financial economics (only need the equivalent of 1.5 years of courses since I get credit from my engi courses aswell).

I have an internship this summer at a small HF.

Looking to eventually work in London (most realistic) or New York. 

How important is getting an MBA for advancing in IB and to compete with other grads?

I took 2 years off between HS and college (personal reasons) and will graduate when I am 26. Working the required 3-5 years will leave me at minimum age of 29 when I can apply.

Is 29 too old? Should I apply for jobs after my B.Sc instead of going for M.sc even though job prospects will be worse?

Thanks for any and all advice.

I'm a CS student from Europe. Soon I'm going to Texas for a summer internship at one of the big US banks. I've saved a bit of money for a wardrobe refresh, but I've realized I have no idea what clothing items to buy, even after reading a couple of guides and threads posted here. I'll list what I'm thinking about:

- A suit. I'm thinking navy blue, but maybe it should be black? How does [this](http://i.imgur.com/AAeoA2v.jpg) look? The sleeves and pants need to be shortened and the breast pocket thing is permanent.

- Shoes. I've got [these](http://i.imgur.com/snaaUlU.jpg) two [pairs](http://i.imgur.com/JQQHOAr.jpg) from River Island, but will they do? Should I get something like I'm wearing in the picture with the suit?

- Shirts. I've got five well-fitting shirts. Two light blue ones, one blue with white stripes and then there's two white ones that fit well, but they are too tight in the neck. I can post pictures of all of them if you'd like. I should get 1-2 additional white shirts.

- Pants. I've got nothing in this department. I've grown out of the ones I bought last year when I was pretty skinny. I don't know what kind to get. Are light chinos appropriate? I heard grey wool is universal, but this is Texas in the summer.

It's easy to find wardrobe advice for NYC interns / finance interns / IT interns at IT companies. I'm having a hard time picturing what I should wear as an IT intern at a Bank in Texas, considering the weather, my lack of knowledge about work culture over there and all. Any advice is welcome. Thanks!

Edit: I'm back from shopping (I've bought only casual clothes to wear after work). Thank you for all your suggestions. I've decided to contact the HR department and inquire about the appropriate outfit. If it weren't for your advice, I'd probably end up spending a lot on a suit and overdressing."
33pg0z,234,2015-04-24,What they didn't tell me about being a woman in a male dominated industry.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/33pg0z/what_they_didnt_tell_me_about_being_a_woman_in_a/,"I'm a young woman in an IT profession. It's my passion, it has been for as long as I can remember. I knew when I was 10 years old that this was the career for me. I've never struggled with it, I breezed through college with ease and never quite understood why women shied away from STEM careers. In school I was always treated with respect, I felt like I was an equal to my male peers, I was never put down or underestimated. I was never objectified or harassed for being a woman. Never, not once. 

I have been a working professional for 5 years now. My very first internship I experienced something I had not encountered before, an older man who approached me and wanted to take me out. I was 20, he was easily over 35. I politely declined, but despite that he found my phone number and all summer long consistently pestered me about going out with him. I told myself to push through the summer, it would be over soon, and since I so desperately wanted a full time offer from the company I was reluctant to go to HR. So I didn't. The summer ended, the man left me alone, and I was given the full time offer. 

But then, it happened again. With a different man. And again, and again, and again. And finally one day I was outright verbally sexually harassed at work, and before I could do something someone else who overheard went to HR. I got pulled into meetings, interrogated about the situation, and it absolutely scared the everliving fuck out of me. I worked so hard to get here, and now it felt like I was losing it... All because an older man harassed me.

Eventually the incident with HR faded. The man was not reprimanded. Life went on, until it happened again. An older man that I work with was caught by a coworker taking pictures of me with ill intent, and yet again I'm thrown into a frenzy of talking to HR. I am 24 years old and I now have two accounts of sexual harassment from an older male on my record with HR. And those two incidents do not even include the handful of times there were incidents something happened and I didn't go to HR. I have been in a committed relationship for 6 years. I come to work, do my job, mind my own business, and try to be as polite as I can. And yet I am constantly being harassed in the workplace by different men, all significantly older than me. I am not ugly, but I am not gorgeous. I'm just an average young woman. I want so badly to succeed and progress in my career. 

Went I went into this field I expected. to be strong armed by my male peers. I expected to work twice as hard just because I'm a woman. I expected to be called ""bossy"" and be stereotyped as catty and inept. I didn't expect to be harassed. I didn't expect to be sexualized by older men. I didn't expect to have this kind of record.

This is what they don't tell women who go into these fields. This is what you don't expect to battle. I am hurt, but I will not be suppressed. I will not give up, I will not give in. I will work three times as hard to succeed. And no matter what HR tells me, I will not be silenced. It should be know that this happens, it happens all the time. I will not stop fighting."

I want to do computer science /engineering and have got admitted into UIUC into computer science as well as CSE UMN . - ( at UMN CSE the major are declared only after freshman year and you have to get a 3.2GPA to be assured admission into the major of your choice).

My choice is obviously UIUC as it is so highly ranked in the US . I do want to do my OPT after graduation in the US for the allowable time ( currently 27 months ) and save money to do my masters. Being an international student I have to pay the full ticket which is $ 57 K per year for UIUC and $ 38 K per year for UMN and this is where I have an issue..

My dad is willing to sponsor from his savings the full cost for UMN for 4 years - approx. 190 K . His logic is that in case I have to do my masters - an undergraduate school should make not much difference in my career and people will look more at where I have done my grad school for. UMN is also a good school and if I grasp all the opportunities I should be in a position to get good internship/ OPT jobs as well as get into a reputed grad school later on.

But, I am extremely keen to go to UIUC. My logic to my dad was

a) is UIUC is rated 5 in computer engineering b) companies like Microsoft come regularly hiring at UIUC.( this is the information I could gather from the web ). So it will be easier and much more better if I could go to UIUC . c) the average salary for a UIUC computer engineer is around 72 K as compared to 56 K at UMN d) If I stay frugally I should be in a position to pay off the loan and save some amount for my masters as well. e) I have already got my desired major in UIUC whereas at UMN I will have to still work for it.

Looking at my enthusiasm he has asked me to take a private loan for 50 K to bridge the difference. In fact he has cosigned the loan and the loan is already sanctioned as well. He has also made it clear that in case there is an issue of me getting a job he will pay this amount from his retirement savings as well so that I do not get saddled with a burden at the start of my life. I obviously would not like this to happen and hence am looking for advice from you if my logical reasoning is correct.

With the decision day looming I have to make a choice - should I go in for UIUC and take the burden of a loan and follow my dreams or do I do what is more practical : join UMN and may be always have the regret later in life that if only .....

Please help urgently!!

PS issues of urban/ cold/ party school are not very important to me as compared to my career and whether a loan of 50 K is worth going to UIUC."

33pj58,2,2015-04-24,Developing an Off-Cycle Recruiting Strategy,Ames92,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/33pj58/developing_an_offcycle_recruiting_strategy/,"Hello all,

There are not a lot of resources* out there concerning off-cycle recruitment for management consultancies thus, I was hoping to use this post to:

1)	Understand how off-cycle recruiting works within your particular firm (ie. How are candidates found, When are slots made available)

2)	Determine how best to network to uncover these opportunities

3)	Develop a strategy to pursue a role in management consultancy off the traditional campus recruiting cycle.

-Personal Background:

Last summer, I interned and received an offer from a prestigious M&amp;A investment bank. In the fall, I declined the offer in order to pursue my interest in a role in consulting. I decided this because I am far more interested in working in the operations and strategy of a company and understanding how to best streamline business and create efficiencies, than working in financial engineering. 

I believe I have the appropriate credentials to pursue an opportunity in management consulting: 

1)	I earned a 3.7 GPA from a top-25 American university, along with honors in economics.

2)	I have relevant internships which gave me experience in handing large data sets and working with clients.

3)	I took leadership and founding roles in extra-curricular clubs at my university.

4)	I have international work experience in a junior year gap year along with second language fluency (Spanish).

In the fall, after declining the offer, I began networking and applying online to all the major consultancies. I understand I lost time by waiting until my offer expired, and unfortunately, I did not receive any communications from many of the firms I applied to and was only formally invited to one interview (which I learned from).

I graduated in December and have been doing part-time due diligence work and traveling since then. I have returned from a long planned post-grad trip with my girlfriend and I am looking to continue pursuing a role in MC.

I wanted to ask your advice on how best to network to find opportunities. For example, I understand networking is important, but how do you do it in a manner that will produce opportunities. Secondly, any advice on how to approach firms and recruiters is also welcome.

Thank you. I understand most of you guys are pretty busy and certainly appreciate any insight you can provide which might help.

I sometimes like to look through these because it's interesting to read bug reports from 1996, and you sometimes find gems like pictures of cross dressing coworkers. One folder looked like a backup of someone's 'My Pictures' folder, and under that was a folder full of images that were screenshots of Firefox's 'Saved Passwords' window. Here were the username and password of this guy's Facebook, work computer, *bank accounts*, all sorts of random stuff. He still works here in a relatively high up position. Now, this picture is five years old, but judging by the fact that a lot of the passwords were reused, I'm guessing a lot are still valid.

Why it's complicated: Even though this was in a folder accessible to everyone, even a lowly intern, it still feels like personal data. It's mostly pictures of his family including his young and teenage daughters, and I feel bad that I was rummaging around through it.
Should I tell him about it or just delete these password files?

Sometimes, I start the day great and well... it ends up like a sad day.

I hear all my friends talk about going to their dream schools or being accepted to some elite school, and then there is me, who didn't even get into the state school for some damn reason. I am stuck with community college and it makes me sad because almost everyone goes to some 4 year university and I feel like I'm being looked down upon because of it.

Also, there is my grandfather, who was a small part of my 17 years on this earth. Sometimes, I wish he came back but I know he won't be here in my home anymore. I am still trying to cope with him not being with us anymore (he died two months ago due to various health complications), especially since he lived with my family for a long time.

I get worried about this summer. I really hope I get this internship at NASA this summer, but it might look bleak too. I already got 4 rejections out of the 11 so I just hope I get into one.

I was really looking forward to getting to go to Bronycon. In fact, I was hoping to lose weight just so that I can get a cosplay down, but when I told my mom about going to the con with a friend we both met in Houston, she told me ""you shouldn't waste your time on that"" and thought I was crazy for liking a girl thing. At first, she really didn't care about it, but it seems that she's all disliking the whole con thing. I told her about NYCC too and she wasn't fond into that at all.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I just dream of cuddling someone I love to help me, but it seems that I can't even cover the pain and sadness anymore. I sound like I am complaining but I really don't know what to do."

I have been accepted into two colleges in the US, [Gettysburg College](http://www.gettysburg.edu/) and the more well-known [New York University](http://www.nyu.edu/). My problem is that I cannot decide which college I want to attend. To better inform you, heres a breakdown of the facts -

______________

My major- Computer Science.


Gettysburg - 5 hours from home and will cost around 16,000$ (which my parents will be paying in full) a year after I received a 44,000$ grant from them. A great school for history related majors, and is ranked among the top liberal arts schools in the nation. Attending this school will leave me with no debt after college, but could be harder to find a higher paying job with a degree from here. The starting salary of a Gettysburg graduate is about 55,000.

 

NYU - Only an hour from home, but will cost me personally 28,000$ and thus will leave me 113,000$ in debt after college. The benefits are the amazing experience of living in NYC during college, the internship opportunities, and the chance of getting a very high paying job immediately after my graduation. The average starting salary of a NYU graduate is 75,000.


My ideas- I love NYU and would go there in a heartbeat if the price was lower. Gettysburg is also a very nice school, and I think I could be happy there, but NYU is my dream school.

So my question to you is, does it really make sense to go to NYU instead of Gettysburg? Does the NYU degree really make up for all of the debt? What should I do?

Thank you for all of your help!"
33pufy,1,2015-04-24,Not Alone,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/33pufy/not_alone/,"Wasn't sure if this was the right place to post this, it'd be great if someone pointed me in the right direction if it's not. Also pardon any and all grammar problems, I am also hooman. 

This past month has been pretty rough and my friends had started to catch on and question what was wrong with me. I'm deathly afraid of opening up to others and every time I do, I always break down into tears and it's difficult trying to spit out words when that happens. So here I am, six hours later with the story of my life, my phone, my computer and a cup of apple juice. Not going to lie, it was extremely difficult for me trying to put my train of thought to words because these are the precious memories I've always held to myself and I may or may not have teared up in the process. Also, this was definitely written for my friends and family in mind as my audience but I started to think about the bigger picture while I made this (as is present at the end). 

Either you know me or you don't, some of you think you might, but you don't. In one way or another, willing or unwilling, knowing or unknowingly, you've helped me to become the person I am today. Personality wise, I'm kind of a self righteous a-hole who needs to ALWAYS be right because I usually am, right? Nah, but those who have already met me know that.

As I've already told two of my best friends, Tom and Erin, abandonment issues be as real as global warming. Now this issue stems off from all sorts of events that have taken place in my life: the loss of my grandpa when I was 9; when I lost my uncle at the age of 11; when the constant fights between my, divorced, parents made me to believe that there was no such thing as true love; when everyone grew up and left me in the past as we all went into high school; when you're called fat all your life by your own parents and family, although I am on the plus side, what can I say, I'm a lazy bum who likes food; when your own blood mother thinks you're feigning sickness to skip school and kicks you out of the house for doing so; when you open up to your one and only best friend but thing's just don't work out and faith in humanity is forever lost.

Now I won't go and say I've had a rough upbringing, cause I didn't. Parental figures worked hard to raise two children and weren't in the picture all the time due to working their asses, pardon the language, off to provide us with all that we had, for that I am grateful for. Spoiled rotten, surrounded by the friends and family who loved and put up with my childish antics, life was perfect. The once perfect life started to tear at the seams when confronted with loss for the first time, Rest in peace ong noi (grandpa in vietnamese, I think...). Growing up, you're a sponge that absorbs everything you hear and see from your surroundings. As a child of divorced parent's I can remember the numerous fights, arguments, and tears shed, this pained me to no end. Now faced with all the confusion of loss and sorrow, I've come to find myself at a standstill when faced with yet another loss of family. Getting a little pg-13 here, but the one I held most dear was found lifeless in his new home of less than a year old. Now I didn't mention how either family member was lost, but it was brought on by a deep depression that reaped their beautiful souls a little too soon. Now I cared and had love for all my family, but my uncle Minh was a different story. Like a father figure, a many hours were spent together doing family type things with my uncle. Of course it wasn't just he and I, my sister, cousin Landon and my ever so adorable cousin Aria would spend the day at the park, having a barbecue or just hanging out at the condo playing video games together. The hardest part about the loss of my uncle is knowing that his two young girls will grow up not knowing how great of a man their father was. You think you may know someone, but in a single blink of an eye they could be gone for the rest of your life, hold on to those you cherish and never let go. For my great uncle who should haunt or smile down on us from the after life, you have my greatest respects and you shall never be forgotten as long as I live another day.

Alright, now that I'm all teary eyed, I'll move onto the next phase in my past life, high school! Everyone grows up and goes their own separate ways but damn was I not ready for when ALL of who I thought were my friends left me for naught and went lickity split after a single summers time. I guess they're not all to blame, it's not exactly like I tried all too hard to hold on to them or anything like that. Moving onward to sophomore year, down with the sickness I caught swine flu! Yum. Long story short, mother figure thought I was pretending to be sick and kicked me out of the apartment! Sweetness, as I have a somewhat good memory, I can vividly live through that dreary day when I was awoken by the yells of my crazy third world asian mom and the bald mofo, that is still with her to this day, breaking into my locked room and dragging me to school. That's cool, went to school and got sent home for being sick, go figure. I actually walked to my crazy uncles place just down the road (maybe he picked me up, that part is a little fuzzy) and started mooching off him for a while. Depression hit harder than ever and I was raced to the ER to get my sickness checked out. No, I didn't do anything like slit my wrists or take attempts at my life, I was just diagnosed with swine flu and hibernated for the winter of 2009. Oh gosh, I remember going to school one day and EVERYONE in my classes looked at me like I was dead or something, being passed out in the middle of class doesn't really help my case I guess. Not a whole lot of people know this, but I used to write, like a lot. Not the merry go happy stories, but something in the domain of suicide notes. Abandoned and left for dead, I did what any asian does best, internetz. I spent a prolonged amount of time filling the void with the false relationships created over the interwebs to help dampen all the pain that had been built up and finally burst. I met a great friend this way (George) and wouldn't change the past for anything. Having been at my wits end with being indoors day in and day out, cured of swine flu, I sought my school adviser to see what I could do about my school situation. Handed to me on a silver platter was the opportunity to further my education and graduate on time by attending Options high school. Now going to Options was MY choice and was frowned upon by both parental units. Now some people know this little school of seven portables to be the school where all the troubled and high school drop outs are sent so they can be kept off the streets, but I found this place to be my salvation and home. With every teacher and principal at my back pushing me towards my goal, I who had once dropped out of school had come to graduate and walk the stage with my fellow peers to be part of the graduating class of 2012. Nobody said it was a cake walk, I sought a therapist for my depression, took meds, had teachers pick me up for class in the morning so I would actually go, stayed late after school to make up for the lost time all while building a new family. I can easily name multiple occasions where each and every teacher at Options has lent me a hand or two, but that would take forever and ain't nobody got time to read or write an autobiography like that! Leslie (greatest improv teacher, EVER), Carrie (slept through most of her classes and she was still kind enough to help me pass with a C-. Bless your soul for your loss and I hope all is well for you and your bright children), Jami (without this lady, I'd have never graduated high school), Lynn (totally tried to hook me up with her daughter, but being the great mother she is she took care of everyone, myself included), Dawn (this woman is chalk full of stories and can brighten up anybodies day), Michelle (the sole reason why I was able to seek help for my depression), Jane (the most vibrant science teacher out there and put up with my know it all attitude during her classes), Steve (this man has a knack for food and much much more. Although the jokes were corny, many laughs were had), Gigi (where do I even start about this fine lady? They will never find someone to fill in the shoes that she once wore). Each and every one of you, thank you again for everything you've done for me throughout high school and after.

Alright, now with all the sappy stuff out of the way I am absolutely inclined to tell you about how I took improv and it changed my entire perspective on life. Not only has improv helped me in my everyday life but it was the necessary component during my high school life as well. Improv started out as just another elective choice in school, but grew to be the space where I met some great people and added another branch to my family. Most people would rather die than make a public speech, so how would you feel if you got shipped off to Olympia Washington to speak to state representatives about the importance of drop out prevention programs like Communities In Schools? Well, I'd tell you that I didn't do all too bad but I did stutter every time I had to bring up how improv helped me improve my public speaking skills. That was embarrassing. Moving right along. Through school and our mutual interest in improv, I met my good friend Maggie. One whom I held most dear to me and the one I turned to when things started to turn side ways again, my best friend. Here's a funny story I've never told anyone until now, before we got to know each other and I unveiled my mysteries tragedies, I told her that our friendship wouldn't last longer than high school so she promised me that wouldn't happen. In a way she was right, we were best of friends until after high school but things had become rocky and our once bright friendship has become one of the past. Now I didn't want to bring this up because this is supposed to be about the various stories of my life, but this is also part of my story and I need to say it, sorry Kevin! Kevin is an obnoxious a-hole who knows how to get under my skin, but he's one of my best friends nonetheless. This a-hole was dating our mutual friend at the time, Maggie, but like most relationships stuff happens and it fell through. Now Kevin is a mysterious creature who always keeps to himself and doesn't open up to people very easily. This butt head closed himself off to everyone and fell into a deep slumber of depression. Now I can't say it was an absolutely terrible thing that they broke up because unlike me, he now has that experience and can grow from it, but maybe next time he'll actually say something to me when he decides to throw away a chunk of his life and hide his head in the dirt like an ostrich. Sorry bud, you're still a friend I hold most dear.

Now throughout high school I fancied myself some good ol' cookin. I took to culinary over at BTC after graduating high school and found it to be much more of a challenge than expected. Unfortunately I ended up dropping out and didn't finish but it's an experience that will never be forgotten and when I so choose like it, I'll go back and pick up where I left off. Again, a new chapter started and a many impressions left on my soul. I thank my funny mexican buddy Seim from the culinary program for helping me get my first job in the industry at the international house of pancakes AKA e-hop, oops, I mean ihop, inside joke. Funny story, I met someone I liked while working at ihop and asked her out, but she just wasn't down for a hopeless romantic like myself. She ended up going out with a dude who broke her heart and now we're just good friends, I guess that's karma for ya. What I learned, it wont hurt you to throw yourself out there cause you never know what'll happen until you just do it and stop with the over thinking and making things so complicated. Got a little off topic there so I'll bring it back to when I went to Spain, that's right, you heard me, Spain. Nobody but the people I worked with in spain knows this story, but I'll tell you now. Working in this industry is equally physical and mentally exhausting, near the end of my stint at the winery, I had been over stressed and simply broke down, not to mention I had actually at one point blacked out on the job from dehydration. Skipping forward just a little bit, I finished my internship at the winery, went and ventured to paris, northern germany and back to barcelona. Going back to trust issues, the man whom I had been rooming with the entire summer while doing my internship and had become like a brother to me while I stayed overseas had betrayed that trust, for what, a girl he had only just met? priorities. 

With that chapter in life closed up, I've started a new as a sushi chef and will continue to see what the future has is store for me. I've met and spoken with a many folks who've gone through depression like myself and the one key thing they keep telling me is how strong I am. It's a funny thing, living and struggling with depression everyday. Some days I just want to jump off the deep end but what holds me back are the people I've met, the opportunities unknown to me and just knowing that if I took my life, I'd just end up starting a new cycle; it'd create another sorrow in someone's life. I'll continue to live for my lost ones and continue on for myself, even if I'm the only one I can trust and believe in. Again, I just want to thank everyone who has ever left an imprint on my soul and my current friends who have held me together during this past month where I could no longer hold myself together and started to question myself again; Tom, Kevin, Laura, and my wifey, Erin. Not actually my wife, another inside joke.

Oh and for those of you who might be thinking that I'm a sensitive cry baby, just keep doing you, cause I'm just going to keep doing me. I can't and will not let depression hold me back and let it define who I am. For those of you who have that stormy little cloud in the back of your mind, know that you are not alone. Thanks for lending an ear to a lonely asian rant and may my words reach out to those in need of them, like they did for me. 


This is 100% me and why I did not use a throwaway account.

33pyuz,1,2015-04-24,Why life is actually a hell I can't escape. I really hope someone reads this; because I have no one to tell it to.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/33pyuz/why_life_is_actually_a_hell_i_cant_escape_i/,"I have been slowly posting parts of this; but I typically delete it because I don't want any affected person to see it.

So long story short I am late twenties and divorced.  I had children with my ex (again I am not being specific, but I will say no more than 3).  To be honest the first was a surprise so we got married.  We grew up from less than ideal households so neither of us were ideal adults yet.  We had been together for a really long time though (think highschool sweethearts) To be honest I was the furthest from being the adult of the relationship, as I carried some of the abusive mentalities my dad had taught me and I had not yet became man enough to leave those behind.

So long story short to catch any still interested up, I went to school and worked while she took care of our oldest.  We were trying our hardest to make things work and knew we wanted more children without letting them get to spread out in age.  So we had the kids just so they could be around the same age.  It was during this period that I went through anger management and started cleaning my part up.  I started working full time and going to class full time.  Then I started an internship so I dropped to part time at the other job while keeping a full school load.

Now this is all necessary to understand what follows.  While I fixed my act I think anyone can understand she was definitely hurt from it all.  Hurt enough that there wasn't really fixing it emotionally.  So she started cheating emotionally online.  I found out and began to scramble to hold my life together.  I was early twenties at this time and trying to graduate, while looking at the possibility of losing my kids.  I didn't handle it all the best, but I tried to and learned through the process.

I finally graduate, and she is pushing for divorce.  She wants to move out of state.  I know at this time she will stop me from moving to a good job in my field to take care of the kids financially if I don't let her move.  She goes to Florida to visit a ""friend"".  I know its a lie.  I know she is visiting a boyfriend (on my paycheck which hurt the most).  She comes back and is more affirmed to move.  So I let her, as much as it kills me.  I let her because I realize how much I love her, and I want her happy.  I let her because I know I can't take care of the kids financial future staying where we were.  (Divorce custody laws would prohibit me moving for joint custody, and she would get to move with sole custody anyways).  I lose all the time with the kids, because I can't afford to fly them back.  I can't go for primary custody because at that time I didn't have a solid enough financial standing to put them in daycare while I worked.  I am stuck with the crippling student loan debt that I racked up to take care of a family.  (60k at the moment).  

I get to watch my kids grow up on facebook now.  I want to kill myself because I don't want to be forced to see what I am missing, but I cant because they still need me; not just emotionally when I am able to see them but financially so they don't have to live in poverty like I did.

So I live this shitty life. But I finally convince myself I don't need my ex.  I convince myself I don't love her.  I convince myself I just have been victim of my own bad choices, and I just need to go out and be a bad ass.  I convince myself one day I will get my kids back.  I just need to work really fucking hard.  I need to focus on my career so I can take care of my kids financially.  And be there for their future.  

At this point I start making a decent amount of money.  When the ex calls and asks for more money than I offer in child support I give it to her.  Because at this point I have nothing of a personal life.  I work, and I save.  I work and save to support my kids.  If the kids need money, then I need to work more and save more.

I start worrying about my ex.  She may be my ex but I know her better than I know anyone else.  I may know her better than her own family does.  She doesn't seem happy and everything I had done to this point is to waste if she's not happy because that means the kids won't be at the maximum happiness that they can be at.  She tells me she is great; but she can't convince me. 

Then she announces she is getting married and is pregnant.  It hurts a lot, and the feelings come rushing back; but I leave the situation reaffirmed in the fact that I just need to work hard.  I keep trying to convince myself that I don't love her.

Then a few months go by.  She texts me.  She misses me.  She regrets her decision.  She affirms that she wasn't happy when I called, and she is surprised that I could pick it out.  She wants to talk about getting back with me.

I know better... I do.. But I want my kids back.  I let my emotional barriers down and the feelings rush in.  And at that point I had tried to get back in the dating scene but no one can seem to reach me emotionally like she can.  No one seems to understand my wants and needs.  So against my best judgement her and I get involved.

She has her new kid.  She kind of goes cold.  Then she rewarms up, then goes cold again.

I reach out to her.  At this point the potential of having my kids back is in view; but its uncertain.  Now I want it more than anything.  Even if it means separating another kid from their father so I can be back with my kids.  I love my children's new sibling like my own anyways.

She tells me what I already knew would happen.  She won't leave the new guy because there is no way she would get 100% custody like she did with our kids.  She isn't self sufficient enough.  In essence, shed rather let me down then risk losing time with one of her kids.  I understand... He's loaded as well so even a good lawyer would only be combated with a good lawyer.

She wants to make sure I am not upset, and she says she is kind of happy it all happened because it helped her forgive me and close ties.  It helped her understand where she went wrong in the previous relationship.  But now she needs to start doing right.

I tell her I had already forgave her.  I tell her I already knew what I did wrong.  I tell her what kills me most is... Then I stop... Because I remember it doesnt matter what kills me.  She wont leave him for me.  Telling her what kills me will only make her feel worse.  So not only do I feel like shit BUT I AM ALONE TO FEEL LIKE SHIT.

**(TLDR also starts here)** So this is why life is a living hell.

I can't bare to watch my kids grow up on facebook, but I cant leave because they need me.

I can't win back the person I love because I am broke because of the situation we put me in.

Shes told me she wouldn't have left if she wouldn't have gotten 100% custody, which means in time everything would have fixed itself if I hadn't let her leave.  At the very least I wouldn't feel empty without kids and the person I love.  But I couldn't convince myself to be selfish like that... I was afraid it would adversely affect them in too many ways.

But because I tried to find the best outcome for everyone; I found the worst outcome for me.

I want to tell her how I feel...  I want to show her this, but I know it won't fix anything.  It will only make her feel guilty.

I hate living in hell, but I can't escape it. "

33q6uk,9,2015-04-24,Incoming non-traditional CS student. What can I do for work over the summer?,squarecompass,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/33q6uk/incoming_nontraditional_cs_student_what_can_i_do/,"Hello all,

**Here's my situation:** I left a job a couple of months ago due to some company culture/management issues. I'm currently unemployed, and decided to go back to school for a CS degree. I have a 2-year degree in IT, so I will be transferring in as a sophomore.

I'm self-taught for the most part and have a general/basic (if a bit rusty) understanding of OOP from the Java class I took. I've tinkered around with Python, C(++, #), JavaScript, Batch/Bash, etc also. However, as I won't start until Fall, I haven't taken any CS classes like algorithms, data structures, etc.

**Here's the issue:** In the past, I have tried to balance part-time work &amp; school before but performance in both suffered. Thus, I want to focus exclusively on school beginning this Fall. So even with 2-3 years of IT experience, it seems impossible to find a position knowing I'll be dropping it at the end of August. But another 4 months is a long time to go unemployed. While I do have to look out for myself, I don't want to waste employer's resources on-boarding somebody with short-term intentions.

With my experience and knowledge, would it be possible to find an internship? Is that even an option since I haven't started classes yet? Should I seek full-time anyway? 

Otherwise, what are my options at this point?"

33qkgy,1,2015-04-24,HR scenario Help - GA (Long),[deleted],AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/33qkgy/hr_scenario_help_ga_long/,"X Company is a dealership located in Covington, Georgia. The dealership contains 106 employees. Joe Reek is the owner and General Manager. X Company contains 20 sales associates, 4 service administrators, 15 car tech’s, and 1 service manager.  The service manager reports directly to Joe Reek. Like most dealerships, tech’s at X Company are paid based off of a flat-rate pay system, which means that the tech’s are paid by each job. The dealership uses a commercially available reference guide  to determine the amount of time expected to do general repair work.  If the work is estimated to take 4 hours based on national statistics, the technician is paid for 4 hours, regardless of how much time it actually takes.   For instance, if the job is estimated to take an hour but requires four, the employee is paid for only one hour. However, if the job takes only 45 minutes, the employee still receives an hour's pay. For technicians who work quickly and efficiently, a flat-rate pay system can be lucrative.  X Company pays apprentice technicians $20 per flat-rate hour, junior technicians $30 per flat-rate hour, and senior technicians $40 per flat-rate hour.  The top technicians can make $1,900 per week. 

Joe Reek has outsourced many compensation activities to ADP, but he takes care of the other HR functions.  Unfortunately, Reek may be over his head since the dealership is facing some major problems related to two previous employees.  He needs the advice of an HR expert to understand his options. 


Allen Muse

X Company hired Allen Muse as an apprentice technician in November 2011.  In December 2012, he was promoted to junior technician.  Six months later, he learned that his coworkers made an average of 50% more than he for the same number of hours worked.  He complained to Joe Reek about the disparity in pay and asked for an immediate pay increase to establish equity. Muse argued that the jobs are equivalent and noted that he is the only Latino.   Reek explained that Muse is paid less for several reasons:  his coworkers are “Senior Technicians,” they have more experience, and they work faster. From Muse’s perspective, they all do the same thing, work the same number of hours, and are held to the same standards.  Muse was unhappy with Reek’s explanation but said nothing more since he needed his job.

A month later, Reek’s 15-year-old son, Tyler, was helping in the service department.  His dad hired Tyler as an unpaid automotive technician intern for the summer.  Reek hoped his son would take over the business one day.  Moreover, he thought the internship would keep Tyler out of trouble.  Tyler worked 8:30 – 4:00 Monday through Friday and 7:00 – 5:00 on Saturday.  He spent most of his time cleaning the shop and moving cars.  

Muse and the other technicians thought Tyler was a big distraction.  He was constantly horsing around and getting in the way.  Of course, no one said anything since he was the owner’s son.   On July 15, 2013, Tyler let his 15-year-old girlfriend sit behind the steering wheel while he was washing a customer’s car.  The girl accidently hit the accelerator.  The car ran over Tyler’s foot, jumped the wall, and drove into a pond.  The car was totaled and Tyler was rushed to the hospital with a crushed foot.  As you can imagine, Reek was distraught over his son’s injury.   While surgeons were trying to save Tyler’s foot, Reek was receiving text messages from a local newspaper reporter asking about the accident. The next day, the accident was front page news complete with photos.  But wait!  There’s more!!  
Two days later, OSHA showed up at the dealership, unannounced, to investigate the accident. Reek had to leave his son’s bedside to deal with the OSHA inspector.  Imagine his outrage when Reek learned that the newspaper learned about the accident from one of Reek’s employees. Apparently, Muse had posted photos of the accident on his Facebook page with sarcastic commentary, including: “What happens when you have an incompetent manager running things.”  He confronted Muse about the posting, but Muse was unapologetic stating that it was his private Facebook page and “It’s none of your business!”  Reek fired Muse on the spot shouting, “How can you be so heartless after everything I’ve done for you?”

One day after he was fired, Muse filed an EEOC complaint based on national origin and filed a lawsuit claiming BB illegally invaded his privacy. 
   
Gaby Frost

Gaby had worked for BB for almost three years until she was fired after refusing to attend four sales meetings.  She had a great first year making almost $70,000.    However, the second year she only made $30,000 and for the first four months of 2014, she made less than $2,400 despite working an average of 50 hours per week.  Before she was fired in June 2014, Gaby had not sold a car in six weeks.  Monthly sales were posted in the sales manager’s office for all to see.  Thus, all of her coworkers knew about her poor performance.  

Overall, BB’s sales were down 15% from a year ago.  During the same period nationally, Buick’s U.S. car sales had fallen 18%.  Reek believed that his salespeople could benefit from training and hired a motivational coach. 

On May 21, 2014, the motivational coach implemented his new program to increase sales.  Every morning, before the salespeople went on the showroom floor, there was a 15-minute meeting.  The meetings had a pep rally atmosphere, with yelling, chanting, and cheering.  Every Monday, the top salesperson for the previous week received a standing ovation and a $200 bonus.  The salesperson with the worst record the previous week was required to sing “I’m a Loser” by the Beatles and clean the employee bathrooms.   

Gaby had the worst record for the first two weeks of the new program, but she refused to participate in what she described as a “humiliating and sexist” exercise.  Moreover, she argued that cleaning the bathrooms was “disgusting and unhealthy.”   It should be noted that on April 30, 2014, she informed Reek that she had Mysophobia (fear of germs) after he threatened to fire her after noticing that Gaby was refusing to shake the hands of customers.  

She refused to attend the next three morning meetings.  Instead, she sat at her desk in the showroom.  She was told in writing that another absence would result in immediate dismissal.  The next day (Thursday), she again refused to attend the “pep rally.” Gaby was fired and furnished a separation notice that contained the following reason for her separation:  INSUBORDINATION

The day before she was fired, Gaby contacted the EEOC claiming gender and disability discrimination.   After she was fired, she added retaliation and harassment to her EEOC complaint and filed a lawsuit accusing BB of intentional infliction of emotional distress.  

GUIDELINES


1.	Is Muse likely to win any of the following claims: invasion of privacy or discrimination based on national origin?  

2.	Is Gaby likely to win any of the following claims:  intentional infliction of emotional distress, discrimination based on gender or disability, retaliation, or harassment?  

3.	Should I be worried about any FLSA violations?

Any recommendations for a 8GB (2x4GB) set?,[deleted],apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/33qlyy/looking_to_purchase_3rd_party_ram_for_my_mid2009/,"After receiving my MBP from Apple repair, they replaced the ram with what ram originally came with my MBP when I bought it. They had my old Kingston ram in a separate package, which had failed a hardware test (hence the replacement). My mom inadvertently threw it out this past week, and with that, the chance of using the company's lifetime warranty to get some new sticks from them. 

I've done some research, and found that, on Amazon, [Crucial](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008LTBJFM/ref=psdc_172500_t2_B001PS9UKW) has some relatively inexpensive ram, compared to what [Kingston](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) is now selling their units at.

Is there a company I should stay away from? Even though Crucial is the cheapest, I know they get some praise from their SSDs.

I can't sleep, even after working a 13 hour shift. I need help badly, and I have no one to talk to about this. Please give me your input, even if it is harsh; I just absolutely need help.

I guess I'll start by stating the obvious: I'm a piece of shit. I am [29/m], married to a [29/f] for 5 years, and we've been together for 10. We have a one year old baby. I'm going to try to break this down to make it a little easier to read:

1.) I was raised a conservative Christian, but I was a very rebellious teen. At age 19, I had a mental breakdown. I was at rock bottom, thinking I'd never be able to have a normal life (I turned out fine). I couldn't even get off the couch. At the time, I viewed this as punishment for my bad deeds. While I was at my most vulnerable, I met my wife at a church function. She is beautiful, sweet, and she shared the exact same religious belief system. I believed this to be divine intervention. I was honest with her about my history, but I straightened up, and I acted like a good Christian to impress her, but I was not being deceitful, I full heartedly believed in what I was doing. I forced a personality change in myself.

2.) We got married, and everything was fine. I obtained 2 college degrees, and I had many internships and jobs that exposed me to the ugliness of the world, but also a variety of different belief systems. My belief in a literal translation of the Bible faded away. I still identify as a Christian, but a very liberal one. My wife's beliefs remain the same, and if I told her of my newfound beliefs, she, her family, and my family would flip out. I've internalized my beliefs that are based on scientific fact and reason. My wife has many positive qualities, however she can be harsh, ignorant, has low frustration tolerance, and is very task-oriented. She is boring. Although I compromise with her and feel that I am fair, I do not bend an inch to her will when she is being unreasonable, and this upsets her. I am reasonable, but not passive. I also feel like an asshole for saying these things, but it's the truth.

3.) I enter another college program. One known for being time consuming, strenuous, and intense. I work a lot while in school, and I have a baby to help raise. He is my only source of true joy and happiness. I love him more than I ever knew was possible. During the program, I meet Sarah [39/f], who is also married, and has kids. Sarah is very attractive, and we are partners on school projects. Sarah is very shy, anxious, and neurotic. I joke a lot to break the ice, which turns into mutual flirting, but we believed we were just joking and having fun. We remained friends and became close, and about a year later, we started carpooling to school to save money and stay awake. The flirting was over with mostly, but we confided in each other about a lot. I realize she has many qualities that my wife doesn't, which is totally unfair and shitty. Right before our final semester (the one ending right now), I suddenly realized I had strong feelings for her, which sickened me because I believed I was not the type of person that would be attracted to another woman besides my wife. During that same time period, I realize that my personality had changed, and I was no longer the good fundamentalist Christian my wife knew. I love her, but I was unsure if I was in love with her, and I still feel that way. I wonder if I've made a mistake by marrying her. I fell into a deep depression, barely being able to get off the couch once I was home from school/work.

4.) Graduation is getting closer, and about halfway through the semester Sarah is distraught. She tells me she is extremely upset that we'll never see each other again. She is crying constantly, her anxiety is worsened, and she can barely eat. I am also very upset. We had become too close without even realizing it. Neither one of us thought we would ever be involved in an emotional affair like this. Never in a million years. 

5.) One night after class, several of us go out for drinks. I had a panic attack during class that night due to things unrelated to this situation. I had a couple of shots and beers because I forgot my medication at home. On the way back, Sarah and I are discussing these confusing feelings we've been having towards each other. I finally admit my feelings towards her, and she says she feels the same way towards me. This initially brought relief for both of us because we'd been holding it in. We talk for a while, and are both extremely upset. Over the next few days, we talk constantly trying to figure this out. I cry for the first time in over a decade.

6.) Last night after class, we sat talking about all of this in the car, trying to figure this situation out. We decide the right thing to do is to no longer speak to each other, at least for a while, so we could work on our marriages. Somehow though, we end up sitting in the cargo area of her SUV, holding each other tightly and desperately, not wanting to let go. I'm ashamed to say that this is the happiest moment I've had in years, besides my son's birth and milestones. It felt right, even though I knew it was wrong. She said the same, and that I made her feel safe. I have to leave to go to work. We embrace, I walk back to my car, and she follows me. We embrace again, tighter this time, for over and minute, standing in place, swaying back and forth, as she cries on my shoulder. We did not kiss or do anything sexual, but what we did was inappropriate. Nothing has changed, and she has been trying to think of ways for us to still see each other, even after graduation. 

Reddit, I do not want to rip our families apart. I know I need to stop. But, why did it feel so right? What the hell am I supposed to do with my wife that will never change her views that cause conflict. What the hell am I supposed to do with her nagging and self-centeredness? I guess now I'm the selfish one. Last night, I got 4 texts from her during class in a span of 10 minutes, telling me all the things I'd done wrong at home. Stupid things like not putting towels in just the right place, accidentally leaving a soda can out, etc. 

Do I live with this the rest of my life? It seems like the right thing to do, but I hate to admit it, but I will be miserable. I'm not even talking about leaving my wife for Sarah, I'm just referring to my own happiness. I have no clue what to do, and I have no one to talk to about this. I'm a selfish asshole, redditors. Ream me a new one, I deserve it, but please at least give me some advice or direction. Thanks you

**TL;DR - Did I marry the right woman? My belief system changed. I'm having an emotional affair. What the hell do I do?**

**Edit: It's fine to downvote me, but please give me some kind of feedback.**

**Thank you all for your feedback. It means a lot because I'm unable to think clearly. I will respond to as many comments as possible when I have time in a few hours**"

As a result, I laugh. I've seen and heard myself talking with this nervous laugh and I've always hated it. I've become more aware of it now that I'm older and it's really only bad if I'm uncomfortable. I can suppress it as long and I'm paying attention to it. During my graduate internship however, I was expected to hold a family conference for one of my clients. I wasn't sure what to expect so of course I was extremely nervous and I laughed a lot. After the conference my supervisor asked me to come into her office to talk to me about ""something"". I went in and she said, ""I just wanted to make you aware that when you get nervous you laugh a lot. You might want to try to control that because it makes you come across as insecure and that you don't know what you're doing."" Which is exactly how I feel when I'm in an uncomfortable social situation and I'm not sure what to say or do. As long as I know what I'm doing, I'm fine. But when I do something for the first time, I'm going to be nervous and I will probably laugh....

When I'm in a new situation, I don't think I can really avoid feeling uncomfortable... I never know what to expect unless I've experienced it before. But in the work environment, I need to always appear like I know what I'm doing... even if I don't. So I guess I should devise another way (other than laughing) to help me get through it so that I don't come across as unprofessional. Anyone have experience with this or can maybe give me some tips on how to cope with this type of situation??"

Afterwards I realized, noticing the elaborateness of his story, that he most likely was lying.

Last night a homeless women came to the door and asked to use the restroom. My intuition didn't trust her but I let her in regardless. My supervisors ended up having to ask her repeatedly to come out of the bathroom, she was being very unresponsive and was most likely not sober. She eventually came out, tried to get us to give her shoes, and then pretended like she lost something and wandered throughout the building.

This summer, I chose to transfer to a different location of that company. They've accepted my transfer, and are going to be getting me the rest of the details early next week, namely pay. 

My transfer is going to a higher cost of living area. Obviously, it's also rather late in the year to be finding a new job, so I don't have any other offers to base a negotiation off of (though I have lots of friends with similar internships in the area). 

To my understanding, 95% of the other interns at that company's location will be fresh interns, who will require a decent amount of training into the company's code base. Having worked at that company for two years, I won't need said training. 

My ""worst case"" is that they try to offer me the same pay as my current location. Expected case is the same pay as the other interns, best case is they take into consideration my experience and offer me more.

How should I go about negotiating, since I'm coming as a transfer, rather than a direct applicant? "

I know that in my field (computer science) internships a fantastic learning opportunity, and basically a requirement for landing any job in my area. 

I've just been out of the loop and haven't really networked my way into a position to be considered quickly. I've felt like I'm really behind and doing something wrong/not doing enough to actually get myself anywhere. I've felt like it's my own fault and that I'm just not trying hard enough. But this week I finally got an interview! It was my first adult interview for a career-type job rather than some kind of minimum wage retail position. I was actually incredibly nervous the day of the interview. 

My interview only lasted 21 minutes, and I felt like I answered all their questions really poorly - maybe I didn't give enough information, or got off topic. Maybe I didn't understand the question. Maybe I gave a really wrong answer. One of my friends who applied for the same position (and who I thought was better qualified for it) relayed to me a week ago that he had been rejected. Another full week went by and I hadn't gotten any kind of response. I was getting ready to call back the retail locations I'd started applying for and let then know when I'd be available.

This morning, between classes, I got a call back from the woman who had set up my interview. She sounded tired and rushed, and I got a sinking feeling that she was just letting me know I didn't get it. I WAS WRONG! She told me that one particular manager had chosen me specifically and was excited to see if I'd come work for them! 

The summer project is one that combines the specific skills I have built up in my school projects! I'm really excited and feel really prepared! This is going to be my first real job in my field! And an even better note: this particular workplace traditionally hires on around 90% of their summer interns for full time positions after their internship!

I'm just really happy that I put the work in and actually applied on time and got called back!  I'm happy that my interview went better than I thought! I'll happy that I'll have a well-paying summer job in my hometown! I'M SO EXCITED!"

* someone is running breaks without major incident

* the mic is NOT potting up and down in awkward ways as it did when shelby was on that board playing intros and outros

* according to Ron, ""Shelby is exploring his options"". Take that for what it's worth

I have a couple of ideas from a part time job I've been in with the city for the past 4 years, but looking for jobs is so demoralizing.  ""Entry level"" actually means 1-3 years of experience and knowledge of a ton of different topics I don't know about.  I could go and learn photoshop, after effects, and things like that on my own time but what is the point when you have no real work experience in those things to show for it?  The same thing kind of goes for an entry level IT help desk job.  I could get a couple of certifications, but what's the point when you don't have the work experience to show for it?

I'd consider leaving my job if a cool internship where I could learn stuff and get work experience showed up but every internship must be for college credit.  I can't just go back in a time machine and start college over.

I went to community college for a year, graduated high school, played sports and went to state championships in high school, had a couple random jobs as a teen (paper boy, go cart track).

Should all of that go into my resume? Or just stuff like my current University GPA and programming experience?"

I'm currently a uni student studying Accountancy and have some extra time during the period of Mid July to Mid September. (I know it's quite a short period, but I really want to spend every moment of my time wisely!) I really hope to put the time to some good use by looking for a internship in order to get more experience and to learn more. But I'm not sure which are the companies that might offer off-cycle internships since the usual summer internship period is between May to July.

I'm quite open to the roles and companies as long as they're finance or accounting related. But my google-fu hasn't come out with any companies that might be offering such an internship.

Any help from veterans in the industry or seniors who have managed to get any such off-cycle internships would be great! Feel free to PM me too if you know of any roles available too! :D

If not, any recommendations on what I should do during the time period would be great too!

I have two years left in school, so I really want to get an internship next summer. Right now I'm trying to figure out what went wrong, and what to do next. My current goal for the summer is to find any sort of job and also to develop and document a simple yet complete embedded application (a board that does something useful).

For what it's worth, I am also quite interested in the EE side of embedded systems (specifically FPGAs and board-level design), although I realize my resume doesn't show that. 

Here's my current [resume](http://postimg.org/image/nntz7zfld/full/).

As far as employment history goes, the most recent job I had was being a short-order cook for 4 months in 2010. I couldn't find a job after my B.A, and when I decided to move home and pursue a B.S, I quit looking for work. That may have been a stupid decision and a big detriment to my employability, but all I can do now is find a way to overcome it and find a way to 'get my foot in the door', as they say. My goal so far has been to try and do this through projects, but I guess I'm just not trying hard enough.

So, how good or bad is my situation, and what should I do now? Any feedback or advice is appreciated. Thanks!

I had a difficult time in high school. I've always been above average in terms of intelligence, but I went to a school filled with very high achieving students who went to ivy league schools, so I was never anything special. I had trouble applying myself throughout high school, so I ended up at a mediocre liberal arts school. 

I did relatively better academically in college (as it was easier than my high school AP classes), but I hated it socially. An extremely rough breakup (ex gf cheated on me, manipulated me using my attachment to her, and eventually accused me of raping her) triggered the worse depression of my life. I left school and have been living at home and working a shitty retail job for the past 10 months. 

Unfortunately my family's financial situation makes going back to college tricky, transfer students tend to get poor financial aid, and the ones that are exceptions to that are very difficult to get into. I am going to apply to transfer, but I can't get my hopes up. Since I have left school I have been working in retail, which has been an awful experience. Dealing with irate customers on a daily basis is so incredibly exhausting. On top of that it's retail, my schedule changes every goddamn week, so I can't count on being able to have free time when I want it. I have to keep the job because I have student loans to payoff, and can't seem to find anything better because I don't have a BA or any marketable skills. 

When my friends are back from their college breaks I hangout with them, but when they are back at school I don't do much, pretty much just watch sports, browse the internet, and occasionally smoke some weed. I have gotten pretty hopeless at this point, and am constantly reminded of how shitty my situation is. 

My sister got into Dartmouth a few weeks ago, and because it's Dartmouth she got a huge financial aid package, and my parents can afford to send her. It seems like everyone else is in a great situation like this. 

About a month ago a good friend was back in town, and I hung out with him a few times. He was telling me about his life (he goes to an ivy himself) and it sounded great. He has got a great, high paying internship in silicon valley this summer, he got to go to Italy with a musical group last fall. He is in a fraternity and they have all these crazy parties with these great musicians they book. He is having the time of his life. It seems like everyone else is too. 

I made the mistake of reactivating my facebook account and I say all the cool shit people are doing. All these people I know from high school are studying abroad, so pictures all over the world are popping up. This one kid I knew was at the motherfucking hamptons for spring break. Another kid is interning in Hong Kong and posting crazy pics of his adventures there. Someone else went skiing in Vail. I can go on and on with the cool stuff people I know are doing. All these people I knew from high school are all also super successful (I know because I made the mistake of going on my linkedin, and unfortunately I saw all their academic and professional accomplishments). The only other people I know who dropped out ended up founding a tech startup, and selling it for 200k. I know I shouldn't be comparing myself to others. I have it better than a lot of people. I have a family who love me, I am somewhat healthy, and I have a roof over my head. But unfortunately I grew up and went to school with a lot people who are very smart and successful. These are the kids I knew and associated myself with. So naturally they are the people I compare myself with, and goddamn they are all doing so much better than me. This is nothing new to me, as it has been true since the beginning of high school. But I have been telling myself things will get better, and they haven't. They have only gotten worse. 

I am sorry you had to read this, and I feel kinda pathetic posting this. I feel so shitty and lost. I feel like I am reaching a point where I just want to give up. Everything feels like it is against me, and I have nowhere to turn for help. All I do is play smash bros and browse /r/soccer. I have no real passions or interests. I think about killing myself, but I know I would never go through with it. I just like to fantasize about things being better. 

I know there are probably many grammatical errors, but I had to get this off my chest and I am too drained to edit it. Hoping that when I wake up someone might have something to say that will at least be able to give me hope.

33uccp,7,2015-04-25,Singaporean wanting to go to the US to study/work. Advice?,manyzer,singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/33uccp/singaporean_wanting_to_go_to_the_us_to_studywork/,"Hi /r/Singapore !

I'd like to hear some opinion from you guys, especially those who studied and are working abroad.

I am a Singaporean who would like to work in the US someday in the tech industry. (Not specifically doing a programming job, but the whole tech industry in general). I will be starting uni this year.

The rational choice would be to study in the US, graduate, and make use of the 2.5 years working visa that international STEM graduates are given to work in the US. I have an offer from a good university (not prestigious but neither looked down upon) in one of the major cities over there to study Computer Science.

The number #1 reason this uni stands out to me is this thing called 'co-op': basically, from your third year onwards, you get to work at a company for 6 months, before returning to school and study for 6 months; you repeat this for 3 cycles, and each time you get to work at a different place of your choice (of course subject to a successful interview). Students get paid during co-op (think of it as an extended internship, and the uni has ties with many companies that provide these co-ops). I feel this is an invaluable part of the curriculum because you graduate with 18 months of real, professional work experience, and you get a leg up in terms of having a strong career footing. Again, this would help me in my desire to work in the US, even if only for a couple of years. 

However, the cost is a factor that's pulling me back. I have tried for almost all scholarship/financial aid without any success. All said and done, I am looking at around SGD180-200K for the full duration, including costs and living expenses all in. This is after deducting the pay that I will receive from my co-ops. While my parents are supportive of whatever decision I can make and technically *can* afford it, I know it is no small sum and there are many things that can be done with that amount of money. 

To me, the only justification would be that studying in the US would be a 1) an experience which could open up many doors for me, 2) makes it much easier for me to work in the US upon graduation, and 3) having the co-ops which are a huge advantage. Also, the average salary in the US tech industry is quite high, so it might justify the expense of going there to study. 

My alternative would be studying locally in either NUS (got accepted to Comp Eng) or NTU (Comp Sci). While these are no doubt excellent alternatives, I somehow feel that I would be missing out on a lot of opportunities and experiences that I would get in the US, both in terms of personal development and career-wise. From what I gather, it would be extremely hard for local graduates to work abroad in the US, because of the whole visa issue which companies would not bother to go through the hassle of applying.

So basically, I'd like to hear any advice you guys have, even better if any of you have gone down the same path. Is it worth it? Am I being naive or shortsighted? Should I stick with the conventional route? Why and why not?

Appreciate any kind of input.

Thanks!"

I know the question that follows is quite complex and obviously there is no magic answer, so I am just hoping for some thoughts and ideas from people, especially those who have been in a similar scenario. I also apologize for the length of this post.

Background: I am currently a junior in college, majoring in Chemical Engineering. I took some programming classes (java) in high school, I liked it but not that much (a lot of it was theory instead of producing actual code, which didn’t exactly turn me onto programming). I ended up going for an engineering degree because I had always figured I would solving problems and working other analytical solutions, and my parents always pushed me towards engineering. Anyway I took a class at the end of sophomore year that centered on VBA programming in excel. I ended up really liking this class, and have been working on learning more about VBA programming outside of my classes. I will be entering my senior year this fall and don’t really know what I want to do with my life after I graduate. My previous chemical engineering internships were ok but it’s not like I really loved it, although there are a vast array of different opportunities in chemical engineering. For this summer, the internship that I was going to have fell through due to funding issues, I am applying to some things now but it is very late as far as things go. I am considering just using this summer to figure out what I want to do.

Anyway, this leads to my question; what do you think my best option is to help me make up my mind? One idea that I had was to essentially make learning to program my full time “job”. I had read an article a little while ago about coding camps, and I would essentially try to do the same thing, spending all of my time trying to learn. If I went this route what would be a good language to learn and are there any good resources to follow that would be more structured rather than typical programming courses? It seems like half the battle with learning to program on the side is that I don’t know what I know.

My other option would just be to continue learning VBA with the intent of just using it occasionally in whatever chemical engineering job I end up doing. With my current VBA knowledge I have created several useful applications, both for the company that I worked for last summer and myself. I have also been trying to do some freelance VBA work but have only had time to do one small project as exam and projects have kept me extremely busy. 

Other thoughts: I know that programming for fun or on the side can be different from doing it day in and day out as a full time job. That is half of the reason that I want to do this, so I can get a sense of whether I truly like to program or not. What has your experience been like moving from learning to program into programming as an actual job? Also, how hard is it to get a job as a self-taught programmer?

33umtf,4,2015-04-25,20 F4A My personal camping trip,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/33umtf/20_f4a_my_personal_camping_trip/,"A light fog was over the forest as the sun slowly rose me from my slumber. I rubbed the tiredness out of my eyes as I extricated myself from my sleeping bag, yawning audibly as I stood up and stretched my sore limbs. I shivered as I felt the brisk morning air wrapping around me. I sighed contentedly as I stopped to watch the nature around me - the squirrels darting to and fro in the underbrush, the songbirds whipping wildly around the treetops, the wildflowers swaying gently with the occasional breeze. I loved being outdoors; it was nothing short of exhilarating.

Although, it was nigh impossible to find the time to go camping nowadays after getting my internship at St. Joseph's. Being a nurse was a highly-rewarding experience, but also incredibly time-consuming. These periodic camping trips were my way of de-stressing. Getting out in nature, getting back to the basics... it centered me. Made me whole again.

I snapped back to reality after realizing how dirty I was. I had hiked for six hours yesterday to find a secluded camping spot, and I had yet to shower. I could feel the dirt and the glazed sweat on my body.

I shed my sweatshirt and sweatpants quickly, feeling the chill autumn air encapsulating my naked form. My nipples stood at attention as goosebumps formed all over my nude flesh. I ran my hands along my lower body, massaging warmth back into my legs. As I did so, I could feel the contours of my muscles, toned by years of cross-country running and hiking.

I grabbed a bag of my personal effects and headed towards the nearby water spring - yet another perk of the camping spot I had chosen. The spring was stronger than most I had seen - the water came out rather fast as it slid down a nearby hill into the river below. I slid my nude body into the spring's path and squealed slightly as I felt the cold water rush over me. My body started shivering as I hurriedly applied soap, developing a makeshift lather over myself. 

I closed my eyes as I massaged my supple form, ran my hands through my long, brown hair, felt the cold water on my skin, relishing the sensations and the solitude... when suddenly I heard a snap. I quickly opened up my eyes and wheeled around to see you standing there, looking at me..."

It was a difficult time for me especially during my 3 week flatline at about 40 days into it but this community's stories, messages, and daily posts of motivation and encouragement were able to push me over the hump. I have never been happier and now that I have completely removed Pornography and Masturbation out of my life I can finally have time to enjoy the little things in life and find new hobbies. Since I began this transition I have skied for the first time, kayaked and hiked, made new friends, gained a new sense of respect and admiration for women and have looked at them much differently then I used to, started a vinyl collection and I landed a great summer internship . As far as dating and relationships go, I am still single and made a pact with myself to not pursue a committed, serious relationship until I was cured and hit my 90th day. It has truly been a complete change of scenery for me and I cannot thank NoFap enough for helping me keep on keeping' on. As for the rest of the Fapstronauts out there trying to change their lives, keep going and don't give up!"
33uyiu,7,2015-04-25,My self-esteem has hit rock-bottom,tortillaberry,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/33uyiu/my_selfesteem_has_hit_rockbottom/,"I've always had low self-esteem, but it's just gotten worse since I entered college. By most standards, I'm doing alright; gpa of 3.4, studying Math/C.S., successful internships in the field I want, leadership positions, etc.

But I don't feel I can measure up to anyone. It takes me much longer to understand material. I'm ugly. I'm awkward. 

Two years ago I intentionally starved myself to &lt;100 pounds. A year later I was having fainting spells. I decided to get healthy. My doctor told me to get to 130, which is healthy for my height. I got to 120 and felt healthy enough to stop gaining weight and to start going to the gym. My boyfriend told me if I kept gaining weight then he would stop loving me. I tried to make a joke about it but he was serious. I had to leave my internship early that day because I couldn't stop crying. When I look at the mirror all I see is ugly. He apologized later but I still feel it and it hurts. 

When I was in high school, my parents separated. My dad was cheating on my mom and planning on abandoning us (I found the texts). I live with my mom, whose supported me through depression and anxiety. I think she's my only true friend. My dad is still around but I don't trust him. A few weeks ago, my mom told me that dad raped and hit her a few times in their marriage, so I don't think he's a good person.

Last September (around my birthday), my boyfriend sexted with a girl from New York. I found out this past January and tried to break up, but I couldn't and I took him back because I'm stupid. I always had his Facebook password but I never used it. I found all their messages, I found that when one of his friends called me a ""slut"" for giving him a blowjob (my first) he didn't try to defend me, that he didn't love me when he took my virginity, he went on dates with girls behind my back, and downloaded hook-up apps for ""curiosity"". 

I'm so stupid. I think he's repentant because he's apologized so many times and has tried a lot to make it up to me. Today I lashed out because I thought he was talking to a friend about my loose vagina, but I was wrong. Now he's angry and not talking to me. :(

I honestly wish I had the beauty, the confidence, and the courage to walk away and make myself happy. I think it's my fault"
33uzne,1,2015-04-25,Any suggestions for careers in tech and arts?,JackieCat,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/33uzne/any_suggestions_for_careers_in_tech_and_arts/,"I am currently a third year student studying Information Systems with a specialization in Digital Media. I am also double minoring in Studio Art and Digital Art.

Honestly, my passion is in the arts. I have a huge background in art, and that is something I have always wanted to do my whole life. I realize that I feel much more comfortable on the design side rather than development.

I have experience with Java, HTML, CSS, and a bit of Python. I also have experience with Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, and InDesign. My classes next year include Unity, JavaScript, mobile and web development as well as databases. I am also a TA for introductory computer science classes. I am currently doing a government internship in IT during my breaks. I also did an internship at a startup where I was doing a bit of web development, but I left because I did not feel like it was a good fit for me because I was not pushed creatively. 

I know I want to have a career in digital media, however, I still haven't discovered what I love. I love to program and I love doing art and animation, but I am confused as to what direction I should be pushing in.

I have spoken to some of my professors about this, and they have all told me that I should be considering grad school. Some places that my professors and I have considered are NYU Tisch ITP and SVA.

What I don't want is to be stuck at a job where I sit and program all day. Nor do I want to work in tech support. I want a career where I create and manage creative projects and utilize my skills in a meaningful way.

Can anyone give me any advice and guidance as to what career paths should I be looking into? Is grad school something I should be seriously considering? "
33v2ew,7,2015-04-25,"Stuck in a Jobless Rut, Keep Hunting V.S Grad School",[deleted],labrats,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/33v2ew/stuck_in_a_jobless_rut_keep_hunting_vs_grad_school/,"Hello /r/labrats,

I'm sorry if this isn't an appropriate place for this, and if that turns out to be the case I'll take this down.

I don't have any sort of adviser or family I can speak to for input so I'm hoping random strangers might. I graduated with a B.S. in Biology in 2013. I tried to balance serious social anxiety, a job, and upper level, independent laboratories while in school and missed out out on internships and networking. I wish I hadn't been so stupid as an UGrad because as I've come to find out in the past two years that having internship/professional experience or premium references are much more valuable than anything I did. 

 I landed a small job as a lab tech for an environmental firm sorting and counting fish eggs shortly after graduating but the project ended one month after I was hired. For the past year and a half I've been tutoring and working retail while trying to find any sort of entry-level work I could find. I've had around seven or eight interviews in that time span with at least two of them ending with me being one of the final candidates but I never make the cut. I live in what I think is a fiercely competitive area (MA) for Biology/Biotech, and I feel like I lose out on most of the firm job offers because I have just an O.K. GPA from a state school and my only references are from Retail.

Last month I was accepted back into my alma mater for a course based M.S. but I'm not feeling excited about it. I already took almost all of the advanced, upper level laboratory courses like Molecular Bio, Biochem, and Protein Crystallography as an UGrad so I would only be able to take recitations for credit. The only advantage I see to it is that I might be able to network better this time around and maybe be able to volunteer as unpaid help in some of the research labs on campus but it'll all come at whatever hefty cost I need to take in loans.

I feel like I messed up too much in the past and nothing that I'm trying to do now is helping my case. I've been to networking events and I always address my applications with a cover letter and email inquiries to the PI if I can find their info. Obviously no one can ever end up this unlucky regardless of the economy so there has to be something fundamentally wrong with me as a candidate.

So I'm stuck. I can either go earn my M.S in Biotech in the Fall or I can continue trying to find a fulltime job in academia or private sector while I work abysmal retail hours. All I wanted to do when I graduated was make a meaningful contribution as a lab tech or research associate. I would accept shit or no pay for a position pipetting or running gels and PCR for hours in a heartbeat.

I'm just worried going back to school and accumulating more debt is an even worse decision when I have no guarantee it'll increase my employability. I don't know if I can solve my lack of experience problem by shoving more education into it. I'm barely coping as it is, and I don't think I'll be able to handle being more of a failure if this is the wrong decision. I'm finding it really hard to maintain a winning attitude lately. My conservative side of the family doesn't regard me as kin anymore and my more liberal friends and family think I spent four years studying ""Life sciences"".

This has ended up way more rant than asking for advice. Sorry.

**TL;DR** **Have a B.S in Biology but no internship or professional experience. Do I go back to school for a strictly course based M.S. or do I keep job hunting. I'll include a copy of a resume here http://imgur.com/49NhPhj. I've considered axing the retail from it but without it I have no professional work history or references.**"
33v58c,1,2015-04-25,I'm not good enough for myself.,kinkycollegechick,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/33v58c/im_not_good_enough_for_myself/,"I am a junior in college. I got my first C last semester, and now facing getting a D and a C this semester. I guess this is no big deal in the grand scheme of things, but here I am trying to study for finals, maybe just maybe raise my grades, and there's this insistent voice in the back of my head telling me all about how stupid and worthless I am, reminding me of my every flaw and mistake.

I've always been told I'm smart and creative. But I've come to realize what really matters is hard work and I seem to be incapable of doing that these days. I was in an unhealthy relationship all of last semester and part of this semester, that luckily I got myself out of. I am with a wonderful, supporting guy now. I miss my ex sometimes because I feel like I deserve mistreatment. I do confide in my current boyfriend, but I'm not sure the depth of my self-deprication really registers with him.

I feel like I keep myself back from thinking in this way. I was declined from five internships that I applied to this summer, so now I'm trying to get my first job outside of work study stuff. It feels out of reach for me.

I'm afraid of summer. When everyone is out having fun, you can usually find me curled up in bed. I hate it, but the thought of waking up without a clearly defined schedule in the morning scares the living hell out of me. Anxiety forces me indoors and isolated. I'm less in shape than I've been in a long time. Aches and pains are a constant for me and I am only 20.

I know this is a stupid, long, rambling post, but I just wanted to reach out. Any advice on getting your first job in retail/restaurant would be helpful. Any advice on not listening to the self-depricating voices would be even more helpful. Any advice on getting myself the fuck out of bed in the morning might be necessary.

Thanks for reading.

I am a university student in computer science. I have been through enough of the simple one class programs and intro examples through assignments and personal work and want to start building actual software and multi-class programs (and everything that comes with it). The problem is that I'm not sure how to get started and thought there might be some decent books around that could teach me through examples.

Would anyone have suggestions for books like this? I am also going to intern as a software engineer this summer and want to learn as much as possible beforehand as I will be doing this kind of work.

Learning how to make graphical interfaces at the same time would also be fun.

Thank you!"
33vfte,5,2015-04-25,I feel like my anxiety is preventing me from being happy and achieving my goals [rant],AnxietyThrowaway15,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/33vfte/i_feel_like_my_anxiety_is_preventing_me_from/,"I am new to dealing with anxiety, so if you have any advice, that is most certainly welcome. Also, sorry about the terrible grammar, so much is going through my head right now I just need to get it all down.

**TL;DR: Sorry about the length, the middle four paragraphs are my backstory which is pretty much ""A lot of shit has happened in my life and I have anxiety and a terrible self-esteem. I am just tired of bad things happening in my life, I am tired of being lonely and hating myself, and I am worried I will never achieve my dream of becoming a physician. I want to make my life better, but I don't know how.**

I am a 21 year old college girl. I'm doing okay, I have an alright GPA that is rising, I'm in an honors program, I love my major and minors, I'm in several organizations and leadership position. But the anxiety, somedays its too much to deal with.

Backstory (TW: rape, emotional abuse): I was depressed when I was younger, mostly because of what I think was PMDD. Looking back, I also think my anxiety developed around the same time as my depression because of my terrible self confidence, and because of my mom (She is way overly dramatic, and every few weeks would get crazy mad about something like messy rooms or some stupid kid thing we did, and spend hours screaming at us, usually me. She still gets angry with me all the time for stupid things, even though I don't live anywhere near her). But I was really social, and despite the monthly depression, I was doing great in school, and enjoying my passion for dance, and I was in the marching band. When I was 16, I got in a huge car wreck where I broke my back and my pelvis, and I ended up having to quit dance. My friends felt uncomfortable around me when I was in a wheelchair (only for 3 months) and stopped inviting me to things, and that plus the weight gain from inactivity made my self confidence spiral even more. I started getting shy and feeling really uncomfortable in social situations. During one of my MRIs my doctors found cysts in my thyroid and I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's. So that combined with not wanting to exercise because of leftover back and hip pain, I have gained 20 pounds and I generally have a terrible self image.

I came to college wanting to rush for a sorority (my parents had told me my whole life that I wont have fun in college unless I am in Greek life), but I got really anxious during the events, and got cut right before the preference round. Since then, talking to friends who are/were in Greek life, I have decided it was really for the best, but still, that rejection really took a toll on me. I made friends and had fun at the beginning of freshman year, but second semester I became really depressed because of some stuff that was happening with people from back home. In the middle of the semester I was raped at a frat party. I refused to accept what happened, blamed myself, and when the guy acted like he wanted to hang out as friends, I fell for it. And when he would show up and my dorm room and get handsy and aggressive, I just laid there. It happened three times, along with a lot of insults and threats, before one of my close friends asked me to talk to her about it. After talking I realized it wasn't my fault and that it wasn't okay. I confessed to my mom what happened over the phone and she immediately packed up and drove to me, and she comforted me. She asked me to go to the police to make a report, and to student advocacy. I didn't want to, I was still blaming myself (I didn't want to ruin his life, can you believe that?), and I just wanted to forget about it and move on with my life. After a lot of pressure from my mom, I wrote a police report, and while I couldn't do anything because I didn't have any evidence (aside from threatening texts and a friend in the same frat who had guessed what was going on that night and tried to find me), I was registered under my school's program for victims of sexual assault. He is still on campus, and I see him every once in a while, but they are supposed to move his classes so he is never in the same building as me (they didn't do it last semester and I ended up having to drop a class after midterms), and I get to take my tests in a private room with extra time.

I developed really bad social anxiety after that, to the point where I had a few panic attacks on campus and at social events friends took me to. At the beginning of sophomore year I stopped going tailgating or to football games because my best friend and her boyfriend (the guy in the same frat as the rapist) always wanted to tailgate at his frat. So I just stayed in my apartment all the time. Friends stopped inviting me to hang out, and I lost a lot of friends. I slept with 2 random guys I met over the internet, even though I generally have no interest in casual sex. One of my roommates threw a party in our apartment, so I came out of my room and talked to a few people. This one guy and I really hit it off, and I slept with him that night. We started dating within a few days, and I thought he was so sweet and just an amazing guy. After about a month, he started getting angry over ridiculous things and screaming at me and insulting me. He picked up on my insecurities, calling me ""fat and disgusting"", told me I was stupid and would never amount to anything, etc. And the next day he would apologize, say he was such a terrible boyfriend and would never do it again, and then would be super nice to me. I didn't break up with him. The arguments started just once every few weeks, then every week, then every time we hung out. Most of the things he got mad about where imagined insults (I put on heels and he got mad that I was calling him short). I lost more friends because he would get angry I did anything without him. After 9 months I broke up with him. I had gained 10 pounds over the relationship, had an even worse self-esteem, and now had even more trust issues.

Since then I have worked on myself a little. One of my best guy friends and I started hanging out, and even though neither of us really wanted it to happen, we fell in love. He is amazing and has worked with me a lot on my issues, but he is human, he isn't perfect and sometimes things he says trigger some fear in me. But I will let him know, we will talk about it, and he will work on whatever it was. He listens, and encourages and helps me better myself. I have tried to spend time with friends, but I still get nervous that people don't like me or don't want to spend time with me, so I end up being lonely a lot of the time. I try to go to Yogalates class at least once a week, but sometimes that just doesn't happen, because I am out of shape and not really good at it compared to the other people in the class. I'm trying to watch my calories and exercise regularly, because I really think losing weight and getting comfortable with my body will help me. A lot of my social anxiety has faded over time, I haven't had a panic attack at a party in a while, but I still worry people don't like me and it keeps me from being as social as I want to be.

I've had a lifelong dream of becoming a physician, but I worry I may never make it. I ended freshman year with a 3.2 GPA because of all the stuff that happened that year and because of my undiagnosed ADHD. I got diagnosed and I'm on medicine, and my GPA is rising aside from two classes I screwed up in. I signed up for the August MCAT, and I plan on studying for it this summer, along with my internship and job at the hospital. But when I signed up for the MCAT and researched study plans for it, I had some major anxiety issues. I felt like I had started a doomsday clock, and I ended up crying on my couch thinking I would never be good enough. I have tried talking to my mom about my anxiety on medical school and becoming a doctor before, but she just gets mad at me because I don't have confidence in myself. So I can't talk to her. I'm also really worried because my anxiety has caused problems in testing before. A few weeks ago I had a physics test and I studied so hard for it, I was making 100% on all the practice tests. But I ended up missing the deadline for reserving my time for that exam in the disability testing center, so I had to take it with the whole class. I had a panic attack during the middle of the test and ended up failing. Now I have to get a high A on the final to get an A in the class. And I am terrified that is going to happen to me during the MCAT.

My life has been so dramatic, and it isn't just the big things like the accident or the assault. It's little things as well. Things like birds flying into my house and hiding in cabinets only to surprise me in the morning, or having mono for 10 months, or having a single week with three exams when I also have the flu, my grandmother dies, and my mom has spinal surgery. I'm just tired. There is always something. I wish I could just get a break.

I am lonely, I am scared I will never achieve the things that I want to. I fear that in 10 years I will have accomplished nothing that I want to and look back on my young years and regret everything. I want to like myself. I want to not be wary of everyone that I meet, or have that fear in the back of my mind when I walk on campus because I know I could look up from my phone and see the guy who raped me.

I am seeing a therapist and it helps a lot, but I am nowhere near where I want to be."

I've made a post or two here in the past and got amazing answers, so I was hoping some of you may be able to help me out a little again!

I'm currently in my final semester at a community college upstate and am enrolled in the CS major here. I'm really considering Stony Brook! I feel as if the classes at my current school haven't pushed me as hard as I would like to be, in the CS field atleast, and really want to take go to a school that will challenge me! How challenging do you all find the CS courses to be? Are the teachers fun with a captial PH or is it more of a boring lecture-esq sturcture? I was hoping that a current student would be able to post somewhat of a course sylabus something like this - http://www.cs.rpi.edu/academics/courses/spring15/csci1200/calendar.php

I'm also very interested in the internship / job placement / fairs that the school may have. Do you, or someone you may know of, have a job lined up with a decent starting salary for when you graduate? I'm really considering going to a large name school just for the job placement, but I feel like in a field like Computer Science, if you're truly good at what you do, then where you go shouldn't matter as much as long as you have the skills to back it up.

I've read ALOT of forums online regarding a multitude of schools and I know a lot of people have answered questions close to these, however, I feel like interacting with people is a little better than just reading stale old forum posts!

If you have anything you would like to add about the atmosphere of the school, please don't hesitate to ask!

And you guys will witness this great feat! You will be witnesses to this inspiring accomplishment! And you all will be inspired to at least do this once in your life and reap the benefits!

I'm confident I'll do it. I reached 79 days before, so 90 will be nothing!! I'm feeling on top of the world right now. I did my doctoral thesis presentation in front of a hundred or so people earlier in the week. Like a BOSS! I'm going to graduate soon. I have a bunch of work to do these next couple of months. Group presentations, projects, finals, papers, comprehensive exit exams, a final internship, and eventually a licensing exam. But I'm not scared. I don't care. I will finish my program!

And in these next couple of months, I will complete this 90 day challenge to boot! The 90+ day streak starts tomorrow! Who wants to race?!! 

And I know I will eventually stop watching porn for good. The goal really is not to fap or watch porn, but I will be proud of myself when I can give in to fapping without watching porn, not feel so bad about it, and not feel obliged to give in to fapping to porn anymore after that. 

This is my declaration! 90 days, I will finally do it!!!!!!! I will not disappoint you guys. Guaranteed.

**Species:** Optional. Default is human, possibly some sort of metahuman variant. If your character is not human, feel free to describe the species if you wish. This can be especially relevent if you have some sort of Physiology-type power and wish to go into more detail than simply leaving it just that. Please remember that while whatever physiology-type might allow an entire species to have unique talents above the average human population, they'd also require their own flaws, and are not guaranteed to be superior to individual metabeings, especially if they have a specific superpower covering whatever the species might be naturally gifted in. 

**Age:** Also self explanatory. Having an older or younger character, either have their advantages and disadvantages when taking into account one's physical prowess, experience, financial situation, mental state, etc. Long-lived or semi-immortal characters may be expected to have their own unique flaws to counteract having the best of both youth and experience, such as being slow to adapt to a rapidly changing world, being stubborn to a fault, etc., and would be expected to be treated as much more than a minor setback. 

**Physical Description:**  A basic visual description of the character, so that other people can have an idea what the people that their own characters are interacting with look like. Providing an actual written description would be preferred over a simple faceclaimed picture, as simply practicing will improve your overall quality of writing. 

**Personality:** At least a brief description of how the character thinks, can be expected to behave in certain situations, particular quirks or mannerisms that they possess, etc. What is the character's motives, what triggers them to act one way or another? This is important so that, when being approved, the mods can judge how a character will make use of their powers and assets in a way that isn't too abusable. What is provided here is not set in stone, and is absolutely able to develop into something different over the course of their in-character experiences, however acting in-character will greatly benefit the chances of which interactions may or may not be made canon.  

**Backstory:**  At least a brief overview of the character's past, describing any important details as to how they became the person they are. Is there anything notable that shaped their personality or word-view, how they obtained any powers they possess, what sort of consequences led them to have their assets, etc.? If in-character experiences justify major character growth to the point of the character being resubmitted to reflect those changes, a brief overview of the events in question and a link to their old profile page would be appreciated here. 

**Residence:** Which of the established cities of the canon does this character live in? Different cities might be known for different demographics, local culture, attitudes towards metahumans, etc., that might play an interesting role in the people who live there - a gay, Muslim metahuman might have a very different life experience living in the Bible Belt compared to the daughter of a wealthy politician and niece of the CEO of a major oil company. 

**Personal Assets:**  What sort of financial resources does this character have access to? Such will help determine what sort of lifestyle the character can be expected to live within the means of. For example, is this a modestly successful shop owner who can cover her expenses and live comfortably while running  her establishment with superheroing as a side gig, or is this character a board member of a multinational megacorporation? (Chances of such being approved are minimal, as a heads up now.) Is the character a high-schooler living in his aunt's basement who gets by through an internship with said megacorporation?  Having certain resources can much better justify other aspects of a character's powers or personal equipment. 

**Equipment:** What sort of arsenal of advanced gadgets does this character have on their person? Any fancy personal devices, weapons, tools, etc. that they can reliably be expected to make use of? How does your character have, and maintain, these items? Likely to be heavily connected to their assets. 

**Special Skills:** Is this person a skilled professional in any given field? What sort of job would this character take up if not superheroism/villainy, or what talents do they have that can be applied to their ventures into the heroism or villainy? Detective? Scientist? Etc. (Please be more specific than just [“science.”](http://drmcninja.com/comics/2015-04-22-30p13.jpg) Does the character know multiple languages? Are they good with animals? Trained as a world-class chef? Certified commercial pilot? Nobody is miraculously skilled at everything, but everyone should be talented in at least something that makes them interesting. 

([Gal's recommendation, highly superpowered beings may stand to be generally be less talented in ""mundane skills,"" due to reliance on their  special gifts, potentially.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDFsOfDAkTk) This would justify characters without superpowers to have developed useful skills to make up for not being able to fly or throw cars or shoot spiders from their eyes, whereas a professional superhero who's trained his entire life to fight crime on the front lines might not have had the time to learn other skills.)

**Powers:** While a majority of the people in the world aren't some sort of powerful alien, android, mutant, wizard,  or any other sort of possible metabeing, many characters you'll be creating likely will be. Does the character have any explicitly supernatural or magical abilities that go above and beyond their species' capabilities? If so, list them here. Please try to be specific as to what their powers are capable of, if anything, and what limits are beyond their capabilities. Powers more specific to a single purpose will be allowed to surpass the magnitude of more broad, generic powers that cover many things, meaning that less really can be more.  The more broad you make your powers, the less depth you can expect to get from each application. Being who are explicitly non-superpowered can still list wiki links below if they are specifically relevant to their special skills and equipment listed above, (such as Tony Stark being able to list things relevant to being a [wealthy](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Business_Intuition) [scientist](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Mechanical_Intuition) wearing an [advanced techsuit.)](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/High-Tech_Exoskeleton)

**Do not forget, just because ""the wiki says,"" stop right there and remind yourself that you character is not an amalgam of every character across fiction ever to use similar powers - what is your character itself aiming to get out of those powers which the wiki uses as a starting point?**

**Stat Chart:**

(Character Name) |  | | |
:---|:---|:---|:---
***Attribute*** | ***Base Stat*** | ***Peak Limit*** |***Rationale, Notes, Non-numeric Details***| 
**Primary Strength**|This would be the character at their usual self, like say Lex Luthor on a regular day or Billy Batson as Billy Batson | This would be Lex Luthor in his Warsuit or Billy Batson as Shazam!   |  |
**Secondary Strength**| Using Teen Titans as a comparison, Raven is the physically weakest member of the team but can use magic to throw objects that the rest could not. |   | What powers allow for this, and more importantly, how much fine control is there? |
**Speed**| How fast a character can move at their regular top speed without being enhanced by powers or technology the like, such as Tony Stark or Bruce Banner out for a run without any suits or anger.   |  Now how fast would they move when suited up as Iron Man or when Hulked out? | Also, please make a note on how quickly it takes in order to reach this speed, and for how long they can maintain top speed. Characters who can teleport should explain the range, cooldown and other relevant details, as a note next to the power that enables teleportation. |
**Reflexes**|  Please remember that dodging is not an everything-proof shield |   | |
**Intelligence**|  A rough approximation as to how intelligent a character is, measured by the amount of things that they would be considered highly knowledgeable in |  |  What specific areas of study is the character smart in? |
**Wisdom** | A rough measure of how easily a character is able to assess a situation, and the people they meet, in order to come to decisions and make plans for the future based off of what they know.  |    |  |
**Willpower** |  The strength of one's mind to resist pain, stress, and powers that might influence a person's thoughts or emotions or psyche, etc.  |  |  |
**Endurance** |  How much can one push themselves past physical injury and fatigue once sustained? This stat can also be used as a measure against toxins for those who do not boast a notable resistance to such from their powers. |  | |
**Durability**| A measure of one's superhuman ability to resist direct harm from damaging forces. Is able to reliably resist harm up to it's equivalent number in danger, meaning that one would not suffer full damage from the attacks of a person with equal danger to one's durability. Having an even higher durability would allow for even less damage sustained.  | |  |
**Weaknesses**|Does your character (or their powers, or technology) have any notable weaknesses, or vulnerabilities to any particular kind of attack? What would be the most effective way for another character to fight this one? This is especially important, if not mandatory, for characters who possess notably high durability, tricky superpowers, or highly advanced technology. Remember, not only is there ALWAYS someone who is able to hurt you or exploit your weakness in some way, but there should also ideally be some way that ANYONE with enough time to legitimately prepare can do so. Also, simply saying ""is human"" is lazy and subject to scorn - even if a character lacks high durability, they require something that can counteract their powers reliably. |  | |
**Resistances**|  Please remember that broad physiology and condition-based powers do not automatically grant full-immunity to something unless you explicitly define that for your character such, and that it makes sense for the character to have that themselves for more reasons than ""someone said so on a wiki;"" the mods do not have to approve that. | | |
**Recovery**|  |   | |
**Melee Skill** |   |   | What specific fighting styles is this character trained in?  |
**Ranged Skill** |   |   | Same as above, but from a distance. |
**Power Area** |    | | |
**Power Sustainability** |  |  ||
**Danger**|    |  |  |
**Non Lethal Damage**|  | | Specify what is being used to incapacitate/what other stat is this measured against? |
**Special/Other**|  |  ||

I've worked 4 months at a company as an research engineer intern.  I recently gave a presentation about my project and management wants to place a patent for my work.  They asked me to photocopy my notebooks, etc. as well.

However, as I am leaving soon and the patent application won't be submitted while I am still with the company, is it likely that my name would still be included on the patent considering I am only a 4 month intern?

Thanks, please let me know if you've had any similar experiences as well.


EDIT: To put things in perspective, even though my direct supervisor is proud of my work and extremely satisfied with my performance, the engineering director doesn't seem to like me a lot.  He seems a bit salty about the fact that I'm only doing a 4-month work term and would be leaving the company soon.

Is it standard procedure to include temporary interns in patents when they did the majority of the work?

This summer I will be driving the car from the west coast to the Midwest to start an internship.  During the internship I will be driving 2 hours each day, on a highway to work.  When the internship is done, I will be driving back to the west coast.  

Due to this, I have been considering hybrids and diesel cars for their good highway mileage.  I am not considering electric cars because it seems like a cross-country trip with one could be rather inconvenient.  

Once the internship is done, the car will be a daily driver, but likely in the city.  Therefore I feel the new car would be a good investment since I plan to drive it for many years to come.  

What cars would you suggest I consider?

 **13,634 readers** touching cute animals for **1 year!**   

If you're a cute cat, [I am going to want to touch you](http://i.imgur.com/7oG4Xl8.gif). I may even [try to kiss you](http://i.imgur.com/7MoswpX.gifv). You can [hide all you want](http://i.imgur.com/AT2pIuL.gif), but I will not stop. You are just THAT cute. Even [Conan O'Brien can't resist touching a cute cat](http://i.imgur.com/3lMPQnt.gif).  

I am not the only one who suffers from this *needing to touch cute animals* syndrome. There are many others just like me. /r/StopTouchingMe is where they reside. There are all kinds of adorable animals *unwantedly* being touched there. They have; [dogs](http://i.imgur.com/3jE1Z8h.gif), [geckos](http://i.imgur.com/HN3SQLl.jpg), [fish](http://media.brainz.org/uploads/2010/01/14-puffer-fish.jpg), [owls](http://i.imgur.com/O5JT50B.gif), and even [sharks](http://giant.gfycat.com/WarpedUnlawfulAnemone.gif)!  

However, it's not always humans that are doing the touching. [Dogs can't resist the urge to touch either](http://i.imgur.com/VplharL.gif)! [Neither can tigers](http://i.imgur.com/rvBLlcX.gifv)! Almost everyone enjoys touching cute animals!  

/r/StopTouchingMe drew me in with posts like [this cat being annoyed by a little puppy](http://gfycat.com/QuarrelsomeDifferentGharial), and [this kid scrambling to get away while being held](http://i.imgur.com/CrIMVKK.gifv). Whether you like dogs, cats, goats, or lizards, /r/StopTouchingMe has everything you could possible desire, and more! It's very easy to spend hours going through all the [wonderful content](http://i.imgur.com/ylDtm6W.gifv). I had a hard time focusing on writing this feature because I just could not stop browsing!  

Not only does /r/StopTouchingMe have enticing content, it has a community that you will fall in love with. Since it is a smaller subreddit, you don't have to deal with all of the troll accounts and spamming, like you see in some of the larger ones. It will grab a hold of you, and reel you in. Imagine taking all of the great qualities of /r/aww, the cute animals from /r/EyeBleach, removing the spam and trolls, and combine that all into one subreddit; /r/StopTouchingMe -Animals that do not want to be touched!  

After scouring through /r/StopTouchingMe for a while, I had a little chat with the moderator there. He was very friendly, and excited to answer a few questions for me. Here's what he had to say: 
 

 

&gt; ## 1. Share a bit about yourself! (You personally, not your subreddit)  

&gt;&gt; **/u/IAMA_dragon-AMA:** Besides the obvious? I can't really think of anything.

&gt; ## 2. Tell us about your community!  

&gt;&gt; **/u/IAMA_dragon-AMA:** Like most cute-centric communities, /r/StopTouchingMe's community is generally very pleasant! There aren't usually too many comments, but those that exist are usually friendly.

&gt; ## 3. Why did you join this subreddit? 

&gt;&gt; **/u/IAMA_dragon-AMA:** Three reasons, really. First, I kind of wanted to actually try modding a sub again. Modding is pretty fun.
Reasons [two](https://i.imgur.com/krhqSU1.jpg)  and [three](http://i.imgur.com/gDQC17N.gif).

&gt; ## 4. What do you like most about this subreddit? 

&gt;&gt; **/u/IAMA_dragon-AMA:** Just how many images there are! I never expected it to get this big with so few reposts!

&gt; ## 5. Anything else you’d like to add?  

&gt;&gt; **/u/IAMA_dragon-AMA:** Bit of a lesser thing: when the sub was first growing, I asked the subscribers how strict I should be on the titles, whether I should force them to be in the form ""Noo, stop touching me! I am [X]!"" or if I should allow for more varied titles, so long as they stay with the spirit of the phrase.  

&gt;&gt;The subscribers voted to allow more titles, and I think this sub has benefited greatly from it.

&gt; ## 6. Anything you'd like to tell your subscribers? 

&gt;&gt; **/u/IAMA_dragon-AMA:** I don't think so. Maybe to remind them that since the image or title has to contain the phrase, so you can be more varied, title-wise, if you caption the image.

&gt; ## 7. Anything you'd like to tell your potential subscribers? 

&gt;&gt; **/u/IAMA_dragon-AMA:** Cats. Cute things. Captions. What's not to love?!

So this is definitely a bit of a long shot, but I might as well try.

I'm about to finish my freshman year at UT, studying Electrical Engineering. I'm going to be taking a few classes here on campus over the summer, but they're in the evenings and I'd love to have something useful and interesting to do during the day. I'm interested in computer science, electronics, robotics--pretty much anything technical in nature. I don't have very much programming experience, but am willing to learn. Basically, I'm looking for an internship of sorts, without too much commitment required as I will be taking several classes at the same time. 

PM me if you know of anything or have any tips or anything you think I might find useful!

I am looking into studio and 1 bedroom apartments as well, but I like the idea of not having to furnish a place myself since I won't be staying long. (not to mention that most places are not fond of signing a month-month or 3 month lease).


A little about me: I am a student at CSU Chico in the Computer Science department. My internship is in my chosen career field and is compensated, so I won't have any trouble paying rent. I used to be a stereotypical nerd that was on his computer all the time, but I have since become much more outgoing. (I am studying abroad in Japan right now for instance). I do not smoke, drink only occasionally, and have no pets. 


If you have a quite and clean home and would be interested in living with a responsible young adult for a short time, please PM me. (Allow for 48 for a response from me due to time zones and me being busy)

However, I am still not completely decided on what area to specialize in. I have chosen Machine Learning as my main concentration, because I consider it to be one of the growing fields in CS. However, I am not sure if that is the right area for me.

My main concern with doing a Masters in Machine Learning is that I will be stuck in a research job position, which I am definitely not interested in. I have had past internships, and the thing I enjoyed most about them was the coding, and the software engineering aspect of them. I actually like development more than I would like doing research. I have many options to choose my concentration in, but these are the areas I have narrowed down. 

- Databases and Software Engineering
- Information Security
- Dual Specialization between one of the above and Machine Learning

I am leaning more towards the dual specialization right now because it will allow me to pursue jobs that are less on the research side, while still having a Machine learning degree that can prove to be useful in the future. I need help deciding whether this is the right decision or not, and if not, what I should choose.

~~I'd like to preface this by saying I currently live in New Zealand but I have an American Passport.~~

EDIT: Some people are getting confused with my passport situation, I'm an American citizen born abroad. My mother is from Illinois. I have already gotten my American passport and SSN. 

**The problem**

My parents just approached me and said they'd like me to move out asap. I've been home since I graduated in mid Feb. It's a long story but I completely understand and I'm (mostly) fine with it. I had always planned on moving to the States after graduation. 

* **Degree:** BSc. Computer Science &amp; Information Systems double major

* **Certs:** Completing my CCNA in June

* **Work Experience:** No paid or internships. I was the IT Specialist for a University club for ~2 years.

* **Portfolio:** Penetration test as part of a interview, small Python program. Odd school project which I need to find and improve. 
* **Career goal:** Anything security related, it's a mad passion.
* **Current career path:** There's several paths I can take to get into computer security (development, IT support etc). Once I get my foot in the door I'm confident I can work my way into the industry. 

**The Questions**

1. What are some good job databases I could look at? 
2. I understand my work experience and portfolio are weaknesses. I'm developing a Hearthstone Deck builder in Python and performing penetration tests on Mutillidae using Kali Linux. What else should I be doing to make myself more valuable to a future employer? 
3. As I said, security is my passion. I want to engulf myself in all things computer security. I currently listen to podcasts, follow ~300 security related twitter accounts, I'm performing penetration tests and I'm reading various testing guides, standards and whitepapers. Is there anything else I should consider? (only two security conferences in NZ)
4. What are some things that I should be aware of when entering the US job market? The process? Expectations of me? 
5. Certs are a hotly debated topic. Given my obvious lack of experience, would it be worth getting one? If so, which one(s)? Comptia? GIAC? 

I've tried to keep this brief as possible, if you'd like to know more just ask me.

33wr0v,3,2015-04-26,"Me [23 M]; Gf [22 F] of two years. She cant keep her self from messaging her ex, and then yesterday I saw her messages and there was another guy whom she was sending messages like: ""Ill miss you *hugggggggggg* :(""",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/33wr0v/me_23_m_gf_22_f_of_two_years_she_cant_keep_her/,"So, we have been dating for about two years and she is a very tom boyish, outgoing person. Me on the other hand, I am more of an introvert. I don't like talking about random stuff to random people and so normally avoid situations where I would have to small talk. 


Now, when we started dating, she had just broken up with this complete creep of a guy who was basically using her for sex. He would call her home, they would fuck, and then ask her to leave. All of her friends were against this relationship but she would keep up with that guy just because she did not know what else to do. (He and her had same classes so they could not avoid each other)


When we started dating, she was completely broken and would not trust guys at all. I helped her recover, and brought her back to the normal world. She slowly became her usual self, and by the time college got over; (1 year since we started dating); she was completely over him and totally into me. 


We both stay in the same city, so when we came back, we started meeting a lot less because we both were staying with our parents and it was difficult to meet more often than 2 times a week. I started working with my dad, and she wanted to study some more, so I pushed her, she gave her GMAT exams, cleared them and will be going abroad in a couple of months. 


6 months back, she took up an internship at the local airport. That internship, co-incidentally is filled up just with guys and obviously, she made friends. Those friends would obviously give her a lot of attention and she, I think liked it. None of it really bothered me, because she would not hide stuff from me, or so I would like to think.


Before I go any further, I would like to let everyone know that I am inherently scared of bikes. I have lost a lot of relatives and a couple of good friends on bike accidents. Okay, maybe not scared, but definitely uncomfortable.
She, is smitten by bikes. Her best friend in college had a bike. When college got over, they lost touch. At the new internship, there is a guy who has a sports bike. She told me that when she started working. She was pretty excited about it. 


She knows about my issues and we had a talk about it, where I said that its okay to sit on bikes, but don't make it a habit, and try and avoid them when you can. According to me, it was a fair thing, because I feel I am coming to the middle ground here. I am letting her have fun at the cost of me having sleepless nights. I was trying to not impose my fears on her.


Now, for some reason, she has become very close to a couple of guys from that group. They started exchanging gifts, and they would apparently open up her phone and read her messages, and she was cool with it. She would never tell me what they exactly talk about, but then one day we were out and her phone rang and I saw a the name ""Jon Snow"" on her caller-ID. She also put me off to sleep one night, and stayed up and drew out a rather good looking poster of Batman and Joker for that guy. 


A couple of days before meeting her, I remember seeing her Whatsapp status which read: You know nothing Jon Snow.
When I asked her about it, she said that status has got nothing to do with that guy. Co-incidence? I think not. Nevertheless, I did not think much about it and let it pass.


Moving on, so last week, she told me that she will be going out for dinner with those guys on Friday, or Saturday, as it would be her last week at work and she would not be meeting those guys after that. I was again, cool with it, but then she had not specified the day. 


Friday evening, I get off from work and call her as usual, it rings and no one picks up. 
From about 5:30 PM to 7:00 PM I called multiple times, and got no answer. By 7:00 when I'm pissed, she messages me saying sorry, that the phone was in her bag and she did not hear it ringing. I asked her where she is and she is like at some restaurant, having dinner with her friends. I asked her if she was on the bike, and she was like yeah but only for like half hour of that 90 minute window. Again, it made me uncomfortable but I let it pass. I tell her to message me when she reaches back home. 


Next message I get at around 11:30 PM saying that she is on her way back. By that time, I was already really anxious because I did try calling her again at around 9 and no one answered. So when she messaged at 11:30, I was half pissed because she was not even cutting the phone when I was calling, and half pissed because she has never stayed out this late with me. She always has to reach home by 11 because her dad gets pissed at her for coming home late. 


I ask her about what she will tell her parents and she is like: ""No one from home has even called yet. So its cool""
I was infuriated for some reason. 

I made it clear to her that I was pissed in many many words (i.e. long, pissed messages) and then slept off. 

Saturday (Yesterday), we were supposed to meet for Age of Ultron. I was pissed at her for being irresponsible about the phone but I was like we will meet and talk this away. We meet, we go into the movie hall, I get pop corn and we sit. 


Before the movie starts, she casually mentions, that if I would have not turned up today, she would have gone with Jon Snow AND her sister for the movie on Sunday. That again made me choke on the pop corn because I have not met her sister. Again, disturbed.


Now as the movie is going on, I was making a fuss about the fact that she will again leave by 10 PM to reach home by 11 and yesterday she was able to stay out with those guys till late. She  agreed to have dinner with me after the movie. 
Then when I questioned her about her not picking up the phone, she was like she was with her friends and phone was in the bag. That situation also sorted, we started talking normally and I asked her where she had gone yesterday.


She named a place, which a resort, on the outskirts of the city. I was like, I thought, you said that the thing was half an hour away. She was like yea it's half an hour away but there was traffic. I was like oh okay. I was a little uncomfortable again, but then she talking about how she was going to miss them etc etc. I was like okay and then as we were watching the movie, she kept her head on my shoulder and said ""We were all basically sleeping on each other's shoulders"" I was like whatt!!! And she was like no no in a friendly way. 


I was now visibly disturbed and I again did not say anything. Then, came the interval. I told her I need to go pee. Went to the washroom and basically stood there in front of the mirror for 10 minutes, trying to get rid of all thoughts that were coming in my head. 
I walk back, she is sitting on her seat, messaging of course, Jon Snow. I got a glance at the conversation. It goes like this:
GF: At Age of Ultron
JS: Alone? With someone?
GF: Haha No No
GF: Not alone. With Mr. Nobody.

I ask her what Mr. Nobody business is about. She is like nothing. I was like can you tell me/show me the full context of the conversation? She is like nope, you'll get more pissed. 


I swear to God, at that point in time, I could have cried. I ask her calmly, telling her I wont get pissed, and after about a couple of minutes of pleading, I get to see the phone. 
I scroll up, and she had messaged him stuff like:

GF: Ill miss you Jon Snow
JS: I'll miss you too __ !! :( :(
JS: *Huggggggggg!*
GF: *Huggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg* :(
 
and there were an uncomfortable number of hugs in the conversation, that was very long. There were multiple exchanged selfies. And not normal selfies, cute selfies sent like Awws and hawws.
Good morning good night messages, hugs, drawings being made, late night bike trips being taken, missing happening, movie plans being made, I really did not like the feeling I was getting. I just got up and walked out of the theater. She messaged me saying that was a very shitty move. I was almost in tears, and just blocked her everywhere. 


Now I do love her, but she has a lot of issues other than this. She keeps messaging her ex and even when she was in college, she would regularly (and mostly intentionally) bump into each other and talk about stuff. Whenever she messages him, the conversation almost always distills down to inappropriate things like he making her moan or discussing period cycles etc etc.


Since yesterday, I have blocked her almost everywhere,but she has messaged me that she loves me and she is sorry and she will stop talking to him if necessary and it was all as friends etc etc, but I don't know what to believe. BTW, these messages were in the morning. Since the afternoon has started, even those have stopped. 


She is a do shit and apologise later kind of person. I really find it hard to trust her because along with her ex, she regularly talks to guys who hit on her and call her pretty names. She knows it makes me uncomfortable and still does it.


I really love her but I think that she is causing me more unhappiness and pain than I think there should be in a normal relationship. I want to break up with her and will maintain this blocked status and consider this a break up but I am beginning to have second thoughts. Please help.


TL;DR: GF of two years with ex issues is PROBABLY trying to hit it off with some other guy from work. Has gone on bike trips to resorts, calls him pet names, messages him day and night, calls him Jon Snow and sends him hugs on whatsapp. What to do.


ps: Dont know if tldr is accurate enough. Please help with suggestions. Thank you in advance Reddit. Really shaken up right now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT: Looks like I will have to focus on dealing with the breakup blues now. Any tips? Appropriate sub? Thanks for the advice. Will keep you guys updated.

EDIT2: She tells me that those she treats Jon Snow and her gang as brothers. 
And that nobody is derived like this:  My name initials N and B which are expanded to Nobody.

EDIT3: Had a long talk with her last night. She was all I love you lovey-dovey. I will miss her. She was a nice person. But there is too much BS in the relationship. There are certain things I cant stand at all and I know for a fact that she will agree to not doing those things right no but then eventually start doing them again. 
She is also putting this all on me, i.e. I'm finding reasons to break up with her and I am misunderstanding her, but I am fine, I think. 
I mean, I told her that it's not on me and there are lines you don't cross, but she is adamant that she did not cross any lines. Going ahead with the dump."
33wrlo,1,2015-04-26,"Me [20F] with my boyfriend [21F] of two years, he's going on a rugby tour and I'm worried something will happen",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/33wrlo/me_20f_with_my_boyfriend_21f_of_two_years_hes/,"So this is a pretty hard question to ask because it's referring to something from the past that's kinda painful. 

About six months into our relationship, we were on work placements in europe two hours away from each other (this lasted eight months, we are now back at the same university). After several months of long distance, he confessed that he had gotten absolutely plastered one night drinking with some teammates, blacked out for most of it, until he remembers being half passed out, without clothes, in bed with some much older woman (someone who he called disgusting) getting dressed and asking his name/number. He realises what must have happened, freaks out, gets her out the house, cries for several days before managing to tell me. At this time I was going through important exams, so he hadn't wanted to fuck that up for me by telling me beforehand, hence the gap in time. 

So obviously, really, really shitty time for us. I broke up with him, after a few weeks we got to talking when he brought me my stuff back, eventually agreed to see if there something worth saving. I mean, I was completely in love with the guy, he was my best friend and I his. He spent months trying to get me back. I saw what the whole thing did to him, he lost a stupid amount of weight from barely eating, being drunk at 9 o clock in the morning. That coupled with genuinely believing his story about that night (and having his state of absolute drunkenness verified by a video from that night) and the fact that he was honest with me and not wanting to build a relationship on lies meant that eventually we rebuilt. You can call me stupid if you want, but I have never regretted that decision. 

These days we have a wonderful relationship. This is not something that I think about often, it's been a long time since those days (or seems like it anyway, I'm only 20, people). I have never been given any reason to not trust him since then. He's for the most part cut back on the drinking, but any night that he has gotten drunk without me, all he's wanted to do is call me and ramble on about how much he loves me. One of his friends told me a story once about how they thought he was trying to cop off with some girl and when they went up to him, turns out he'd just been talking about his ''amazing girlfriend'' to some poor young lady. I can see us being together for a very long time, we have never had any other issues since this incident. I have trusted him on nights out for a long time. 

Yet in about a month he is going on a two day rugby tour in Brussels. And I've been around his team, mostly they're nice guys but there are stories of strip clubs, brothels, ""what happens on tour stays on tour"" etc. And it's brought this all back, cos it terrifies me that something could happen again in that environment. He's young, it's a rugby tour, I'm not going to expect him to not drink, and it shouldn't have to be a case of prohibiting him from drinking in order to trust him. But because the original story sounds like some combination of being too drunk to know what he's doing and being taken advantage of, it just seems all too easy for him to be in that position again. 

When I heard about the stories of stripclubs, brothels etc, I did mention to him that the thought of that made me uncomfortable and he assured me that anything like that had never appealed to him. I know this is true because he's passed up on opportunities for strip clubs before. However I'm very reluctant to bring up concerns about cheating on the tour. It doesn't change anything, I won't stop him going, and he's going to do what he's going to do, and I just need to trust that he'll make the right decisions. A week after the tour, we're going to Germany for the summer for internships and are living together. We have a wonderful relationship and I don't want him to think that I haven't trusted him all this time because I've seen how much that hurts him. 

So what do, reddit? I have a month of worrying about this before he goes, and I can't do that to myself. Talking to him is not an option I'd really like to go down because it changes nothing, it's not a confirmation of nothing happening, and I don't want to plant the seed of mistrust in the relationship again (or at least for him to be aware of it again). Does anyone have any input on how to stop worrying about this or is it inevitable?

33wzzb,3,2015-04-26,24 F4M Exercising your power at the White House Correspondents' Dinner :),[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/33wzzb/24_f4m_exercising_your_power_at_the_white_house/,"When I first received the invite to the White House Correspondent's dinner, I'd been incredibly excited - after all, this was an incredibly exciting evening! I'd picked out my most elegant, figure-hugging dress with care, been offered a wide range of expensive necklaces and bracelets by a handful of the world's most prestigious jewelers, and practiced every one of my elevator speeches to perfection. By the time I left the apartment I looked and felt a million dollars. But now that I was here, it was all very different.

Populated by the rich and powerful, everybody at the party seems more interested in photo opportunities and speeches than actually having fun. Businessmen hole themselves away in corners making deals, actors pose for photo opportunities with just about anybody they can find, and every politician is desperately grandstanding to every journalist in sight. I'm tired of all the speeches, jokes and photos... sick of the champagne... and utterly bored of the grandeur and prestige. For a girl in her 20s, an event like this can actually turn out to be a bit of a drag.

As I glide through the bustling crowd, I try my best to keep up appearances. I smile politely, shake hands where they're offered, and make periodic trips to the bathroom to ensure that my hair is still sat correctly, and that my cleavage isn't misbehaving. But that's it. With a sigh, I make my way toward the bar, grabbing a canape from a waiter's tray, and slide into a chair.

-----------

**Hi dpp! :) So that's my premise!**

Over the last few years, it seems like the White House correspondent's dinner has become more and more ""Hollywood"". No longer limited solely to journalists, it is now attended by powerful businessmen, wealthy actors, and a wide variety of distinguished guests. Ever wonder how that Russian supermodel ended up dating that nerdy old politician? How an innocent young journalist intern managed to get knocked up by one of Hollywood's biggest stars? Or how that pretty socialite first met her investment banker husband? It's at events like these.

In this scenario, I'll be an attractive young party-goer who doesn't really fit in. Maybe I'm an actress bored of all the speeches and jokes, a socialite tired of the photo ops, or a journalism intern just trying to survive and avoid any faux pas. You'll be ANYBODY in a position of status and power. Maybe you're an oil baron, an extremely influential venture capitalist, or perhaps a meteoric young politician... the choice is yours. Either way, I'm a big fan of power play, so would like you to have a ""seek and conquer"" type of mentality. You're one of the most successful men in the world, and therefore DESERVE to spend the evening with the prettiest thing in the room.

Big kings are: being submissive, impregnation and reluctance / dub con (but growing to like it)! We don't have to work all of those in, however! Bonus points for if you're articulate and intelligent too! If you send me a message, be sure to include the word vertigo so I know you read this far ;)

I usually prefer more fast-paced (but detailed) chats on sites like SexyTimeChat, but we could also do reddit pms too (I tend to lose interest if they go on for days / months though). Feel free to drop me a message with your character's details (and who you'd like me to play!) if this is your kind of scene! :) x

33x5nc,2,2015-04-26,"Budgeting advice - $70K student loans, good income, high future medical expenses",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/33x5nc/budgeting_advice_70k_student_loans_good_income/,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

I've been reading a lot of this subreddit and have seen some really good advice, so I'd like to get your take on how I should budget with a large student loan and some other factors contributing to my long-term goals.

I currently have a $70K student loan with an average of a little over 7% interest. The loans are in my parents' name for various reasons, but I pay the full amount monthly. They contribute a little bit when they can. I ask them not to, and they really haven't. 

They're taking out loans for my middle brother as well - his school is a lot cheaper. With all this they've managed to save quite a bit for retirement and will have pensions. They sometimes dip into the retirement for medical expenses, but not much. 

I really admire and respect them and haven't been as good as I should with them because of lots of stress in college, including panic attacks and a hospital visit. I'm very lucky to be stable and happy now.

The only debt I have is the student loan and a 0% interest car loan with about $21K left. I currently have about $10K in savings and $1.5K in checking, with a little over $2K in a particular stock I am optimistic about.

I was able to get a $95K / year job right out of college with a technical degree from a top school, so to me the debt was well worth it. After maxing employer-matching 401K contributions and taxes, my income is about $5K per month. Here's my original monthly budget:

$5K income

* $1K/month rent and insurance for a 1 bed 1 bath apartment

* $380 car loan

* $80 car insurance

* $80 gas

* $180 utilities - the last bill was $80, but I live in a hot state so over-budget a lot for A/C
* $80 Internet - no cable TV
* $1K student loan - minimum is slightly over $900

After fixed payments:

* $1K savings

* $400 food - sometimes more than this because my boyfriend eats at my apartment a lot and basically lives with me. He has 1 year left of college, so he doesn't have enough income to contribute much. I'm vegetarian, so that saves a lot on food.

That leaves $800 month in discretionary income, or $200 a week.

My boyfriend will be living with me over the summer during an internship and paying half the rent. He wants to pay half the costs and will be making $20 per hour. I don't think it's realistic for him to pay half the costs, but I could be wrong. I won't pressure him into doing so at all because he's rather uncomfortable with the income disparity already, and I'd rather not talk about it at this point. 

He is frugal. We have slightly different philosophies about money. He doesn't like talking about it and has relatively bad credit because of a late payment on a credit card transaction he took out for some family members. He's done some *really* sketchy stuff for family in the past that they asked him to do as a minor, without going into detail. They're good people but I couldn't imagine asking my kids to do that if and when I have them. He was pissed when I told him that their ask was crazy.

I love him and fully expect to marry him. I'd rather not mix finances. He was a little mad about that. I'd like some advice for best practices for discussing things like this when he graduates. He has slightly less income potential than I do but it's still good. He doesn't know how much he has in student loans. I don't expect it to be higher than $40K.

With a car down payment, apartment furniture, and an apartment deposit I haven't been sticking to that budget. I had also been eating out a lot with coworkers for lunch and spending a bit more than I'd like on alcohol. I cut down on both of these already.

One factor I'd like to mention is that my youngest brother is severely disabled and requires daily nursing care. He's had over 30 surgeries and is 15. My parents are in their 50s. We were lucky enough to receive state assistance for the nursing, but the medical costs are still large, even with good insurance. I will need to completely support him after my parents pass because I don't believe my middle brother will have high earnings. This is grim to think about, but I love my brother and want him to be happy and comfortable.

I had been stressing out a lot more than I should about money because I really want to take care of my youngest brother in the future. I know my situation's a lot better than some recent graduates and am very grateful for that.

Given all of this, what are your recommendations? I will try to cut down on discretionary spending. I don't have very expensive hobbies and am pretty content reading, but I really want to travel while I'm young as well. I'm not sure whether I should pay more on my student loans, save more, or invest. I'll try to cut down on discretionary spending on dumb things like alcohol.

Thanks for your advice. Sorry if the post is too long or rambling."

I have destroyed relationships, wasted innumerable opportunities and spent stomach churning sums of money all in the service of a mentally and physically destructive activity. If I had never smoked cannabis, without a doubt, my life today would be immeasurably better than it is now (Being a snake oil peddling expat trading on his inflated academic degrees and financial wordsmithery is hardly a way to make a living). 

Moreover, if I had never smoked I would not have opened the door to all manner of intrusive and ridiculous thought patterns that intrude on my sober mind (""What if I could fucking teleport anywhere in the world and be invisible? What would I do then?"" Great mate-really fucking constructive neural pathways to spend hours developing-staring at the fucking wall spacked out of your mind. ""What if me an X had got married and had some little half Asian-half scots super kids and I hadn't jacked in my internship at HM Treasury to smoke cannabis with a load of morons I went to school with""? Again great mate- you did chuck her and sack of your internship. Why? Because you got stoned instead. And now you’re staring at fucking wall thinking about all the cool shit your moronic lazy ""high IQ"" arse could have done if you had some fucking backbone and had not chronically absused a fucking flower) 

I cannot turn back the clock but if I never smoke again then my life in the future will be much better than it will be if I continue the cycle of  of quit, relapse, quit, relapse…………... Over and over and fucking over. Why can I never smoke again? Not just once? Just for tonight? Just a little bit? Because it will be (it always is) so good that I turn my life upside down every time just to stay high.....all for a feeling. 

Since I became addicted to Cannabis in the summer of 2012 I have quit and relapsed eleven times. Most of these relapses have been serious lengthly affairs, consuming all my free time and making me act like a total dead eyed sociopath at work and in my personal life. 

Next time I feel the urge to smoke I am going to fucking beast myself until I puke my guts out.

I don't remember what happened next. Anyone who wants to know how love begins may read novels and long stories; I will put it shortly and in the words of the same silly song:

     ""It was an evil hour
        When first I met you.""

Everything went head over heels to the devil. I remember a fearful, frantic whirlwind which sent me flying round like a feather. It lasted a long while, and swept from the face of the earth my wife and my aunt herself and my strength. From the little station in the steppe it has flung me, as you see, into this dark street.

Now tell me what further evil can happen to me?

How do we talk this out now?",throwaway24745,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/33xbgg/me_20_f_with_him_24_m_had_a_long_talk_about/,"Okay. This turned out to be a REALLY long post. Please feel free to just read the TL:DR and skip to the ""ACTUAL QUESTION"" part, the background is just for those that really want to get an idea of our relationship.


**Background:** I met Jamie (obviously not his real name) in August of last year. I'm a sophomore, he's in his first year of graduate school. Please, if you have anything to say about the age difference, I promise I've heard it before. I typically date a few years older than my age. Anyways, we're both in the same department at our university. He has an assistantship, I have a scholarship (both from the university and from the department itself). Given this, we both are required to work for the department. I don't want to give away too many personal details, as this is already identifiable enough. But to give you an idea of our working relationship - we work in the same overall field, but within different niches, different enough that we rarely do interact in the workplace, other than seeing each other in passing for a few minutes a day. We both have different designer roles within the department, so occasionally, we may be assigned to the same project with different designs. This hasn't happened yet, but if it were, our only real working interaction would be discussion at project meetings (held once a week for the duration of the project, figure about six to eight weeks) and minor collaboration outside of these meetings. I'm giving you all this detail to let you know that we do not work CLOSELY together. 

We do occasionally take classes together. As we work in a niche field, there are only a few professors in our department that teach anything close to what we will be doing in our ideal career paths, so they often combine graduate and undergraduate courses, giving a little extra coursework and more challenging projects to the graduate students to differentiate. As of yet, we have only taken one course together. Given that I have essentially completed my coursework for this major (I have a second major, completely unrelated - think Political Science and Art), it's pretty unlikely that in the next two years, we'll be taking more than one course, maybe two together. I'm giving you all this background so I can avoid the ""don't shit where you eat"" advice.

So anyways. We met in August and became close friends. We bonded through similar tastes in music, similar work ethics, same hobbies, sports teams - all of it. We get along great, 98% of the time. We began hanging out more when we realized we were the only two in our department who are 420 friendly, so we'd go smoke a bowl together occasionally and just shoot the breeze (I hope I used that properly). We had a great friendship. Fast forward a few months, it's November. I've been through a rough breakup at this point the month prior. Jamie supported me through the whole thing, been there for me, watched me cry, offered his shoulder, checked in on me regularly to see how I was holding up. He gets major kudos for listening to me and my boy drama. Anyways, so I've been working hard, both on my own and in therapy, to move on, and I'm feeling a lot better. Ex (we'll call him Kendall) has started to move on as well, casually dating Erin, who also works in our department, but not nearly as close. Imagine two different sets of graduate students, one solely for one field in our department, one divided into three different fields (and occasionally others) in the other. Kendall and Jamie are in the second set of grads, Erin is in the first set. Point is, I don't have to see Erin a lot, but her and Kendall spend a lot of time together and I'm fine with it, surprisingly. Jamie has helped me through and made it easier to move on. I did have a one night stand or two with an undergrad outside of our department in this time (I mention this only to prove that I'm past the ""rebound"" stage). 

So, after a few beers and a bowl, Jamie and I are watching a movie on his couch, flirty banter ensuing throughout. We're moving closer to each other, when suddenly we're holding hands. Then his arm is around me. Then we're kissing. It just felt right. I feel so safe and secure with him, I was so happy in that moment. I've been through rape/abusive relationships in the past and to just feel comfortable and safe and just *content* was sooo nice. We ended up having sex. A few hours later, once we've sobered up, we've got to get into work. We've got a half hour to kill, so I said ""Okay, let's talk about this."" I'm definitely not starting anything with a friend that close or someone I work with without 10000% clear communication. He says he doesn't want casual sex, but it seems hasty to just jump into a relationship. I completely agree, and suggest that we just date casually for a bit and see how things go. We also decide it's important to take things slow and really make sure they're going to work out before we publicize our relationship in the workplace. While our department doesn't have a problem with us dating, as they've had grad-undergrad relationships before, they do require that we disclose these relationships. So we wanted to make sure everything was going to work out with us before we had to inform our professors/bosses. 

We dated for six days. I was on top of the world, and so was he. I've never had a guy actually take me out on a date date before, and it was so sweet. This guy had been my best friend for a few months at this point, so we were completely comfortable with each other. Everything just felt *right*. Then, six days later, I get a text message, asking if we can meet up for lunch. We grab lunch, and as we're eating, he drops the bomb on me. ""I don't think we should do this. If things go south, it's just going to be bad for us, given that we work together."" I'm stunned at first, and just ask for a moment to think. On the one hand, I'd like to think we're both adults and able to handle ourselves professionally. We make each other so happy. Or at least, he makes me so happy, and has told me I make him happy - but I don't want to put words in his mouth. I think about it a little longer. We, unless one of us transfers, which isn't happening, are going to be working together until we graduate - spring of 2017. That's a guarantee. However, we are not guaranteed to date and remain happy for that long. That's true. So I tell him, while I had a wonderful time for those short few days, that he's probably right, and I'm okay with breaking things off. We agree to work on our friendship. 

Fast forward to March. Everything is fine with us. After a few days of awkwardness - mostly on my part, I'm an awkward person in general - we go back to normal. It's like we never dated, and we refer to those six days as ""just a little blip in our friendship."" Things are great with us - we're very emotionally supportive of each other, we work on our designs and homework together. We hang out at least twice a week, and get along great. Neither of us dates in this time, but neither is really interested. I'm still harboring feelings for Jamie. But I convince myself to put them aside and focus on our friendship, like we agreed. In March, we are both invited to attend a conference out of state. In the interest of saving money, we share a hotel room - we're not concerned about this, as I've slept over at his place many a time to avoid driving under the influence. We joke that his couch is my bed now. Long story short - surprise, surprise, we get drunk one night and end up kissing and fooling around. The next day, I ask if we can talk about it. He says it can just be a one time thing, we don't need to make it uncomfortable, it happened, we're sober now. Fine by me - but the next month we live in this state of flirtation and tension. I miss Jamie, and I'll flirt with him, but I'm not going to push him into anything, his friendship is way too valuable to me. 

**ACTUAL QUESTION TIME**
Fast-forward, early April. We are out of town again, working on an out of town project for our department. One night after work (we don't get in until around 11pm, so it's probably 1am at this point) we have a few drinks with two of our friends, Alec and Katie, two grad students who are dating. Alec works in our field, so Jamie and I are very close with him. Katie works for our department, but in a different area (same subset as Erin, who I mentioned earlier, damn this is a long post) so we aren't as close, but we like her a lot and have started spending more time with her now that she and Alec are together. Jamie and I decide to head out for a smoke break real quick (mostly to give Alec and Katie some alone time). We've both had a few drinks, but I'm at most tipsy, not drunk, and I was pretty sure he was on the same page.

I don't even remember how it happened, but suddenly Jamie is reaching down to kiss me. We kiss, and I say ""okay, let's finally address this. What the hell are we?"" We have a long, long, long conversation. We both confess mutual feelings for each other, that we've both wanted this since we broke up. We both want something more, something serious. We decide to casually date again through the remainder of the school year, keep in touch over summer, and re-evaluate when we return. As a result of our summer internships, we won't see each other for four months. 

Then, Jamie tells me it bothers him that I've slept around, and wants to know if I'm hiding anything from him. I confess that Alec and I had drunkenly fooled around a few months prior, but we were both so fucked up that nothing really happened and we agreed it wouldn't happen again. I agree to tell him everything, the guys I've messed around with that he knows. I know he personally has a problem with casual sex - I just lost my virginity last summer (well, first time I've had consensual sex), and have been having the occasional night of fun. I've by no means gone overboard, I've had safe, consensual sex with a few partners who I can count on my fingers. I know it bothers him, so to make him feel better I let him know everything, know that I'm not hiding anything from him. He makes a few other comments, like it bothers him how much I curse. This is something I've noticed in myself and been wanting to work on, so I have no problem telling him I'll work on it. And I have, I've worked so hard the last few weeks to cut it down, among the few other things he brought up. 

So after this long talk, we go to bed (separate rooms) and everything is hunky dory. I've gone along for two weeks thinking we were casually dating and everything has been great. Occasionally we'd grab dinner, occasionally we'd have sex. I've just been happy being with my best friend. The other night, we're doing homework together. He's had a few (maybe three?) beers, I'm sober. I don't remember how it came up, but I brought up that long conversation we had about feelings and whatnot. He said something along the lines of ""wait, what?"" So I prod a little more and...he doesn't remember this. He doesn't remember this conversation at all. He was apparently, drunker than I thought. He does have a history of forgetting after he's been drinking, but I do too...he is essentially twice my size (5'4"", 145lbs to his 6'7"", 280) and we'd been drinking the same amount, but I guess he doesn't hold his liquor as well as I do, because he has ZERO recollection of this conversation. He's been drinking at this point. So I tell him what we talked about, but not exactly what we said or decided. I realize I've spent two weeks thinking we were dating and he's spent two weeks thinking we were still in this weird limbo. I told him we need to talk about this when we are both sober. So I left that night (it was late and I was getting ready to leave anyways). We haven't had time to meet up since, but we're meeting tonight to talk about it. 

**REALLY THE ACTUAL QUESTION NOW**
My question is, how the hell do I even bring this up? I decided it doesn't really matter how he felt when he was drunk, it matters to me how he feels sober and what he wants now. Do I just ask how he feels, where he wants us to go? Do I tell him what we decided? If he tells me this isn't something he wants, do I tell him I thought we've been dating for two weeks when apparently we weren't? I feel like I need to let him know what happened and where my head was at in order to help him understand why I've been pretty upset about this/having a hard time communicating with him about it. But at the same time, if this isn't something he wants, I don't want him to feel bad, it's not his fault he can't remember...I don't know what to do. How would you approach this situation? 

   
**tl;dr**: Best friend and I, after a long period of flirtation, had a conversation and decided to date casually. This was two weeks ago - I just found out he was too drunk to actually remember the conversation. How do I bring this up with him? "

I can't afford to spend more than 150 (with tax and shipped) at the moment and need to compromise on quality. I would be happy if this new pair of shoes could last me at least 2 years since I come from buying Macys shoes that barely last barely 4 months ( I do wear my dress shoes almost everyday) and walk on sidewalks often when commuting which eats the sole like crazy.)

If you guys could give me direct links to specific models of shoes or sites where I can browse, that would be good. I don't know much of the good brands, if you guys could give me good brands within my budget, that would be great. 

I can also look around at my local TjMaxx and Marshalls for some pairs. Anything in specific that I should look for in shoes? Brands? Do rubber soles really mean bad quality?

I like zappos alot, what are good brands to search for there?

I know about Allen Edmunds but the circumstance of time and my tight budget, I will unfortunately have to wait for a pair of them in the future.

I'm new to this subreddit. I have recently gotten into Haskell, and I'm loving it so far. The functional paradigm is a really fun way to reason about programming.

So, like the title says, this summer I do not have an internship lined up, so my plan is to do a lot of personal projects, post a lot on github, contribute to open source projects, and possibly attend tech meetups to network. As such, I should probably learn as much as I can this summer, right?

I really want to get good at Haskell, though, like really really good. And functional programming in general. My question is, if I spend all of my summer doing Haskell, getting good at it and doing a lot of good work with it, would I have a shot at getting interviews for places that use functional programming, even if I don't have too much experience with other languages? 

Either way, I will probably dabble in more popular languages like Scala, Erlang, F#, etc, but as of now I'm making haskell a priority. Should I split the time more evenly, or will learning haskell pay more dividends when it comes to being a better programmer, and still not hurt my chances of getting interviews at places whose stack is heavily functional based?

Like to flirt, tease, talk dirty, and play? You found the right person. Let's have a bit of a build up until we can't take it any more.

I have a few fantasies in mind, but I'm open to other ones. In general, my kinks are D/s, exhibitionism, dirty talk, ageplay, incest (Dad/dau), bondage, some rough play, cum play, impreg. Limits include toilet stuff and non-con.

Here are the fantasies I've been thinking about:

1) Dad/dau play. Maybe you're my secretary or a new intern. Maybe you're just playing hooky to come visit Daddy at work. While others may think you're innocent, Daddy knows what a dirty girl you really are. Or maybe you're just an out and out slut. Maybe we can have some people watch or join in? Or maybe we have to sneak around.

2) I read a cuckquean scenario the other night and it caught my attention. I don't have a lot of experience with this one, but it sounds like fun. You're the other woman--younger, hotter, kinkier, wilder. What would you do to tease my wife while we play? How would you drive her wild with jealousy or put her in her place?

3) It started off innocently enough. You heard Mommy and Daddy making noises at night. That led to listening and peeking, and snooping. You found the outfits, the toys, the porn. And you liked it all. You wanted what Mommy had, and you were convinced you could do it better. Kinkier, louder, dirtier. Anything with Daddy. So you stated to dress differently, act differently. Flirting led to touching, then kissing, then fucking. And you were right. You are better. Daddy now prefers you. You just need to find ways to sneak around and have your secret fun. How far will you go? How extreme, how blatant?"
33xo90,3,2015-04-26,UK undergraduate looking to study a masters degree in the US.,PM_Me_Compliments,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/33xo90/uk_undergraduate_looking_to_study_a_masters/,"Hey, so I am heading into my final year of my CompSci degree here in the UK. I am studying at a top 15 university and am on track to achieving a first.

My hope is to study a masters in the US after I graduate but I am struggling to find information that isn't either confusing or overwhelming. 

I am looking for any information in the following areas:

___

**Costs**

* Financial aid and scholarships for international students, what is offered and what am I eligible for? 

* Part-time jobs for international students, am I allowed to work in the US? 

* I heard there are schemes where in return for financial aid I can help the university in various ways, research, office work, etc. Is that a thing? If so what is it called?

* I am aware of costs in tuition, accommodation, cost of living, visas and flights. Is there anything I am missing.
___

**Application Process**

* What is the application process? Is there a timeline of when I should do what?

* I don't really understand GPA? It seems that 4.0 is the best but I have also seen other scales which is confusing? We don't have them in the UK but they are required for US colleges, so is a first class degree in the UK comparable to a GPA score? Or does it not work like that?

* Aside from grades is anything else taken into account for post grad entry? Such as work experience, side projects, extra-curricular activities? Also from movies I learnt that college essays are a thing, would I need to do one also?

* Here in the UK, we apply to university with a UCAS application. On that application we choose 5 universities to apply for. Is that the case in the US? Is there a general application that everyone uses or do you just apply to schools that you want to go to? Is there a limit?

* Is the undergrad and post-grad application process the same, aside from the level of degree you're applying too? 
___

**General**

* Should I look for public or private schools? Are private schools better or worse? 

* Of course I want to go to an Ivy League school. Is that unlikely for international students or are the amount of international students accepted at Ivy schools similar to non-ivy? Also here in the UK an elite school like Oxford costs the same as the worst school, is that the case in the US?

* Am I eligible for internships? 
___

**Visas**

* Do I have to apply for a visa completely separately from my college application. My research seems to bring up a 'Visa Lottery', so lets say I get accepted to a college but I don't get a visa for whatever reason (because I don't get picked from a lottery or whatever) what happens then?

* What happens after my masters? Must I go back to the UK or am I able to stay and work in the US?

* Is there a requirement that I must have a certain amount of money in my bank account to be eligible for a visa? Right now I am poor student that earns very little money and is relying on student loans to apply.
___

Sorry for the huge amount of questions and the frankly inarticulate post, I am just confused about where to start my research so any information would be hugely appreciated."

The static fire took place on April 22, and no issues were reported.  This vehicle was originally slated to go up prior to CRS-6, but was delayed due to potential defects in the helium pressurization bottles; no defects were found, but the bottles were still swapped out just to be safe.

### Mission
The TurkmenÄlem52E/MonacoSat mission will see Falcon 9 launch Turkmenistan's first satellite into geostationary transfer orbit.  The satellite was funded by Turkmenistan, will sit in the Principality of Monaco's orbital position 52E, hence the long mission name.  It was built by the Thales Group of France, and weighs approximately 4500kg.

Based upon Thales’ medium-class Spacebus 4000 C2 satellite platform, the 9,920-pound (4,500-kg) TurkmenÄlem52E/MonacoSat will benefit from dual-array solar power provision of up to 15.8 kilowatts and up to 11.6 kilowatts of payload capability, enabling around 80-100 active channels with medium Radio Frequency (RF) power and coverage across the Ku/C and Ka frequency bands. In November 2011, Thales contracted with Turkmenistan Ministry of Communications to build the satellite—together with two Ground Control Stations and associated services, including an internship program to train a team of Turkmen operators—with the expectation that it would provide the Central Asian nation with its first National System of Satellite Communications.

""This is a very important milestone for our customer, Turkmenistan Ministry of Communication, and for our company, and we would like to thank all the parties involved in this project since the beginning,” said Reynald Seznec, President and CEO of Thales Alenia Space, after the contract award. “Co-operation with Turkmenistan is strategically important for Thales Group and this contract is further reinforcing our already existing relations.” It was noted that the satellite would utilize the 52E orbital position of the Principality of Monaco—also known as “MonacoSat-1,” hence its cumbersome name—via the Monaco Satellite Operator Space Systems International-Monaco (SSI), and would be equipped with “Ku-band transponders covering large beams over Central Asia Region.” Of the satellite’s 38 transponders, it is expected that 12 will be dedicated to SSI usage.

This is SpaceX's fifth launch of the year, the 18th launch of Falcon 9, their 23rd launch overall, and second launch in April!

33xrso,26,2015-04-26,What made you want to get networking/IT?,corehazard,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/33xrso/what_made_you_want_to_get_networkingit/,"Hey everybody, 

I have wanted to be a network/systems administrator since 8th grade. The main reason for it, is that I got a C in Algebra I and knowing that a degree in computer science or engineering requires lots of heavy duty math and physics. I have always enjoyed working with PC Hardware and OSs, since I was 11.  When I took Algebra II the following year, it only got worse. In 11th grade, I got to take a 16 week web development class, thankfully it didn't count as a grade and was free. In the fourth week when we went into Javascript and types of logic, I felt like there is no way that I could see myself doing this for living. HTML and CSS didn't give me much trouble. 

 Networking in general seems simpler than programming. Even my networking teacher who has a B.S. in Information and Computer Technology and is CCNP certified, said that networking engineering is a ""light form of engineering"", when compared to say programming or electrical engineering. 

Currently I'm in my second of year college at a community college, will be transferring to the same four year college, that my networking teacher went to, pursuing the same degree as him. Have been A+ Certified since my sophomore year of high school and currently CCNA certified. Also have CCENT, Net +, and Sec +. Currently don't have a job and will be doing an IT internship as part of my degree, only IT job experience includes working at a local PC shop and an internship on my college's IT help desk. 

How,why, and when did everyone else here get into IT? "

I have a GPA of ~3.4.  I've been applying and interviewing for internships since my freshman year with no luck.  Since I come from a very poor family I get exorbitant amounts of work-study funds from the government, and I was hired in the HR department of a non profit where I have been working for the last 8 months.  Some of the interviews I had for this summer seemed highly promising but did not pan out, so my bosses at the non profit gave me a full time seasonal position as an HR clerk no questions asked.  The pay is on par with that of a summer internship, and I need the money for summer classes if I want to graduate on time.

In the long run I want to get into trading, pursue a masters degree once my life shows some signs of stability (I can't afford to live in this area if left unemployed, home is an 8 hour drive away).  My resume is on par with my peers minus the internships, I have extracurricular experience in both equity valuation and derivative trading, but recruiters in those fields have yet to give me the time of day. 

I feel like I'm falling into a trap.  I don't want to be in human resources, but it pays better than fast food.  My recent work history is  sparsely relevant to my career choice (and only when I can successfully play it up in an interview).  In an interviewers eyes it looks like I might as well have done nothing for the past year.  

How can I transition into a finance career before I graduate?"

I wasn't sure where to direct this so hopefully I'm in the right place. I went into college thinking I wanted to be a web designer and got my associate degree in Media/Visual art. I have been talking with my adviser these past few weeks and am confused and anxious about where to go from here. I want to go into networking, but will need to complete atleast another 2 years of pre-requisites before even being able to transfer to a larger state university where I could get my bachelors in computer science with a focus on networking(which will also take 2 years). I live about 30 minutes away from a well known technical college, which offers a certificate program for networking. The college route will yield me a bachelors degree, but the technical college will be more affordable and I will get more hands on experience. The technical college also has some good opportunities for internships. I just am not sure which is better in the long run and how important a bachelors degree really is for this line of work. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks."

I already have a table for these notes coded in the model but am unsure how to implement this from the front end. I've been trying to look into using AJAX but have been unsuccessful so far. 

Right now the clients information shows up in a partial view. I'd like to have a text area for the note and a button to submit. At first I tried putting an Ajax.ActionLink in the button. This worked somewhat but I could not figure out how to pass the text area text in with the clients ID. Then I tried writing my own script that used the jquery ajax function and using the data field to pass in the id and text. This I couldn't get to do anything. 

Ideally I'd like to have the button wired to both update the database and add the note to a dynamic list that appears underneath the text area along with previous notes. However, right now I'd be happy to be getting the id and text to the controller so I can deal with it there. 

I'm pretty green to jquery, ajax, mvc, and entity framework so please be gentle."

***

I have been known my current girlfriend for about six years now, through the end of middle school and throughout high school. We went through phases where we were really close friends and then really hated each other then FWB then close friends again, and now we’re dating and we have been for around 6 months. We went to an international school where us dating was never really an option for us. We graduated and went our separate ways and continued to talk over the past summer and while it was obvious there was a connection there, we didn’t really do anything because of the unspoken “Long-distance is stupid” and “You’re supposed to be free in uni” rules. She is going to apply to go to university in Europe next year, so she’s been doing internships and has a job this year, while I’ve been studying in the UK. 
***
For about 5 months from the summer of last year to November, we kept in close contact, still talking often and in November we decided that we didn’t care that it was long-distance and we wanted to be together, so we bit the bullet and started dating, which was great. We said we love each other really early because of how close we’d already been prior to dating and we were really happy together, I’m guessing in the “honey-moon” period of the relationships. Of course, there were some minor stresses on the relationship, but whatever, we got past them and discussed them and helped each other through everything. I’ve visited her frequently and she’s visited me, so we’re trying to work through the distance as well.
***
Here’s the dilemma. My girlfriend has suffered from anxiety and depression for a while. It flares up when she’s stressed and I’ve known this and when we were friends in high school I tried to help her get through tough times and it helped. She was doing fine for quite a prolonged period of time from November to about a month ago. As of late, she has had monetary issues, her being far away from myself and her friends (she’s at home while all of us have gone to university in the states or the uk or wherever), and general stress with applying to universities and maintaining her job while also dealing with her overbearing family. This means that her depression and anxiety have sky-rocketed to new levels and it also means that she’s becoming more and more distant from myself and her friends. She’s told me that she’s “feeling numb” and “emotionless.” She doesn’t say she misses me when I say it to her, and she stopped saying she loves me when I say it to her. I’ve stopped saying these things to her because it kind of hurts not hearing it back, and I also don’t want her to feel an obligation to say these things to me. She’s not one to beat around the bush or fake feelings or say things when she doesn’t mean it so I’m not going to force her to say anything by being selfish and saying it to her when I know what the answer will be. (Right?)
***
I’m a student who’s studying medicine as well as some psychology so I know a bit about depression, and I’m also trying my best to learn even more about it so I can try empathise or understand or be supportive to her. I know that it’s a disease, and I don’t know if it’s just my “fix-it-all” brain working here, but from what I’ve read, I’ve seen that therapy and maybe taking something will help her in her path to recovery. 
Her family isn’t overly supportive, as depression, unfortunately, is not seen as a “proper illness.” I see it like I would see cancer and if you had cancer, you wouldn’t just ignore the signs, and you’d go see help, and that’s what I want her to do. She’s acknowledged the need to go to therapy, but with so much work and studying, she hasn’t gone, and I don’t ask and follow up on these things because I don’t want her to feel like I’m being pushy and I don’t want her to end up resenting me for it. 
***
We had a talk today, where we discussed the distance between us, both emotionally and physically, and we discussed how she feels and how I feel. She was saying how she feels anxious in the relationship because of the pressure she feels to be involved. She feels as though she’s not being fair on me by being “a wall” while I’m being the whole relationship by myself and being affectionate without reciprocation. I told her that it’s not her place to judge what’s fair on me or not, and I know what I can handle and I will obviously tell her if anything is bothering me and if anything is going wrong. She was saying that she doesn’t know how long it’s going to be like this, and she doesn’t know how to move forward because it’s something she doesn’t have control over. I don’t know if it’s just me being overly optimistic, but I just kept trying to tell her that I didn’t mind because I knew that it would all work out but she was still unsure and thinks that I’ll end up resenting her, or she’ll end up resenting me for trying to help and not being able to. I told her that I’ll be there IF she ever needs me and I won’t push anything on her because I obviously can’t completely understand what she’s going through and I don’t want her to hate me for being ignorant. I wouldn’t resent her if she has a physiological disease, so why should I for her having a mental one?
***
I have a blind faith in everything working out for the better, and I never want to give up on anything, and I truly believe that she’s strong enough to overcome her depression and anxiety, with the help of treatment, and that we’re strong enough as a couple to move past this and be happy. 
***
I know that this isn’t an issue that is unique to us, and many couples face depression as a barrier, and some overcome it and some don’t, and I know that no-one can predict the future, but I just am blindly optimistic that with the right action, it’ll all work out. I really don’t want this relationship to end because of depression and I know the burden and I know how hard it may be, but for me, I knew the risks when I got into the relationship, and I know the hardships now, but it’s still worth it for me.
***
1. I guess my question is, or my looking for answers is, does anyone have any similar experience or advice? 
***
2. I feel as though therapy would be a great help, but I don’t want to be pushy, so how can I try encourage her to get help ASAP without her hating me? You wouldn’t postpone cancer treatment, so why should you wait out getting help for depression?
***
3. Am I even doing the right thing here? I know the risks for myself, and I truly want to be with her no matter what, so how do we move forward?
***
4. Is there any way I can ease her mind about feeling bad about the relationship?



   
**tl;dr**: My girlfriend is suffering from depression and it's putting strain on our relationship. I love her and I want anything for her to get better and be happy but she's worried. How do I ease her mind and how do we move forward?"
33yk53,13,2015-04-26,"My younger sister graduates soon, and memories of how my graduation went last year are making the both of us not look forward to it. Story inside, any advice to surviving this a second time?",orsomethinglikeit,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/33yk53/my_younger_sister_graduates_soon_and_memories_of/,"This is my first post here that isn't a comment in another thread. I hope I'm not mistaken in thinking it belongs here. Sorry it's so long - there's a lot of rambling on my part to try and explain my mom's behavior, since I'm not sure it comes out in the story by itself all too well.

My sister and I are a year apart school-wise. I graduated college last year, and in a few weeks my sister will be graduating as well. I was hoping perhaps I could get some advice for surviving the shit show I'm sure it will turn into.

Last year, I graduated and was fortunate enough to have a job offer to start a week after graduation (it was technically a paid internship). Before I'd even graduated, I told my mom the good news and her first reaction was to be upset that we can't go on ""one last family vacation together."" Uh, what family vacation? If one was being planned, I certainly never heard of it. She congratulated me after, but I digress.

My graduation day was the same day I had to move out of my school-affiliated apartment. So after sitting and getting sun burnt in an obnoxiously long ceremony, I had to put up with my mom's billions of pictures she took, which was fine but all I wanted to do was get the fuck out. Didn't help that she insisted on taking pictures in front of things such as a statue of a football player I had no connection to, and the like. At this point I felt disgusting and wanted to just pack up my crap and go to the hotel room they'd rented for the night.

So we get back to my room which is mostly packed but not completely. My sister also lived with me, so we were packing both of our things into two cars - my parents' and the one my sister and I shared, but would be keeping as I would be staying in town to start my job. Queue my parents getting angry - we have too much crap, why didn't we pack more earlier, etc. etc. Yelling, my mom bitching about dealing with the loud vacuum cleaner to use the space bags we bought (which I had suggested the night previously, but they didn't get until that day, and somehow it was my fault I didn't suggest them earlier/they were a pain to use), my dad bitching about nothing fitting into the car. 

I've moved in and out of dorm apartments all four years of school, and I never saw another pair of parents get so angry to the point of yelling at each other or at their children. I was tired and heat-exhausted and was doing my best to pack things up, but I wasn't very much involved with getting the stuff into the cars. Soon my dad started complaining that the cars were almost full, and how the fuck would we fit everything inside. My mom naturally started bitching about how hard she was working (she was literally just holding the vacuum nozzle, and sitting still, but god knows she was working the hardest out of everyone. &gt;.&gt; ).

My parents continue to yell at my sister and I and at one another about how impossible it will be to pack everything up between the two cars, until they start talking about getting my boyfriend to come back and take some of my stuff. My boyfriend had left the graduation right after he walked on stage (smart move, in my opinion), and the apartment complex was full of cars coming and going, both moving people out and because people were parking for the second graduation ceremony. It was a pain in the ass to come or go into the complex. I told my parents this, but they were convinced there was no other way to fit things in the cars. So I called him, and reluctantly asked him to come. So he did.

He and my sister's boyfriend (who has been with us the whole day), start to help us grab some of the bags of stuff while my parents are doing who knows what. We get to the cars, ready to cram what we can into mine and then pile the rest in with my boyfriend's. Well, we get to my car, and guess what?

The damn thing is nearly empty. A few bags of my things are in there, but there's plenty of room.

I'm livid. We pack my stuff up, and go back inside, and I yell at my parents asking why the hell they were telling me the cars were full. My mom says she wouldn't know because she's been working hard packing everything inside. My dad says it's my fault, because if I'd been bringing things out to the cars I would have known. The fact that I was packing my crap up inside, and I was exhausted and slightly delirious from that and sitting in the sun for hours obviously meant nothing. My boyfriend was pissed (luckily, he knew it wasn't my fault), and I was pissed too. Eventually he left when it was obvious he wasn't needed (he had things to do at home; his parents are quite demanding of him), but I couldn't really get over the fact my parents had been so uncaring. It took my boyfriend a full half hour just to leave the complex, and even longer to get home.

Eventually, we got to the hotel room. We tried to take naps but I was so angry and exhausted I didn't sleep. At some point I opened presents and we had dinner. My mom then presented me with a HUGE suitcase - she had gone shopping at the Salvation Army for work clothes for me. She'd asked me if I minded her doing so, but I was expecting a few items, not a huge suitcase. The thing would obviously not fit in my car with the rest of my belongings crammed in (I was essentially moving out with my small Ford Focus holding everything I would be moving to my new place with). I then had to parade around in the dozens and dozens of clothes because my mom would ""just take back anything that wouldn't fit"". Even then, there were a lot of clothes. Most of it wasn't really my taste, but I knew better than to say it in front of her. 

But that didn't remove the fact that the suitcase wouldn't fit in my car. I suggested taking the clothes and rolling them to make them smaller, and sticking them in a flexible bag we had that would be easier to squeeze into the car. My mom asked if that was necessary, because she'd spent all her time ironing the clothes and folding them nicely. I looked at her and said I had no physical way of taking them in that suitcase. She got upset, but eventually ""let me"" roll the clothes up and put them in the separate bag.

This is what my mom does. She is helpful in a way that is inconvenient. When she comes to visit my sister (who has still been at school in the same town I now live in) she'll bring me waaaay more food than I can fit in my fridge shared with essentially four other people, and get upset when I say I can't take it all. She'll also bring me random stuff like canned beans and other things I don't cook with/eat, and be upset when I say it's too much stuff, (""Well *SORRY* for trying to save you some money""). I'll tell her to stop, that I'm living on my own and I can take care of myself, but she'll still try to give me things that I don't need. Half the shit in my room currently is crap she gave me that I just don't know what to do with, and I'm too much of a sucker to just toss it.

Anyway. My sister is graduating soon, as I said. The differences from my graduation are as such: she's the only one moving out this time, so only my sister's things need to be packed. She has her own car and my parent's to fill, so there's plenty of space. Her graduation should be shorter than mine, so hopefully no heat exhaustion on her part. My boyfriend most likely won't be there (he's in med school now, and although he has a lot of friends graduating this year, he probably can't make it), but my sister's boyfriend will be. 

HOWEVER, my parents and my sister's boyfriend have been awkward around each other, because there was a period of time last summer where he was experiencing some drama and didn't talk to my sister much, and she made the mistake of letting my parents know, so now they don't like him despite the fact he's super sweet to her (still not sure he's the best partner for my sister, but I don't think he treats her badly in a way that causes concern). So now there'll be me, the child my mom doesn't like, and him, the boyfriend my mom doesn't like, and my dad who I don't think is an N but can have a bad temper in stressful moments like these.

I'm hoping that things will be calmer this time around, especially since I'm not the center of attention this time, but I'm still worried. It will be Mother's Day that Sunday, and I don't think my mom will demand attention but who knows. I've also greatly limited my contact with her over the past year and especially the past few months, and I'm afraid she'll be emotional over that, especially with my sister leaving our college town, she won't have any reason to visit, nor will I have someone to drive me home during major holidays (I have a pretty severe driving anxiety so I'm not willing to drive the two hours home to my parents, especially not since my mom treats me like crap when things don't go her way).

Any advice on how my sister and I can survive her graduation, and hopefully prevent or minimize my parents going crazy? I already told her to pack up what stuff she can before the day so it's literally grab and go, but the last few weeks with finals and such can be stressful so I'm not sure how possible that is.

TL;DR: Parents get super stressed/angry when dealing with the stress of attending our graduation/helping my sister and I move out of our school apartment. They tend to cause a lot of drama in the name of being ""helpful"". Any ideas to minimize the stress/keep the parents from going nuts?"

Doesnt really seem fair to me, I mean, anyone can say that, in fact, you know how incompetent people tends to have the best opinion of their own skills, I'm sure employers are aware of that.

On the other hand, I know for a fact after doing college + work that I actually do have above average problem solving skills, which makes me good at software development, thats why I chose this career in the first place, and it would be a shame not to let a potential employer know.

I wouldnt want to give a bad impression because of this small detail, so, what do you guys think? would you put that into the resume, or only things that you have proof of (eg X months of experience)?

I'm a new graduate and only did internships so backing it up with archievements is not an option yet"

I[22 M] work 3 hours away from everyone, and everything is falling apart.",throwawaymaterialidk,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/33yote/my_sister18f_is_depressed_and_treats_my_parents/,"If you have it in you to read this entire story, I appreciate it immensely. If you skip to the tl;dr, I still appreciate it. Things have been boiling up for years now between my family members, but it became kind of serious today, and I am running out of advice to give to my family when they call me crying/screaming/angry/etc. I just don't really know how to fix the situation, which is why I'm posting here. But, alas, the situation.

Background: My parents got a divorce when I was in 4th grade and my sister was in kindergarten. Obviously there are a lot of things that play into a divorce decision, but the two big factors were my dad's short and very abrasive temper, and my mom cheating. I think it probably would have ended whether my mom cheated or not, but that certainly didn't help things. After this, my sister lived with with my mom and weekdays and visited my dad on weekends - they only lived about 30 mins apart. 

Fast forward to me graduating high school and going off to college. I was a very good kid by all standards... I played sports year round, maintained high honor roll, got along very well with both parents, had friends that were more or less the same as me, and ended up being sort of a mediator for my entire family. My parents got along really well at this point actually. I mean well to the point of my dad, his girlfriend, and my mom could all hang out and it would be chill. Throughout these years, my sister had increasingly become a stereotypical brat girl teenager in the sense that, whatever the situation, it was her way or no way, and if it was no way, she'd cry and sulk until that changes. But whatever, she was like 14 - this isn't totally unexpected. Her relationship with my mom was a bit strained because of what I mentioned above, and her relationship with my dad was a bit strained because they didn't really have common interests and neither of them wanted to go out of their way to hang with the other. Also, when my sister was a brat, my dad did't take it and yelled back. They are actually very similar people... both always right and usually unwilling to compromise, but I'd say my sister was a bit worse. Throughout this time, I think my sister had gotten the impression that I was the ""favorite"" because my parents were always pleased with my success and lack of rebellion. In hindsight, I think this may be a significant part of the current situation.

In my college years, I was about 2 1/2 hours away. I was home during summer and on breaks, but the last 2 years of school I had internships pretty far away from home. In this time, things started deteriorating more and more. My sister's relationship with my mom got pretty bad for no apparent reason besides my mom may have been bit overbearing in terms of parenting, and my sister decided she was annoying and didn't want her in her life that much. I'd get calls from both of them crying and yelling about the other on a semi regular basis. Eventually, my sister demanded that she go to a different school and live with my dad. To my mom's dismay, this happened, but it didn't really go great. The problems with my sister on my dad were magnified because my sister is extremely disrespectful, and as I mentioned earlier, my dad doesn't quietly take it like my mom. The next year, my sister demanded she switch schools again. This shcool was the next district over, so it still made sense for her to ""live"" with my dad. To get to this new school, she'd need a car. My parents were going to get her a car anyway, but she literally demanded one and gave them a date on which she'd need a car or, and I quote, ""she wasn't sure what she'd do to herself."" That was kind of her method for everything..get really mad and sulk and threaten self harm and generally be incredibly rude to everyone that didn't do what she demanded. Every time, it increased tensions with her and my parents, and also tensions between my parents themselves because of their alternate parenting styles. 

Now, I have graduated and just started working (early Feb) about 3 hours away from everyone. My sister is about to go off to college, except she demands she go to a specific private school because I was able to go to an expensive private school as well sue to my good grades and actual drive to go to a good school and get a good job. My sister, although she has decent grades (low 90s high 80s), thinks that she deserves everything that I had just because I had it, and if she doesn't get equal treatment, it's not fair. If may parents or I say she should go to a cheaper school or something, she says she just won't go at all. She's also not exactly sure what she wants to do, and sending a girl to college that will require 20k out of pocket (after financial aid and scholarships) is logically ridiculous. But better not tell her that. Throughout all of this, she has increasingly disrespected and lied to my parents about multiple things and been a pretty bad kid by all accounts. Besides being disrespectful, she doesn't take care of her car at all, is a complete slob, expects my mom to take care of everything for her without doing anything nice in return, etc. 

Things kind of ebb and flow as far as everyone getting along, but the other day my sister got caught red handed in a lie and my dad took her car away while she was at work. He wanted an in person apology and a commitment that she would be more respectful, but she doesn't want to see him at all because she doesn't think he should be in her life at all. My mom, who has committed to pay for this super expensive school mostly by herself with a lone (at least for a year) has been trying to help my sister, but my sister says she feel uncomfortable with my mom as well. 

Her reasoning is that my mom still see's on occasion the guy that she cheated on my dad with, and my sister has decided that she will no longer ever go to my moms house again unless she agrees to never see him again. I also think my mom could do a lot better and its a bit ridiculous, but its also her own life and she can do what she wants. My sister thinks she is a victim of a broken family all of a sudden, except everyone gets along with everyone, except her. 

After hours of conversation on the phone between my mom, dad, and I, my dad was going to give my sister back her car to go to school and work, but only those places. Basically, she gets the car back under certain conditions. My mom texted my sister about these conditions and she wasn't having it, demanded her car, but still didn't want to see either of them. 

My mom then drove to my sisters friend's house where she had been staying (because she doesn't feel comfortable with my mom or dad) but my sister was MIA and only her friend was there. Her friend and my mom had a long talk about my sister in which they discussed that she seemed very depresses, was taking typical high school drama really hard, and has been a mess lately. I guess she throws up the defenses when dealing with parents or anyone, but all alone is a bit more self aware. Still, she works herself up so much about everything she pukes. 

After this talk, my mom drove to my dads house to inform him of all this and try to convey that no, her behavior is not acceptable, but she needs support more than discipline and they need to develop a plan for that. My dad, who had apparently been drinking while trying to fix her car up for her, just lost it when my mom said that my sister had been dealing with drama convincing certain people that are total scum (have stolen from my dad during a party my sister refuses to take responsibility for) and slammed the hood on her car, smashed jumper cables against it, called both my mom and sister every name under the sun, then literally beat her (legally his) car with a field hockey stick out or rage.

My mom left because she was feeling unsafe, and that's when she called me and informed me of everything. This is going to mean my sister definitely won't want to see my dad, my mom and dad's relationship is looking bad, and my sister really still doesn't like either one and says without a car she'll drop high school, drop college, and also is threatening suicide in general because she is so miserable. 

I'm worried about her because I really believe she is depressed and has a problem, but her ridiculously disrespectful behavior is the root of a lot of these problems. She always has to be a victim of something, furthers that mindset when someone doesn't give in. My dad lost it today which is not okay at all, but tbh, he has a lot of reasons to be very upset with her and not allow the privilege of a car, What he did today was very wrong, but the basis of his anger is legitimate. My mom has tried her hardest to reach out to my sister and take care of her, but my sisster completely resents her and only looks at the broken family angle, not the angle where my mom has done everyhting she can to support her. 

Now I'm worried that my sister won't get to college, maybe not even finsih hs, and potentially inflict harm on herself because of her mental state about most things. Idk whats going to happen with my dad at this point, and my mom is just slowly breaking down. I get all of these calls, and this stuff usually doesn't get to me much, but it's starting to. And I'm not even around, so the best I can offer is phone advice which makes me feel guilty for all of this too. 

I'm not really sure what to do. The family is spiraling down, everyone is at fault a bit, and I don't know how to make it better. What can I do? What can they do? I don't know to handle all this. What is my next play?

I apologize for the typos that I probably made everywhere. I wrote this at a rapid pace. Felt good to type it all out. 

tl;dr - my sister is very disrespectful and pretty much refuses t speak to my parents but expects them to bend over backwards for her while she plays the victim. My dad lost his temper, beat my sisters car after taking it away for a legitimate reason, and I don't know how to salvage their relationship. My mom has tried to be the sensible one, but my sister is making it increasingly difficult to support her and everyone is at each others' throats, and  I only see it getting worse. My sister should be going to college soon, but I don't know if that will happen or not. She is threatening suicide. I'm 3 hours away, and can't help besides calming everyone down over the phone. How do we fix this?

I'm starting to like someone else.",otterswearinghats,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/33zi40/22f_ive_been_with_my_long_distance_boyfriend_22m/,"My boyfriend and I are both students at different schools 300 miles apart from each other. He comes home during summer, school breaks, and some weekends. On average, we get to see each other about every 4-5 weeks. I'm a part-time student working a retail job, my boyfriend is a full-time student busy with internships.   


I'm the only girl my boyfriend has ever been with. Literally ever. First relationship, first kiss, even first hand-hold. He's the third exclusive boyfriend I've had; ones before that were brief-ish high school boyfriends, and a few random hookups.   


My current boyfriend is one of the nicest and most considerate people I know. I occasionally have issues with anxiety and OCD, but he never treats me any differently and supports me through everything. Neither of us want children, ever. We share many similar views. He's smart, and he's able to keep up with my sense of humor (important for me). He always makes me laugh, and he's one of the few people I'm able to be myself around/be goofy with without feeling judged. We have never been in an argument or fight in all of our time together (not sure if that's secretly bad or something).   


I started taking birth control about a year and a half ago to help with a chronic pain condition. My life has improved dramatically in nearly every aspect, but my sex drive (which used to be so high) has tanked, unfortunately. Quitting the BC isn't an option for me, as I'd turn into a useless lump in pain all the time. It allows me to live my life, and not get babies. Of course, he's wonderful and kind about it, like he is about everything.   


So, I care deeply for this guy. But sexual things are just boring for me at this point with him. I'm worried things are stale. He doesn't repulse me at all, it just isn't fun or interesting anymore. I guess he never tries to ""seduce"" me to make it more interesting, though I've asked him to in the past.   


Sometimes I wish he were more adventurous. I suggest an interesting new date, going hiking, taking a day trip to somewhere cool, trying a new restaurant, anything, but we just end up watching Netflix on the couch night after night. I like doing that and just cuddling, but variety and new things are a necessity for me.   


Another note: his mom is a neurotic and controlling Jesus freak and very much tries to push that on to me. She won't let us be in my boyfriend's room when we're at his house. Being around her for more than twenty minutes is very hard for me.   


So... This new guy, though. He began working at my same retail job about two months ago. I started talking to him, just casually at work, and he's hilarious. We both share the same taste in music. And I don't know. I just find myself thinking about him a lot and wanting to hang out with him, wanting to kiss his cute face...   


It's easy to say or think ""just break up with your boyfriend."" I certainly am not planning on rushing anything in regards to my decision. He's a very important part of my life. He's so kind and knows me better than anyone. But I am young, and I don't want to end up marrying him later on and continue having these feelings about other guys. I keep feeling guilt about wanting to do things with a guy other than my boyfriend. I have promised myself to never be unfaithful or unfair to anyone in my relationships, and I'm going to uphold that. 

So... Should I try to stick it out with my boyfriend? Date myself? What have you done when you're dating someone, but start liking someone else? "

I am looking for some career advice from professionals such as you guys. I have posted this on /r/careerguidance but I am looking for advice specifically from the graphic design side. 

I am currently a third year student studying Information Systems with a specialization in Digital Media. I am also double minoring in Studio Art and Digital Art.

Honestly, my passion is in the arts. I have a huge background in art, and that is something I have always wanted to do my whole life. I come from a family of artists and designers that have always told me to find a career that pays better. However, I realize that I feel much more comfortable on the design side rather than development.

I have experience with Java, HTML, CSS, and a bit of Python. I also have experience with Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, and InDesign. My classes next year include Unity, JavaScript, mobile and web development as well as databases. I am also a TA for introductory computer science classes. I am currently doing a government internship in IT during my breaks. I recently did an internship at a startup where I was doing a bit of web development, but I left because I did not feel like it was a good fit for me.

I know I want to have a career in digital media, however, I still haven't discovered what I would love to do in terms of a career. I love to program and I love doing art and animation, but I am confused as to what direction I should be pushing in.

I have spoken to some of my professors about this, and they have all told me that I should be considering grad school. Some places that my professors and I have considered are NYU Tisch ITP and SVA. I have also been told to look into careers in UI/UX. I always thought that I would be a programmer, and only recently have I realized that I really want to pursue a more creative career path.

What I don't want is to be stuck at a job where I sit and program all day. Nor do I want to work in tech support. I want a career where I create and manage creative projects and utilize my skills in a meaningful way.

Can anyone give me any advice and guidance as to what career paths should I be looking into? Is grad school something I should be seriously considering? What kind of projects should I be working on for my portfolio?

Thank you to everyone in advance!"

However, a lot has changed since the. He has girls come up to him all the time, and hit on him now. 

He spends like 3 hours at the gym everyday, and he has like 8 perfect body fat, and is jacked. He drives a brand new 80K mercedes, and only wears expensive brands - mostly ralph lauren, sperry's etc. 

Anyways, the other day, he ran into the girl that rejected him to prom and she said that she regretted having had rejecting him. He told me that he just said ""its ok"", then walked away. 

I asked him why, and he told me that if he didn't look how he looks right now, worked his ass off in school, had an internship at [redacted], or drove a mercedes, she wouldn't have given him the time of day.

33zsnw,1,2015-04-27,4yr ldr she (22) goes distant on me (23) at the last second causing us to break up,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/33zsnw/4yr_ldr_she_22_goes_distant_on_me_23_at_the_last/,"So it's been a few days now and I'm sorry for the essay here.  
It all hasn't set it considering she was my best friend, lover, and support system.



**Back to the beginning:**

We never intended on getting together but it just happened.  She was beautiful, a ten out of ten and everyone knew it.  In the beginning I thought that I would was never my taste before for obvious reasons but she had this charisma and carefree aura to her that kept me coming back.  We didn't particularly hit it off at the very beginning but it was the summer and we were young and rowdy so we kept hanging out saying it was nothing more than fun because she was headed off to her first semester at school and I going to be a junior studying in CA for a semester.  After a while she got hooked as one usually does but I knew I wasn't going to take away her college experience from her.. at least not yet.  While we were apart we talked about once a week and then ended up starting our relationship at the end of her first semester in college.  I flew home from LA, to surprise her. Her smile, oh her smile, it invigorated me.



**The Details**

We worked great together.  We both liked the same things, had the same values, we even grew together into the people we are today together.  She got along great with my family and I was there for her through some issues with hers no matter what.  


We had our differences too though, she was a socialite while I was a jock/nerd/eagle scout a little on the shyer side.  We had great times together but from her perspective I wasn't as ""outgoing"" (party oriented) as her and from my perspective she was a little absorbed into the party scene at her school but hey every kid is in college.


When she first got to school she laughed at greek life but ultimately their school was 65% greek and eventually most would join so she followed along.  I told her that I really didn't know about it but as I always said all I wanted was for her to be happy and told her just as long as she was upfront and honest we set a couple guidelines to live by (which in the end bit me in the ass bc she called them ""rules""), which consisted of the obvious don't do drugs, don't lie to me, call me when you get in - So nothing crazy just courtesy stuff.


She pledged my last semester in college, it broke me down my senior year.  I never showed it but when she was pledging she wasn't allowed to talk to anyone so we barely spoke. I was about to graduate private school with more than substantial loan debt which she was always there to support me mentally with.  Up until this point I tried really hard to play it cool with her.


Her first two semesters in the sorority after I graduated and returned home went well but then it turned one night when I went up for a party.  She was one of the pledge masters (i supported the idea because she was never really one to assert herself) and I was up as her date.  Pledges were going to be there but didn't exactly know what their pledging entailed due to often omitted details about her program.  I had witnessed her command a girl to take a shot and then 20 min later that same girl was limp in the middle of the hallway due to an overdose.  To this day I still do not regret my actions that night as I acted when others did not but I know I did not keep my cool afterward.  This ultimately led to great stress in our relationship.  She started lying/omitting more details to me but I never found out for about 6 months which led to a lot of trust issues.


Regardless of all of this, it never took more than 48 hours after she came home for us to be perfect again.  I was certainly willing to look past some of the things she did in school for the idea that I did not want her to miss out on a college experience - I made sure to ask her if I was hindering it a few times and she always said no.  But it ended up eating me up inside and I became angry when she was at school.  She would always attend frat parties at least twice a week and would say how she never put the sorority before us but she couldn't even stick to a once a week skype date that was her idea.


But whatever we were in the last semester! We got there.  We could now be together for a year and then take off to a city which we had been planning for years.  We had talked about starting our careers, which I had already done because I was at home waiting for to go with me.  I had a lot of debt and the only thing on my mind while she was at school was making enough money so that she didn't feel that my college debt was a burden to us.  But the industry in our hometown was horrible for what I wanted to do.  I took a couple freelance gigs, a project here a project there.  My degree program was top in the country and I had literally the #1 internship that I could've ever asked for on my resume from CA.  I was determined and when I wanted something I did everything I could to get it so I started my own business.  It was great! I grabbed some people to freelance for me and only took clients that weren't local so that if I moved it wouldn't matter.  It was the perfect plan and it worked, I was paying my bills which were higher than a mortgage and I was still giving my girlfriend all the things she needed and deserved in the mean time.



**The End**

She was ducking me a lot the last semester and had time to party but could never skype me let alone call me when she got home at the end of the night.  Half way through I hit a wall.  She would call me controlling because I expected her to call me when she got in from a night of drinking.  She couldn't even step outside to talk me for more than 5min when she had been day drinking from noon until 2am.  I was there at one point but this was just inconsiderate and it was keeping me up in the middle of the night wondering if she had gotten home okay.  I broke up with her briefly because she couldn't even stick to a skype date once a week and call me when she came home from a night out.  We met up half way to school and we worked things out – well I did for us by giving in to her needing space.  It wasn't pretty but we were so close I just wanted to make it to the end.  It took so much out of us, her last semester mindset. I just wanted us to survive and I knew that I couldn't bear much more of how we were going.


So fast forward to last week, she started to seem even more distant after I asked her if she was going to be able to do our regular skype date.  She pushed it off a couple days and reassures me it will happen and then bails again.  She got really short with me but I thought it was just because she was almost done with school so it was okay.  The next tuesday comes around for our date and she bails for the 3rd time. The next day was a greek tradition day drinking event and I called her once in the middle of the afternoon and she picked up and told me the traditional “get me off the phone with her” reel: who she was with (the girls), what she was doing, and asked me how I was only to then pushed me off the phone.  An hour later I'm at the gym and slipped a disk in my back and went to the hospital.  I txtd her, she txtd me back saying oh no that sucks acting concerned.  I then missed a call from her but returned it immediately after the last ring but don't hear back from her until the next day.  She had no idea anything happened and then I got really mad for how uncaring and distant she was.  I could tell in the tone of her voice that this was different.  I asked her if she wanted a break and she said yes.  A week later I asked her to make up her mind because I had been waiting for her to come home so we could start our lives together instead of moving.  She said she didn't know so we broke up.


**Anything you can guys can recommend?**

I'm having a hard time dealing with this emotionally and can't picture my life without her because we made our life plans together.  Are there any good websites/articles to help with a breakup?  Also I'm having a hard time not texting her which I know is literally the worst thing... this has been so unhealthy for me I think it's obvious I need time as well.

   
**tldr**: Long distance relationship w gf entire 4yrs at college while I was at another school then at home getting my life together.  Breaks were amazing together and we always talked about what the future would be like.  She graduates in 2 weeks, she wasn't excited about being together and wanted a break causing us to end it.

I'm afraid that my entire college experience was a waste because I didn't join clubs, groups, go partying, make any friends, or really have any of the ""college experience"". In reality, I know that I don't want those things because I'm so painfully introverted that I would have hated any of those parts, but at the same time I'm upset that I've passed by my ""one chance"". I'll never be this young or uninhibited again, and it's not like I'm going to go to college again because well...I'll have my degree. It's just the thought that I can never have this opportunity again that upsets me, after all everyone claimed these years would be the ""best"" and most fun, everyone saying this is when I would meet my friends for life or ""figure out my future"". I have literally no idea what I'm going to do with my life, I wish I had picked a different major, and I'm horribly unhappy with my life and I really have no hope.

EDIT: also forgot to add that I'm freaking the hell out because in high school I was an over-achiever with super high grades, and now in college I'm finishing as a rather average grades student and I didn't get to go on any of the crazy trips or do any of the intense field schools. Actually, I didn't do *any* field school or internship because *literally nobody told me it was even a thing until it was essentially too late*. I'm kind of mad and feel cheated, but at the same time I blame myself and feel like a lazy piece of shit who wasted their entire college experience by not being the best. Also, I want nothing to do with the careers in my field and I'm mad as hell about having this major.

Does anyone else feel this kind of fear or have I really messed up?"

I have an interview tomorrow for a marketing internship. I am a business administration and computer information systems double major. However, I have only taken one formal marketing class. I feel like the lack of marketing education may put me at a disadvantage against other candidates. Would bringing in a sample marketing plan that I had made for another organization be beneficial to me in the interview? That way they have a more concrete example of the skills I can provide. I am just not certain if that action is appropriate; I wouldn't want them to think of me negatively in some way because of that. Many thanks in advance; I greatly appreciate the advice."

In my area of SC, the median salary is $75k for a programmer. Given my situation I understand that it is not a reasonable salary for someone straight out of college and no work experience in the industry. 

I was thinking a decent range that would not be underselling me nor make me come across as outlandish would be 55-65k. Am I shooting to high or would that be perfectly reasonable? 

I just really want to find a job, get paid what I deserve and have the opportunity to learn and gain the experience to further my career. Am I'm afraid that if I ask for to much they are just going to overlook me for someone with more experience. "

I'm in my mid-20s and failed out of my undergrad studies after several years. needless to say my grades aren't anything to brag about. When I work, I work hard, but with school it's like I'm a 12 year old idiot trying to learn graduate-level mathematics - I don't even know where to start and I get really disheartened and give up. So school didn't really work out for me, and I dragged it out for a long time before being forced to accept that. 

I went to a good CS school and took a couple of CS courses, but my major was in engineering. My internships have given me some experience: 16 months of QA work, 4 months of build/release engineering/server management, 4 months of Web development, 8 months of driver development, and 12 months of your usual UI/app development. Despite all of this, I feel hopeless. My team leads and managers have often praised my work ethic, how quickly I learn things, how ""smart"" I am about things. But I am a brutal interviewee. I am not upfront in-your-face technically proficient. I am not charming. I am awkward, anxious, and ditzy. If you give me a week or two to learn a programming language and/or codebase, I'll be there, I'll pick it up maybe faster than anyone else you've met. But there's no way for me to demonstrate that in an interview, my experience with technical interviews are ""answer these specific questions and solve these problems"" and I choke and I flail and I fail. I am the person who fails at writing FizzBuzz in an interview. And now I'm going into the ""real world."" No degree. No ""I'm cheaper and don't need benefits, worst case scenario I'll be out of your hair in a few months"" internship situation for companies. 

I don't know what to do. I have a lot of friends that dropped out who work in the Valley now, but they're all so much better than me at software development, I'd never be able to do that. I'm from southern Ontario, currently live in ""the Silicon Valley of Canada,"" but it's not reassuring in the slightest. These days I stare out at the unknown void of the rest of my life and I feel so hopeless I want to throw myself in front of a train or something. I've never worked outside of software and now I wonder if I'll ever work within the industry again.

I know this is a ""questions"" subreddit and I'm sure I had a question when I started typing, but only one comes to mind now : is there any reason for hope?"

340afn,2,2015-04-27,"[Personal Issues] Me [23 M] with my Fiance [21 F] 3 years, I let her date another guy for a sexual kink, revealed a lot of problems.",iBlewIt1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/340afn/personal_issues_me_23_m_with_my_fiance_21_f_3/,"Well reddit, I think I blew it (hence user name). This is my first relationship, she is my first everything, she has had one other LTR before me. We started dating because of crazy coincidences telling us we should be together, these coincidences continue throughout today, some of you may know what I am talking about.

I know you're thinking, first girlfriend, GET OVER IT, well there are several reasons why I won't be able to get over her (easily). First month we were dating, we couldn't stop seeing each other. I left for college halfway through the month (sophmore year), and she came to help me move in, spent the night, and for the first couple months we would drive back and forth 4 hours to see each other. Eventually she would stay weeks at a time and then months until that school year was finished. We did not like being apart, and after seeing each other's face every day since we started dating, we wanted to keep it up but go easier on the gas.

The next school year I transferred to an online school, goto class from anywhere! It was awesome, I basically lived at her parents house, who REALLY liked me, they did not mind at all. I eventually picked up a very good internship, and got paid very well. I think at this point we were still very honeymoon stagey, even after 1.5 years together. I believe the first problem happened when we moved into our first apartment. 

I was very new to a big salary, and paycheck, and thought wow I can get myself a new car or computer parts, anything! At this point, we decided we should have our own living space, responsibilities, whatnot. Yes! I really want to live with this girl and do house stuff. Well in the back of my mind maybe I wanted to buy a few things first? I told her this, and decided a 2 month wait after I got my job would be a good time to get an apartment. The two months took 2 days instead. At this point I started worrying about money for the first time, I didn't know how to feel or think about basically spending my entire paycheck on this apartment every month but I did have some credit card debt from a few new job purchases I hadn't payed off. Over the next few months this debt got bigger. I think some fights happened because I was too consumed with thinking of all the worst case scenarios with money, and I was angry we didn't wait two months to pay off the debt I had prior. I really did want to move out, this amazing woman cooks for me every day, with a smile on her face, does all the chores without asking, I don't have to do anything! 

I was so annoyed and worried about the money though! Every month I looked and saw I was gaining 300 bucks of deficit, the initial purchases like furniture were okay and made sense, but the balance never went down! The weird part is I didn't even need to worry about interest on the card until 2 years from that first month in the apartment, but the fact that there was debt just bothered me. We had fun times in our first living space, don't get me wrong I wasn't a complete wreck yet. I did start playing video games more, and trying to be isolated, honeymoon phase over? I don't know what was wrong with me, I didn't want to do anything! Stuff I had to do, chores. It was physically painful to get up and do the chores, I know what an asshole, but this wasn't me! Toward the end of the year lease, I got a few accusations of falling out of love...what? I could of sworn we would be together forever, this was a new thing to hear.

Well for some reason they give me a raise and it's just enough to get approved for a mortgage, how did I get here? I believe what happened at this point is real clinical depression, but I didn't know it yet. I had signed for the house, proposed, but something didn't feel right, I wasn't ready for this I thought. I know I really wanted to be with her, but there was something making me upset that I couldn't put a finger on. I decided the fears in my head about money were nothing, and that I would be happy to have a brand new house with so much potential to become a home. 

Two months in, we decide to make this fetish I have a reality, hotwife, for anyone who doesn't know, it's when you want to watch your SO have sex with another man. The only thing she asked for in return was that she could be in a relationship with the guy, so we found the perfect mutual friend, who has a lot in common with her. Everyone is screaming danger at this point, and I would have thought the same, if I didn't look on /r/polyamory for days lurking and figuring out how it was possible for a girl to be in a relationship with two guys. I agreed to the conditions because yolo? I think I saw our sex diminishing from once a day to once a week, and wanted to spice things up really bad, I have a high sex drive that didn't go away with the sex. I think everything was fine, until a week or two in, I noticed some suspicious signs of cheating, yes I knew about the guy, but I had agreed with her to communicate everything. 

I did the dumb thing and looked at the phone, texts deleted, but thanks to google, I recovered the deleted texts and figured out which ones were between her and the third guy. Actually not even just the guy, but some of her friends, her MOTHER, all knew and were discussing it with her. What I read was a little heartbreaking, there were so many talks about leaving me, be with the other guy, what is going on? I thought. I didn't know there was a problem until this point, I was either too stressed or depressed to notice I stopped doing all the cute things that make you a man, that I stopped doing chores, and I was playing video games more and more. 

So the first time she lied to me paired with me not knowing how horrible I was treating her, caused me to talk with her. This other guy treats her how I did when we first started dating, what a douche! I wanted this girl to be mine and only mine at this point, so I got upset as shit. The next few times we all hung out turned out a disaster for me, instead of him touching her and massaging her turning me on, I suddenly got extremely jealous and sick to my stomach. I told her not to touch him at all next time, it bothered me too much. Lots of fights about me not being the man I should and that I don't love her anymore continued until I saw a psychologist that told me I have depression caused by the stress of all the life changes such as apartment, house, and we even got a dog. I tried to communicate to her that I had depression, not a good excuse, the last boyfriend claimed the same thing. 

The disconnect comes from the fact that she thinks I resent her for making me move out and become more successful and buy a house, and that I have fallen out of love with her. I think in my head there is nothing I want more to be with this girl, and now that I understand I have depression which was causing me to isolate to video games and not do ANYTHING, I tried to tell her that it has nothing to do with her. I told her the life changes would have made me depressed whether if I was with her or not. I wanted to move out, sure, but the stress of the money I guess fucked up my head. 

As of now, she is over at the guys house, we are trying to take a break so I can cure my depression and when she comes back, it will be a dramatic change she can observe the difference from not seeing me every day. I am looking at old pictures and just being sad, not crying anymore, just feeling melancholy. 

What is it reddit, do I not love her? She really still loves me and has done everything she can to make me happy, but I just wouldn't be happy, and at the point where this new guy comes along, she says it may be too late to make it up now, and its the same time I discovered a problem at all! I really just want to rewind, but she says I cannot redo the proposal, the two big moves, everything was fake, and I didn't show any emotion.

I really want to convince her there is nothing wrong with US, there really isn't we still have fun every day, I just feel sad more than I should. I really want to cure this shit already. I know what I have to do, work out, goto sleep at a normal hour, stop bad habbits and pick up good ones. I need to organize my life, previously I would go off memory for all the bills and responsibilities, but at this point the depression has caused me to fuck up simple tasks and just do shit work at work and sometimes just sit on my phone all day. I can make up the work, but I'm scared I cannot make up this poisoned relationship. She's not gone yet, she is going to come back tomorrow, decide what to do next, I think we are going to take a real break, but the house situation isn't decided yet. Do I go back and live with my parents? She keeps the house? I really hate the idea of another guy replacing me in my own fucking house! I really need to get better and focus on me, but I really just want to get better so I can have her back. I really hate myself today, I need something to cheer me up, I blame myself for 100% of whats going on. I even told her she can go be with him if he makes her happy, she said she won't do that yet, still loves me and all. Another problem is she said everything would be fine if I was okay with the two guys one girl relationship. I don't know if I can ever have that.

I feel like there is no competition, you wouldn't think it's fair to have an Olympic swimmer with the flu to go against someone in perfect health. Fuck what do I do, is all lost? I know I will get at least one ""BREAK UP NAO!"" but I am posting for some alternatives to think about.
   
**tl;dr**: Depression revealed after another guy is stealing my fiance, after I approved them dating, she says it's too late to make up the problems caused by having depression.

340f2h,2,2015-04-27,"In a relationship, want to travel, need advice!",Nisja,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/340f2h/in_a_relationship_want_to_travel_need_advice/,"Hi all,

As of last night, I'm in a bit of a sticky situation. I'll try to make everything as clear as possible first time 'round, but apologies if I miss anything!

I've just turned 23, I went to school/college/university and straight into a job before graduating (lucky me) - so my traditional education is out of the way.

I'm a full-time software developer, making a comfortable amount of money that allows me certain freedoms with enough left to save up.

I've been with my girlfriend for almost 4 years, and we currently rent a property together. She is very dependent on me financially, and I currently pay £500 of our £650/m rent. I also pay the majority of our £60/m utility bills, and for the past few months have paid for almost all of our food expenses. Hopefully you're getting a clear indication of our current situation.

To complicate matters, my girlfriend is in her first year of a PhD, meaning she only has a part time job (which will bring in ~£260/m, £150 of which goes towards rent). She has never been a very driven person, and so it's more than likely that this is how our life will be for at least the next 4 years. She is already ~£500 in-debt to me, and it's only going to keep rising for the foreseeable future.

With all of this, I am not happy. I haven't been happy for a long time, and have been trying my best to keep myself occupied. I have taken up drawing, digital painting, meditation, woodworking classes, running, got back into playing my guitar, and after all of this I'm still not satisfied.

I desperately want a change of lifestyle, and have gained a lot of self-confidence over the past few years; something I've never had before. I'm young, in better shape physically than I have ever been (I've been going to the gym 4 days a week for the past year; watch my calories and eat healthier), and I have a drive to go out and discover the world.

I've always liked the idea of teaching, and have recently begun researching TEFL (Teach English as a Foreign Language) which would allow me to both teach and travel abroad. *Can you see where I'm going with this?*

In short, I can take a course (140 hours over ~3 months) and then apply for a 5 month internship in places such as China, Vietnam, Thailand (but can also teach in most continents). I really like the idea of the internship, as it'll provide me with additional support, and if I decide it's not for me, it's only 5 months!

Yesterday afternoon I decided to tell my girlfriend about what I had been thinking, as I thought it best to just let her know as soon as possible. Why? Because I want to approach the matter as pragmatically as possible, without hurting anybody, or letting emotions boil over. Also, I've been told off in the past for keeping things 'bottled up' and to myself, so I thought I'd do what people have suggested and just get everything out in the open.

My girlfriend was not happy. She made sure to let me know that I'm essentially tearing her world apart, and that she may have to quit her PhD as she can't afford to carry on (without me as a financial crutch). She would have to move back in with her mother who is no better off financially (if anything worse) , she would have to give up her new part-time job (which she is starting in 2 days). I would essentially be ruining everything for her.

I just feel absolutely terrible. We managed to settle things a bit before bed, and I told her that I wouldn't even begin to do anything for 3 months. If I still feel the same way after that, well I don't know what will happen. I want to live my life before I'm too old, but (I know this sounds horrible) she is holding me back.

She has said she doesn't want to stop me from doing what makes me happy, but my girlfriend is the world #1 at arguing - I lose almost every single time and feel like the bad guy. I really don't want her to persuade me from doing what I want to do, but I can see it happening as I absolutely hate to see her upset.

She also thinks my parents have warped my mind/judgement. I spent the day with them yesterday and discussed things with them. They're the nicest, most down to earth people. They would never push me into anything, and only want to support my decisions and to see me happy. I can't talk to her at times, so I talk to them, and now I'm turning to you guys.

Apologies for the wall of text. What do you think? Thanks for reading."
340fjg,34,2015-04-27,My [22F] boyfriend [23M] broke up with me immediately after I was raped.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/340fjg/my_22f_boyfriend_23m_broke_up_with_me_immediately/,"Backstory: We had been dating almost a year at the time and had been having a blissful relationship. Six months in, my boyfriend went out of state for a semester long internship. I stayed behind and continued my education, attending college in our home state while he was away. I would go up and visit once a month and everything was going perfectly for our relationship. We were very open with each other about our pasts and had been understanding of everything the other had been through. We shared everything and we're each other's rock. 

The night of the incident me and my roommate decide to go out to some local bars (I had okayd this with him beforehand and agreed to not going past tipsy). It should be noted I have extreme anxiety and was only going out to be a wing-woman for my roomie. We go to a couple bars and everything is going great, she's having fun.. We met some interesting people and in general had a very regular experience at the bars. Around midnight my roommate had found a group of guys she was interested in, so i started talking her up and what not to the guy she was interested in.  Of course as always, there was the typical creepy guy in the friend group who kept eyeing me all night and giving me the heebie geebies. There was definitely something off about him and how he seemed devoid of all emotion/extremely stoic. Either way, I didn't feel right about him. 

Flash forward an hour: I went to the bathroom and when I got out I couldn't find her anywhere. I had only one beer to drink so there was no way I could be incoherent as to where I left her. I asked around if anyone had seen her and a group of girls said she had left with a group of three guys and didn't know much else. That's when my anxiety kicked in... I knew they had taken her. But i was confused because there was four total in the group... So where was the other guy? 

Not knowing where they had taken her and being all alone and feeling vulnerable my anxiety kicked in full force. I couldn't breathe. My vision was tunneled and I just sank to the ground completely helpless. That's when the creepy guy from the group found me. Mid hyperventilation I had the gut feeling it wouldn't end well. That's when I passed out *I assume from lack of oxygen* when I came to the guy was carrying me down a dark street behind the clubs to their house. I started resisting and begged him to let me go. He refused. I had another panic attack and was convinced I was being carried off to my imminent doom. *I passed out again* I woke up on their front lawn to him slapping my face to get me awake. He kept telling me I was so beautiful and he was going to take good care of me and then slowly smiled. 

Exhausted from two panic attacks I didn't have much left in me. He picked me up and led me inside to a back room. On the way, I saw my roommate on a couch with the other guys. He gave me a blanket, a glass of water, and a pillow and told me to rest for a while. The room was completely dark and simple with nothing but a bed and nightstand in it. Exhausted *if you have ever experienced a panic attack you can relate* I sat on the bed with my back against the wall telling myself to calm down and began doing my breathing exercises to relax since I now knew where she was and she was okay. 

I awoke to the door opening and a dark figure approaching me. To my horror I had fallen asleep and was completely disoriented and taken off guard. He shut the door, immersing us in pitch blackness, and that's when he took me. I tried to fight back and resist but felt powerless against him. He was too strong and I had no strength left to fight with. 

After he was done, he put his clothes on and left. I was in shock. Knowing my boyfriend couldn't come help me I texted my best friend ""I have just been raped. Please help me."" To which he responded immediately ""Can you get out? Give me your location."" I told him I didn't know but I was trying to get out of the house. I knew if I went out the front door I would have to face him again so I elected for a window. 

Once out I literally ran down the street and called my best friend while turning left and right on different streets so they couldn't track me down. He eventually found me and got me in his car and drove me back to the house to with all his gusto collect my roommate. She was fine, just wasted. 

We went to the hospital, they did their rape kit and I was left in the room alone. I began crying and knew I needed to hear my boyfriends voice to calm me down. I dialed his number and it rang three times before he answered. He asked me why I was crying. I told him I had been raped.  The next words out of his mouth were ""I'm breaking up with you."" and then he hung up. I was left in pure agony sobbing into the examination table. I texted him back asking why. He said I had obviously cheated. *his girlfriend before me lied about being raped just to cover up the fact that she had cheated and slept with another guy* I was crushed. I would never cheat. I seriously don't think I could live with myself if I ever did. I lost my virginity to my boyfriend and never even considered sleeping with anyone else.  

I tried to convince him I didn't cheat for many hours before giving up. I was in too much pain. He was convinced I had cheated and there was nothing I could do. The next day I went to my sister's house for two weeks to get out of town. He texted me in the middle of the first week asking me to forgive him and all throughout the continuing weeks. 

I gave him another chance... But i have never been able to feel the same towards him as I did before. I'm still wondering if I made the right choice to get back together... He still says he has doubts about what really happened that night. He's convinced I was drinking or fudging the details or that I could have done this and that to stop him. I've gone over it a million times in my head... I know it could have been different.  I regret every minute of that night. 

Should I have forgiven my boyfriend and gotten back together? 

TLDR; I was raped and my boyfriend broke up with me because he thinks I cheated."

So I was hoping you could help me out again and tell me if you have any tips on how to really stand out and thrive over the ten weeks I'll be there?  

There's a few weeks between my last exam and this internship starting too, so if there anything you would recommend me doing in these few weeks to become sharp and ready I'd love to hear it. 

All feedback is greatly appreciated :)

I was wondering if you could help find me a destination for my trip next summer.

I'm from Germany and had my first backpacking experience in 2012, I went to India, alone. I stayed for 4 weeks and loved it so much that I went again last year for about a month.

I couchsurfed as much as possible, if I didn't find a host I stayed in 5$ hotels. What I liked about my trips that I got to know lots of local people and got to see many things and places that ""regular tourists"" don't get to see. I made many life-changing experiences and got to know some of the nicest people I ever met. I stayed with poor people, rich people, old ones, young ones, in big cities and in tiny villages.

I saved money for a trip to the US that won't happen anymore. I've got the money to fly pretty much everywhere in the world and about a month of time. I thought about going to Pakistan/India/Bangladesh/Nepal, but as I'll go to India for an internship next year I figured I should see something else.

I'm looking for a country where I can get in touch with locals easily and that is fairly cheap. I was thinking about Costa Rica, but it doesn't seem very affordable for a whole month and also not very safe. 

There isn't really a culture that I'm not interested in. I was thinking about Cambodia, Philippines, Indonesia, Mexico, somewhere in Africa, there is just so much to choose from. 

So, can you recommend a country that is relatively safe, not too pricy and, most important, hospitable to western foreigners?

Thank you very much!"

**PREPARE FOR WALL OF TEXT**

I am a 2nd year Computing Science student and I seem to be struggling in finding a company ready to employ me during the summer. I'll give you some more detailed information.

As stated previously, I am a 2nd year Uni student studying Computer Science. I live in a place where this is the only real University (other places are just small branches of foreign Universities, ex. University of London) and therefore, it is the best rated University in the country. Being the only University in the country, it takes pretty much all student (with regards to IT) assuming you get the required grades in your A-Levels. First year was very tough. I managed to scrape through with an average of around 61. Not great, but I seemed to be above or bang on the class average (to be fair, we had a lot of classes with students from other subjects such as Business and IT, which I feel are less intelligent than CS students, as their requirements are lower, and they probably altered the average a bit). I was obviously not happy with how I performed. With that grade, I would have gotten a 2nd lower degree. (45-59 3rd class, 60-69 2nd lower, 70-79 2nd upper, 80+ 1st class). I tried to up my levels 2nd year 1st semester, and I aimed for a 70+ average. I was very disappointed when I ended up with an average of 66, although once again I seemed to be somewhat above the average in a number of subjects. For this semester, I am aiming for an even higher average, around 74, which will hopefully tip my average to around 70. This is unlikely, but the least I can do is try. Although I recognize these are not the best marks possible, I really am trying to achieve higher marks, and I seem to be on an upward trend. 

I have done little to no projects in my free time. I tend to get lazy when I am at home, which definitely needs to change. (more on this below)

I have some work experience. I have worked for 2 summers in a row in a governmental IT agency. Unfortunately, this job was more administration related rather than hands on programming (which is what is really needed). I had to administer a number of systems, help in integration of a VLE system, create a manual program using MS Excel (nationwide government initiative. Had to create a 'temporary' 6 month program using Excel until the real product was done [outsourced btw]), etc.. As you might notice, it was useful to a certain extent. I did learn a bunch of new technologies and procedures, but it still is somewhat distant from a real IT job. Also, the government has the stigma that employees don't actually work, which to a certain extent is true (although I always did over and above what was expected from me). I feel I was quite good at what I did. When I first joined, I was not wanted by the department, but the department was forced to take a student and they had to accept me (I was part of a nationwide project where we get put in IT companies for experience, and I ended up in this governmental org.) I quickly managed to win their trust (?) and they started giving more more jobs, and also invited me in certain meeting with big foreign companies (Ex. Microsoft). After the first summer, they told me to join again the second summer, because the department didn't want any other student apart from me. I joined them again (hence the second summer experience). They have also given me an offer to join them the following summer (more on this below) and also jokingly asked me to join them when I graduate. 

I am now nearing the end of my 3 year course (just passed half of it) and I am trying to get a 'real' internship, i.e. programming in a software house. I sent out a number of e-mails (probably around 10), with a covering letter and a CV, but I have received limited responses. Most of them just told me that they will contact me if there is an open position, and only 2 companies contacted me for an interview. I would like to say that I feel that my CV is well structured, and I asked a number of people for help, and I think it is quite good. I think the lack of responses is more due to the fact that certain companies are relatively small (~20 employees) so they don't have much space for students. I also don't think that my grades are a cause for the lack of interviews. Only 2 companies asked for my Uni grades, although both didn't answer me after sending them my grades.

Now, regarding the 2 interviews I did.

The first one was from an International company, who initially gave me a test (similar to an IQ test; number sequences, picture sequences, math problems, computer related questions). The next interview (?) was pretty much just laying down the terms of employment. From their end, I was accepted. The reason I declined them is due to the fact that they wanted me to start working from the following Saturday, for 10 hours weekly, up until the beginning of summer (during exam period too), as a training phase. Apart from that, they wanted me to work additional things at home. I was not able to accept that, due to the fact that I honestly have too much Uni work to do, and I wouldn't be able to juggle the two at once (I feared it will impact my marks negatively, and I'd rather have a better degree). 

The other company who interviewed me first asked me to complete a task which they sent over by e-mail. I managed to complete the task and they asked me to come in for an interview. One of my interviewers was one of my lecturers, which was probably a good thing. The interview first started with them speaking to me about CV related items, then they asked me to explain my implementation to the task. They seemed to like the approach, but then went on to ask me other questions. The first one was regarding Java exceptions, and I felt I fucked up quite a bit. I know what exceptions are, and how they work, but the last time I used exceptions was around 3 years ago (as stated, I pretty much only do assignments, so I deal with exceptions/problems in different ways) so I was not great when answering. I did have a decent idea though, so i scraped through. Then they asked me database and SQL related questions. I do know databases/sql, but once again, I was rusty on the subject (around a year ago was the last time I used SQL) and only managed to scrape through. Needless to say, they didn't accept me. 

Now I'm stuck. Personally, I don't think I will be called for any more interviews. I don't know many more companies who do take on students as interns, so at this point, it looks improbable that I will manage to get an internship. Assuming, I don't get an internship, I need help on what my next step should be. I am thinking about going to my previous place of employment (governmental agency) and just suck it up for the summer (along with hopefully doing personal projects at home AFTER work hours) or just skip the job and create personal projects. I already have a decent idea of what I want to start on, but I'm unsure whether I want to go to work and work on side projects, or just work on personal side projects. Money is not really an issue for me. I do have enough money to get me through a summer without a steady income. I just need to know what is more beneficial for my career. My only fear of working only from home is that companies still won't see this as valuable , and I'd rather do something which isn't valuable and get paid rather than do something which isn't valuable and not get paid.

I appreciate any help that I can get. 

Thanks in advance.

EDIT: I recognize that some parts are relatively poorly written. Writing this took me way more time than I anticipated, and I really need to get back to work."

341bfh,4,2015-04-27,"Long rant: There is uncomprimising differences between how I am and how the world I am living in is. It's hard to explain, but here it is",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/341bfh/long_rant_there_is_uncomprimising_differences/,"
My values, for example, I want to do meaningful, good things in the world. The best paying jobs I've seen are about selling, marketing and human resources. I want to produce, something useful and helpfull. I want to use my creativity and talents —I have lots of them. I don't want to be an engineer, that produces for over-consumption of the masses. I don't want to be like Dilbert. I want to be conscious about environment. I want to have a harmonious working environment. These are some of the things that I am unopen to discuss. 

Then there is the country that I am living in. The huge gap between the rich and poor. Each wealthy person is like a king here, and no social mobility for the poor. 

There comes my family, who are really bad at finance. They cannot handle it. I see other people's parents, they pursue money like rats after something sweet. Mines  are too proud to do that. They get offended easily and do not communicate properly. No wonder I have become like this by having their genes. They simply shouldn't have produced any offsprings. 

And other like-minded people, they are from much well-off families. They want friends that share their taste for luxury items, fashion and consumption. I am very disillusioned about these, coming from a much more disadvantaged background. I am willing to put on the appearence just to get by, but I simply don't have enough money to do that either. 

The education that I got, the one that I had access to, was merely dependent on pointless competition. I need a purpose, you see. I need a bigger picture. I feel I wasn't good enough at keeping my eyes on the prize. Like 2.5 million people take the university entrance exam each year, I was in 6000s in placement. This was simply not enough to acquire the resources I needed to success in this life. You need to be under 1000 in rankings for that kind of thing. 

I did go to a pestigious university though. Had a scholarship. But the academia here is simply too corrupt to contain a person like me. Soon, me being me, I started to question things, like why the instructors were so blind to cheating in exams, even in courses like technical drawing which is one of the basic skills you've got to learn in any architecture program. And, Why weren't we learning anything in classes? What was that pretence about? Why the favourite students of instructors tended to be children of influencial people (like mayors and contractors) or acquintances (like other design profs and architects)? And every single student willing to pursue family businesses after graduation?

I know I am shit at living. But I am one of those people who considers every possible option thoroughly. So, I searched for what kind of jobs I would be able to do when I graduate. There were some gentrification work in the country, and some obcene construction projects in Arabic territories like Dubai. Needless to say they were in conflict with my values. Not only I was not very keen on doing these jobs, but they were also not looking for people like me. My researches showed that those companies were looking for individuals coming from  families who can afford bachelors/masters/internships abroad. 

Oh well, I had an internship coming up on plants, so I thought maybe I will like it when I'm doing the job. It must be enjoyable working with plants, right? Not for me it seems. I don't want to be the person who sees bad in everything, but I wasn't very happy about the way plants were treated. All the pruning and treating them as merchandise or material to ornament some shitty gardens were too much for my shitty brain. Moreover, I wasn't very good at fitting in with the working environment either. For example, when I was having my period, there wasn't a bin in the toilet. I asked my colleagues about this and they told me to carry my used pads in my bag and throw it at home; because the boss doesn't like seeing pads in toilet bins. There were two other female employees and two other female interns working with me in that company (who were all in university, or graduated from university) and I was the only one who was seeing the wrong in it. 

I guess, once you get in to some crazy loop, it just follows from there. I don't want to feel guilty about my choices, or because of the values I hold. I want it out, the guilt, that is coming from being that jobless person who is dependent on others. I want others to know that that wasn't in the plan. I am simply not prepared to deal with that kafkaesque environment where I am incapable of communicating my thoughts without losing my piece of mind. And even then, They don't listen.

I think I have to get this off my chest so that I can accept that my life is heading in the right direction, even if it doesn’t always feel like it.

My beloved dog of ten years passed away in the beginning of 2015, and I knew the year would be strange from there on. Only a few weeks later (three months ago in late January) I had my heart broken. My girlfriend of two years dumped me out of the blue, citing the inability to deal with a long distance relationship as her chief concern. I found out only a month and a half later that she had been cheating on me for the previous eight months with a guy that she had worked with over the previous summer. They are now dating and are over fifteen hours apart by car, thirteen hours further away from him than she was from me. She had talked about breaking up for when she got to college, but now has no intention of being single.

In the weeks since, I have lost a fourth of my body weight and struggled mightily with depression and apathy in nearly every aspect of my life. It has been very painful seeing her happy with the guy on social media. Moreover, I have lost several friends who knew exactly what was going on as early as September and October. I had few people to talk to and felt totally alone.

College had been very depressing for me as I was largely isolated from the duties of maintaining a relationship and weighed down by a tremendous amount of work (I am pursuing two ambitions majors and a minor program as well). I had tried to play a sport in the fall, but I got mono (I know now from my great ex-girlfriend) and then broke my hand. I put on a lot of weight but managed to get nearly perfect grades. 

This semester I have managed to get back into shape and to excel in the classroom; I am going to finish the semester with a 3.88 and my overall GPA is over a 3.7. I finally got help from a counselor about existing issues and I have never felt better about some aspects of my mind. I decided to transfer and am thus far 2/2 with applications; both schools I got into are great and I am excited to find out where I will be next year. 

I miss my dog a lot, and the pain from months of neglect, cheating, abuse, deceit, and betrayal continue to hurt, but I feel so much better in spite of that. Having my first relationship end was probably a good experience, though the cheating was horrible. I got accepted for the three prestigious internships that I applied for during the summer and will be spending June-July across the country in California, still alone, but with the opportunity to make a lot out of the experience. 

Everything that happened was very bad, and I will continue to prevent that girl from coming back into my life. I believe that my life is on the right track, and I need to remember that. I am in a better place than I was two years ago and the future is bright.

341k2u,385,2015-04-27,My[F24] Boyfriend [M23] tried to push a religious debate on my Sister[F28] after our Dad died.,throw_away_armchair,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/341k2u/myf24_boyfriend_m23_tried_to_push_a_religious/," A little background, I am an Atheist and my boyfriend happens to be one too. My family is Christian but they are the type that loves everyone, accepts people for who they are, thinks gay marriage is fine, and accepts that I am an Atheist. My parents have always had that ""be Christ-like"" mentality which sometimes doesn't mesh well with more conservative Christians. But anyways, they are awesome people and I love them. 


 Our Dad died after a rough battle with cancer a week ago. It was pretty bad and my family is mourning right now. We are a pretty tight knit family so we are reeling atm. We had a funeral at a local church and it was really nice and beautiful. I personally don't hold the same beliefs but I respect other people to have their own opinions and I don't take offense or make it a private mission to some how prove them wrong which is something my boyfriend has a tendency of doing. He's more judgmental and he's curbed back a lot but it's still there. 


 Yesterday I get a phone call from my older sister in tears because my boyfriend started going at her in regards to her faith (she's the same as our parents). He sent her a message on FB offering his condolences since they haven't really had a chance to talk after my Dad's death. She thanked him and said that our Dad wasn't in pain anymore and that he was with God now at peace and my boyfriend said ""You're entitled to your opinion, I just don't feel the same way"". 


 This kind of pissed off my sister because this isn't the time of place for that kind of stuff and I agree with her. She told him that it wasn't very appropriate to make comments like that to someone who recently lost a parent. But I guess my boyfriend took that as an opportunity to make a debate out of it and my sister ignored him. She showed me the messages and I just feel so angry. 


 It's one thing to not agree with someone, it's another to be an ass and be rude about it especially at a time like now. My family has never pressured him or made him feel awkward about being an Atheist. When I told them I was they nodded and said that they loved me etc. It's not even about faith it's about the quality of the person. In my opinion if someone tries to push their ideologies on another, whether they are Atheist, Christian, Muslim, etc they have deep rooted insecurity.


 I feel really mad at my boyfriend and this is feels like a deal breaker for me. We've only dated a few months (we've known each other for a few years) and I realize now how utterly grating he is. It's not a blatant nails on a chalk board irritating but more like, makes excuses, is lazy, doesn't have a job, stopped going to school because no one will hire him as an intern, he complains constantly about that shit but does nothing to change his circumstances. He actually got mad at me last Christmas season because he bought me a $5 game as a gift and I didn't buy him a $60 game. For one, we had just started dating each other a month before I didn't feel comfortable shelling out that much money on a gift for a new boyfriend. I didn't expect anything at all from him because of how anti-Christmas he was. I did get him a gift (a $10 game) and he tried to guilt me about it because I have a job. 


 Sorry this is turning into an angry rant. What would you do in this situation? I am ready to cut contact with this person. What is the best way to handle this?

   
**tl;dr**: Dad died a week ago after battling cancer. My family is the loving and accepting ""Christ-like"" Christians. I am an Atheist and so is my boyfriend. My family has always been accepting and non-judgmental towards us. He tried to push a religious debate onto my sister after offering condolences. This upset her a lot and is pretty inappropriate.

A week later (two fridays ago), I decided to contact him again, asking him if he wanted to stay in touch. I had low expectations about this. But he was very happy to talk to me again. For the next 5 days, we texted all day, everyday. He was so interested to talk to me and there was always a conversation. I was very happy. 

Problem: We went out for lunch on Tuesday. (We haven't seen each other since we broke up). We didn't planned it in advance, just a: ""I have free period"" ""Oh, I finish my internship early, let's have lunch right now"". And it went great. We had a lot of fun. (I think he was nervous because he was sweating so much). He actually gave me a ride, paid for everything and told me next time we should go to this other place (because that day I choose the place). (I don't know if it was a date or not, but whatever). The problem is that since that day he isn't texting me anymore as frequently as he did. Our conversations lasted a couple of hours. He is just not interested in talking to me anymore. I don't know if the fact that we saw each other affected him. 

Not only that. Last Friday I had a serious family issue. The next day I woke up shaking, scared, and i only wanted to talk to him. I remember he said weeks ago that no matter what he was always going to be there, whenever I needed him. So that morning I asked him if he mean it, he said yes, and I told him about what happened last night. Three hours later, no reply. I texted him again, saying: ""Sorry if I bothered you. It won't happen again"". His reply was: ""Sorry, I'm with friends. But see, I know that feeling since my parents told me they wanted to get a divorce, so I'm already used to this. My mom just gets mad and vents"". I was so mad with his response! I just wanted him to say: ""Everything will be fine"", instead of him talking me about his family, but obviously it was so much to ask. I haven't replied, and we haven't talked. 

   
**tl;dr**: My ex and I were texting for days, and everything was perfect. We saw each other, and since then, he seems he lost interest in talking to me. Actually, he doesn't even care about my problems (when days before that he cared). I don't want him back. But I just want to know what he really wants (something he can only answer), but in the meanwhile I'm trying to understand why is he acting that way. I don't know what to reply (obviously he made it clear I can't count on him on my personal issues), but I just want to make things clear. "

I have been reading up on the posts on this subreddit and a lot of people are talking about how hard it is to find jobs and how important it is to have a good gpa and a good school on your resume.

I have applied to internships and none of them have responded back to me.

How am I supposed to reach out to people just so they'll at least give me the chance for an interview? I really regret messing up by not putting the effort to getting into a better school, and then slacking off and not getting the best gpa that I could have, and I feel like I totally screwed my future over.

I will continue trying my best and start working on side projects and learning outside of my classes, but I get the feeling that recruiters might still just glance at my resume, seeing my school/gpa, and passing it over for someone with a 4.0 at a more prestigious school.

I would love to know if anyone has been in my situation and was able to break out of it. "

First off, I am a junior in college.

Anyways, it looks like I will have an internship with a small insurance company this summer.  My position will be an IT QA intern.

I have no idea what to expect when I start this summer.  What will I be doing?  Am I dealing directly with software?

Also, if my goal is eventually to be a Software Engineer when I graduate (work for big tech companies), does this position look good on my resume for future applications?

3421jz,7,2015-04-27,Skin or lifting?,[deleted],AsianMasculinity,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianMasculinity/comments/3421jz/skin_or_lifting/,"Curious topic, but here goes:

I'm at a pretty critical point of my studies where I have to maintain a high GPA for the internships I want to get into.  Lifting, as much as I like it, does take a big amount of time (most of it spent on food prep, not the actual lifting portion).

I'm planning to forgo the gym entirely for the next year or so to focus purely on my studies. 

Whenever I consume milk or protein powder, my skin breaks out quite a bit.  I've gone off milk/protein for two weeks, and my skin has cleared up significantly.

I'm aware that I can get protein without milk or protein powders, but that would add even more time to food prep. 

It's pretty cold where I live, so I can still look decent-sized by layering jackets.

Personally, I've noticed that when I was bigger (not even that big! From 5'8 62kg to around 68kg) but with some acne, I did get better results than as someone skinny but with good skin (that said, my skin still isn't perfect.  I will update this as my skin clears completely and compare that with my earlier results).

However, the results were better by, perhaps 15%, while I had to spend a significant amount of time on food prep and the gym.

I understand that as I get even bigger, the results should be more noticeable, but as I stated previously, all things considered, my studies *should* be a priority (and anyways, I'm still getting mine even as a slightly skinnier guy with better skin.  Just a slightly decreased quantity but I'm okay with that).

Thoughts? Has anyone noticed whether good skin or a moderate increase in muscle mass is better vis-a-vis pure physical attraction?

Bonus: if I don't focus on bulking at all, I also get a more defined face and jawline

**tldr skinny with good skin vs bigger with worse skin? For pure physical attraction **"

I'm building a home server around the Asrock quad-core Avoton mini-itx board. I actually did an internship a few years ago working on a commercial NAS at IBM, so I have a little background with this kind of thing, but I'm a total FreeNAS newbie. The goal is an energy efficient home server that can do a bit of everything, including plex, some sort of file sync, backup target for laptops, lightweight vm host, etc. I know I can do all this with FreeNAS plugins and jails, but I'm curious about the pros and cons of using those features with FreeNAS running on the bare metal versus running FreeNAS and a few other VMs in an ESXi environment. Is there a significant performance or security trade off here?"

Right now I have a GTX 780 graphics card, and the next upgrade I was gonna make was to get a 2nd monitor. Right now I have a BenQ 1080p, 60hz monitor, but I know that the 780 is capable of more than that.

I'm stuck between going 4K or 1440p. This summer I'll have the money for either of these once I start my internship. I know that the 780 holds 1440p pretty well, and that it will definitely struggle with games at 4K, but I'm planning on getting a 980Ti either Christmas, or early 2016.

So I'm just looking for advice, enjoy 1440p or get the 4K monitor and down sample it to 1440p or 1080p until I get the 980Ti and can use it for 4K? Any feedback is greatly appreciated!"
342912,0,2015-04-27,Four month summer break before starting an Applied Statistics master's. What should I be doing?,coffeecoffeecoffeee,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/342912/four_month_summer_break_before_starting_an/,"I just got my BS in Math and Statistics from a decently-ranked public university.  Next year I'll be doing a one-year master's program at Carnegie Mellon.  I don't have any CS credentials but took some classes, and as a result I know Python, R, Matlab, SAS, SQL, and a decent amount of Java.  I'm not that experienced with OOP and don't really like Java, but I figure I just need to get more used to it.  With regard to math and stats I have deep theoretical knowledge but very little applied because of my university.  So I can explain a ton about mathematical statistics, probability, linear algebra, regression, etc., but have very little experience building models on real data.  I feel like this is the opposite of most people looking to get more involved in machine learning, who seem to have a lot of practical and programming experience but not nearly as much statistical theory.  My master's program will rectify this a lot because it's heavily applied.

I have virtually no projects to speak of but also want to get better at programming.  What should I be doing this summer if I eventually want a programmer/analyst ""data science"" role once I get my master's?  I was thinking about teaching myself data structures and algorithms in C++, or possibly functional programming (I want to learn some kind of Lisp for the hell of it).  I'm also curious about learning Hadoop or Spark but I don't know where I'd get the kind of computing power I'd need to actually learn them.

Right now I don't have anything lined up for the summer after I applied for a ton of internships and positions, but I might be doing paid research at Carnegie Mellon doing some heavy statistics simulations. (I've had one internship and it was only tangentially related to my field and I was literally the only statistics person there).  If that doesn't pan out, what kinds of things should I spend my summer working on?  Thank you!"
3429nz,0,2015-04-27,My Comprehensive and Effective Strategy to Getting a Job,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3429nz/my_comprehensive_and_effective_strategy_to/,"Hi All - 
I thought it might be beneficial for some of you to have an inside perspective of how to identify, pursue, and get various jobs across a wide variety of industries. This is my personal technique so take any bits of it you want. A bit of background about me, I am a current management consultant with one of the Big 4 accounting firms (PWC, Deloitte, KPMG, EY). My experience is in a business environment, but the same principles will apply across the board.

I graduated from Temple with a BBA in Accounting and from the get go I wasn’t one of those intense networkers who attended every single free pretzel day or networking dinner. I was introverted in that regard. I thought for sure that a job would land in my lap. I was wrong.

In my junior year I applied to 12 internships. I received all rejections except from one. I hated to admit it, but it wasn’t totally unexpected. I barely networked and had a modest 3.0 GPA. I received an invite to interview on campus for a boutique consulting firm. I took the interview and received an invite to the local office. I got an offer for the New York office and the reason being that they liked me, but they liked three others more for the Philly office so they tried to keep me any way they could. I wasn’t going to say no... It was all I had. 

Subsequent to my internship I received a full time offer. I worked my tail off for it, too. I did a solid 2 years at the firm until I decided I wanted to do something a bit more challenging, so I shot for the top (Big 4). I went through the entire hiring process for the Big 4 and have even worked a bit in recruiting and saw first hand what top-notch companies look for in a candidate. My goal is to give this advice to any of you who may be having a tough time or who are just starting the search.

----------------------------------------
Four strategic principles to remember in searching for a job:T
Target
Arm
Fire
Massage
----------------------------------------

TARGET
After deciding which position  you want to pursue, you’ll need to identify where you’ll apply. This is the Target phase. I suggest using a spreadsheet to keep track of your communications with Target companies. I created a handy one here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g5_QPxLTMJ1SmefvqBqamS4Bax3Tzu9NYc73JxPf2zo/edit?usp=sharing

There are various resources you can use to identify companies: Indeed.com, Glassdoor.com, Monster.com, LinkedIn (!!), Facebook, Jobvite.com, etc. 

For example, if I’m looking for a job as a UX Designer, I would search one of these websites and note down any companies that interest me. 

NOTE: Don’t let anyone fool you, networking is the BEST way to get the job you want. You could submit 100 resumes/day via online systems, but that may work 1/30 times. Networking and getting in front of the Target is key. 

Once you narrow down your list to around 5-8 Targets, it’s time to move on to the ARM phase. 



ARM
You’ve got your list of Targets, now you need to identify who the key players are at that company. 

For example, if I’m targeting Google, I want to make sure I identify any recruiters or managers that may be associated with the position I’m seeking. If the UX Designer job I want is located in San Francisco, I want to scour LinkedIn under the Google company page by using the search terms “recruit, talent” etc in the Keyword field. This will identify any individuals within the company that work in Recruiting. If you’re going for a job in San Francisco, make sure to find recruiters located there. Once you find some, note them in your tracking spreadsheet. 

NOTE: I also suggest searching for managers and associates if you come up empty with recruiters. These individuals will know where to point your application. 

So how do you get this information you might ask? It takes a little bit of creative thinking and investigation. 

My go-to tools are MailTester.com and the Rapportive GMAIL application. MailTester requires you to type in an email moniker and it will ping that address to see if it’s valid. For instance if you want to reach Brian Wilson at Google, you would type in brian.wilson@google.com or bwilson@google.com or any other combo and see if it gives you a “success” message. (if there is a real Brian Wilson at Google, which there probably is, i’m sorry dude).

Rapportive is great because you do the same as MailTester.com but you type the email address into a new Gmail email window and if it’s a match, rapportive will pull up the POCs (Persons of Contact) social media profile so you know you have the right person. 

Once you find a valid email address, add it to your tracker. 

By doing this, you’re setting up for launch, or Arming!



FIRE
You’ve done the prep work, you’ve identified your Targets, you’ve identified POCs within those Targets, and you’ve found their email addresses. Now it’s time to send your cold e-mail. I’ve tried numerous email scripts from a variety of sources online, but this is my best script:

“Hi ______,
My name is ______. I’m a ’09 grad from _________ and current management consultant. I came across your name on LinkedIn while searching the __________ company page. 
I’d love to get your career advice for 15-20 minutes. I’m currently working at ______, but a few of my friends work as _____ (UX Designers) and each time they tell me how much they love their job, I get more interested.
Most of them have told me that if I'm interested in becoming a UX Designer, I have to talk to someone at _______(Google). Do you think I could pick your brain on how I can position myself to be attractive to _______ and what motivated you to choose the company? 
I can call you or keep it to e-mail…whichever is more convenient. I can work around you! 
Would it be possible for us to chat?
Thanks,
__________”

I sent this script out 10 times and received a 70% response rate. It’s not perfect for everyone, but it’s a start. 

It’s important to note then when firing emails to your POCs, you make sure you tailor each to that specific company. There aren’t many things worse than writing an email to Google with an SAP thrown in there. Keep it relevant and keep it GENUINE. 



MASSAGE
The final phase is more of a routine and not a phase with a distinct start and end time. In this phase you will keep track of your communications and “massage” your POCs (sounds weird, huh). What this means is that you will periodically follow up with relevant tidbits about yourself and about pieces of news that pertain to that individual’s position. For instance if you read an interesting article about UX designing, it wouldn’t hurt to email that POC the link to it maybe a couple of weeks after the initial communication. 

By massaging your POC, you’ll become familiar to them. But you dont want to be too pushy. You want to be an asset. So when you send interesting articles, specifically tell them that no reply is needed. 

---------------------------------------------

This was a quick (lol, not so much) overview of the techniques I’ve used in the past that have worked for me. Network, network, network!

I was thinking of creating a course or a video series with some more insights. Is this something any of you would be interested in?

342adr,13,2015-04-27,Putting in my 2 weeks. Did i go about this wrong?,wwoodall,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/342adr/putting_in_my_2_weeks_did_i_go_about_this_wrong/,"So in December the semester before i graduate i accepted a full time offer with a company i was really excited to work for. I told them i was also looking to work during my last semester so they offered me an intern spot and then full time when i graduate. I signed both offers and was really excited. 

Anyways once i started i realized that the work i would be doing is really really boring. We are not really making any new features so i just constantly copy and paste code to integrate new clients. On top of that my ""trainer"" who is really just an entry level dev does not get along with me at all. Its a small startup so only like 25 people in my office. I talked to my boss and got more work/responsibility which was good but the work is still the same. Nothing challenging and mostly just bug fixes or very simple integrations so i started looking for jobs again and landed a couple new offers. I ended up taking another offer in early April since the company seems like it will have more for me to do and 30% salary increase plus better bonuses. I dont start my new job until july so could theoretically work at my current one until then but i feel kinda like a dick leading them on longer and dont need the money so vacation after graduation sounds nice.

Anyway im about to put in my 2 weeks and i am really nervous it is going to go poorly. They still believe i will be starting full time and obviously that is not the case. Not to mention my boss i get along really well with and feel like i am kinda screwing them since they have been waiting for me to start full time. 

What should i say? What should i expect? Am i leaving a bad rep with my current company?

Edit: Should i be asking for references also? "
342bs8,2,2015-04-27,"So long, rock bottom.",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/342bs8/so_long_rock_bottom/,"A year ago this time, I'd failed out of university, friendless, had a few hundred to my name, a web development job on my plate I had no motivation to finish, and hints of an old drinking problem starting to resurface. 

If that wasn't rock bottom, I don't know what was. I packed my bags, contemplated leaving to the French Foreign Legion. At the least, to a small apartment in Leaside, ON where I thought I'd be able to muster the motivation to live off of some tech support / web development work. I thought about abandoning my mother and my ailing father to save myself. I got a job after being suspended from school - my first real software job, a small startup with a lot of traction. They fired me within a week and handed me a check for 1000 dollars, after I wasn't able to keep up with the rapid pace of the place.

I read passages of Camus and stoic literature everyday trying to muster up motivation to keep going on.

I just got my grades from the last semester (I have one exam left!), and it looks like this will be my best semester ever by a mile and then some. I met a gorgeous girlfriend last June who has been with me through all the ups and downs (I haven't told her about that time I hit rock bottom, but she has consistenly there, supporting me since the day we met). I started talking to a psychiatrist (old school one, like the armchair psychologists you see on TV), my dad just got a new kidney, and I have very promising internship offers for this summer starting to surface. I had an app that appeared on The Steve Harvey Show this month. I wasn't able to capitalize because I was still learning the ropes, but it was cool as fuck.

Why am I writing all this out?

I read a comment by the RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan fame on his Reddit AMA, and it reads: 

&gt; When you're in the water, you never think about how far you swam.
You just head toward the other shore.

&gt; When you reach the shore, and look back - then you realize how far you came.

&gt; If you lost something in the water, or gained something in the water, none of those things matter.

&gt; What does matter is that you made it to the other shore.

I'm nowhere near where I want to be, but for the first time in a long time an hour ago, I looked up from my finals preparation and realized that there's nowhere else I'd rather be than right here, and it was a pretty dope feeling - looking back and seeing how far you swam. 

Good luck out there everyone."

I enjoy programming and I'm quite good at it, but I'm very mediocre at math/theory stuff. I've spent at least three times as much effort in probability, physics, EE, linear algebra and graph theory classes as in any of the programming classes I've taken, and tend to get Cs. In programming classes I have an A- average, but together my GPA is far lower than I'd like.

A lot of my friends don't have this disparity at all and have had a lot more success getting internship interviews, or at least it seems that way. It's also possible they downplay the number of jobs they apply to. I have a research position this summer that I'm super excited about and had a good internship last summer, but getting these took more work than seems typical from talking to people.

Basically, how much will this bring me down in getting a real job after graduation? I also ideally would want to get a masters degree in computational biology/bioinformatics but I don't think anything less than a 3.5 will be good enough for that. Is there anything I can do, besides taking more of the classes I'm good at, to put myself in a better position?

Thanks!"

Would reading Dragon Book and building a compiler lead to employment opportunities?",DAEHateRatheism,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/342fy6/have_a_degree_but_no_networkconnectionswork/,"Long story short, I was reclusive and suffered from a lot of social anxiety in college.  I majorly fucked up the one internship I had (as a research assistant in mathematics).  Thus no connections, and no work experience.  My degree is in mathematics and computer science, so naturally I am more interested in the theoretical and foundational topics.  I am not terribly confident in my ability to make it in as a mathematician (though if I had the choice, nothing would please me more than to study math every day).

I've decided I should at least have a go at making a living as a programmer, but I need to prove myself somehow, presumably with a portfolio because I have no references period.

One idea that intrigues me would be to study Dragon Book and start building a compiler of some sort, posting my work at every step of the way on my github.  Is this a suitable project for my situation?"
342i5j,1,2015-04-27,My Comprehensive Guide to Getting a Job,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/342i5j/my_comprehensive_guide_to_getting_a_job/,"Hi All- I thought it might be beneficial for some of you to have an inside perspective of how to identify, pursue, and get various jobs across a wide variety of industries. This is my personal tehcnique so take any bits of it you want. A bit of background about me, I am a current management consultant with one of the Big 4 accounting firms (PwC, Deloitte, KPMG, EY). My experience is in a business environment, but the same principles will apply across the board.

I graduated from Temple with a BBA in Accounting and from the get go I wasnt one of those intense networkers who attended every single free pretzel day or networking dinner. I was introverted in that regard. I thought for sure that a job would land in my lap. I was wrong.

In my junior year I applied to 12 internships. I received all rejections except from one. I hated to admit it, but it wasn't totally unexpected. I barely networked and had a modest 3.0 GPA. I received an invite to interview on campus for a boutique consulting firm. I took the interview and received an invite to the local office. I got an offer for the NYC office and the reason being that they liked me, but they liked three others more for the Philly office so they tried to keep me any way they could. I wasn't going to say no...it was all I had.

Subsequent to my internship I received a full time offer. I worked my tail off for it, too. I did a solid 2 years at the firm until I decided I wanted to do something a bit more challenging, so I shot for the top (Big 4). I went through the entire hiring process for the Big 4 and have even worked a bit in recruiting. I saw first hand what top notch companies look for in a candidate. My goal is to give this advice to any of you who may be having a tough time or who are just starting the search.

###FOUR STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES TO REMEMBER IN SEARCHING FOR A JOB:
1. TARGET
2. Arm
3. Fire
4. Massage


###TARGET PHASE
After deciding which position you want to pursue, you'll need to identify where you'll apply. This is the Target phase. I suggest using a spreadsheet to keep track of your communications with Target companies. I created a handy one here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g5_QPxLTMJ1SmefvqBqamS4Bax3Tzu9NYc73JxPf2zo/edit?usp=sharing

There are various resources you can use to identify companies: Indeed.com, Glassdoor.com, Monster.com, LinkedIn (!!), Facebook, Jobvite.com, your network, etc.
For example, if I'm looking for a job as a UX Designer, I would search one of these websites and note down any companies that interest me.

NOTE: Don't let anyone fool you, networking is the BEST way to get the job you want. You could submit 10 resumes/day via online systems, but that may work 1 out of every 30 times. Networking and getting in front of the target will yield higher success rates.

Once you narrow down your list to around 5-8 targets, it's time to move on to the ARM phase.

###ARM PHASE
You've got your list of Targets, now you need to identify who the key players are at that company.
For example, if I'm targeting Google, I want to make sure I identify any recruiters or managers that may be associated with the position I'm seeking. If the UX Designer job I want is located in San Francisco, I want to scour LinkedIn under the Google company page using the search terms ""recruit, talent"" etc in the Keyword field. This will identify any individuals within the company that work in recruiting. If you're pursuing a job in San Fran, make sure to find recruiters located there. Once you find some, note them in your tracking sheet.

NOTE: I also suggest searching for managers and associates if you come up empty with recruiters. These individuals will know where to point your application.

So how do you get this information you might ask? It takes a little bit of creative thinking and investigative techniques (fancy).

My go-to tools are MailTester.com and the Rapportive GMAIL extension. MailTester requires you to type in an email moniker and it will ping that address to see if it's valid. For instance if you want to reach Brian Wilson at Google, you would type in brian.wilson@google.com or bwilson@google.com or any other combo and see if mailtester gives you a success message. (if there is a real Brian Wilson at Google, which there probably is, i’m sorry dude).

Rapportive is great because you perform the same steps as MailTester but you type the email address into a new Gmail email window and if it's a match, rapportive will pull up the POCs (persons of contact) social media profile so you know you have the right person.

Once you find a valid email address, add it to your tracker.

By doing this, you're setting up for launch, or Arming!

###FIRE PHASE
You’ve done the prep work, you’ve identified your Targets, you’ve identified POCs within those Targets, and you’ve found their email addresses. Now it’s time to send your cold e-mail. I’ve tried numerous email scripts from a variety of sources online, but this is my best script:

-------------------


Hi XXX, My name is XXX. I’m a ’09 grad from XXX and current management consultant. I came across your name on LinkedIn while searching the XXX company page. 

I’d love to get your career advice for 15-20 minutes. I’m currently working at XXX, but a few of my friends work as XXX (UX Designers) and each time they tell me how much they love their job, I get more interested. 

Most of them have told me that if I'm interested in becoming a UX Designer, I have to talk to someone at XXX(Google). 

Do you think I could pick your brain on how I can position myself to be attractive to XXX and what motivated you to choose the company? 

I can call you or keep it to e-mail…whichever is more convenient. I can work around you! 

Would it be possible for us to chat? 

Thanks, XXX


-------------------

I sent this script out 10 times and received a 70% response rate. It’s not perfect for everyone, but it’s a start.
It’s important to note then when firing emails to your POCs, you make sure you tailor each to that specific company. 

There aren’t many things worse than writing an email to Google with an SAP thrown in there. Keep it relevant and keep it GENUINE.

###MASSAGE PHASE

The final phase is more of a routine and not a phase with a distinct start and end time. In this phase you will keep track of your communications and “massage” your POCs (sounds weird, huh). What this means is that you will periodically follow up with relevant tidbits about yourself and about pieces of news that pertain to that individual’s position. For instance if you read an interesting article about UX designing, it wouldn’t hurt to email that POC the link to it maybe a couple of weeks after the initial communication.

By massaging your POC, you’ll become familiar to them. But you dont want to be too pushy. You want to be an asset. So when you send interesting articles, specifically tell them that no reply is needed.

This was a quick (lol, not so much) overview of the techniques I’ve used in the past that have worked for me. Network, network, network!

I was thinking of creating a course or a video series with some more insights. Is this something any of you would be interested in?"

342igh,27,2015-04-27,The Marni Papers. Part 1.,marnipapers,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/342igh/the_marni_papers_part_1/,"[Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3492km/the_marni_papers_part_2/)

All you need to know for starters is that I work for a really prestigious museum. I want everyone to know what happened to me so no on else can suffer my same fate.   

&amp;nbsp;

By “work” I mean I’m an unpaid intern. I’m currently spending a semester interning at this really great museum because I’m a bit of a history geek and thinking of going for a Museum Studies M.A. I work in the Bibliography section of this museum—it’s really small and only has a couple employees. We analyze books, catalogue them, and see if they can be exhibited. Today my really nice boss, the registrar of the department, Paloma asked me to go through these really old documents. If you’re at all familiar with museum work, you know that around 70% of it is grunt work. And since I’m a college intern, I’m basically stuck with all of it. I don’t really mind—Paloma turns a blind eye when I go on Facebook, and she’s always been really nice about my vitiligo, unlike a lot of the other employees.  

&amp;nbsp;

Sure, people won’t ever ask you upfront about what the hell is wrong with your skin, but I’m not stupid. The other day when I was using the bathroom, two coworkers came in and began washing their hands and gossiping. I had my iPod in, but I could hear snippets of their conversation.  

&amp;nbsp;

“What ethnicity even is she? She’s black *and* white.”  

&amp;nbsp;

The other one gave this really gross guffaw. “Julie, you’re so mean!”  

&amp;nbsp;

Ugh, Julie, that bitch. She’s this really chubby lady with these beady little eyes and I know she steals the food I put in the communal fridge. I’ve never really liked her, and now I had a concrete reason not to.   

&amp;nbsp;

But I digress.

&amp;nbsp;

Paloma gave me these documents to look over. There’s probably five Hollinger boxes jam-packed with notes and loose leaf papers. They’re all from the 80’s, and when Paloma heaved them onto my desk, she gave me a sympathetic look.  

&amp;nbsp;

“I’m sorry, Renee. I know it’s grunt work, but it’s really important!”   

&amp;nbsp;

Feigning a smile, I said it was no problem. But the minute she left, I sank into my dismally uncomfortable office chair. Fuck. I had just finished putting together and assembling the accession numbers for some other files, and I had to do even more tedious work. Rubbing my eyes to keep myself awake, I delved into the first box.  

&amp;nbsp;

Within each folder was probably 30 pages of letters, and each started with “Marni,” or “Dear Marni.”  

&amp;nbsp;

Frowning a little, I rifled throuh the rest of the letters in the folder. They were all little letters and notes to this “Marni” about really trivial stuff. For example,  

&amp;nbsp;

“Dear Marni,
Janet didn’t show up to work today, I think she’s sick. It’s probably the change in weather.
Talked to Veronica about the new acquisitions. She said they should be ready by the 24th. 
Bob needs to see you about 1974.1.1.”  

&amp;nbsp;

So on and so forth. There was nothing especially interesting these letters, but the more I read through them the more I got curious about Marni. Since we have an open office, I wheeled my chair over to Paloma who exited quickly out of the Weight Watchers website she was perusing.   

&amp;nbsp;

“What’s up?” she asked quickly.  

&amp;nbsp;

“Who’s Marni?”  

&amp;nbsp;

Paloma frowned, a furrow appearing between her brows. “She was the registrar in the 80’s.”   

&amp;nbsp;

Now it was my turn to frown. “Was? What happened to her?”  

&amp;nbsp;

Paloma shuddered, and crossed herself. Despite her high position, deep down was a very traditional, Catholic Filipina.   

&amp;nbsp;

“She got fired.”  

&amp;nbsp;

My curiosity piqued, I ventured on, ignoring her obvious discomfort. “Why? Did she take something?”  

&amp;nbsp;

“No, the opposite. She lost a very important piece to the museum.” And that all she would say about it. “Now didn’t I just give you something to do, or do you need some more work?”  

&amp;nbsp;

Smiling cheekily at her, I wheeled myself back to my desk. I brought up the museum’s database on my metallic hunk of a computer. I had a hunch about what she might have misplaced.  

&amp;nbsp;

I typed in the accession number I had found in the notes slowly. “1974.1.1.”  

&amp;nbsp;

The website flickered, and then showed me what I was looking for.   

&amp;nbsp;

“**Item ID**: 160173  
**Accession Number**: 1974.1.1  
**Level of description**: Anthropodermic bibliopegy  
**Author/Creator**: Unknown  
**Title**: Unknown  
**Biographical History**: Loan from _______ University. Was previously thought to be sheep skin. Delicate and in poor condition. No other information known. Considered lost since 1974.”  

&amp;nbsp;

Holy shit. My eyes widened, and leaned back in my chair. No wonder Paloma crossed herself. Anthopodermic bibliopegy…that’s museum-speak for books bound in skin. And not just any skin. Human skin. They’re extremely rare, and would have been a great boon for the museum’s exhibit. No wonder she was fired. A shiver ran up my spine. What exactly happened to that book? You don't just lose something that important... I decided to see if I could find Marni's address and find out for myself. I was a bored unpaid intern in a new city. It seemed exciting and fun. I wish I could go back in time and never have looked at the Marni Papers, as I had began to call them. 

But time's growing short, and I can hear *her* coming down the stairs. There's going to be another feeding. Oh god help me. Reddit, help me before it's too late.

342jf4,2,2015-04-27,DoNdad and Emom Here. Frustrated to the point of insanity (mostly venting but also looking for proactive thoughts) Warning: Long,ceruleannymph,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/342jf4/dondad_and_emom_here_frustrated_to_the_point_of/,"My SiL told me about this subreddit the other day and I am so glad I found this. I've been reading all your stories and seeing all the similarities and more importantly realizing how shitty things in my life have been and that I don't think I can deal with my Ndad any longer.

I'm going to be graduating from college in about 2-3 weeks. (yay! excited to be graduating on time and had a pretty good 4 years). I'm ready to move on to the next stage of my life, grad school or internships or working. This feels like the culmination of my young adult life but I have some HUGE fears and anxieties in the background concerning my immediate family. Let me give some short back story. I grew up with an Ndad and Emom. I have an older brother who was from my mother's previous marriage whom I am close with and we talk about these issues sometimes. Growing up, my father was extremely emotionally, psychologically, and verbally abusive towards all of us, and would get physically abusive with my brother. I think growing up my brother was the SG. He was a genuinely good kid, top of his class, played sports, had lots of friends but my father would fly off the handle about literally fucking ridiculous things and treated him like garbage. Home life was volatile. My father worked in construction and due to his poor work ethic made hardly any money. He often came home pissed and crazy and would scream and throw tantrums at my mom and brother about things like dinner taking too long or my brother wearing his hat backward. I often dissociated and would zone out when he got crazy like this (learned as an adult i have textbook PTSD with dissociative tendencies). My mother would try to stand up to him but mostly did nothing when he directed his behavior at us. My mom never worked cause he convinced her not to (to make sure she had no money) and she was the primary one who cared for us. Other than screaming and destroying things he had very little interest in us and did not participate in taking care of our most basic needs and blatantly avoided interacting with us unless he felt like it. My mom was a good mom, but if he screamed loud enough his needs always came first. Because of this neglectful bullshit I ended up getting molested when I was about 10 and raped at 17 (no one knows, i knew they couldnt handle it). My mom always acted like she put up with him because he ""brought home the bacon"" but really he had no money to speak of and we grew up in poverty. All the money we lived off of was loan money, and most went to buying himself things (he's addicted to online shopping and hordes) and eventually stopped working altogether. He's been unemployed for like eight years.
 When my brother lived with them he spent most of his time at friend's houses or would come home early in the morning and leave early for school so he would never have to be around my dad. I was just barely in elementary school when my brother moved out to go to college. I felt abandoned since he was my only friend and now I would eventually become Ndad's punching bag. My brother essentially went LC after that, he would come home for christmas but only for a few days because the abuse would start back up. I have a distinct memory of being about eight or nine and watching Dinotopia with my brother one morning. My dad came in asking my brother about some of his mail he had opened and what it was about. My brother politely asked him not to open his mail and that it was illegal. My dad promptly threw a chair across the room and came at my brother telling him he was going to kill him and started beating the crap out of him and trying to choke him to death. Luckily I distracted him long enough for my brother to run out of the house and leave town. When my mom got home that afternoon I told her what happened and she looked away and smiled and basically said ""thats not true...you don't know what you saw"" and told me to go walk the dog. I knew after that she was never going to help us.
Due to seeing my father constantly abusing my mother and brother, I grew to hate him. He had this weird obsession with saving face and being monstrous in front of me or toward me and then playing it down like it was a joke or he was kidding or I was overreacting.  I would watch him punch my brother in the face or call my mom a ""dumb bitch"" and then smile at me and tell me i was his ""baby girl."" It was so fucking creepy. He always bought me things and would talk to me like I was literally a baby (he does it even to this day) but by the time I could show that I didn't like what was happening he started becoming more verbally abusive towards me but kept trying to buy me off. He always tried to form this makeshift comradery between us. He always said stuff to me like ""you and I are different from your mother and brother, we're the same"" or ""we're special."" I never knew what to say or do when he started with that shit. I hated him and I felt like my body language, glaring at him and lack of speaking should have conveyed that. I always regret that I didn't stand up to him more. I always wanted to call the police or tell him to his face to leave but I knew he would wreck me. He's very tall and weighs 200 lbs. and when he gets angry...i've never seen anything else like it. Its not just his size, its this energy he has. When other people get mad I don't care and have no trouble standing up for myself. but with him I just shut down. I start shaking involuntarily cant breathe, start crying uncontrollably and can't form words or sentences.  I still do this now as a grown ass woman, its fucking pathetic. So i'm not even sure how I would call him out on his shit, when I've attempted to in the past he just immediately starts screaming in my face and threatening me.

Anyway, she always said she would eventually leave. now I'm an adult and even though my brother and I are out of the house, my mother is STILL with him! I've been VLC with him for most of college, only rarely going home, i never call or text him. Most ALL the abuse gets targeted at her now and still she stays with him acting like they're a normal married couple having a ""spat"" or he's doing something ""annoying."" You wouldn't believe the awful things he does to her. (financially ruining her, yelling and screaming in her face, having affairs, constant criticizing, telling her he wants a divorce and then refuses to leave her home, preventing her from seeing her family, stalking her at work)I tell her she can have him removed from the premises by a constable and she acts like she will but then just goes home and fixes him dinner. WTF. I read something last night that hit me to hard about how there is no such thing as an enabler, its just a different form of abuse. Now someone I've cared about and felt empathetic towards my whole life, I'm now seeing them as the spineless cowardly bitch they are.

My graduation is coming up and my lease ends the day after so they are wanting to help move my stuff back home, then after I plan to immediately move to a new city and get a job bar-tending to get ready for grad school. Once established with an apartment and job I plan to go full NC and basically drop off the face of the earth to those two. I've told my mother I DON'T want to be around him ever again and if she wants to stay married to him I won't be seeing her. She acts like she understands and will leave but consistently she tries to do things to convince me they're normal and it's safe to come home in order to spend time with me. She knows I'm mentally unstable and his behavior sends me into debilitating panic attacks as well as depression. I honestly don't even want to see either of them at graduation, I'm dreading moving my stuff out and having to make eye contact with either of them. It literally makes me physically ill just entertaining the thought. I would confront her about it but honestly I've done that so many times. shes never going to leave and she will always trivialize his crimes so she can pretend they're normal. "
342ju1,2,2015-04-27,Finding work?,soretits,oilfield,https://www.reddit.com/r/oilfield/comments/342ju1/finding_work/,"I didn't see any rules regarding posts so I hope this kind of post is allowed.   I am a recent graduate with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering.  I've been looking for an engineering job for almost a year and haven't had too many bites.  I'm not great with interviews and come to find out my resume was crap (formatting, presentation, wording, etc. not content).  The few I had were with crap companies so I didn't go after them though I probably should have looking back on things.  I don't have the best GPA and I don't have internships.  I worked to get myself through school, mostly retail, but a few other positions, photographer, computer lab assistant, math tutor.  I also had experience though short as a CNC operator and another job doing product testing. I worked anywhere between 20-40+ hours per week in addition to going to school full time.  Mommy and Daddy didn't put my butt through school.  

At this point my loans are catching up on me and people are wondering about the gap between school and now.  I just want to work.  I've had an interest in working in the oil and gas industry for a while.  I took a class on well logging though I didn't do great in it because my other classes were more important at the time and I hadn't really considered working in the industry until part way through the class.  The material wasn't hard I just had more important things to do at the time for more important classes.  I've started looking for entry level jobs in the industry and haven't had much luck.  I figure I can go work on a rig for a while and work my way up.  I figure the money isn't bad and I can get industry and rig experience.  I have the education, but lack the experience which is what many of the engineering jobs want.  Really at this point I just need a job and one that is going to contribute not just to a paycheck, but my future.  I'm not afraid of long hours, weather, or hard work.  Though I worked retail I worked the physically demanding jobs, unloading trucks, pushing carts, loading bricks and dirt for customers, etc. in 100+ degree heat, humidity, rain, snow, -30 degree cold.  I don't mind hard work and heavy lifting.  I also don't mind technical work.  From working and going to school I'm used to late nights, early mornings, and lack of sleep.  I've done my share of over-nighters and 4+ Monster/coffee days.  I get along with just about everyone and usually when everyone else is freaking out I'm the calm one making rational decisions.

That all said can anyone give me some advice?  I don't know what to look for when it comes to entry level positions.  I've tried ""entry oil"" in indeed.com, but didn't come up with much.  I've tried looking for sites directly for oil jobs, but most are for highly experienced people or are trying to sell you something.  Do you know of anyone hiring? I'm in the U.S. and can relocate just about anywhere if the paycheck is worth heading out there for.  I would be willing to work outside the U.S. as well though I doubt most places are willing to hire someone with no oil field experience for those kind of jobs.  I don't mind hard work and long hours, I'm just trying to find a job that I can learn, get some experience, and move up in it.  Any help is appreciated, a number for a company that's hiring, an email for a rig supervisor needing an extra set of hands, or just some reddit comments, anything.  I'm going nuts just sitting here, idle, waiting to get on with my life and worrying whether I'm going to end up washing dishes at a restaurant for the rest of my life.

I have been accepted to ESC Rennes for a Masters degree in Marketing, and I'm happy about it!

I've seen that ESC Rennes is ranked 10th in France among the business schools, and 34th in Europe I think according to the financial times' ranking. French friends have told me it is a quite good school and well ""respecté"" but others have told me to look for a better option.

I have read so many different experiences from both attending ESC Rennes and for living in Rennes and although everyone agrees that it is a beautiful city, many guys seemed to have found the language barrier to be a deal breaker. I speak spanish (Im Mexican) I think I have a good english level, and I speak some french (not on a professional or University competence) and I can ""survive or have small talk"" with it.

1.-My questions are if ESC Rennes is really a good school and if you would recommend it? (No other options are into account)
 
2.- Is it truly impossible to get an internship or a job if you do not speak French on a ""high level""

Thanks, hope I can get some great advice from you guys!

When i got in i was overjoyed and was really happy, but now looking at the cost both my parents and i are nervous that this debt is WAY too much for me to handle. As a little background i live in new york and wads lucky enough to get into many different schools for engineering that cost a lot less ( queens college (not engineering but they have a 3-2 program with columbia), GWU, Stony Brook, and U Miami. I dont know if this is a bad idea but i really need advice so im going to say how much each of these cost so that hopefully some amazing sole can give me advice because right now, i'm a lost 17 year old who doesn't want to live in debt for the rest of his life. onto the costs:

queens columbia program: (3 years at queens college (~3k a year which my parents will pay) and 2 years at columbia (estimated probably at ~60 with financial aid

GWU (~30k a year); U miami (~28k a year); Stony Brook (~20k a year)

with UIUC i got 0 in FA so its 50,502 and most of that will be loans so will end up being around ~29k a year for 10 years if its going to be that every year ( i know i can make money from dorming off campus in an apartment to getting internships but regardless this is of course still a lot). I know this is probably the wrong place to post this and i will probably also post this on college confidential but my main choice right now is definitely UIUC because of the great reputation and rigor that the school offers in engineering which will lead to a better job. so if you can't answer my questions if you could tell me where to post this so people could.

I've seen that ESC Rennes is ranked 10th in France among the business schools, and 34th in Europe I think according to the financial times' ranking. French friends have told me it is a quite good school and well ""clasée"" but others have told me to look for a better option.
I have read so many different experiences from both attending ESC Rennes and for living in Rennes and although everyone agrees that it is a beautiful city, many guys seemed to have found the language barrier to be a deal breaker. I speak spanish (Im Mexican) I think I have a good english level, and I speak some french (not on a professional or University competence) and I can ""survive or have small talk"" with it.
1.-My questions are if ESC Rennes is really a good school and if you would recommend it? (No other options are into account)
2.- Is it truly impossible to get an internship or a job if you do not speak French on a ""high level""

I know, I am practically a baby because I was born after the year 2000, but whatever.  Anyways, I was offered an internship at an art studio to work with a team of software developers this summer and I am really excited.  I met with one of them today and he said I should learn C because it is useful for lots of things.  So, after school today I googled around and found some resources about learning C and I am really liking learn C the hard way.  I know that I should read K&amp;R but I am a little strapped for cash right now, and the local library doesn't carry it, and I can't inter library loan it either.  Basically I am asking what you guys know of in terms of free recources to learn C.  I also am not sure which version of C to learn because from my research it seems like there is C99 which is widely supported but I have also seen some things about C11 which seems very unsupported.

-I am a college student who just interviewed for a full-time, technical position for a chemical firm. Got rejected from the FT so I would like to ask if I can intern for them instead. It'll be cheaper for the company and give me a chance to prove myself. 

-The face-to-face, behavioral part of the interview seemed to go well. I am almost certain that the rejection came to due to my performance on the technical exam. I would like to chalk up my technical interview performance to a bad day. 

-The company itself is relatively small so the roles are not concretely defined. They have opened up roles for students to come in and intern in the past. 

-The company is in need on candidates of my background and do have the funds to hire. 

Would it be professional for me to ask them to consider my application for an internship? I feel like I have nothing to lose by doing this.

Anyway. I've been unemployed for almost two months now. Applying for job after job (west coast).

The thing is, I'm starting to wonder if my blackness is a bit of a problem. I've gotten interviews, I've done well on them (I took an interviewing class to help myself).

Yes, I know I'm just a recent grad with negligible life experience, but really? Somehow, many of my white/Asian friend seems to be finding companies that are willing to teach/mold/whatever. I feel like they don't have it this hard, but correct me if I'm wrong.

In the past few weeks:

-I've had phone interviews, told I would be brought in to meet this week, they look at my LinkedIn (which says the *same* thing as my resume), I never hear from them again.

-I interviewed amazingly for one position, was told I was going to get reference checked next. I emailed to follow up, and....nothing. Finally got several back and forth emails which culminated in, ""We didn't think we got enough candidates the first time around, so we're going to keep interviewing. You're still in the running though."" The job was only administrative.....

-A phone interview with a tech company that GRILLED me on why I was interested in switching industries. They even asked me what schools I was accepted into when I applied to college (back in 2009...). I had an internship for 4 years in school for operations. Yes, I've never done operations in Tech before, but I've done it elsewhere.

I'm just very frustrated, and kind of sad. I'm looking into taking coding classes, although the concept of taking out a loan when I have no job is disturbing.

I guess I have accepted my never have a real job status. :("

I came to the U.S. on a student visa with a very strong desire to go into the legal field and eventually law school. I was pressured into taking the Computer Science route at university by my family and a lot of friends. I was told it would offer me better opportunities financially and the ability to permanently reside in the US. 

I did very well in that field of study and earned my BS in it. I have had three jobs in the IT field. I reluctantly quit my last job because I wasn't very happy. I have a green card now, without restrictions, so I can do what I want to professionally. Thankfully!

I'm currently enrolled in am ABA-certified certificate program at a local community college due to start in June. I'm unemployed right now and I don't want to pursue another IT related position. I would prefer to work in the legal field in any position that I can get, preferably to get experience and enough exposure to benefit me in the long run. Even if it's very basic clerical work. I just don't know how to sell myself as a BS in Computer Science with the intention of being a paralegal? Would I get an interview for anything based on my CS experience? 

Two of my positions required HIPAA training and one of my academic focuses was security. Both those jobs dealt heavily in dealing with federal regulations on private healthcare information. I have exposure and interest in that, certainly. I'm also very familiar with immigration law, out of necessity, given my background. 

Should I try applying for clerical positions at law offices or should I wait to be certified with hopefully some intern experience?"

I was a smoker throughout college, I'd say from late freshman year until I graduated.  It was something I would do socially, or alone, either way it was fantastic.  Gave me something to look forward to and made everything more interesting.  Towards the end of college though (probably the last three months I'd say), it began to treat me a bit differently.  The real world was bearing down on me, the loans seemed more real than ever, the job market seemed dry as a bone to someone like me with no experience (right out of college I know, but it's amazing how under-qualified I was with other graduates for not doing an internship), and my family was beginning to ride me about not having a job lined up.  I was smoking and just stressing in my mind about my job search, what I was going to do with my life, why I was getting high instead of putting out resumes, and especially my senior project which was stressful as hell.  My friends, don't ever let your thoughts get trapped in a hole like that, it began getting me depressed and I wasn't enjoying smoking or anything at all.  

When I graduated, I decided to give up toking as I knew if I landed a job, a drug test would be needed.  In fact, the night prior to graduation was my last time for a long time.  I graduated, and continued working my retail job full time to make money as loan payments began to knock.  I was going to interviews, but getting no response, and began to turn into a retail zombie.  Work whatever random shift I had, and come home and have some beers, and repeat.  It's amazing the toll working a retail job can have on people, for me a convenience store.  The constant berating can really mess with someone's mind, which I soon learned.  I went from job hunting, to six months later thinking I was going to be doing my shitty job for a long time, and I kind of gave up on moving forward with a career.  

Fast forward to February, and a friend from college mentions to me that there is a job opening at their company, I send over my resume and an interview is lined up.  Things go well, and to my surprise I land the job two days after the interview.  My mind set had been bad, I was just working to hopefully get drunk with a friend of two and that was all there really was for me it seemed.  I began the job and things were great, learning new things, having my own desk and computer, nobody yelling at me for a soda being 89 cents now instead of 59 cents, it was great.  But over time my mind began to get into the daily work grind mood, working all week, partying all weekend, and then doing it all over again.  It felt empty and un-fullfilling, sure I had money, but the constant grind of day after day desk work was taking it out of me.  Trying to drink for a buzz just wasn't doing it for me anymore, and I wasn't sure what to do.

Two months into work though, I was doing well at the job, people at the company like me and I was good at the job.  So this past Sunday, I went hiking with a friend of mine to a small waterfall in the area.  It was a good time, but crowded as it was a nice day.  So we drove out and headed further out to a farm in the area that has an amazing mountain view.  It is used for big events, but is open to the public and is a beautiful property of small vineyards and orchards, with cattle out further that you can see from the main barn area.  We happened to be the only ones there somehow, as it was about 80 and sunny with a few clouds and a steady breeze, the perfect weather.

Me and my friend sat down under a tree and were talking, taking in the amazing views and gorgeous day.  He says he packed his vape up and brought it with him, and asked if I wanted a few hits.  Being finally settled into a job, I gladly agreed.  I figured it was time that I try again what was so paranoia inducing to me for many months.  I had a job, and although I wasn't enjoying it as much as I should, I knew I wasn't going to leave it anytime soon. 

I took 4 hits or so off of the vape, and felt the high begin to set in.  It had been almost a year since I had that feeling, that feeling when you know you're going to get higher than usual and could feel it building, but this time it was different.  Gone were the job worries, the family stress that comes from not having a job, the worries about what I was going to do for money, and I could simply enjoy the fact that I was going to get good and high and enjoy the world around me.  

I sat there with my friend and jabbered about past experiences we had that were so much fun, and just enjoying the amazing scenery.  After a while, I decided to get up and go for a walk.  This started a solid hour of just walking through the orchards and vineyards, looking at the life around us and the small apples and peaches that were beginning to blossom all around.  I had a weird sense of calmness, no stress about work or other things in life, just me enjoying the beautiful day and nature, talking with a friend about anything that popped in your mind.  Words can't describe how amazing the experience was, it brought a calm to me that I can't describe, and I could feel the sun's warmth shining on me, but also the cooling of the breeze and the shade from the clouds.  Hell we even talked about why clouds were even there, and how they formed and the different types of clouds and the purpose they served, it was an amazing experience.

After a while, we walked back to the car, not before stopping off at a conveniently placed swing set.  The car ride home was even awesome, winding through hilly farmlands and taking in the views.  A road that I had seen a million times before all of a sudden turned into something more, it was a working part of this world we live in and it was beautiful.

After I got home and had a snack and went to bed, my entire day of work afterwards has been awesome.  Everyone seems nicer, as I am not as anxious about things because I feel like I see the world as it is a little bit better, and can enjoy my place in it rather than constantly worrying about it.  I don't know when I will smoke again, nor do I expect it to be like it was this first time back, but I hope to keep this perspective on my life that I have been missing for a long time now.

I know this was long, but I wanted to share my experience with everyone here and hopefully if anyone else is in the post college jobless world they can relate, you will find a job and it will get better!

I mean, it's the largest law firm in the country. And with that territory, comes a flurry of interns, both law students and undergrads.

So lots slip in between the cracks. And for awhile, I did, too.

But one day, a fellow senior partner made a crack to you. He mentioned how stressed he was, and made a crude reference to a few things he wanted a certain intern to do. Apparently she arranged a few things for a trial. And she was surprisingly competent, and came with a body too sexy to be hidden underneath her typical black skirt and white button up shirt.

""She's the one with the lipstick,"" he mentions.

Its late one night, and it feels like all the senior partners are heading into trials or big negotiations. All of the interns are required to work — whether it be fetching coffee or redacting credit card numbers for trial.

You walk into the break room to grab a fresh cup of coffee. You open the door softly, but there's only one person in there. I don't notice you right away, but your eyes land directly on my ass. Curvy, and accented by a pencil skirt. My long dark hair is curled bouncing as I reach for a plate from the top shelf. I turn around, and you see a young intern, probably 21, with bright green eyes. I'm short, only five three, with high cheekbones and striking dark hair.

Some closing thoughts...

Just because a company isn't advertising specifically for a timeframe, doesn't mean they aren't hiring. Companies don't really care what season it is the way schools do. If you see a sweet gig you're interested in that's only advertising for summer, you should apply anyway.

Company isn't actively advertising for interns? Doesn't matter, you should apply anyway. You're likely to receive a lot more rejection this way. I've been doing this for a while with some success, though. I've submitted my resume to companies under a full time position, and included that I wanted to do an internship in my cover letter, or mentioned it to the recruiter when they inevitably send me the ""uh, you're still in school, why are you applying here, exactly?"" email.

Do not wait for companies to come to you. YOU GO TO THEM. Especially if you don't have any experience. Kick down the door and show them that you're awesome and that they're goofy for even considering not hiring you.

For those of you considering taking a semester off to get more experience: I am doing this right now, and absolutely loving it. Easily the best decision of my life so far. If you have any questions about what it's been like, I'm happy to answer them via PM or comments.

Hooray for engineering!

EDIT: I'm happy to add more. Please comment with your findings!"

I hadn't been applying to many places because I haven't taken data structures yet (next course to take) and thought that was crucial to being useful in the work field. I have taken 3 programming classes (java, c, c++) and a few computer organization/logic design classes. Do I have enough to be considered for an internship?

I ask this because I recently networked with a family friend at a funeral and she put in a very good word about me to her son, a hiring manager at Toshiba. He just emailed me saying I was recommended from a highly reputable source and that he wants to talk to me. What do I need to prepare for this? This is pretty much my last chance to land a good internship this summer.

Thanks for all the replies in advanced."

I am a student in computer science interning for a small software company that makes and maintains a custom ERP system for customers , the users of this system on average 3-7 per customer connect to a server trough a remote desktop connect.
Right now all of this is hosted on a server at the customer so they can also have mail and other software up and running.
Smaller customers that don’t need a server for other software use hosting provided by the company I intern for that  at the moment is a small server room in the attic.

The assignment I have been given as an intern is find out and write a business case on what is the cheapest or best option to move the customers servers and the company’s to a datacenter of some sorts
The options I have found :

* Colocation,
* Dedicated server(Baremetal VM?)
* VPS
* Dedicated cloud

Any comments advice or questions I should ask my self are welcome i want to learn ..

I am an IT graduate who had land a job with the title *Network and System Administrator*. I have average, if not little, computer networking skills I got from my internship (and of course my undergrad) that made me realize this job is for me. My organization is quite small so they explained to me that I'll have to do both the duties and responsibilities of the offered job.  And so I accepted it. It has been months since I entered the organization and most that I do are troubleshoot some workstations, fix internet connection issues (mostly cable-related), and submit a monthly Internet Usage Report. I thought I was doing great until I realized I am... *invisible* to the organization's IT group AND that I am not contributing something of significance to our organization.
Why, you ask? You see, our IT group consists of Web Developers, Application Developers, and Mobile Developers. I am the sole person who works with networks and the like. I handle our organization's internal computer network. Our IT group is much more focused on the developers and this made me feel like I am left alone. They can't relate to me and so they have their own world. I can fairly say our organization can move on without me since I know my senior can possibly do my job. Without tickets I have nothing to do but browse tutorials and also read here .I'm not saying that I seek out their attention but it made me question ""Am I really needed here?""  
I blatantly say that I am not contributing something of significance to our organization because I feel that all my reports, tasks, and whatnot are not enough to truly deserve my job title. I just graduated. I don't know what a Network and System Administrator really does. I just follow orders.
People of Networking, I only seek an advice. Please don't be mean.
1.) Do I really deserve this job? Or is it time to leave?
2.) What are the other things that I can do to make my existence in our organization be more important or at least make me feel like my job is really needed?

Everyone in the rest of the department thought the same, and so did the general manager of our district.

Work for this department for months under constant reassurances that I'm doing great work, and that it's getting me closer to getting a job. Even at the expense of other work I should be doing, because hey, if I get a job this will all be water under the bridge, right? Now, at three weeks left until I get out of here, the general manager asks the manager of this department what his plan to get me hired is. Department manager draws a complete blank.

I had worried that neglecting other areas would cost me the job. I had worried that I wasn't performing well enough or working hard enough. I had worried that somehow my first boss who (even the general manager has told me) is a flaming asshole, would somehow screw me out of getting the job. 

Clearing all these hurdles, only to lose the job because the manager of the other department had no idea who I actually was, is incredibly ironic and frustrating. But also really, really dumb.

In my childhood all my teachers and my parents said that I will get to be successful. I've gotten straight As all the time without learning much. Now I am in the 6th semester of my computer science bachelor's degree and I am only halfway done with all the courses.
That's because I've never learned to work for my grades so I only learn half-arsed. This leads to me getting negative grades which leads to frustration which leads to me procrastinating which leads to even worse grades.

I'm not sure that I even want to work in CS anymore. I've had 4 internships in which I felt uncomfortable because I always felt like I was underperforming. People were talking behind my back, this I know for a fact. This stressed me out so much that I had to decline a really good offer to stay with the company after my internship. And although I said to myself: ""hey, good job, they wanted to continue working for them!"" I have the feeling that I am not that good in what I'm doing.

The next thing is that since I've gotten a girlfriend 2 years ago I've gained weight and although I am not super fat and ugly, I feel unwell and unattractive. So I say to myself: ""Ok, start to eat healthy and start the couch to 5k program"" I ate a sack of carrots... immediately followed by a bacon and cheese sandwich. I started with the 9 week running program and stopped on week 4. I want to get up early in the morning, but I can't get myself to get out of bed before 10 am because I wouldn't know what to do with the time.. (i have something to do though)

And then there is my relationship. My girlfriend is always worrying about the future and is stressed out about her own exams . So much that she kinda drags me down. She ""copes"" with the stress by playing online games and letting others do the work for her. Lucky for her she is good in memorizing stuff so she can pass most of the classes without being good at the subjects. I didn't notice that until lately and I'm not even sure if I want to be with her anymore.

So yeah... I woke up today with the realisation that I don't want to wake up today which is a really shitty feeling. It seems like I've lost all my motivation and momentum. I've become grumpy and I am hardly enjoying anything I do anymore. I think I have depression and should consult someone.

tl;dr: I don't want to wake up in the morning because I feel like I am just a lazy piece of shit that should do better in life."

Last summer I was hired as a software development intern and it was  a great experience. I was transferred to a new team half way through working on a brand new product for the company and it has been really amazing being able to see a product go from barely an idea on a whiteboard to talking to clients about jumping on board. At the end of my internship in august they hired me on as a junior dev working part time around my school schedule. I will have worked here a year in may. While I really do love the office, my coworkers, and what I do, I dont feel very challenged. My work is relatively simple webdev stuff using HTML/Javascript/DOJO and I do touch the backend server stuff as well. Now my question is: where do I go from here? I certainly could work here the rest of college (~2years) and looking for offers upon graduation. I am hesitant to do so because I could possibly being missing out on other internship opportunities over the summer as well as being able to diversify my skills and learn more about what interests me outside o my current responsibilities. I am currently being paid $15/hr (from $10/hr during my summer internship) and know I could make more, but I feel I have a sweet gig here and want to be thankful for what I have.

I have been checking in with this subreddit about every other day for the past 3 or so years. And just yesterday I signed an offer letter with a company I really want to work for.

I know around this time of the year there is a surplus of threads with to-be grads or recent grads who are kind of freaking out about finding a job.  I was one of them. 

My advice is there really is no secret.  My GPA is bad: ~2.4, I only have one internship where I didn't really learn anything, and I only have 3 projects on my github (all from one CS class). 

You just have to get yourself out there and apply.  I made it a habit of applying to about 2 or 3 positions every other day. Also if someone messages you on LinkedIn about a position, reply (unless its a staffing company [personal preference])! They messaged you which means you sorta have the upper hand and you have nothing to lose.

Their will also be times where you are in the middle of the interview process for 1 or more companies and you keep getting contacted by other company recruiters.  Times like this were really stressful and busy which made it easy to just say I wasn't interested or not reply at all, but you never know if one interview process will fall through so you want to take every opportunity you can get.

Now that it's typed out my advice seems very common knowledge, but I really wish someone told me this 2 months ago. Again, thanks for all the help guys! And good luck to everyone trying to find a job.

I applied for a (very large multi-national) company at the beginning of April, ~1st.

I got an email from a University Specialist saying they want to set up an interview. I emailed her back immediately after getting her email requesting one for the following Tuesday (the 14th). She didn't email back for two days, so I emailed her again. She immediately emailed after that, apologizing for the delay and setting up an interview for Tuesday morning, and that she would send me a confirmation email the day before.

Come next Tuesday, two hours before the interview, I still get no email, so I email her again where she once again apologizes and does confirm the interview.

I interview with the two people, it seems to go great. They ""evaluate"" my interview at the end, saying I did very well and was very prepared and that I would hear back with a decision at the beginning of next week. I say ok, I send the thank you notes etc. etc.

Come next week I get nothing. So on Friday (the 24th) I email the University Specialist again, wondering what's up.

She emails me back (with a recruiter c.c. to the email) later that day saying that a recruiter will get back to me ASAP.

She ends the email with ""fyi [recruiter] - [my name] interviewed on April 14th for the [position]. 

So to me it seems that the recruiter wasn't even notified until I sent out that email 10 days after my interview.

Now I admit I might be a bit more annoyed than I need to be due to the problems I've had with the specialist, but still. Does the process really take this long?

The only saving grace I see is on glassdoor most interns that got an offer said the process usually took 4+ weeks.

And is there anything I can do to possibly speed up the process?"
345yww,14,2015-04-28,Internship social life?,guyvango,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/345yww/internship_social_life/,"I'm interning at a well known company at a location where there are lots of intern events but the number of interns is low (50-400), so everyone will know each other and there isn't the big company ""anonymous factor"". There is also dorm-like intern housing where all the interns live. Does anyone have experience interning at a company like this? I was wondering if I would be able to not be involved socially and just do my own thing in this internship.

I'll go into a little depth about myself to give you a bit of context. I've had social anxiety(SA) issues for most of my life. Freshmen year of college was miserable for me because I always had SA because of having a roommate and having to talk to people. I've luckily been able to get my own place every year after that and been able to basically be anonymous irl. Being involved socially is a bit painful for me because it brings up feelings that I've been trying to avoid. I have been making progress with my SA and I do want to actually make friends and talk to people but only when I can do it by my own choice and have enough space to ""recover"" from talking to people.

At an internship like this, I feel like it would a bit weird for me to keep doing what I'm doing especially when everyone else will be really close to each other. I've had internships before and I can talk to people at work about work related things but that's kind of the extent of my social skills. Outside of programming related topics, I get nervous and anxious because there isn't a defined purpose to what is being discussed so my mind blanks out on how to act. All my life, I have basically had to choose between looking weird for being socially anxious or looking weird for not talking to anyone. At other companies, the latter option is usually better for me because a lot of people do their own thing.

Will I be ""that guy"" if I don't get involved in the company social life?

3460qy,11,2015-04-28,My MIL is just out of line,GIMME_ALL_THE_BABIES,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3460qy/my_mil_is_just_out_of_line/,"After 2 years of rude, insulting, and selfish behavior, I am done with my MIL (and partly my FIL). Here is the shit I have put up with:

* She keeps asking if I  will continue to work when we have kids. When I  say that I will, she gives a relieved sigh and exclaims, ""good!"" I really do plan to continue to work but it isn't her call or her business what DH and I decide to do when the time comes. She has also had this conversation with me in front of my mom. Nevermind the fact she hasn't worked since DH was a fetus.
* She was so entitled at my bridal shower. My SIL has an actual gluten insensitivity.  You'd never know because she never mentions it unless you're actively offering her some cake.  But MIL has ""asymptomatic gluten insensitivity as diagnosed by an inconclusive diagnostic test."" So she didn't bother to rsvp to my aunts that there were GF party-goers (4 in  total,  3 for BS reasons). It's clear she sees it as my fault there was no GF food for the first couple courses (it's a party in my honor and I obviously didn't plan it and she had the host's email address and phone number),and she treated my aunts like crap, saying how it's more than just a little thing because it's member of the bridal party (SIL was a bridesmaid) and the mother of the groom. My MOH was also GF and you'd never know because she just ate around stuff and kept quiet.
* As mentioned above, my MOH keeps gluten free. Enough guests of my wedding are GF that I did order GF cupcakes from my baker for my wedding and took some to MIL to taste a few months prior (because I'm nice). I mentioned to her that my MOH (my cousin) is also gluten free so I was working hard to accommodate everyone.  Without skipping a beat,  she said, ""Mother of the groom and sister of the groom are more important."" Not to me, MIL. 
* I didn't sit down the week of my wedding. I was a crazy person getting things from all across the city. The day of the rehearsal dinner (which DH and I planned and budgeted for, not MIL and FIL), I did not sit down. I had 15 minutes to get ready after running around all day and was barely on time for the rehearsal. DH had one task that day: to pick up a GF mousse cake from Whole Foods for my MOH, SIL, and MIL, which he did. On the way from the venue, DH's phone and mine went off at the same time with texts from MIL: ""dont forget my mousse cake."" I was livid. I'd run around all day like a crazy person and she was concerned with the special dessert for her.  Because the world would end if a 60 year-old woman didn't get dessert. 
* In the months leading up to the wedding she kept asking if she and her family would have access to the bridal suite. The answer (from DH) was no, it was for the bride and bridal party to chill in, and there were couches in the front and everyone was getting ready at the hotel anyway.  But she kept pushing it.  DH held firm.  The day of the wedding it was made clear again, and the bridesmaids, groomsmen and patents of the flower girls all knew they were welcome to chill in the bridal suite on the couches and change the diapers of the flower girls on the floor or conference table, but no one was to use the toilet because it needed to be clean so my dress wouldn't get messy. After the first dances, I went with my cousins to the bridal suite to go pee (They had to hold my dress). MIL's brother was on the phone in there. I told him it was the bridal suite and he needed to leave. I was met with a rude response about how he needed a place to make a call. I responded that it was not the place to do so and he could go outside (it was summer). I proceeded to the bathroom and was met with fresh shit. He'd gone into a room he wasn't supposed to be in,  used the toilet meant only for me , and hadn't bothered to flush. It's clear MIL sent him there to make his call ands he took it further. She and her family were supposed to stay out.  So disrespectful. 
* My mom visited me to buy my wedding dress. MIL suggested we all do dinner. When the check came, MIL and FIL sat on their hands. A few months later, they invited themselves to stay with my parents in CA. They sat on their hands at the restaurant they went to there. Zero reciprocity. Not even an attempt to reciprocate. MIL and FIL also didn't offer to help with dishes when my mom cooked one night. 
* I found this out this week. My parents got a letter from MIL the week DH and I got engaged.  It said, ""We are pleased that GIMME_ALL_THE_BABIES has the eye of practicality in using her grandmother's ring."" I am so lucky to have inherited a beautiful ring with a nice diamond and that is to my taste.  Had I not,  DH would have gladly bought one. I'm offemded by her comment because it truly isn't her business where the ring came from and it's rude of her to make this comment. I feel it implies that in receiving a new ring had I not been so fortunate would have made me a gold digger. It might even imply she thinks I wouldn't have deseved a new ring. I'm offended.
* My dad worked in the auto industry (desk job, not UAW). He got laid off (forced to retire) in 2006 like so many others And as a middle aged man, his subsequent opportunities have not been as great. He finally got a job be lovef around the time DH and I got engaged. FIL and MIL made a comment, not knowing anything about the situation other than my dad was coming out of retirement, that ""well any money coming in is good,"" as if my family is a bunch of poor hicks.
* My little brother is graduating this year.  He has a paid internship at his dream company lined up. It is truly the opportunity  of a lifetime and he earned it by building a portfolio of solid work and holding a very serious leadership position at his top public university. He also was interviewing for full-time jobs and was close to an offer before deciding he'd regret it forever if he didn't take his dream internship.   MIL and FIL made a comment recently when I mentioned his upcoming graduation that my parents must not be looking forward to his pending unemployment come June. They just assumed, given my brother's field, that he was unemployed. I was furious And offended.
* SIL has a new boyfriend. Before he came to meet the family, we were talking about it at Easter. MIL said, ""I'm excited to meet the BF because SIL is picky,"" and she shot me a look that just said it all.
* At the rehearsal dinner where MIL had her fucking mousse cake, my bridesmaid's husband was making small talk with MIL and FIL. He asked what MIL did for work. She replied that she stayed at home.  FIL followed up in a snotty tone that our was valid because she raised a Harvard grad and a dentist. the poor guy was just making small talk. No need to be snooty.



I'm just done. It's clear this behavior is driven by my in-laws' perceptions of class and where we fall versus them. The comments to me, my family, and about my family are not ok and I'm done. DH and I are moving out of their area. I have asked DH that for one year they not visit us so we can focus on our marriage, since these behaviors are offensive and I don't want to fight.  He agreed.

My parents are retiring to a resort town at the end of the year and are  building a gorgeous new house.  I suspect MIL and FIL don't realize what rude guests they were last time and will ask to visit my parents to ""see the new house."" I've made it clear to DH that he needs to nip that in the bud should they mention wanting to go, because I don't want my parents mistreated again. He agrees. 

I'm just angry and offended and done. "
3463l0,8,2015-04-28,[Question] How are you supposed to be able to live while on the job search trail?,dajjbomb,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/3463l0/question_how_are_you_supposed_to_be_able_to_live/,"So, basically, I'm at a point where I feel like I'm going to be jobless for quite some time (Context, for those who want it, is below,) I am at a point financially where I am almost 100% sure I'll be out of money before I'm employed. I have no idea what sort of resources are out there for this purpose, and since I live in a small town I'm scared said resources are non-existant. So...how does one actually fund a job search effort? 

Context: 

*Education wise: I'm currently a few weeks from wrapping up my masters degree in Electrical Engineering (Worst Idea Ever: Deciding to continue into my masters directly after undergrad. I feel like I'm in this sort of limbo-land where I'm either over or under qualified for everything so I'll never get hired.) I have money to last till this is done, but not much else.

I've almost 100% convinced myself that I the worst engineer in the history of the world. Most of my projects/internships I've worked on mostly end in a state of mostly-failure, with most of the failures (in my mind at least) having a direct line toward me. (I'm also pretty convinced that a high-school graduate has a better chance of getting a job than me, but I feel like that's more of depression talking.)

Experience: I have some internship experience (including for my thesis,) but as I am probably the worst engineer in the history of the world I'm pretty sure if any potential employer contacts them I'll be immediately removed from the process.

Network: None that I really know of. Classmates have either gone away or already been tapped. Parents will (most likely) not be options, and professors have already given what they can afaik.

TL;DR: How do you keep paying the bills/affording to live while trying to find a job?"

I know next to nothing about the CS world, and would greatly appreciate anyone taking the time to answer a couple questions!",Idiot-Warranty,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3468ds/music_major_took_cs_course_for_a_ge_credit_and/,"**Edit:** Thank you everyone for the helpful responses! I think now that I'm definitely going to go for it, especially since I was just offered an internship position today. I'm really optimistic about the future and plan on working hard to make it happen!

Hi everyone! You seem like a pretty friendly, helpful group of savvy humans so I figured why not chance a post. 

As the title states I am currently a music major. Basically, I decided I wanted to do more than math for my one of my General Ed requirements so I took Intro to CS instead of Calculus.

It's crazy... but it's like a light went on in my head. I feel like I've fallen in love with the language of programming-- its elegance, efficiency, and utility. (We're learning with Python, if that means anything.) Now, I am seriously considering and planning a complete career switch and need a couple drops of advice.

**My Questions**
My first question (or question ""set"") is this: am I just getting ahead of myself? If I love CS 121, will I probably love going through with a CS major and a CS career? Or, does the beginning just feel awesome while the reality is different?

If I'm doing well in Intro, is that a good predictor of doing well in the rest of my training, and in a career if I choose to pursue one? (I don't want to be fooled into thinking X when I've only just dipped my toe in the water.)

What are some realistic employment prospects for someone with a BA in Computer Science, no further degrees? (I'm most interested in software development/programming from what I've gathered.)

Oh yeah, one more thing, I'm almost a senior, but with my music major I can extend my financial aid for a fifth year and add BA in CS. Is the degree a better idea than loading up on CS courses, graduating next year without a BA in CS, and then self teaching afterward?

**TL;DR:**
I know next to nothing about computer science besides what I've been learning in Intro. After just one semester, though, I'm intrigued enough to seriously consider switching my entire life's path. All I know about CS is what I learned in class. Any helpful advice would be hugely appreciated!"

I'm a recent (ish) IT graduate that has had literally no luck in finding that ever so illusive first job after university, as I'm sure many others on this sub are too. I spend most of my days working barely part time hours at a bar in Glasgow or fruitlessly applying for jobs. And well...I'm getting nowhere and I can't really understand why.

I've had a handful of unsuccessful interviews (that I thought went well) from something like 100+ applications, I've re-written my CV countless times, and I'm a member of just about every jobs agency website/start-up website/graduate website you can think of, and nothing has come from it. 

I have some relevant work experience, but not much (which is what I think lets me down the most), my honours project which involved creating databases was undertaken inside an office supplies company, and I currently volunteer as a website assistant at a charity based in Paisley.

Perhaps I should define what job I'm looking for; I've stopped being picky, gave up looking for my dream job months/almost a year ago. Anything that's IT oriented and that's in Glasgow or Edinburgh, doesn't have to be full time or contracted, I'll take anything, part time, internship, temporary. Preferably in the planning and design parts of the IT industry since I have never been that strong of a programmer (not ideal, but I'm selling myself as seen).

Can anyone on this sub help? It's a big ask I know, but I'll be forever grateful. Are you hiring? Do you know anyone that's hiring? Do you have a friend of a friend that looking to hire? Are you the CEO of a multinational company?

I just need half a chance to get somewhere, and I had the crazy idea that this could pay off. 

If anyone knows anything, wants to know more, or wants to see my CV, leave a comment, PM me, bat signal in the sky, I will get back to you.

Most of the time I just feel depressed, I look out into the world and I feel empty. 

All I ever do is browse the internet or sit at home in the afternoon, then I drag myself to work in the evening. I work the closing shift at Mcdonald's, I've been there for a year, and I really want to quit. It is so boring and exhausting, it makes me feel worthless working at a shithole like that. I'm afraid that I will get complacent, I don't want to be stuck there any longer, I'd rather die than work there my whole life. I have accumulated so much debt over the years, I went to a vocational school for accounting and owe $8,000 in student loans, and $800 in credit card debt. I also took out a credit loan of $2,800 so my mom could afford dental implant surgery, I also have a car note of $13,900. I have to pay $300 a month, plus $100 insurance, that is already half my income. I'm so bad at managing money, I tell myself that I won't spend what little I have, but I'm always spending a bit here and there and before I know it my whole paycheck is gone. Sometimes I am even afraid to check the balance on my checking account. 

I don't know what to do, I dropped out of college twice and haven't even gotten any accounting jobs with the worthless certificate I have, I haven't even been able to find internship positions either. I'm contemplating going back to college, but I'm not sure if I'll just be wasting more time. I don't know if I will make it through.

I don't understand why I can't get myself to do anything. If I am not distracted with internet or video games, I just start to feel hopeless, I try to think about what I can do to improve my life, but I usually can't think of anything useful, then I just get filled with despair. I try to go out for walks and bike rides, and it sometimes helps, but at times I wonder why I even bother. I feel like I've failed my family, I wish I was better than this so I could improve their lives. My brother is starting college soon, and I want to help him as much as I can, I want him to succeed, but I can't shake these grim thoughts I have of the future.

I only have 2 friends left from high school, and only one bothers to contact me, and I'm grateful that he is still my friend after all this time, but my other friend never contacts me, I'm always the one that has to reach out to her. I also can't forget my ex best friend from high school, we were really close, but she stopped talking to me after an argument. it's been four years, and I've contacted her through facebook few times, but she just ignores me. I feel maybe if I try and make new friends it will help, I would like to make friends that are into the heavy metal culture, but since I feel like a boring person with nothing to offer, I feel they might not want to be friends for long.

I want to figure out how to stop these self-defeating thoughts and improve my life, but I really don't know what to do, I don't want to live like this anymore."

I have an interview coming up at a fairly Big company in London for an IT Operations Internship described as:

**FAIR WARNING** I am going to gloss over a lot of terms here without fully explaining. If you don't know the term, and want to figure it out you should be able to keep a google tab open and find anything easily.

----

PART 2:

When I ended part 1 I had just agreed to join both Scientology and more importantly, staff. I was convinced more that joining staff I could get involved in delivering Dianetics to people than I was that I should participate myself. I personally wanted to help people recover from trauma, so my recruiter focused on how I could help and used that interest against me.

Over the next couple days I did some basic intro stuff. They had me do the ""Basic Study Manual"" which was a prerequisite for the ""Staff Status"" courses which are basic staff training. That book was actually just posted to this sub by someone showing what Applied Scholastics teaches. I sat down with some of the recruiters and a couple Sea Org members. We had 4, an LRH Comm, Flag Banking Officer, Deputy FBO and Flag Representative, plus a CMO Int Mission there to help us build up to our Ideal Org grand opening the following weekend. If I remember right I was talking to the DFBO and the CMO Int Mission I/C (in charge) and her deputy.

I was being told that they had a perfect position for me. They wanted me to be the Book Store Officer. I would be in charge of keeping and opperating the book store, being an expert on EVERY book and EVERY lecture. I was sort of questioning why I wasnt going to be working in the area I had originally been told about (the Dianetics section, as an auditor) but they just said I had to get through my ""Staff Status"" courses before I could do full time training for a technical post. They make any promise about the future as long as it gives them what they want now. It's why people get sold on joining staff NOW and figuring out how to get their schedule to work with the Org schedule NEXT month... 

At this point they were in full ""handle"" mode. They were just handling me and getting me happily sitting in some spot doing some task with a smile on my face so they could turn their attention to NEW prospects until grand opening. They succeeded. I was pretty excited to be this ""Book Store Officer"". I was convinced that learning the ins and outs of every book would make me that much better as an auditor. I was pretty much just a sponge at this point. I had decided I wanted to do this as a way to help people, so I was trying to learn everything I possibly could about it.

To make matters even more complex, and a prime contributing factor to why I didnt turn around and walk right back out of Scientology in the first two months, my then girlfriend, was the Hubbard Area Secretary (HAS). She had been a part of my recruit cycle and we were now moving in together. I wanted so badly to make her happy that I was trying extra hard to learn about Scientology and any time something didnt make sense or I was hesitant to believe something I would simply disregard it as not important and would focus on that which I believed was valuable.

Between then and actual grand opening my post shifted around a few times. I was no longer going to be the Book Store Officer. I was now going to be the Director of Intro Services, then I was going to be something else, then something else. I finally got posted as the Director of Public Book Sales. I held that post for 2-3 miserable months. I HATED that post. I wanted to bring new people in, I enjoyed being out there talking to new people. I liked sharing this ""wonderful"" new thing I had found. I was in the honeymoon stage. I loved Scientology and wanted the world to join in this discovery.

But I hated the post itself. I was forced to be so pushy and was told to push books on EVERY person who walked in. I was road so hard by the DFBO that she should have paid me for my services... I wanted to sit back, be nice to people who came in, and spread a message of ""hey, we are here if you are interested, and if you want to take a service or buy a book great, if not, we are still here to answer your questions or just be a nice place to come in to get out of the cold or out of the heat"". However, if a person came in we had 3-4 people jumping down their throat to get them to spend money. If I failed to get them to buy something, often within minutes of walking in (long before any kind of interest would develop) then I was drilled and trained and corrected. I was crushed down into the mold they wanted me to be. Then it got worse. 

We started this ""pass our fliers"" concept. We printed out little fliers for ""free films"" and ""free personality tests"" and were told we HAD to go out and pass out 300 or so a day. Which only the best of use were ever able to maintain. I felt it was deceitful and rude... but it was NOT optional.

I was still trying so hard to bring people in, but just hated doing it THAT way. I had started reading Dianetics and even though that book is full of inaccuracies I had constant reinforcement around me from my exwife, her family, the church, my friends, etc that it had ""changed their life"" so I was apt to believe what I was reading. I was trying to incorporate some of this stuff into my life and wanted to find things that were as amazing as everyone claimed. 

I found some basic stuff pretty true and clung to it. For instance, the 8 dynamics (a pretty decent idea IMHO, even today) or ARC. I had a few PTS handlings from getting sick and they werent great (actually they did less than nothing) but you can't attest till you claim they were amazing and helpful, etc. so I would just claim that I felt so much better. Yet if you lie about something to everyone for long enough you will start to believe it.

I think that was a common theme here. I was putting on this face of loving everything. I was acting like I was totally on board with all of Scientology (even though I didnt agree with a lot of stuff, I claimed I did) and over time, being so immersed in that lifestyle I started to believe it myself. At this point its been a few months since I joined. I am finishing up my Staff Status 2. Once you finish SS2 then you can't be moved to a new post without a bunch of paperwork, so the Org looked into my qualifications and found that I was a rare person who hadnt done one of the many out qualifications for HCO (Hubbard Communications Office). Some of the most simple of those quals are never having done LSD in any form and having no homosexual history. I also had a high IQ (per their bullshit test) and a good OCA (which just means that I learned how to think like a Scientologist in those few months). 

I was told this was a great honor to be in HCO as there are very few who are qualified and just being in HCO is equal to being an executive. It commands respect. Who wouldnt like being in a position that just by BEING there proves you are ""better"" than everyone else. So I said sure, I will do it, but I didnt want to be a recruiter. Staff was HARD work, and if it hadnt been for Autumn, my ex-wife, I would have left already. I wasnt making the 300-400 a week I was promised, and often was making less than 50... plus I was working way more than 40 hours a week.

Guess where I got posted.... yup you are looking at the brand new Personnel Procurement Officer (PPO, or ""recruiter"") for the Seattle Day Org.... woot woot... They convinced me that I would be helping an exponential amount of people by recruiting OTHERS who would then each help as many people as I could from any other post... (see the pattern here? No matter what they want me to do, they figure out how it plays on what I want to do and then convince me thats the case, even when it couldnt be further from the truth). 

This was the CMO Int mission 2nd and 3rd who spent most of this time with me. The Recruiters who were there prior to grand opening were going to be coming back up, and till then the CMO Int 2rd was in charge of HCO, especially recruiting. They convinced me I would have the best internship on the planet with 4 dedicated Sea Org members coming up to fix recruitment in the org (we had skyrocketed to like 150 staff for just Day org alone before grand opening, then plummeted back to like 80 in a few weeks... mostly from broken promises from the FIRST time those recruiters were up here....) and they would all be dedicated to training me. 

They also made the promise that its super easy to replace yourself as the PPO. Since you are already a recruiter all you have to do is recruit someone to replace you on that post (had to be HCO qualified of course). So if I really didnt like it, then I could always just replace myself and try something else, but right then that was what the org needed... I spent 2 years on that post, seeing (if I remember correctly) 5 new HCO members come in after me, every single one after I had expressed I would like to change posts, and every single one of them posted somewhere else, leaving me as the recruiter... but thats getting more into part 3, when I become disenchanted with the whole thing.

For the next two years I rode the rollar coaster that is Scientology. For about the next year I continued to indoctrinate myself and get indoctrinated by them. I did a bit more auditing, and a bit of training. I was gearing up for the Purif when I decided I was going to leave... So I never did get that far.

I did the basic Success Through Communication Course. Its basically just TRs done super simply and without all the intensity of the main TR course. I still to this day think that was one of the BEST parts of my entire experience there. I still use most of what I learned in that course today. However, these services and such were not how I was most indoctrinated.

As I mentioned I indoctrinated myself. I had not had any positive experiences myself, but like many people who are so focused on helping OTHERS I was convinced that I was just a lost cause. Scientology wouldnt be much good for ME but I would at least bring other people in! I could help other people get the happiness I wanted them to have and that would bring me happiness in my own way. Looking back thats absurd, if it wasnt working for me, then why would it work for them??

However, I spent a year and a half telling everyone I met that Scientology was amazing. It had helped me, it had helped everyone I knew, it was simple and you didnt have to give up any beliefs to start using Scientology. I was really good at selling Scientology, and even being in HCO I was still used for a lot of Div 6 a/b (public divisions) activities. I was so good at it, and kept the facade up at all times, for so long, that I convinced myself. Somewhere along that timeline I started to believe my own PR. I started to really believe it actually WAS as helpful, even to myself, as I claimed it was.

One last contributing factor that really helped me stay interested at least enough to keep going was my Mother in Law. I believe, (present tense, I still hold this belief) that of every person I have ever met she fits the description of a ""clear"" as close as I have ever seen. She was never unecessarily emotional. She would calmly assess every situation. She was a successful small business owner and had a great ability to see into the heart of people, which lead her to have a kick ass staff of really great people. She had a fantastic memory (not as great as Dianetics claims, but still a great memory) and had a true pleasure in life from the big things right down to something small like doing some light gardening. We spent a lot of time chatting and she was the best mediator I have ever had. In short, she was one of the 3 best people I have ever known. (The other two are Pat, who will play a big role in part 3 of this story, and my ex-brother-in-law, Ian) So my mother in law AND her son, two people I lived with at the time, were both just stellar examples of humanity. 

Both of them claimed it was entirely because of Scientology and both of them told me that eventually I would find the services and courses that really worked for me and would finally have the ""wins"" that I wanted. I have no doubt that was it not for the love I had(have?) for my ex-wife, my friendship with her brother, and my utter respect for her mother, that I would never have continued lying to myself long enough to start to believe my own lies.

At this point in the story I had been on a staff about a year and a half, all but 2-3 months of that was spent in HCO. I was about as convinced as I ever was that Scientology was 100% correct. I had convinced myself that if I hadnt felt any personal gains or wins of the magnitude that others described it was only because I hadnt done any major bridge steps yet. I was fully convinced that Hubbard had really laid out the best way of improving life. I still questioned a few actions we were doing, but I firmly believed that EVERY aspect about the church I didnt like was a departure from LRH Policy. I was a 100% dedicated Scientologist.

As always, feel free to ask questions. I was not expecting to write this today, or right now. And I am used to telling the part 1, as well as the part 4 (the aftermath, after I left) but people rarely ask about part 2 or part 3, so this is one of the first times I have tried to write this up.... hopefully it made sense and everyone could follow along!

TL,DR: Lied to myself long enough to convince myself I was telling the truth. Had a few very important people in my life who kept me wanting to be a ""good scientologist"" and trying to please them I managed to indoctrinate myself deeply into the cult.

3471wh,3,2015-04-28,My boyfriend [21M] and I [21F] are considering getting engaged and saving the wedding till after grad school.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3471wh/my_boyfriend_21m_and_i_21f_are_considering/,"My boyfriend [22M] and I [22F] have been together for three years now. We were best friends who fell in love, and I swear, we have one brain.

This summer we are both applying to grad school. I'm going to med school and he is wanting to get his Ph.D in math or software engineering (he works with parallel processing). So for the next 4-5 years we are going to be in school. We are applying to schools in the same places, really hoping we will at least be in the same state, but there is a good chance that we will be long distance.

We have been talking about marriage for over a year now. Neither of us want to have a long distance marriage. We want to wait until he has his Ph.D and I am in my internship or residency to get married and start living together. But we have tossed around the idea of getting engaged before we leave for grad school.

We already wanted a long engagement, a year or more, so we could enjoy it and we could spend more time planning our (small) wedding. Now that we are discussing this, I think 4 years would be pretty great for planning. Then we could reserve a location 2 years in advance, take our time on making decisions and arrangements, have more time to save money, and avoid becoming a bride/groomzilla. Also, by the time we would be getting married we would have been dating 7 years. We know we want to spend the rest of our lives with each other already, but after 7 years of dating, I don't think we could be more sure that we want to get married.

However, I've also heard that long engagements are really hard on couples. I mean, there was even a movie called the 5-year engagement (that I never saw, I just know the long engagement was a negative thing).

I have no experience with this, so I am asking you guys. Do you think a 4-5 year engagement throughout grad school, with possible long distance is a good or bad thing? Any advice?

**TL;DR: Boyfriend and I considering getting engaged now, but waiting on the wedding for 4-5 years until after we are both out of grad school. Is a long engagement a bad idea? Or is it beneficial/ nothing wrong with it?**"

3477py,1,2015-04-28,Just need to write what I'm thinking / feeling,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3477py/just_need_to_write_what_im_thinking_feeling/,"I'm new to this, and I just want to say some stuff I guess. first time posting on this site.

I'm 22, go to a college in Rochester, NY. and I had a girlfriend when I was a freshman in college. It was my first girlfriend, and I was a ""nobody"" in high school so I guess I had low self esteem, I don't know. I had these beliefs about what a relationship was supposed to be based on what I believed / how I was raised back then - some super serious long term love me forever thing... I was only 18 back then.

Girl cheats on me a few months in and it completely rocks my world, but we stay together because I was convinced I wasn't good enough for anyone else. I try to be a bigger man and part ways with her a few months later. She starts sleeping with the guy she cheated on me with and I find out she kept the whole thing going pretty much the whole time we were going out. 

i'd never been with anyone physically before or emotionally and I had this mentality that I only wanted to share myself with this person. It was the most unhealthy attachment of my life. I was actually faithful the whole relationship. when she did me wrong like that, a side of me came out I didn't know existed inside of me. I was so broken and sad, I guess I wanted to hurt myself, it all was honestly such a blur I have a hard time thinking it was all real sometimes.

this guy moved to California and she came back to me, which I gladly accepted because I was a pretty pathetic guy in that sense back then. by this time, it was the end of freshman year. and all that sadness I was experiencing during my first year of school turned into deep, deep hatred. I was obsessed with hating this girl, even though she was sleeping with me and attempting to make conversation or be friendly or ask for forgiveness or whatever. I didn't want to let her go anymore then I had to, but at the same time, I promised myself I would never forgive anything she ever did to me. I /loathed/ her. 

I had never felt anything so strongly in my life over the next year - I had never felt love, joy, sadness, fear, anything... as much as I felt hatred for this girl. it was so bipolar. she would drive to Philly and see me when I was on an internship, and we'd have a great time, then something would remind me of the past... and I would turn into a different person. 

we stopped talking my fourth year of school, cause she moved out to cali with that guy I think. after she found him again, she cut me off hard. blocked and everything on all fronts, which was definitely for the better from her perspective. mine, too. a lot of people called me the bad guy. I called myself a victim. now I feel like both, if I'm being honest.

so now here I am, 22. but my life feels like it's falling apart. don't get me wrong on the outside everything looks clean. I'm in a leadership position in my fraternity, I get really solid grades, I'm an honors student, I have a 6-figure job lined up when I graduate, I have a great group of friends I've known for over a decade that go to school with me I can call family. I feel like I'm a decent looking guy. I can walk into a room of people or go on a date, and make everyone have fun for hours with silly stories or fun conversation. people seem to like me.

But then on the flipside, I still feel like I have the lowest self esteem. I'm on drugs. I have a unhealthy amount of meaningless sex. and.. it's not that I don't want to live. I just don't want to live in a world that makes me feel the way I feel right now (not suicidal, just wishing it didn't have to be this way). 

It's been a year since I've talked to this girl and she crosses my mind everyday. I guess the reason I write all this is because I have so many questions on my mind. Was the girl that I so strongly disliked simply a reflection of the ""true"" person I am these days, and I was too emotionally unstable to see it all these years? why can't i stop thinking about her? why does she /still/ haunt me in my dreams and /still/ make feel a way that no other person have ever made me feel (both positively and negatively)? why am I never satisfied? why does nothing I do satisfy me? don't I have what a lot of the people that go to school here want? why does this girl control my thoughts and feelings? why would I give anything to speak to this person that's clearly toxic in my life? why did I have to be the bad guy? am I still the bad guy? am I a bad person? why does someone who has no actual impact or influence on my current life and how do I get out of this mental prison?

.. all done. if anyone reads this, I'm not asking for help or advice - honestly, I don't know what the hell I'm asking for. nothing, I guess. sorry for such a lengthy post and any grammar. Just kind of belted out what I was feeling, but I did a quick spellcheck. have a great day, everyone. "

347eq9,5,2015-04-28,"Me [23 F] with my mother [44F], who is suffering from various mental disorders and will not take her pills. She is supposed to watch my daughter(9 months.) How do I go about tell her that I changed my mind.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/347eq9/me_23_f_with_my_mother_44f_who_is_suffering_from/,"This may be the wrong subreddit so if anyone has a better suggestion as to where to get advice please suggest away.

So my mom has suffered from various mental issues her whole life. The cocktail she normally suffers through is depression, anxiety, paranoia, and bipolar disorder. She is the type who will be on pills and after a while start talking about how great she is feeling and then decides she doesn't need them anymore and will go off of them, which just allows her relapse into a state of self destruction. 

I just began noticing how bad it is getting. She used to be really good at hiding it. Growing up, she held jobs for a good amount of time, had good parenting skills, and had a good relationship with my dad. Now, she still has two young teenagers in the house and she has completely changed. She can't keep a job, she spends money constantly that she doesn't have, and instead of being a parent she would rather be a friend to my two youngest sisters. She lets them go out at all hours, their boyfriends are constantly over, she is always getting into their social life. 

The past 6 months she has gone off and on medication at least a dozen times. Most of the time she self diagnosis. When she goes off of the pills, she doesn't throw them out but hordes them. She has dozens and dozens of pills that she uses to self diagnosis and twice in the past 2 months she has overdosed. 

Now I am the oldest and trying to help keep the family together but I'm having trouble. I'm a new mom and a full time student and about to get an internship. I had a pretty rough time with depression after my daughter was born but I've been steadily working on being mentally healthy by positive thinking and not holding in what I am feeling but instead talking it out. I avoid negative people but I can't avoid my mom.

Today everything came to a head. My mom's sister is 10 years older than myself and we are really close. We just always have been and she only lives a few minutes away from me. I do hang out with her a lot. Last night my mom had one of her meltdowns to me, telling me how everyone is mean to her and how my sisters are out to get her and purposely make her depressed. I kept trying to get her to talk to me and calm down. I tried to think of solutions but she shut down and wouldn't talk about it. It makes me feel pretty shitty so I did talk to my aunt. I didn't tell her about pills or whatever. I just said I was worried about her. 

My aunt just figured she would call my mom and ask her how life was. My mom took this as me betraying her. My mom freaked out on me, saying I betrayed her by telling her 'perfect sister' about her problems. She said how my aunt is evil and how my aunt and her family are laughing at her from their perfect fucking house with all their money. I told her that wasn't true and that my aunt was just worried. 

She then went on to say that I didn't understand and I was part of the problem. She talked about how everyone was always talking down to her because they had a tone to their voice and that they were always giving her nasty looks. She spoke about how my grandma and grandpa were horrible people too, and that all her children were out to get her.

I stopped speaking to her and have been just sitting here with a pit in my stomach. My fiancé and I are going to a concert a few hours away in two weeks and we have had it planned for months that our daughter would spend the night there. My mom has really been looking forward to it. 

She loves my daughter and she is a good grandma. She is very careful with her and plays with her and I feel horrible just thinking like this but what if she has a breakdown while watching her? I don't want to hurt my mom's feeling but if she feels like her own children are out to get her how do I know my daughter is completely safe. Also, seeing my daughter is one of the only things that make her happy but I don't think I can allow myself to let my mom watch her over night at the moment. I know telling her I changed my mind will make her feel horrible but I don't know what else to do.



   
**tl;dr**: My mom is having issues and won't take her medicine. I don't feel like it is safe keeping my daughter there over night while I go away. How do I tell her I changed my mind without sounding like a horrible daughter?"

347m7g,7,2015-04-28,[RF] about 4 years of college,Votive,shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/347m7g/rf_about_4_years_of_college/,"Always be thinking. Always have something on your mind. Think about the random ad you saw on the street, the last time you ate a kiwi, or even what getting in a bar fight would be like. Your thoughts should be also huge and overwhelming at times. Think about [   ], and wish you could spend more time with her.  Think about how your father is starting to cry more now that he’s been diagnosed as clinically depressed. Your mom will ask you for help with him. Wonder if your friend [   ] will kill himself.


Always be willing to share these thoughts with others; they will come to expect conversation from you, and it will define you as opinionated. Almost always be open to conversation. At first resent your emotional side and tell yourself you are a masculine, stoic, intellectual-athletic machine. Think of picturesque male roman statues and personify them. Grow egotistical and neglect your social intelligence. Get much less out of high school than you could’ve. Don’t go to prom, or a single football game.


Cut your long hair. Slowly outgrow most of your angst. Kurt Cobain could pull it off; you can’t. Go to college and meet people you had no idea could exist. Unconsciously begin redefining yourself. Your neurotic inability to stop yourself from thinking will help you ask questions in your classes. Participate in the classes you care about. Quickly become comfortable with speaking in public, and participating in class. People will notice this about you.


Try marijuana for the first time the day of your high school graduation. Come-too on a stranger's carpet eating Kraft cheese singles and white grapes. Your track-buddy who throws discus is playing Call of Duty with the kids who you used to play tag with, back in 2nd grade. Learn to cherish bizarre experiences. Drive yourself home. Feign exhaustion and go right to bed to avoid talking to your parents. Later realize that wasn't marijuana. Vow to never smoke synthetics again.


Start going to the gym religiously. Impress your older brother with your dedication, instead of playing online with him late into the night. Develop a deep seated appreciation and respect for self-discipline. Egotistically admire your progress, but never abandon the insecurities surrounding your body. Start seeing results. Convince your friends to come to the gym with you. Start seeing their results. 
Notice that girls are starting to find you attractive. Realize that women found you attractive even before you started going to the gym. Act on their advances, clumsily, but successfully. Sleep in 4 different beds over the course of a week during your freshmen year.


Become a better kisser. Start flirting with a lot more girls. Mature a little bit and embrace your emotional side. Open up to people too quickly. Get hurt in your relationships. Dramatically (but no less painfully) suffer the loss of your first love for well over a year, until your new RA gives you a blowjob. You’ll fall for her too, and she’ll hurt you like [   ] did, but you’ll be better equipped to handle it. Regret burning bridges with her, but never rebuild them because of an indescribable combination of shame and pride. Hope you’ll unexpectedly run into her somewhere in the future, and hope she’ll want to reconnect with you.


Innocently enjoy your escapades, blissfully ignorant of the beautiful girl who you have the most intimate and powerful conversations with. Figuratively kick yourself when she asks you why you didn’t kiss her freshmen year. You'll be 6 weeks from graduation when you realize it's too late.


Mature a little more and tone your emotional side down. Start to put some weight and meaning in the word “friend.” Connect only with people who you respect and who respect you, but try to learn something from everyone.


Play cards with your close friends and try to read their facial expressions. wonder if you look like your father when he played poker. Drunkenly reminisce about things that happened as early as last week, and realize that these will be the moments you miss when you graduate. Listen to a variety of albums while playing cards, and develop a deeper appreciation for music. Try to teach your other friends how to play cards, and wish they could get into it as much as you do.


Allow your roommate to convince you to drop acid. Visit seagull island. Ruin your favorite pair of jeans. Laugh so hard you can't stand up, and appreciate the fact that someone was sober enough to take pictures. Spend the rest of the night irresponsibly, but amongst friends.


Question labels and assumptions people make about you. Question the labels people make about the world around them. Ask really meaningful questions in your philosophy, aesthetics, and English classes. Form meaningful relationships with your professors.  Renounce your Catholicism. This will inevitably upset your mother, but she’ll understand. Ask Mom whether she prays for you, and wish you had the heart to tell her to stop. Change your major and spend a lot more time in business classes. Coast through college averaging B's.


Get an internship and dwell on how strange and different it is than the rest of your life. Realize you need a job after graduation. Start applying for jobs. Update your resume. Start networking with professors. Be immensely grateful of the job listings they forward you, and the professional connections they help you make. Wonder if you’ll get an offer before graduation. Wonder how much time you’ll spend living with your parents after graduation.


Take stock of virtually your entire college career during your creative writing class. Get carried away with the assignment. Wonder what you’d think about re-reading this document ten years from now.

My conservative christian dad didn't freak out when I basically mentioned living with my boyfriend for three months. THIS IS FANTASTIC AND I WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS. I am legitimately surprised. This is a huge turnaround from two years ago when he nearly called the cops because I went to BF's hotel room alone. Turns out that my dad is more sane than my Nmom.

And, I got even better news today: One of the places I applied to near BF wants to do a phone interview! Getting an internship there would literally be the best case scenario. I'd be getting job experience plus FINALLY closing the gap with my long distance BF. I just wish I didn't have a fear of talking on the phone. Any of you guys have any tips? I'm really inexperienced with this interview stuff...

Wish me luck!"

I accepted an offer for a 6 month internship that starts June 1st (so about a month from now).  My friend recently reached out to me with an opportunity to potentially work full-time for a more well known company. I have a few questions about this:

1. Is it a good idea to keep looking for better positions after accepting an offer?
2. If I choose to apply for the new position, should I tell them that I have already accepted an offer? If so, at what stage in the process?
3. If I get the new position, what is the most professional way to tell the previous company of my switch?

I specifically want to go to Stanford due to the combination of location, entrepreneurial spirit, and research opportunities(they are top of the field for my area of interest). 

GPA-
I will most likely have a 3.8 gpa at the end of this semester, but plan on taking the harder CS core courses sophomore year. I am slightly worried because I've gotten A-'s on all of my cs courses this year, which are offset by A's for all of the classes required for my second major (economics).  However, I also realize that a 3.8 is reasonably high. Around what gpa do grades start to not matter anymore, and what is the average for accepted applicants? 

I also find myself putting in an almost unreasonable amount of work in trying to earn A's in classes as opposed to A-'s, which are worth a gpa of 3.66ish as opposed to a 4. Are grad schools going to care about such a small differential, or am I just wasting my time? I don't inherently place any value on the actual letter grade itself and would much rather spend the time not stressing about grades and working on projects instead. It seems somewhat absurd that admissions committees would place weight on a 3% differences, but at the same time, the A-'s are cumulatively beginning to bring my gpa down.

GRE-
When should I start studying for it, and how difficult is it compared to standardized tests for undergraduate admission (SAT, ACT)? Do graduate schools place heavy emphasis on these tests?

Research-
How important is research for Master's admissions? Should I focus on gaining experience through research or internships?

Recommendations-
How should an undergraduate student go about getting 3 great recommendations from professors? I feel that most of my research work is overshadowed by masters and phd students who are substantially smarter than I am.

She was married at the time and I was involved with a mutual friend and we all became really close really fast. We drank together, sang karaoke, worked out together, shopped, you name it. Instant best friends. She has this amazing, funny, quirky and interesting personality and I loved being around her. Even when I moved 2 hours away I made trips back just to hang out with her. 


Fast foward a year. She and her then husband bought a house that she and I painted together one weekend. 2 weeks later, I get a sobbing, incoherent phone call that she was leaving her husband. He had an anger and drinking problem and it had gone way too far and she left literally overnight. I was back to visit as soon as I possibly could, and we cried and I told her I was so sorry. 


She (very, very quickly) moves on, and is with another guy. I kind of hate him because he's just generally a douche, but whatever. I can put up with him. I start seeing one of his friends (not a pattern I meant to have with her, seriously), we stay just as close. I'm also still friends with her ex husband and our old friend group. She's not a big fan of that, but whatever. 


I move back to start grad school, and things start going downhill. We see each other a good amount my first semester and by the end of it she's engaged! I take her out for manicures and she asks me to be her bridesmaid and I of course say yes. I'm with her fiance's best friend, we're all friends, it's all great. 


My life then turned into a new level of crazy trying to juggle law school, working too much, an internship and live-in relationship and I just don't see her for a few months. We try to make plans and one of us breaks them for whatever reason, we chat and say hey I miss you!, etc but I just can't make it work to actually hangout. I feel like a jerk but there's not much I can do at that point.


This goes on for a few months, and then my life goes into turmoil. I abruptly leave law school to deal with mental health issues, break it off with the boyfriend, move out, etc, all within a month. She's really not there for any of it. She says she's sorry we broke up and hopes we can see each other soon, but that's about it. In the meantime she's made all sorts of posts about this new girl she was hanging out with and how AMAZING she is!! 


A month or so later, she posts ""Went shopping with my bridesmaids for their dresses! So exciting!""...and find out I was apparently kicked out of her wedding. Without being told. We don't talk for months-I'm angry, sad, and confused. I finally suck it up and message her ""Hey, I don't know what happened with us, but I miss you and I want to see you and talk and stuff."" It takes a few attempts of that, but we finally meet up. We talk, and things are okay. She says nothing about the wedding. It's weird but shaky and kind of okay.


That was probably 9 months ago, and we've seen each other a few times since but my life is still so shit right now. (about to graduate and things will be much better!) I got an invitation to her bridal shower planned by her new BFF a couple of months ago and thankfully had to work because I didn't know what to do. My gut instinct was hurt and anger to be invited to the thing I was supposed to plan.


Now we've got her wedding invite, and I don't know what to do. Part of me is still so angry at her. What an awful thing to do, and for no apparent reason other than we both got busy. Part of me knows that not going will be the nail in the coffin of our friendship. But I know it's going to hurt to be there, seeing all her bridesmaids (some of whom I know she doesn't see any more often than she does me) and still not knowing what happened. 


What do, Reddit? I miss my best friend. I don't have a lot of friends that are girls, and I desperately miss that bond. Neither of us are the same person we were when we started this, but I don't know if I can just move past things. 


   
**tl;dr**: Former inseparable best friend and I grew apart because of schedules but were still friendly until I was kicked out of her wedding without being told, now I don't know if I even want to go or continue trying to keep this friendship. "

I recently got Academically Disqualified from school. I tried to reappeal, but it was rejected.

I want to be able to figure out how to get back to school. Currently I'm a 3rd year (next year is my last year at UCSD), Computer Science (originally Computer Engineer), and I'm done with all my GEs, except HUM from Revelle.

I was supposed to graduate Srping of 2016.

My grades have been terrible from my 2nd year to my 3rd year. Due to my lack of focus and also since I have a job. Currently I am a Software Engineer intern. 

Basically I don't think I have any excuse for my grades. I just didn't focus, and keep hanging with people who don't focus anymore since they all graduated. But, despite knowing each quarter I need to do better, I still lost focus in one class which dropped my GPA back to below a 2.0.

Last quarter (Winter 2015), I did well, but failed my ECE course since I missed a midterm and couldn't drop due to it being my 2nd time.

I pretty much only have UD left till I graduate. I want to figure out how I can re-appeal my decision. With a year left, I wanted to re appeal for Fall 2016... But I don't think I have anything to show in terms of Academics besides my job and Letters of Recommendation from Professors. The Asst. Dean told me I should switch out of Engineering even though I currently am a Software Engineer at a good company. I learned a lot from there. More than I did from school. Still, I want to complete my degree. 

Thanks, and I hope I can figure this out.
I am currently very lost atm, and want to go back to school."

I'm 26, studied Computer Science for 4 years but didn't graduate(long story). Moved back home to take what I thought was going to be my last ""break"" after having taken a few semesters off before that. I was working retail at a dead end job in NYC, and ended up seeing an ad for a mobile developer internship at an up and coming studio. I interviewed, and eventually got the intern gig. I knew how to code and had a few mildly successful apps under my belt, so that helped.

That's all she wrote from there. Worked my ass off since, soaking up as much experience as I could about the field, industry, my platform(Android, soon to be iOS as well). Eventually started landing paying gigs as a freelance developer. I honed my skills day in and day out, working on side projects to build up my resume. I joined meetups, went to every tech conference I could get into in my area, and just networked my ass off with other devs. 

This whole time I was working, I still wanted to do my own thing. I couldn't let go of the idea that that's why I got so hooked on software engineering in the first place. You had the power to create, your world, your ideas, anything you want. And to top it off, you could just put it out there, at whatever cost/worth you deemed fit.

Fast forward 3.5 years. I'm currently working at a very big and well known media/broadcasting company as an Android engineer. Love my job, in fact it doesn't even feel like work. It's the exact same thing I would've been doing right now anyways, only for free.

I bit the bullet back in Februrary, and started my own company. We're a Creative Studio named Permoveo. Right now I have a marketing partner who I'm considering making co-founder, and I just hooked up with an ex-coworker(full stack web dev) who wants to come on board as well.

I met an iOS developer recently at a tech event who seems interested, but he also has his own thing going so we may just do some contract business going forward.

The goal is to operate much like other creative studios/agencies in that we will be doing a bunch of client work to pay the bills, but I really really want to focus a lot of my time and resources on my own passion projects and ideas. As my old boss used to say, ""all it takes is one"". I currently have a couple ideas, but only one in active development right now. 

I notice that most entrepreneurs, and creatives in general, seem to suffer from the same disease. For the life of them, they cannot bring themselves to simply focus on one idea to fruition. Their passion wanes, or they get distracted, or they get discouraged, or something comes up. I honestly believe that this is the most poisonous trait to anyone serious about making it in the tech industry, or any industry for that matter. You absolutely must be able to execute. Consistently.

Anyways, I decided not to quit my day job. At least not for now. A common theme around the entrepreneur community it seems, is that unless you quit your day job, or leave your ""safety net"", you won't be motivated enough to go at your entrepreneurial pursuits with all your might and ability. Again, I can tell you that blanket statements like this are largely false, and useless.

Frankly put, there's no way in hell that I'm going to turn away from 150k a year to pennies running my own shop. You can do both. It's possible to do both, others have done both! 

I'm single, with no kids and no crazy debt minus ~30k in student loan debt. I'm using a lot of my salary to get things off the ground currently. We're working on a small project right now and I'm paying my web developer out of my salary from my full-time job. 

I work 10-6, then come home and code from about 8-12, rinse and repeat. I don't want anyone to ""work for me"", instead I want to work with really smart and talented individuals and make us both some money. Weekends I still find time to have a social life(somewhat), but I make sure I'm structuring my days in such a way that I'm the most productive. I recommend the books ""The Power of Habit"" and ""Maximum Achievement"" by Brian Tracy for developing the mental attitude necessary to become more productive at goal setting/execution, and those are just must-reads in general. 

To be honest, so far, It's draining. But I love it. I don't want it any other way, I don't want it to be easy. I want it to be the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life(it will be), but that's what makes victory so glorious! 

I will say, I am in a bit of a unique position since my day job and my business are basically the same thing. 
We design and build apps, websites, and hopefully we'll be doing a bunch of stuff in the open source electronics and 3D printing spaces in due time(investing in a CraftBot).

This idea that you have to quit your day job needs to stop, as it's largely relative to your field and current situation. If you have the drive and willpower to balance both, go for it. I am in no way ""comfortable"", no matter what my salary is, my vision is far greater than a sum of money. I also think that's what it is. If you're truly comfortable making 6 figures, so much so that you lose your passion for owning your own business, then I'm afraid entrepreneurship is not what you're after..you're after a nice salary.

348cl9,0,2015-04-28,Live rent free with controlling father or leave and start renting?,Isthemoneyworthit9,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/348cl9/live_rent_free_with_controlling_father_or_leave/,"A little background :
22 years old, and I graduated college almost a year ago now. I took a job and I'm currently making  47k right out of school. Fortunately, the job is a 25 min drive from my father's house and I'm living rent free with my father. Currently I'm saving $1500 a month even after putting 15% towards my 401k. I love the idea of saving as much as possible, which is why I'm fortunate to be able to live rent free. Problem is, my father has always been controlling and slightly abusive. He's had depression for most my life, and although he has good intentions and does love me, he's very belittling and his constant negativity is beginning to wear on me. He doesn't respect any viewpoints of mine when it comes to my personal beliefs or opinions, name calling is pretty common as I'm constantly called shithead/dumbass/stupid and any of my recommendations on how to improve the living situation together is quickly dismissed with a ""shut the f*** up, I pay the bills you do what I say"". He's a slight hoarder and pretty messy, so there's at least a confrontation once or twice a week because I moved his mail from his exact spot, or I moved his laundry out of the way. And don't get me wrong I don't mind doing chores and cleaning, taking care of little things, but he completely uses the ""I pay the mortgage"" for just about everything, and I'll go off and do what needs to be done while he watches tv and falls asleep. I don't don't have a very good relationship with him mostly because of his abusive language and stubbornness. I can barely get him to commit to do anything with me on weekends since he's picky/moody and doesn't like the fact I'm ""controlling"" him as he would say. But there are times like fixing the house / a car or the rare chance he agrees do something with me where he losens up a little, which always makes me hope things will get better. He's only getting older, know deep down he's going to miss me, and hope him getting older realizes he doesn't need to be so bitter and angry about everything. Unfortunately, he is just very immature and his way of caring for me is very off from ideal. 

So my current dilemma is that a good friend of mine currently is looking for a roommate. This being a college town, places go quick. He found an apartment for 800 a month which includes Internet, water, trash, and sewage. Knowing he's clean, and with me being closer to work by 10 mins, I really like the idea of not having to deal with my dad anymore and living with my friend. We'd be splitting the apartment so with utilities the apartment will probably be about 500 a month for me. But... I also really like the idea of saving that money. My girlfriend of 4 years is in graduate school for at least another year and a half (were long distant) and I probably could live rent free at my dad's til she graduates and then we move in together. Realizing I'd be throwing away 6k a year and instead can be putting that in an IRA or towards a down payment for a house in future sounds really nice while I still feel it's socially acceptable to live with parent(s) at my age. 

I also have worries about my job/career and wonder if I should put up with my dad just in case things go south. I got an accounting degree, which I find myself not enjoying a whole lot, and realize many coworkers and mentors of mine through this job and past internships resented that they spent most of their life working long hours. I've always considered going back to school but honestly don't know what other degree I'd want to do since I've pretty indecisive about most things (as you can probably tell reading this). Also I work 50-60 hours a week so I barely get time to really explore any passions of mine after work. I seem to be doing fine for my first job, but technically if I do get fired or laid off I will be owing a recruiting fee of 8k since I didn't work 1 year. I have about 3 months left and have that slight worry in the back of my mind. 

Anyway, I know it's a list of complex situations I'm in, but I'm just trying to get some other opinions on what would be best for me. Is it worth the 6k a year to move out and get away from my dad? Or should I suck it up and deal with it, ""You're getting free rent!"" for another year or two? Does anyone else have a past experience similar to where they moved out an uncomfortable home when they could of stayed and saved money?"

They have 7 horses, 2 dogs, 2 turtles, 12 cats, and ~200 chickens (and counting). My mom won't let go of any of them. They're ""her babies"". She has this emotional attachment to them because her son (my brother) died in 2004.

My sister is a sociopath. She lives at home still and is making their lives miserable as usual. She says horrible things to both of them. She does nothing to help around the house. She won't work on her college courses they paid for. She won't even spend time with them.

My dad had a seizure from high blood pressure a few years ago. I'm so worried he's going to have another one. I know he won't go long after my mom does. They're 7 years apart, and he's turning 71 this year. He makes good money but he works so much, and then he has to come home and take care of all the animals. He goes to sleep at midnight earliest, and wakes up at 4. My dad is going to have another seizure, or a stroke.

I'm doing an internship and school 2 states away. I think I have to drop everything and put it all on hold. I want to move back in with my parents and help them out for the remaining time I have with them.

I wanted to take them to Ireland before they died. 

If I go back, the internship will still be waiting for me. I have that guaranteed. But I know my parents would be stressed about my future. They'd worry and think they were a burden to me. I know they'd appreciate the help, though.

I'm so confused. There are a lot of things happening in my life outside of that, too. It's all happening at once. I don't know what to do. I'm uncertain but I'm certain. I'm overwhelmed with emotion, yet entirely numb.

The problem is that he has ""planned"" to do an internship this summer (he's in engineering - computer programming) for some time now, but he hasn't actually taken very many steps in procuring an internship. I am worried about his chances of actually getting one, as I know a lot of competitive internships are hiring for summer now. 

We usually have great communication, and we pride ourselves on our ability to talk through our problems. However, when I have tried to talk to him about this, always gently and not frequently, he becomes defensive and shuts down. Example:

Me: Have you tried contacting any advisors about places where you could apply or enquire about opportunities?
Jack: No. 
Me: Do you plan on talking to anyone soon? A lot of internships hire kind of far in advance.
Jack: I don't know. 
-end of conversation because he had shut down/is clearly too agitated for me to try making any suggestions to-

I got him to open up once about it and he said that he was nervous about it, which I think I understand - he's never actually applied for a job, he's always gotten them through connections whereas I've had my fair share of applications rejected or great interviews end without an offer - but his nerves seem excessive. He couldn't give a reason for why he was nervous (""I just am""). We talked for a while that evening, and in the end I had gotten him to agree to work on our resumes together and attend our school's career fair, both of which we did. 

I know that he's a grown adult, and he's in charge of his own life. I have no intention of nagging him, I'm not his mom and he can take care of himself. I suppose my reason for being so concerned is rather self centered. 

I'm a big planner. I like to have an idea of what's ahead of me, even if it's just, ""I'll still be living in this house in 6 months,""  ""I'm going to move to XYZ within a year,"" or ""I can look for a job in XYZ to start in [month],"" etc. The problem is that with Jack being on the fence about internships/finishing his last few terms online vs on campus, there's not a lot of stability in my living situation. I would like to be able to know if I'm going to need to pack up in 3 months, or half a year, or if I'll be here for a while. And while I'm very flexible with my job at the moment, I don't want to sit around on my degree without getting a ""big kid"" job that actually pays enough to live on for longer than I really need to. 

Additionally, if he gets an internship out of state, or even out of town, I will most likely end up living here on my own until he comes back for classes. 90% of my friends are graduating and moving away, so I'll be pretty alone if that's the case. I would be ok with doing this (not optimal, but doable for a summer) but I would like to know sooner rather than later. 

I've brought up the ""honey, I just ask you this because I'm nervous about not knowing what's coming up for us. Are we still going to live in this apartment, are we going to move? It makes me uncomfortable not having a plan,"" and I have been met with the same kind of shut down and agitation. 

I really need advice on how to motivate him to step up his game without becoming an obnoxious nagging girlfriend. I (and I know this is crazy and obnoxious, so don't give me too much shit for it) went through his college's faculty list at one point when I had some free time and pulled out anyone whose research sounded like something he would enjoy, and made a document with some blurbs about them and their contact information for him. I had previously mentioned (multiple times, spread out across a few months) that contacting professors or other faculty that are doing work that interests him would be good contacts when looking for opportunities, because they would either have opportunities themselves, or possibly know of other people doing similar work. He agreed, but whenever I ask if he's looked into it, he said no (and shut down). Thus, the ""Professor Cheat Sheet"" was born. He hasn't looked at it beyond opening the email when I asked if he had received it. 

tl;dr : I want to know how to motivate my boyfriend to take steps toward his academic/professional future so that I can start planning for my own professional future, but I don't want to nag him. "

Since then, I was able to line up a summer internship. But today, I find out a department at this person's company saw my resume and wants to interview me next week. But, it's for a network admin gig and I know literally nothing about network administration. My background is in math and some computer science. 

I was thinking since I have nothing to lose, I should call them back tomorrow and ask more about the job while expressing my concerns about my lack of experience in the area. Would this be a bad idea?"

I don't have a job set up for after school ends though yet, though I graduate next month.

Ive had on-site interviews at Google, and Bloomberg, but no job yet. So Im still looking, though I haven't submitted many applications since I've been so busy.

I really wanted to be a camp counselor this summer as I used to do it when I was in high school, and though I enjoyed it, a couple summers of internships has made me really appreciate it even more. I really like working with kids and the job is fun, and I figure once i get a full-time job that's it, and this is my last chance to do something like this. I'd like to have one more summer at a camp before I enter the work-force.

My parents are furious and tell me I am not doing that, and that I will look horrible for jobs, and ruin my chances of getting one, that they won't be ok with me taking the summer off, and that I must look for jobs now. I say that I don't think they will turn me away because I decided to do this in the summer rather than get employed, but my parents are furious and say that everybody they mention it to laughs and my mom says its career suicide (my mom tends to exaggerate). She, as well as my grandparents, are very adamant that I should not be taking a job like that at this point and should be getting a real job or Ill look bad.

Anyways are they right? Is this going to negatively affect me? Is it an awful idea?"

Recently came across this sub and while I think my resume is pretty solid so far, I decided to submit it and see if I can get any advice on improvements, better wording, or other things of that nature. Always improving!

Some background on me: Most of my previous professional experience is in customer service/retail, but I hate it, obviously I want out. Although that background may be helpful for some sales positions, that's not what I want to do, so I have recently started obtaining some more IT focused work to gain some more professional IT experience.

I am close to finishing an Associate's Degree in Computer Network Technology. The final step is my internship, which I start next week.

One question I do have regarding the internship is once I start and add it to my resume, should I allow it to flow on to a second page? Should I push off the bottom job entry even though the other entries both started relatively recently?

Any other info you think may help in your critique? Just ask! Thanks a bunch for everything guys!

3498bt,26,2015-04-29,Feeling lost at UBC,throwaway4292015,UBC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/3498bt/feeling_lost_at_ubc/,"Hi reddit,  

I just finished my second year of engineering, and I'm feeling a bit down. To give some background information, I transferred here from U of T. I completed one year of artsci there, but due to a variety of personal issues, I had to return to BC.  It was also during this time that my perspective on life really changed.  

Like many people, I entered college not really knowing what I wanted to do with my life. (I still don't.)  Everyone told me - and even encouraged me - to take a bunch of classes and find my passion.  So, my first year at U of T I tried to do that. But the thing is, I'm not particularly passionate about anything.  I'm supposed to find my 'passion', but I still haven't found it. And what if I never find it?  

Thing thing is, I'm so average it hurts. I'm good at some things, bad at others, and in the end it balances out.  I see all my classmates, who are striving to be lawyers, doctors, writers, musicians and I envy them.  I see my classmates breezing though school, securing internships, and though I'm happy for them, I can't help but feel I'm not up to par. I don't belong here. I feel like such an outsider here at UBC.  

Anyways, I had to come back to UBC because something happened that really changed me (I won't go into details). It forced me to grow up. Made me realize people come and go. Made me realize all the responsibilities I had.  Made me realize all the people who were counting on me. Money was tight now, so the year I came back, I decided I couldn't gamble my college education away. It was critical that I graduate with a job that could pay the bills.  

I decided I was going to do engineering at UBC. The first year I came back, due to finances and the timing of everything, I couldn't go to UBC straight away. Instead, I worked several jobs and went to a nearby college to complete some of my engineering requirements so I could transfer into UBC.  

I started this year as a second year, and it was pretty tough. My grades aren't bad, but they aren't great either. I do well in some classes, not too well in others.  I don't how the other engineers do it, but taking 40+ credits definitely takes a toll on your mental and physical health. I'm tired all the time. Some days I just want sit down for 5 minutes so I can catch my breath, but I have so much stuff to do, I can't stop.  

And because money is so tight, I still have to go to my job. By the time I get home, I just want to go to sleep, but I still have a million problem sets and tests to study for. And no matter how much I study, the profs. are still going to make stupidly hard tests. I'm also really disappointed with some of the profs. in my faculty/department. So many can't teach. The averages are also depressingly low, and the room is a huge sausage fest, which just makes the atmosphere even more depressing.  Don't get me wrong, I don't hate engineering and I don't hate school. I try my best, but I'm just not good enough.  

What's even worse is, I'm not even sure if I can even find a job when I graduate. And that's what stresses me out the most. I failed to get a job this work term. I don't even know if I can get one next term. And I still have to pay the stupid fees to coop even though I couldn't get a job.  I don't know what I'm going to do this summer. I'll probably take some courses so I can lighten my load next year, but the thought of going back to school in a couple of weeks just makes me sick.  

I want to be a kid again. I can't handle all the responsibilities. I could use some advice - but I've heard the same thing all again. Hit the gym. Speak to a counselor. Find what you're passionate about. Join a club. Stop working. Reduce your credit load.  

But the thing is, I've tried doing all these things - and some of them I simply can't do. I can't just stop working - I need the money. The last thing I want to do after my day is hit the gym. I'm already exhausted enough. I can't join a club. All my meetings for group projects conflict.  

Honestly, I don't even recognize the person I used to be two years ago.  I used to be so carefree. Now I'm so stressed. I worry about the future all the time. I've become such a cynic. I see the negative in everything now.  If these are supposed to be the 'best four years of my life', then the rest of my life will seriously suck.  

Some words of inspiration would be nice. Some meaningful advice would be better.  I don't know why I'm writing this on reddit, but in a weird way you guys have always been there for me. Sometimes it's the stupid shit redditors post that literally makes me laugh out loud and makes me realize for a second - life is OK. And there are the posts, where I realize there are people who have been through so much more than I have. Who are so much braver and stronger than I could every wish to be.  I hope everyone's in a better place than I am. Stay strong.

349f3v,5,2015-04-29,I have come to the conclusion that forever isn't long enough.,alana1999,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/349f3v/i_have_come_to_the_conclusion_that_forever_isnt/,"The phrase ""This is forever"" is used a lot on Grey's Anatomy. Especially when talking about MerDer but I have come to the conclusion that forever just ins't long enough. We all thought that Meredith, Christina, Izzie, Alex and George would last forever, but here we are in season 11 with only two of them left. We also thought that Derek, Richard, Bailey, Addison and Mark would last forever but yet again we are left with only two of them. Then we were greeted with 4 new interns from Mercy West, but hold on a minuet there is only two of them left. I wont even start on Lexi's story line because it still upsets me. But do you start to see the pattern of how we meet new characters then BOOM 5 seasons later they either die or leave. People who don't watch the show do not realise the connection we have to some of these fictional characters and tell us to get so upset, but we have invested ten years of our lives to this show and yeah Shonda doesn't owe us anything, we get enough by tuning in to watch every week. 

The death of OUR McDreamy has hit some of us harder than any of us would have expected. I personally feel like I've lost a close friend where as other people may feel like it was just another character death on a silly television show. Forever is not long enough, forever is meant to be forever not until one of the actors decide to leave or there's an argument on set. I understand that actors would to progress in their career or want out, I get that completely but Shonda thinks of the first way to get rid of them and does it.

Derek Shepard didn't deserve a 43 minute episode to die, and end up brain dead, I mean c'mon Shonda what were you thinking!! The episode as a whole was great, having Derek save those people, but after that point it was just down hill from there. Derek was Shondas character from the start but he was introduced into our lives in 2005 and was taken away from us in a way he didn't deserve. 

People are being petty in saying that Grey's is now over, don't be so ridiculous, there is still so many great characters left and story-lines to be finished. Don't stop watching because one character has died. If that's the way you're looking at it why are you still here and not stopped watching after George?

So forever is not long enough in my opinion, forever is meant to be a lifetime. 

What do you guys think?

Here is the shit I have put up with:

* She keeps asking if I  will continue to work when we have kids. When I  say that I will, she gives a relieved sigh and exclaims, ""good!"" I really do plan to continue to work but it isn't her call or her business what DH and I decide to do when the time comes. She has also had this conversation with me in front of my mom. Nevermind the fact she hasn't worked since DH was a fetus.
* She was so entitled at my bridal shower. My SIL has an actual gluten insensitivity.  You'd never know because she never mentions it unless you're actively offering her some cake.  But MIL has ""asymptomatic gluten insensitivity as diagnosed by an inconclusive diagnostic test."" So she didn't bother to rsvp to my aunts that there were GF party-goers (4 in  total,  3 for BS reasons). It's clear she sees it as my fault there was no GF food for the first couple courses (it's a party in my honor and I obviously didn't plan it and she had the host's email address and phone number),and she treated my aunts like crap, saying how it's more than just a little thing because it's member of the bridal party (SIL was a bridesmaid) and the mother of the groom. My MOH was also GF and you'd never know because she just ate around stuff and kept quiet.
* As mentioned above, my MOH keeps gluten free. Enough guests of my wedding are GF that I did order GF cupcakes from my baker for my wedding and took some to MIL to taste a few months prior (because I'm nice). I mentioned to her that my MOH (my cousin) is also gluten free so I was working hard to accommodate everyone.  Without skipping a beat,  she said, ""Mother of the groom and sister of the groom are more important."" Not to me, MIL. 
* I didn't sit down the week of my wedding. I was a crazy person getting things from all across the city. The day of the rehearsal dinner (which DH and I planned and budgeted for, not MIL and FIL), I did not sit down. I had 15 minutes to get ready after running around all day and was barely on time for the rehearsal. DH had one task that day: to pick up a GF mousse cake from Whole Foods for my MOH, SIL, and MIL, which he did. On the way from the venue, DH's phone and mine went off at the same time with texts from MIL: ""dont forget my mousse cake."" I was livid. I'd run around all day like a crazy person and she was concerned with the special dessert for her.  Because the world would end if a 60 year-old woman didn't get dessert. 
* In the months leading up to the wedding she kept asking if she and her family would have access to the bridal suite. The answer (from DH) was no, it was for the bride and bridal party to chill in, and there were couches in the front and everyone was getting ready at the hotel anyway.  But she kept pushing it.  DH held firm.  The day of the wedding it was made clear again, and the bridesmaids, groomsmen and patents of the flower girls all knew they were welcome to chill in the bridal suite on the couches and change the diapers of the flower girls on the floor or conference table, but no one was to use the toilet because it needed to be clean so my dress wouldn't get messy. After the first dances, I went with my cousins to the bridal suite to go pee (They had to hold my dress). MIL's brother was on the phone in there. I told him it was the bridal suite and he needed to leave. I was met with a rude response about how he needed a place to make a call. I responded that it was not the place to do so and he could go outside (it was summer). I proceeded to the bathroom and was met with fresh shit. He'd gone into a room he wasn't supposed to be in,  used the toilet meant only for me , and hadn't bothered to flush. It's clear MIL sent him there to make his call ands he took it further. She and her family were supposed to stay out.  So disrespectful. 
* My mom visited me to buy my wedding dress. MIL suggested we all do dinner. When the check came, MIL and FIL sat on their hands. A few months later, they invited themselves to stay with my parents in CA. They sat on their hands at the restaurant they went to there. Zero reciprocity. Not even an attempt to reciprocate. MIL and FIL also didn't offer to help with dishes when my mom cooked one night. 
* I found this out this week. My parents got a letter from MIL the week DH and I got engaged.  It said, ""We are pleased that GIMME_ALL_THE_BABIES has the eye of practicality in using her grandmother's ring."" I am so lucky to have inherited a beautiful ring with a nice diamond and that is to my taste.  Had I not,  DH would have gladly bought one. I'm offemded by her comment because it truly isn't her business where the ring came from and it's rude of her to make this comment. I feel it implies that in receiving a new ring had I not been so fortunate would have made me a gold digger. It might even imply she thinks I wouldn't have deseved a new ring. I'm offended.
* My dad worked in the auto industry (desk job, not UAW). He got laid off (forced to retire) in 2006 like so many others And as a middle aged man, his subsequent opportunities have not been as great. He finally got a job be lovef around the time DH and I got engaged. FIL and MIL made a comment, not knowing anything about the situation other than my dad was coming out of retirement, that ""well any money coming in is good,"" as if my family is a bunch of poor hicks.
* My little brother is graduating this year.  He has a paid internship at his dream company lined up. It is truly the opportunity  of a lifetime and he earned it by building a portfolio of solid work and holding a very serious leadership position at his top public university. He also was interviewing for full-time jobs and was close to an offer before deciding he'd regret it forever if he didn't take his dream internship.   MIL and FIL made a comment recently when I mentioned his upcoming graduation that my parents must not be looking forward to his pending unemployment come June. They just assumed, given my brother's field, that he was unemployed. I was furious And offended.
* SIL has a new boyfriend. Before he came to meet the family, we were talking about it at Easter. MIL said, ""I'm excited to meet the BF because SIL is picky,"" and she shot me a look that just said it all.
* At the rehearsal dinner where MIL had her fucking mousse cake, my bridesmaid's husband was making small talk with MIL and FIL. He asked what MIL did for work. She replied that she stayed at home.  FIL followed up in a snotty tone that our was valid because she raised a Harvard grad and a dentist. the poor guy was just making small talk. No need to be snooty.



I'm just done. It's clear this behavior is driven by my in-laws' perceptions of class and where we fall versus them. The comments to me, my family, and about my family are not ok and I'm done. DH and I are moving out of their area. I have asked DH that for one year they not visit us so we can focus on our marriage, since these behaviors are offensive and I don't want to fight.  He agreed.

My parents are retiring to a resort town at the end of the year and are  building a gorgeous new house.  I suspect MIL and FIL don't realize what rude guests they were last time and will ask to visit my parents to ""see the new house."" I've made it clear to DH that he needs to nip that in the bud should they mention wanting to go, because I don't want my parents mistreated again. He agrees. 

I'm just angry and offended and done. "

To all of you who think that because they are not doing as well in school that you wont be able to find a job and aren't good enough to be an engineer I want to tell you that isn't true. The past two semesters have been pretty rough. I am currently about to enter my senior year in AeroE, I have had a low 2.5~ Gpa for a while now after doing poorly in dynamics/DiffEq last spring. I have been down in the dumps ever since and honestly a lot of posts on here have not helped how I was feeling. I finally realized at the beginning of the semester that I needed some help from the outside. I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with depression, my doctor suggested medicine along with seeking help from counseling and change in diet and exercise. I took her words to heart and started working out every day along with eating a lot healthier. I then went to counseling student services and got some great free help. With all of those things I've really turned around this semester. I changed my work ethic a lot and am studying at least twice as much as past semester. I am sitting at A's in nearly all of my classes this semester at 18credit hours. Another thing that was getting me down was the lack of internship opportunities. I have always heard you need that 3.0 otherwise you're just thrown out of the runnings, but I applied to any and every company. I have been working as an undergraduate research assistant since my freshman year so I have work experience but I was still pessimistic. Eventually I heard back from only two of the companies and the interviews went fantastic. After a few rounds of interviews I managed to land an internship with one of the big Aerospace names! I just want to pass my positive feelings to all of you. If you think that you have not shot you're wrong. Working out and getting outside has helped so much. I've been able to lose all of my negative thoughts just from exercising and clearing my head. Sometimes all it takes is just a little motivation and a lot of hard work. Sorry for the rant guys!  

TL;DR: Did shitty in past semesters, thought it was a lost cause, changed habits this semester and worked my ass off, ended up landing my dream internship and should finish this semester with a ~3.7 Gpa"
349ywh,6,2015-04-29,"My wife and I have credit card debt, I can't work out if I should consolidate or not. Please help.",doiconsolidateyesno,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/349ywh/my_wife_and_i_have_credit_card_debt_i_cant_work/,"So over the period of a few years my wife and I went into debt over some vet bills, car repairs, and being stupid. We've gotten a handle on the credit cards themselves and haven't increased the amount on any of them in about 10 months now - except where we've opened up 0% cards to transfer balances from higher interest accounts.

We're both students, I work part-time during the semester &amp; full-time over the summer earning $11 p/h. My wife has just found a job and starts next month for $11.75 p/h full-time over the summer which also goes to part-time over the semester period. In the future (~2yrs) we will both be fully degreed and working in a Computer Science field hopefully earning a lot more. We are planning to get internships in Summer 2016 period which should pay, on average, $20p/h to us both. But, as much as the future looks awesome to pay off this debt, we're stuck in the lower-paying-student roles for now. So I'm wondering if we should consolidate at this point though to get it all into one lump sum.

Here's our current situation: (W) = wife's account, (M) = my account

Chase (W)	18.99%	$25.00	$867.82	
USAA (W)	17.90%	$71.00	$2,491.41	
Chase (W)	0.00%	$25.00	$750.00	0% expires 09/03/2015
Capital (M)	17.90%	$25.00	$304.49		
Citi (W)	0.00%	$39.00	$2,632.69	0% expires 09/2015
AmEx (W)	15.24%	$56.00	$2,459.08	
USAA (M)	15.90%	$47.00	$2,998.49	
Citi (M)	0.00%	$30.18	$466.72	0% expires Nov 2016

Total Debt: $12,970.70
Total Min: $343.18

My wife tries to pay just above the min monthly payments on the higher interest debt if she thinks we can that month. 

So here my question, I just got a personal loan offer from USAA for $11,600 for 17.75% APR. I can choose from the following terms:

36-Month Loan
$417.91 per month
17.75% APR

48-Month Loan
$339.24 per month
17.75% APR

60-Month Loan
$292.99
per month
17.75% APR

This is where my math ability seems to taper off. I can't work out if it's worth keeping the debt where it is right now or taking one of these options. We would love the lower monthly payments, but I'm not sure if the APR is going to work out well for us. I'm also slightly confused as to why USAA gave me $15.9% on my credit card, but now offering 17.75% for the personal loan. 

But anyway, is this worth it or not? Should we look elsewhere to consolidate? If it helps at all:

My credit scores:

688 TransUnion
678 EquiFax

Her credit scores:

717 TransUnion
724 Equifax

Thank you!"
34a4gf,6,2015-04-29,Me [22 M] with mygirlfriend [21 F] of 6 months are going to be in a long distance relationship,FoxyMegan,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/34a4gf/me_22_m_with_mygirlfriend_21_f_of_6_months_are/,"So we met through common friends last year in a bar in London. She was there for a gap year, and I was doing an internship for 6 months. We started dating in late October, and became official on the 15th of November. 


It was very nice the time we had in London, even though we knew it was going to be hard since I had to come back to France (Paris) as my internship was ending at the end of December. 


So, we decided to be together for New Year's eve and so she joined me in France. After that I had to go back to uni in a city close to Paris and she stayed with me there until now.


Everything has been very good, but she has to go back to Canada (Vancouver) to finish uni. So now what should we do? I'm finishing uni in a month, and then I could look for jobs over there but this is very uncertain that I can find one.


**tl;dr**: We met in London, then moved back to France and she joined me ever since. But she has to leave on the 10th of May to go back to Canada. So what advices on long distance relationships could you give us? "
34a7bx,12,2015-04-29,amney,beforethewind,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/34a7bx/amney/,"My uncle started hospice last weekend. 

He is not terribly old. Of course, he is not terribly young, either. He is my grandmother’s brother, on my mother’s side of the family and he is dying. I am sitting on his bedside and outside, far away, police sirens are roaring. He was always our uncle, but he was more of a cousin, he was more of a peer. Uncle was a child at heart. With my brother and I being the only children in the family, he was our de facto cousin. He was the family friend we could relate to. He was not a condescending source of maturity; he was as ridiculous and optimistic as we were. The fact that he is dying destroys us. It destroys me. An obnoxious measure of sirens blots out my thoughts. 

Adam is taking it with particular difficulty. He is the truest baby of the family and my younger (and only) brother. That is not to say that the rest of the family is coping any easier. Uncle Jack was the youngest of his siblings, as well. It is a terrible situation no matter how you word it. He would always be the one telling me, “John, you take care of Adam if anything ever happens to us,” meaning, the older relatives and my parents. That advice gives me little solace today. 

Uncle Jack was a police officer for many years. He married a beautiful woman who we came to love as our aunt in his early thirties and that was probably the symbolic ending of our “peer relationship” with him. At that point, he was our elder. We were no longer arbitrary cousins. It ironed out the family. We knew who we were and what our family consisted of, at last. Adam was almost out of middle school when this happened and I was just graduating high school. 

It is incredible what a decade can do to your being. Adam is now a police officer, very much so following in the footsteps of his beloved uncle. But Uncle Jack, dearest uncle… he is not nearly as thriving. He maintained a lustrous career in the New York Police Department and was looking forward to retiring by fifty. Instead, he contracted a rare cancer, probably due to a consistent bout of responding to emergency calls in this one devastated area of the city. You know the area: uprooted partitions of asbestos and every god damned carcinogen known to man were crudely molded into low-income housing. Now, every time some schmuck with a gun let a slug fly, these chemicals became airborne. These chemicals infected the lungs of the men and women who were there to protect the innocent bastards who were unfortunate enough to live in these areas, to live besides the walking scum of mankind that fought such petty wars. And now he was dying, before sixty years of age. 

I will not get into the philosophy and utter bullshit that comes into play when discussing such matters. Would a just god allow a kind and fair person to die before the age of seventy? Would an omnipotent universe allow a schoolyard of young child to be slain at the end of a gun belonging to a madman? I am not one to even begin rationalizing these conversations and will sure as hell not begin to do so here. The fact remained: my uncle was dying and my family was preparing for the absolute worst. And we struggled against futile efforts. 

Adam and I, we grew up and matured under almost direct-influence from my uncle. Of course my dearest mother and father crafted our personalities. Of course our friends and schoolmates helped to form our ideas. But, as far as anything beyond our genetic destinations, our uncle was probably singlehandedly responsible for our identifications as selves. From our profound interest in the afterlife to our preference to spending the weekends playing paintball in the mountains, he forged us. Honing in on the whole “afterlife” aspect of our interests, he gifted us one item that truly solidified our love for the macabre. When I was just beginning high school, however many years ago, our dearest uncle gave my brother and I a simple Ouija board. 

It was a mass-produced and super commercialized item. We were, concurrently, super skeptical, but my brother was feebly open-minded and I was always looking for a way to spook myself and my family out. The silly board game even had a “glow in the dark” feature that added to the ridiculous nature of the whole ordeal. This led to Adam and I spending countless afternoons in the basement, sitting cross-legged on the floor in the dark, peering into the softly glowing, barely visible face of the Ouija board. 

My skepticism had never left me and Adam was never particularly deft in the craft of manufacturing a storyline and characters of a fictional persona. So, when we began “meeting” otherworldly beings and dead humans through this board game, I was a little bit more than pleased and worried with our findings. Whenever we would ask their names, we would get a handful of random letters that only loosely resembled realistic names. But their backstories would always be spelt with the utmost of tact and grammar. While their names were gibberish, their explanations were perfect. It was a tad unsettling, sitting as the elder in the room. 	

With all of this apparent fright, let it be known that I was never upset with my younger brother. I did not receive these paranormal readings as malcontent on his part. It just surprised me, at times in pride, at others in fear, that he could move the dial on the Ouija board and spell out entire life stories of people who had lived in the 14th, 18th, and 19th century. How did he, a public student living in 21st century America, know the politics of Luxemburg? How did he know that women in historical China would bind their feet? How would he, a boy who had barely begun to pick up the guitar, know what a mandolin was? I could not tell if it was my practical joking getting the best of him and I concurrently or if otherworldly forces were at play. Could this ridiculous board game actually channel… something else? Of course not. I refused to believe it. It must have been something about our subconscious or some other psychological phenomena that I could not explain.

Time went on and I found other vices to occupy my time. I found petty flirtations with girls my age that never came to fruition. Young puppy love and relations that never manifested themselves into an actual relationship. I was far too afraid to actually ask a girl out on a date, so these feelings only resulted in my confiding with my good friends. But I had not kept tabs on my younger brother. As where I had grown tired of playing with the Ouija board, Adam kept at it with his friends and even, at times, by himself. In the days that we had played with the device, we had “met” an entity known as Xenon. It was a completely ridiculous and unbelievable name, but she was supposedly an Asian immigrant of the Luxemburg storyline that I had previously alluded to. She was a servant of a household in the European micro-nation. She had also played the sitar. How my brother had created these characters, I have no idea. My imagination was certainly not at play and I, even as a younger teenager, truly did not try to disenfranchise the results of the board by creating my own metaphysical stories to frighten my brother. 

I allowed them to play with the board without supervision for quite some time. He had shown it to various girls and boys from the neighborhood whenever I was working at the local craft store. As I had said, I was no longer interested in the game, but his young mind surely was. Life went on. 

As we grew up a bit, we would cater to our love for the paranormal through alternative means. Fortunately for us, it became a topic of popular culture and many television series and specials were produced for broadcast programming. This allowed for our parents to become involved in our hobby. After a few episodes of a ghost hunting show on television, my mom confessed, with a slight bit of sarcasm and enthusiasm, that she had thought she had seen a “woman standing in our living room, late at night.” This was, of course, an appeal to my brother and I, an attempt at stirring our imagination. I nodded and worked on my dinner as Adam stared in amazement and swore that he, too, had seen such a manifestation. Our dog, a small Jack Russell Terrier, entirely white except for a splotch of brown on her head, took this opportunity to steal some food off of his plate. The little rat had always sat right behind Adam, sharing his chair and hoping that he dropped food. 

Having been next in line for our creative development (behind my beloved uncle), my mother would consistently drop little story starters into our daily lives and never provide much more to go on. Much like the short story about the woman in the living room, she would give us a mental image and an out-of-the-ordinary situation, and let the ideas cultivate in our young minds. This continued for a long time and at certain points, I could not tell if she was merely being whimsical or actually telling stories which had occurred in her life. I remember when I was a freshman in college, visiting home for the winter, she swore that when she was working on her computer in the kitchen, our dog walked past her legs and into her bed which was typically at my mother’s feet. She reached down to pet my dog and realized nothing was there. A few moments later, after searching, she found the dog sleeping upstairs. 

Weeks later, after watching one of these television series with the entire family, we found ourselves enjoying a scene, invariably scripted beyond oblivion, of the “paranormal investigators” utilizing a Ouija board and attempting to talk to spirits in the attic of an old house in Washington State. Adam sat there on the couch, with this knees held against his chest in rapt attention. It was pleasant to see that childhood enthusiasm alive and well. Although he had still regularly played with the board, seeing this television show had completely rekindled his love of the game. He asked that I would play with him that weekend when he had his friends over. 

There were two boys and a girl. They were all around fourteen years old and, naturally, little shits. There is really no other way to put it. I am all but positive that one of them and the girl were a couple. He’d take every opportunity of physical contact as a grace-lacking attempt at touching a personal area of the girl’s body. Were this incident to occur today, modernly, there would absolutely be harassment issues brought up between the girl and the boy, their school’s guidance counselor, and possibly the police. But that is merely my age revealing itself. Unfortunately, the curse of young adulthood and piss-poor personalities did not keep its hands off of my younger brother. 

Before we began the séance, we sat around the board and Adam gave the instructions, their objectives, and his “house rules” of sorts. The girl lit three candles and turned the lights off at his request. He warned his friends to be very serious in this exercise. He warned that it could be a lot of fun, but that they may end up talking to very powerful and sometimes malicious entities. He did not want them to display any disrespect or rudeness, because he frequently had spoken with “demons” who had initially introduced themselves as benevolent spirits. One of the boys asked what he meant and Adam, appealing to the annoying nature I had previously mentioned, told him that he would be temporarily cursed. Further inquiring to what Adam meant, he told him that “whenever he went into the bathroom, your face would be replaced with white eyes and a horrible screaming mouth” – I intervened and told him to knock it off. There was no point in playing with this if you were going to be a lying schmuck throughout the ordeal. 

He laughed at my objectivity and apologized. The three others laughed nervously too: they still believed in my brother’s ridiculous warning. No such “curse” ever came about, so there’s always that. Ha.
Before long, we encountered an entity that refused to give a name. The boys teased, saying that it was afraid of us, and the board said, simply, “bullshit.” They asked if it was a boy or a girl and it did not respond, again. The group was quiet for a little bit, nervous, and the girl hazarded, “Are you a demon?” The room was still for a moment, then the dial moved, all of our hands on it: yes, you little slut. I chalked it up to the touchy-feely boy, but he looked as shocked as everyone else. They were a little upset. 

Adam looked genuinely worried at this point. He apologized to the board, for our rudeness and whatnot. It responded with a simple “fine” and the group did not really know where to go from there. One of the boys finally asked, adding an additional apology, if they could speak to someone else and the demon could be on its way. The board told us that he would not release the board to any other entity. We were going to speak to him and him only.

This seemed to really not sit well with anyone. I, well, I was interested. I held my smirk behind a straight-grit in order to keep the group still and petrified. Without asking another question, the dial moved once more and scribed a sentence that chills me to this day: tell that brother of yours to stop being a smartass. My eyes widened and I looked at Adam. Adam looked at me and then wore an expression of a man twenty years his elder, so far removed from the comforts of modern living. He wore the face of a parent burying his child, of a surgeon failing, of a war veteran outliving his comrades. He bore too much knowledge about the situation at hand, far more knowledge than anyone in the room. Essentially, this was not a joke. We had all removed our hands with this last insult and Adam motioned to return them, clearing his throat.
“Demon,” Adam asked. “Is that you, Amney?”

The familiarity and tone in my brother’s voice made the hair on my neck stand. Without a second to contemplate the situation at hand, the dial read “yes.”
“Listen, we were just interested in showing our friends how the board works. We mean no harm.”
“I know, you little fuck. I was just checking in. How’s the family?” The board wrote.
After the response, the dial rapidly shot to each corner of the board, to the decorative pictures that branded the extremities. Nonsense.
“We’re… we’re fine, Amney. I know we haven’t spoken in a while.”
“Good. Good.  Which parent do you love more?”
At this point, I picked up the little dial and clutched it tight, standing.
“No, we’re done. This is bullshit. Adam, I don’t know if you’re fucking with your friends, or… or what. But we’re done.”

The fucking thing tore from my grip and landed upright on the board. The candles went out immediately after and the girl screamed. I moved towards the stairs and turned on the light. The candles were tipped over and the wet wax smothered the board. Most of it was covered, except for the smiling sun in the upper left-hand corner.  The wax encompassed it and most of the mess was already drying. Adam looked up at me and told me he was sorry, a single tear running down his face. He sniffed, looked away, composed himself and rapidly stood, cleaning the mess. His friends never saw his tear.

We quickly packed up and that was that. We did not talk much about it. He was obviously bothered, but got over it by midweek. We played plenty of shooter video games and we even drank a little bit of our parent’s alcohol when they went away the next weekend. That Sunday night we watched a horror movie which focused around a demon. Upon realizing the story’s premise and hearing the word “demon,” I silently hated myself and prayed that it would not bring some shell-shocked flashback to my brother’s being. No such break down occurred; in fact, he calmly and happily brought up the experience after the movie. He simply asked, “Do you remember that whole ‘Amney’ bit?”

Of course, I said yes.

“Yeah, that fucker is creepy,” he smirked.
“You talked to him a lot?” I asked him.
“Yeah. I don’t really know how to explain it. Maybe those things are like… creative unlockers? You know? Like they tap into your creative invulnerabilities and just pour words from you.”
“I don’t know, man.”
“Well, I hope so, at least. He described himself to me one time. Real creepy stuff.”
“Like what?”
“Well, he was a demon. First of all,” he chuckled at this. He was nervous at first, then the seriousness caught his voice. “He was a demon, and he told me that the  most relatable thing he could call himself, the thing I would most understand, was the shape of a dog. Except instead of your typical ‘dog-shaped’ head, he said it resembled a mask. Like a large, porcelain, V-shaped mask. Mostly blank, besides large black eyes.”

I think of my mother sitting at a computer desk in the kitchen, thinking she saw a Jack Russell Terrier move past her feet.

“Weird, man,” I reply, offering nothing else.
“Yeah…” he cleared his throat. “What did you think about when he asked about mom and dad?”
“I,” I thought for a moment. “I didn’t.”
“Good,” Adam nodded. “He would have done something vengeful.”

I did not know what he meant, but I did not want to pry. I was happy enough that we covered this topic without a breakdown of tears. We proceeded to watch some mindless programming for a few hours and he went to bed, happy.

Later that night, or rather, early that morning, I received a call from the police department informing me that my parents had died in a car accident on I-95. I did not tell Adam until later that day. He went to school, like any other day, and spent six or seven hours in ignorance. He went to his part time job at the grocery store and worked, happily and stupidly, like any other day. I had to tell him when he got home. Our uncle and grandparents were there. It was inevitable. It was not my choice. He had to know. Were it up to me, I would have kept him, to this day, ignorant of the fact that our parents died, one with the melted and molten iron and steel that cocooned their bodies. Their carcasses were inseparable from the frame of the vehicle that carried us to however many family vacations. The vessel that brought us to Disney World was now their tomb; the vehicle that brought us to the beach was now the same chemical composite as our parents. Were it up to me, I would have prolonged his revelation with bullshit in the vein of, “oh, they are traveling in Europe,” or, “they continued their weekend trip and their flights are delayed!” Bullshit. Ignorant bullshit that keeps the emotional mind at bay.

We mourned. The community supported us. I was on the verge of suicide for months. The thought of my brother being alone kept me going. Our uncle was our guardian for a while, although officially, per the government’s papers, our grandparents were our guarantors. I grew older, completed college, and watched my brother finish high school. The years that followed were uneventful. Adam got a community service commendation; I managed to break from alcoholism. I got a job in mid-management at the state health department; Adam earned an internship at the police department. We were the most typical fucked up brothers you could fine. That was until our uncle became sick.

Yes, I know what you’re thinking: oh, a family member was diagnosed with something malignant, aren’t you a special snowflake. Well, you can go fuck yourself. Uncle Jack is in hospice as we speak. I already told you this. Uncle Jack is in hospice and the sirens have been blaring all day. From all around our sleepy town in the middle of nowhere, crisscrossed by highways and interstates and roads that lead everywhere but here, the sirens have been blaring. Fire trucks and police officers from towns that never knew our name are here, portioning off an exit on the highroad.

Uncle Jack takes my hand. He looks me in the eye. The morphine is already terribly strong and it is getting stronger by the day. At this point, it is not to relieve his pain. It is simply a race against nature to cease his organ’s function. It is no longer palliative, but a challenge to god. Earlier this morning, he talked about cats I don’t own and family members that never existed, such as a sister who was “bringing him water” all day. His delusions were terrifying and pathetic. I could no longer bear to see such a loved person dealing with so much bodily failure and ultimately, pain.

Staring me in the face, he said, “Son, I appreciate everything you’ve done… but please, get your dog out of here.” At this, I was confused. I knew it was another symptom of the morphine, but I wanted to help him, however I could.

“Uncle Jack, we don’t have a dog. You know that,” I held back tears.
“Stop. Just close the door. Stop him from staring at me. Stupid… fucking… dog,” he choked.

I rose and closed the door. I could tell the end was coming. But it is never easy. It is never immediate. It is always a matter of hours, days, weeks. Sometimes, months. The sirens outside grew louder. On a day like today, no solace was spared. No grieving, nothing. Your problem was just another piece of rubbish in the mosaic that society is composed of. Little did I know that the sirens were clearing and helping sort out a pile up that was on the same interstate that killed my parents. Little did I know that my brother was driving home from classes this afternoon to help me take care of Uncle Jack. Little did I know that his sedan may have been involved.

“Son,” Uncle Jack cried. “You’ve always been as good as any child of my own that I could have prayed for. Your parents loved you. I loved you. And I could never have asked for anyone better to see me out.”
I will admit to having cried at this display.
“But please, close that damned door, that fucking dog…”
I turned to see the closed door and dropped my eyes to the floor. Poor, poor drug-induced illusions.
But, of course, he continues.

“He keeps asking me, John. He keeps asking, who do I love more, ‘Adam or John?’ Get that little bastard out of here.”

34abaw,0,2015-04-29,Need advice on rejecting an internship after already accepting the offer.,watamidoingwithlife,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/34abaw/need_advice_on_rejecting_an_internship_after/,"So, I accepted an internship offer at a company that was relatively close to home and paid well, especially for the low-cost of living in the area. It's not exactly something I wanted to do, but since it was already March, I went ahead and accepted it. 

Now I just received an offer from a company that is very cutting-edge and would overall help my career much more just having their name on my resume. It's in an awesome place (Bay Area, CA) where I would get paid enough to live relatively comfortably for 3 months. 

So my question is, how bad is it to reject a company after already signing the offer letter, especially since I'm supposed to start in less than 2 weeks? How exactly should I go about contacting the first company? I wouldn't do this until I signed the second company's offer and they confirmed it, which probably wouldn't be until next week. 

If I should reject it, how detailed do I have to be and should I call or is e-mail enough? 

Thanks in advance!

But after several career fairs, networking events, dozens and dozens of applications and a fair amount of interviews, I finally got an offer for a full time paid internship in my are of interest (business/IT stuff), right in my home town (I thought I would have to go to NYC to find such an opportunity but now I can spend the summer with my friends and family woohoo).

The thing that gives me the most satisfaction is the fact that I got this with no connections or assistance or networking. This was all me and I've never felt so accomplished. I applied with a genuine cover letter and spent all night before the interview researching the company and figuring out exactly what I wanted to say. HR called me back an hour after the interview to give me their offer. My girlfriend was in the room when I got the call and she saw my face light up like I had just won the lottery. It's so damn satisfying to succeed after trying and worrying about something for 7 months.

I got the offer a week ago and I'm still just filled with excitement. I can barely pay attention in class anymore because all I can think about is starting my internship. I can't wait to do a great job this summer and maybe even get a full time offer. : D"

I have worked a few jobs, and my current one offered me full time position after I graduate, but I need to be interviewed again so I'm not sure if this is a rejection. I haven't looked into other jobs because of time restraints.

So there's a few things I want to point out:

* I don't really like the work environment I was in and I don't think I'll be paid enough to keep me happy, story of almost every person tho
* It's all self-learning in the company, even during the internship, so there's only going to be a wall that I'm going to hit eventually, that or I'll be banging my head against the desk
* I want to go to grad school but I haven't taken standardized tests yet and deadline is coming up as well as finals, gotta work hard because my GPA ain't looking so hot
* I don't want to work full-time or at least that many hours so I can concentrate on studies and other self-improvement activities like the lone wolf I am, but I'm not sure how to bring it up or when to bring that up

I'm planning on asking about the hours if they do hire me. I have already told my employer that I want to go to grade school. Have not discussed salary.

I'm not sure what I'm going to do is the best course of action and I hope you guys can help me out or guide me in the right direction.

Also, I don't have a github or anything of the sort and my development work has been internal company stuff. So I can't post any of the sort on github anyway. How important or enticing is it to include it in a resume for future job prospects?

i have trouble in getting my act together x_X"
34aqtz,5,2015-04-29,Keeping an abundance mentality after you have finished college.,soontobgrad,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/34aqtz/keeping_an_abundance_mentality_after_you_have/,"In just a few weeks, I will be done with college, the most enjoyable years of my life so far (a large part of it being because I was in a fraternity). Now there is no doubt in my mind that as I get older, I will get more experiences in life that make me a better and more desirable man. I plan on sticking with lifting for a while so I make more gains and the career track I am at now will have me making a six figure salary.

Even though I agree with the red pill about the whole sexual market value chart thingy, there is one thing that makes me uneasy. The one that makes me uneasy is also the one major roadblock I feel like older guys who have it together will run into.

**The lack of attractive single women compared to your younger days.**

I feel like in college, I was surrounded by girls in the 18-22 age range and they were there in a high concentration. Not only were many of these girls above average looking, they were also in their sexual prime and many of them were not tied down to anything long term. I felt so spoiled in my college days and being in a fraternity only made it better.

As my college years went on, I saw it happen. Girls who were slutting it up and made for great ONS material early on in college were not settling down into LTRs as they were months away from graduating. Most of the hot ones were usually the first ones to go as well since they had their fun early on. 

I compare college to the real world (based on internships I have done in cities and my time in my old town) and I already see the sharp differences in quality. College is loaded with young, horny, and attractive girls while the real world is literally all over the place. So many women in the unavailable category (legally too young or just too old) and even in terms of looks, there are not nearly as many attractive women.

Now some will say you can get those college girls as you get older **but that is going to be a hell of an sacrifice.** 

I have seen it for myself in all 4 years, even a guy as young as 25 is ""too old"" to a lot of college years let alone a 30 yr old. Not even that, I feel like I would have to sacrifice so many things in my life for that kind of access while the 20 yr old just has to be there. Then there is the issue of college girls not wanting to go for guys that old because they are not a part of the college community, so you will lose out to the guy with the right Greek Letters on him everytime.

**So I am almost forced to ask, how do older guys keep an abundance mentality?**"

I am in a bit of a situation that I need some advice in. I received and accepted a full-time offer from a company this spring semester, that has a start date of August . Before the fall semester, I was planning on earning my undergraduate degree in May but I was forced to drop one of my classes for my major this semester and now my graduation date (3 weeks away) will have to be delayed to the following fall 2015 semester. The classes that I need to graduation are not offered in the summer so I can not complete it then.

I was a part of and completed this company's internship program last summer and performed very well and had many positive reviews coming from full-time professionals including the internship program coordinator. Throughout the interview process for this full-time opportunity, they continued to give my good praise and really wanted me to be apart of their company.

What is the best way to approach letting my hiring manager know that my graduation date has now been delayed?

Should I ask if I can be considered for the internship program this summer again?

Will the delay of my graduation due to a necessary drop of my class negatively affect my relations with this company that I would love to work for in the future?


Any information and advice is greatly appreciated!

Thanks"

Figured I'd drop a line here as well just because this is a much more popular subreddit.

The short summary for you guys: I graduated college in 2013 (BA in Information Technology &amp; Informatics, which is basically about tech and how it impacts/is adopted into society, with a minor in English). 

I am on my second IT job (first was a non-technical support desk, this one is being the IT guy for a small company) and I hate it. 

Truth is that I always wanted to work in marketing. I've been reading ad age for years, am really into how brands work, etc.

Anyway, now is the time for a career change, while I am very young.

What I'm looking for is suggestions on how to break into advertising. I obviously can't do an internship, but other than that, I don't care what I have to do, as long as I can get my feet wet.

What I'm already working on:

* Applying to tons of jobs on job boards
* Looking for work on LinkedIn (job searching there)
* Looked into marketing meetings (I live by NYC); there's a big one on May 26th I'd like to go to


What else can I do? I've gotten suggestions for a blog/google analytics and I want to get started on that (as soon as I can figure out content to put on there!). I also do use twitter regularly, but it is not professional at all, so I'd have to clean that up.

34bey0,7,2015-04-29,Respectfully reneging on former employer's offer with 4 months notice... nasty response back,atalossforjobadvice,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/34bey0/respectfully_reneging_on_former_employers_offer/,"Dear All, 

Today I had to renege on an offer from a former employer. I worked there for 2 years as an intern and they told me I would have a full time position upon finishing up school. Then out of the blue they told me that they would not have a position available due to some restructuring... And so I began my job hunt... about a month later they told me, actually we will accept you, here's the offer letter. I signed it - it was on an at-will basis with a start date for Mid-august. I had to accept it because I had nothing else going for me at the time and with graduation looming large, I couldn't say no. They gave me less than 3 days to respond to the offer which pinned me in an unpleasant situation.


.


. 

This was in December and all this time I was worried that they would flip flop their minds again on me (note, they gave me an offer for 25,000 less than verbally promised initially when I was interning). I had to accept it because I had no other options at the time. 

With the job hunt, I applied to over 200 positions, had about 15 interviews... I finally landed a position with a 30 minute commute round trip versus 2 hour commute roundtrip. I accepted that position and today I was given an offer letter - I then emailed my former employer and very very respectfully informed them due to personal reasons of not living in the area after I finish school, I won't be able to work for them. 

**I got a VERY nasty response back that took shots at me personally when I had to take a couple weeks off when I had surgery for cancer - which they trivialized in the email and was just exceptionally rude.**

..

..
..


 They claimed that I was essentially stabbing them in the back and that at this point in the game they wouldn't be able to find someone else and there will be an empty space.. 


.

.

Let me inform you all that the reason a position was available was due to someone going to graduate school, that person will be there until mid- August (when I was supposed to start).**I feel as though giving them 4 months notice was respectful of me. I didn't spring it upon them in the last week before starting?**
.

.


The position I accepted pays a very competitive rate and the 30 minute round trip commute versus 2 hours will significantly improve my quality of life. Something that means a lot to me with all the health struggles I had last year. Not to mention I would be working 8 hours per day instead of 11 hours per day at my former employer. 


.
.
.

**My concern is that my employment at the new company contingent satisfactory references from previous employer... Am I completely screwed here?** 

Do you all have any advice in this situation? Thank you so much for your help!! 


...


...


...
**EDIT: My apologies on the format.  Here's a TL;DR - Company A was former employer when I interned, Company A flip flopped back and forth and then gave me an offer at the very beginning of year which I took because I had no other option. I had commenced searching for other jobs at that point, Company B comes in and presents me with offer today which I couldn't refuse. Today I had to renege on Company A - who was furious. Company B needs satisfactory reference from previous employer for offer to hold. Company A is pissed and I'm worried about getting terrible review?**"
34bjj5,3,2015-04-29,mechanical engineering student considering switching to computer science,Jeida,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/34bjj5/mechanical_engineering_student_considering/,"Hi everyone,

So I am a mechanical engineering student in my 4th semester at a good technical university in Denmark. I sort of ended up in ME after way too much pondering and asking for advice from too many student counselors, even though my initial intention was to do computer engineering... anyhow, it is kind of too late now.
The only courses I have enjoyed so far are maths, matlab and electronics design and to a certain extent control systems. I have struggled my way through mechanics and even though I got decent grades I can't stomach it. Same could be said for machine design, CAD, FEM which i almost failed... 
At the moment, I feel extremely demotivated to continue and feel so bored by lack of applicable skills, feel like I have wasted time on all this theory and machine design which is useless unless you have access to industrial resources. In other words, I feel like if I did computer science instead I could be creative and productive on a daily basis without needing external resources, does that make sense? So whenever I get the time, which is very rare since ME studies are way too challenging for me, I find myself trying to learn more programming (mainly improving html skills and python)

But what I would like your opinions on is this:
I have only one semester of courses left for my ME degree besides the internship semester and the bachelor's thesis. And I just found out that I can do an online bachelor's degree in computer science in with a Swedish university. 
Do you guys think this would be manageable if I am already struggling with ME studies?
Would it be smarter to drop ME and switch 100% to software engineering instead? 

If I went on with my ME but graduated with a poor GPA , and did the computer science online degree from a rather unheard of university, do you think I would still have chances of landing a good job within comp. sci. ? or would i just be taken less serious &amp; considered as a confused, unfocused person? 
should i just take whatever skills i can get from the studies and focus more on developing a portfolio instead of caring too much about the diplomas?

I don't know what to do",malicoma,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/34bl9k/me_30_f_with_my_roommate_33_f_and_her_boyfriend/,"First of all I live in Germany, in a city where rents are really high, and I cannot afford moving somewhere else, as I will move away in a couple of months, and just need to find a way to cope with their behaviour.

As I have been living in this house, which belongs to my roommate for about one and a half years, a lot has happened in this time- so sorry for the long post.

When I met her she seemed to be really nice, a little shy and somewhat childish sometimes, but nothing too awkward. But then she started telling me a lot of very personal stuff, like her boyfriend wasn't allowed to open his eyes while they had sex- and the'd openly discuss this in the kitchen, while I was cooking next to them. That was one of the first things, that made me wonder.

He wasn't (and still isn't) allowed to sleep in her bed, so he slept on the couch in the living room for more than 9 month after I moved in. To reach both bathroom and kitchen you need to pass the livingroom, so for over 9 month, almost everyday whenever I had to get up, he was there(because he doesn't work at all). I asked her several times when he would finally be allowed to sleep in her bed, because I didn't want to tell her that it is really annoying, if he sleeps there all the time. She didn't get the hint, and one evening, when I was sitting on the couch studying ( I am about to be a child care worker and have to study all the f** time..) he told me, he wanted to sleep, so I have to leave the living room. I told him to sleep in her room then, because I had to study, but he insisted- so I left annoyed as hell. (He doesn't pay a dime, not for rent or anything). So I had to tell her straight in the face that I don't want him to sleep on the couch anymore, and that I don't take his rude behaviour. He even told her that I was annoyed about him, but none of them had one thought, that their behaviour was maybe a little selfish and rude... After we had a long talk she decided to let him sleep in her room, as she has a big attic above her room (with windows and everything, basically the same space I have in my room only mine is a quarter the size hers is, and where I sleep as well). At that point I was already irritated that she wouldn't get anything unless I tell her loud and clear what is wrong. I mean it was nothing she couldn't have noticed herself, wasn't it?

About three month after I moved in my roommate quit her job to get ready for an entrance exam to university. So she told me I should pay my rent cash, so she would get more unemployment benefits, because otherwise she wouldn't be able to pay for the house. She bought the house from money her grandfather gave her, and then raised a credit to renovate the house (while she was at university and she took a year off, and lived off of sickness benefits-to renovate her house...). So to pay for the credit, she told me she needed the money, and I agreed, because obviously I didn't want her to lose the house. She wasn't accepted at university, and she didn't get a job as well. But after about three months she bought herself a fucking piano for about 900 dollar ( 800 €) and I thought what the f. Why do I lie to the welfare agency and commit a crime by paying her rent under the table, when all she does is buy a piano. I felt so betrayed and like she took advantage of me. I don't make any money although I work two days a week and the other three days I am at school ( It is called internship, where you don't earn anything but experience). So because she didn't want to get a job, once again she got a sick note for one year from her doctor, and she lives off of sickness welfare again. I don't get any money from the government, because I am at school- stupid law in Germany- but I still have to pay health insurance which is mandatory. So she basically lives off of my money... She may be dellusional and she told me she had a borderline disorder, which I can confirm, but this doesn't make you that sick, you cannot work at all. She is in a choir, in a band, in a theatre group, she goes to the gym twice or three times a week, she takes singing lessons and is up all day and all night. So in my opinion, if you are able to do all these things- you are able to work as well.  

Now the part that annoys me the most is that they are filthy as hell. They are at home all day ( when they are not in the theatre, choir, gym etc) and they don't even manage to wash their dishes, or put their cooked food into the fridge. They use about 6 rolls of TP in about four days (only if he is there) and when I told her, I would like her to tell him not to use so much toliet paper she said he could use as much as he wanted, because it wasn't something you can dictate someone. I was always the one who bought toilet paper, he stayed over for the weekend, used all ours, left us maybe a pack of handkerchiefs and left. So it was on me to buy new, because as usual she was very busy with her fun activities and didn't manage to buy some. Also they always left their used dishes dirty in the sink, so I couldn't use it unless I washed them. I feel like I have to tell them everything: not to use all the TP, not to leave dirty dishes outside, not to leave the old food in the sink after doing the dishes, to dry the sponge after doing the dishes......... I could go on. But if I tell them, they don't take it serious, I heard them talking about in the kitchen, when they thought I was in my room, and she made fun of it like I was stupid or something. So now I am at a point, where I buy my own toilet paper and hide it from them, I use my own sponge and brush for the dishes and my own dish detergent because they manage to use a whole bottle in one week and the sponges started to mold and stink like rotten. 

I am sorry if this is too long, and if anything is unclear. There are so many other things, that are horrible for me, but I think for the time beeing this is enough. 
I just wanted to ask you guys if I am right feeling used, deceived and treated with no respect at all? And what would you do if you were me? Thank you :)

I just got an internship at a small company in the San Jose area a couple weeks ago. Since it is on such short notice, I have had a very difficult time finding housing and was hoping you guys could give me a hand. I am new to reddit (a friend referred me) so I hope these kinds of posts are allowed. I looked at the links on the side but none of them really helped. 

I have contacted numerous places but all of them are already full or have wait-lists and I need something much soon since I will be heading out there in a couple weeks. I also checked airbnb but it was too pricey and didn't have much luck on craigslist. I am looking for an apartment/studio for around $1000 a month if possible but can spend up to $1400-$1500. Other than that I am not very picky. It just needs to be in the San Jose/Santa Clara area. I would also prefer a furnished place, but it is not a must.

Thank you in advance!"
34bvxr,1,2015-04-29,Car Accident has left me broke- I'm a student - settlement underway. I need help. What can I do?,academiamet,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/34bvxr/car_accident_has_left_me_broke_im_a_student/,"Hi everyone! This is a throwaway account, but I've been a part of this sub for a while. 

Back in October 2014, I was hit by a car while walking in a cross walk. Another car had stopped for me to pass, and an elderly driver wasn't paying attention (?) and hit me. I fractured and broke a few bones in my back, got a concussion, and have a bulging disc. 


At that time, I was a student doing 20 credits and working 2 PT jobs. I was able to return to one job (desk job) a few weeks after the accident, but still haven't returned to job #2, because it’s very physical and requires a lot movement that I still cannot comfortably do. 


Being a student has made getting a new 2nd job impossible, not to mention I can't really give time or energy to any more. I'm still full time in school, I work 1 job, I'm healing from this accident, and working with an attorney over this insurance claim.


Also, as part of my academic plans, I am doing a study abroad this summer. I'm a junior, and will graduate this time next year. If I don't do this study abroad (which is really integral to everything I'm doing in school), it will delay my graduation, and really just be a loss in a lot of ways. I can't imagine working this hard for this opportunity, and then not doing it; I won't be able to do a study abroad if I don't do it now. 


I am working hard to regain my health and stay positive and motivated through all of this. I've already got a history of anxiety and depression. Money was already tight before the accident, and since then I have been tumbling towards financial ruin. 



**What my post is about is school:** I need a co-signer to cover my tuition costs this summer. It would be a private student loan, and the first and only time I'd get one. They don't offer much financial aid for summer semesters and I wasn't able to save any money, because of the accident. I literally have no family to co-sign or offer help; the only family that could co-sign tried, and he was denied as a ""non-credit worthy co-signer.""
I had always planned to get a private student loan to cover the costs of the study abroad, so it's not that I'm being hasty or irresponsible. We were both surprised he was denied, and we both called the lenders to clarify why. I'm a 1st gen college student, I don't have a lot of family, and live about 700 miles away from anyone. I've always been pretty independent and self-reliant. 


A few friends/ parents of friends have offered some $$ towards this summer, which has been incredible. However, I'm still short $4000. I've honestly reached out to just about everyone I know, asking for help. I needed help after the accident, and now I don't know if I can keep up with my school planning with more help. If I don't do this study abroad, I won't get field research and internships done and will not graduate on time. This summer includes over 20 credits in work, and the tuition is only for 6 credits. (It's complicated, but this is a good deal.)



**Basically, here's where I see my situation:**



* I could drop out of school/ for the summer, and try to find work. (My current PT job is a campus job that is only fall/spring. I leave every summer, and come back in the fall. I will be w/o a job next week.) I feel that this is a short term solution to a short term issue. I would incur long term issues that could cost me more money down the line. 
Financial aid comes in again in the fall - I'll be ok financially then, but from May-August, I'm in the hot seat. Getting a summer job could continue to only barely cover bare minimum expenses. Moving “home” isn’t an option. I don’t have any home to go to. This is my home.

* I could keep moving forward in school, and hope that things come together.

* I've applied for all scholarships available, and somehow got 0. I do get some financial aid, but it's not nearly enough. I've exhausted all resources for loans, grants, and scholarships, except a PSLoan.

* I've planned this study abroad very well. It will make me stand out in my profession and in applying to grad schools, and literally everything is lined up EXCEPT for that last $4k. Again, there is no other time to do this. 

* I've asked 4 family members to cosign, and 1 did, being denied. I have no extended family to ask, and no family friends. I'm one of the more responsible people in my family (and I'm one of the youngest.) Friend's families have contributed all they could.

* Financial aid comes in again in the fall - I'll be ok financially then, but from May-August, I'm in the hot seat. 

* There are “pre-settlement loans” available, but the interest is outrageous, and it could really cost me a lot in the long run. I do not know if I’m even eligible for it. If I get any loan, it should be a PSL.


 * *EDIT* I have asked my attorney about a pre-settlement loan, and they said they'll look into my options.

Going on this study abroad is reasonably the best thing to do for myself.



Furthermore, getting a PSLoan would help keep me afloat/ add a cushion to the costs of this accident. Financial aid will come in the fall, so I'll have a cushion then if things continue to be tight. I've got an attorney working on the claim, but this could take 2-8 months, generally. I do not know when it will be settled, I don't know how much I'll get, and I can't count on anything. I’m at such a loss right now.
What can I do? ...Anyone willing to point in the direction of a stranger-loving millionaire? 




**TL;DR: I'm a uni student injured in an accident that lost me a job/ the ability to work and save money. I planned a study abroad for the summer, and if I don't do this, I won't get field research and internships done and will not graduate on time. My credit is ruined, I have no money and now I have no co-singer for a summer loan for the study abroad. What can I do?**

I got one, there was no extra fee or anything, but I was wondering if anyone else has gone through this process. How do you know whether you are accepted or rejected since the page to check status only shows the first application results. 

Also, like many others, I was wondering if I have a chance to get in. I will have a B.S. in CS and a B.S. in Mathematics from University of Maryland Baltimore County. Graduating with ~3.4 overall GPA and a ~3.9 GPA for comp sci. My work experience was only an internship over the summer as an associate web engineer, and a semester of being a peer tutor for a 200 level computer science class."
34bxzh,3,2015-04-29,"I'm a third year computer science student, the semesters are making me increasingly anxious and a stressed out mess. Is this similar for anyone else?",ryman2012,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/34bxzh/im_a_third_year_computer_science_student_the/,"Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, but I just wanted to know if anyone else can relate.

I'm 22, and I've always loved computers and knew I wanted a career in something computer related.

I didn't have high enough marks out of high school to get straight into the comp sci program, so I did economics for a couple semesters. After that I realized I would never enjoy a job in that, so I did what I needed to do and got improved to switch majors.

I sort of lacked motivation for the first little bit, but once I got an internship (that I'm still working at part time, programming), I knew I needed to get through the degree.

My first semester back after a year at the internship just ended, and I'm really scared about my upcoming semesters.

This semester was terrible for me mentally, I was anxious, stressed, always feeling an impeding sense of doom or failure related to school, etc.

I was only taking 3 courses (calc II, databases, and computer graphics), but just the stress of it all gets at me.

The biggest part if just not knowing how your doing, or not doing as well as I wish.

In Calculus II had a final percentage of 51% and in graphics I had 65%. I got a C+ in calc and an A in graphics. The whole semester I was freaking out and worried I was going to fail. I remember for graphics crying on the floor for an hour trying to do a graphics assignment I spent 20 hours on and was stuck.

I'm still working 20 hours a week, but I feel like I need to. I would be so depressed if I didn't have the balance of being able to work, go to school and be social. Sometimes going to work is the only thing that kept me sane from school.

This upcoming summer I can only take one course, Numerical Analysis. My friend just took in and got 40-something percent in the course and ended up with a C+. Its stuff like this that just makes me sick to my stomach knowing I can work my ass off and get terrible percentage marks and then get a C+.

I feel like a large percentage of it is because I don't feel confident in learning and getting help I need. Its just not available. I have the time to put into all this, but I go to lectures and the professors are terrible and I feel like I learnt nothing, I try to go to the 1 hour office hours they have a week (that get cancelled for who knows what reason), and they aren't very helpful. It just feels like I'm always completely on my own to learn things despite paying to at least have someone teach me partially. I understand its how it works, but sometimes I find the lectures to just be waste of my time depending on the professor. I feel like the school can do a way better job teaching than it does.

I only have 2 retakes left, and 50 credits left to graduate, and I'm just not looking forward to the stress and anxiety from all this. I'm terrified I'm going to fail too many things or something and not be able to graduate.

Is it always this stressful?"

December or June graduation?,gooiegoo99,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/34c279/need_some_advice_for_my_future_december_or_june/,"So, here's my story. I'm trying to go the B4 route, and am currently finishing up my third year of college. My aim of course, is to get my 150 credits. I am doing a couple of leadership programs this summer, and I'm hoping this will lead up to an internship for next year, but I'm not getting my hopes up quite yet.

The thing is, I'm being pushed by my accounting advisor to graduate in Dec 2016, as opposed to June 2017 (the end of my 5th year). Also, I have already told both leadership programs that that was when I intend to graduate, at his advice.

However, should I push for Dec, that would require me to take 18 credits for the rest of my college career; something I'm not sure is worth it, as I currently have close to a 4.0, and I don't want to jeopardize that.

So what's the deal, why is the Dec grad so important? Why isn't just (hopefully) interning next summer, and getting an offer for the summer after that good enough? Am I missing something?

thanks for any feedback! I've been lurking here quite some time, and have always appreciated the insight :)"

34ciyk,3,2015-04-29,I disappointed everyone again...,IrateGandhi,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/34ciyk/i_disappointed_everyone_again/,"I'm 24. Male. I live in south Jersey, near Philly. I've been dealing with Seasonal Affect(ive?) Disorder for as long as I can remember. Before 13, I did not know how to express what I was feeling but I did start to realize around that age that whenever it was Fall &amp; Winter, I got sad. And not like normal sad. I was sad for no reason. I was exceptionally sad for valid reasons. Then come the end of February or March, I would get better.

My whole life I have felt like a constant failure. I know some of that has to do with my father not being in my life or growing up in a not so loving environment or being molested as a child or some other concoction of triggers in my environment. Hell, maybe it's just genetic. 

I never did well in school. I'm not a dumb person. I tend to not do very well during those months and it hurts my schooling tremendously. But I cannot think of a single time growing up where anyone really seemed to care about what I was going through, aside from family and a friend or two. I even had to take an english class during night school while going to day school my senior year to graduate high school. I just... never could seem to do ""good enough."" I was always not living up to the worlds expectations.

To keep this from becoming too long, I'll summarize my college experience: it has taken me seven years to get through a four year undergraduate degree. The first 3 years were absolute hell. It was some of the worst times of my life. I stopped attending when it was at its worst. I ended up failing the first 3 semesters of classes. I just could not recover from anything. 

It was at this point that I started to do what I needed to. I would eat healthier. I would sleep how I was supposed to. I would work out. I would stay positive despite all of the negativity around me and within my head. I ended up doing very well pushing myself through the last half of those 3 years at community college. Yes, community college. That place where a full time student should be out within 2 years. I was disappointing a lot of people.

I got accepted, thank God for GPAs that only show the last time you've taken a course, to a Christian University. Due switching majors to Youth Ministry, it was meant to take me 3 years to graduate. I killed the first two years. My depression was at an all time low, even though it was still hard to get through the seasons. I managed to do alright. The fall semester of my ""sr"" year aka year 7 of undergraduate went so well. I did very solid in my courses. I was afraid of what the next semester would bring but again, I stayed hopeful and confident that I could get through it.

This past season destroyed me. Even with a strong friend group, a new loving &amp; supporting girlfriend &amp; a small course load (4 classes, 1 internship, 1 lab, 1 research aid) I could not handle what I had to do. My priorities began to shift, as always. I had to do my best to figure out what mattered the most. Clearly I had to stay as mentally healthy as possible. I had to stay hopeful. I could not disappoint the children at my internship. I could not disappoint my church that I was interning at. I had to make sure my relationships were healthy. I had to do my school work. These were my goals.

More often than not, school would take a hit. It's not that I wouldn't read the material assigned. I would. I would even contribute to dialogue in my classes. It was that I never had time to get my assignments finished. I never handed in the packets that took over 5 hours to do. I never wrote my reading reflections for the books I was reading. I had to eat &amp; sleep &amp; stay sane. I could not afford another total breakdown like those I have experienced in the past.

I ended up sleeping too much. I ended up staying up too late to read. I would miss my morning class. Alright, that happens. The semester went on.

As I was coming out of my season of depression, around Feb, I realized there was no way I could pass one of my classes. It was not a big deal. It was a gen ed. I could take that online or at a community college in the summer. So I gave up trying to pass that class. I had to put my energy into the other classes. 

A prof told me to check out a few places on campus that might be able to help. I went to the proper places on campus to let them know what was going on. I never had anything on record before about SAD. They told me I had to prove I had the disorder but regardless, everything before this paperwork, they could not help me. Despite not liking that that was my outcome, I realize I operate within academia. I have to follow their rules. Even if I disagree with them.

So I went to my doctor. I have not seen my doctor in many years (I cannot afford to go to a specialist). His executive assistance informed that she could not find my records. Discouraged, I decided the best course of action was to work my butt off as best I could. There was no other option.

I do as much work as I can in the time my professors allow me to hand in work.

It is the day of finals week today. I should be graduating next Saturday. I have about 10 days until graduation. I have 6 days until finals are over. But it's not over for me. I won't be graduating.

I got an email from my professor telling me there is no way I can pass his class. I had to get docked a lot of points for the assignments i handed in, and I did not have time to hand everything in. Despite him even telling me my work was excellent, I could do nothing about my grade. He even went as far as to tell me I need a 321 on the final if I wished to pass his course. He called me his brother in Christ. He apologized that there was no way around this. I am a failure yet again.

Here I am. sitting in tears. Still looking at this email feeling helpless and abandoned. I know my professors tried to help me. I know I tried to do what I could. But none of it was good enough. Nothing I have ever done has been good enough. This society has standards I just cannot seem to meet. All I do is periodically bring disappointment onto the ones I love. 

I have no idea how to tell my mother about this. She's already bought her ticket to fly to my University. I do not know if I can even walk. I am meeting with my department chair tomorrow. I still have at least 30 pages to write by tomorrow night. I know I could do it. At the very least, I could hand it all in by Friday and take a few points deduction for a day late. 

I am having trouble seeing the point of finishing right now. Regardless of what I do, I disappoint my friends, my mother, my girlfriend, my professors. Those families that have helped me over the years. I disappoint everyone. I can't even retake this course until next spring. So I have 6-8 months to just hate myself for not being good enough the first time. I have no idea where I will live. I have no idea what type of job I will get while I wait to try to pass this class next year. 

I have so much pain within myself. I am so disappointed that my best was not good enough. It never is. 

I am so sorry everyone. I let you down again.

I am so thankful for my faith right now. I don't know how I'd still be functioning without it. I'm not suicidal at the moment but I know if I didn't believe in a hope for the future, I most likely would have killed myself after I got that email.

ps- Emailing a student like this is probably the worst way to find out. Especially when they have a mental illness history."

I'll hold a B.Sc in Computer Science with a decent GPA. There were quite a few important concepts that went over my head this semester and I've become burnt out due to the difficulty of the subject and several personal issues outside of college.


I intend to take the summer off to take a road trip, maybe go hiking, clear my head while casually learning some of the important topics, such as data structures and algorithms, and do a little development to improve my coding. 


Now, I fully intend to start interviewing in late August or September, perhaps taking some freelance jobs during the summer to sustain my basic needs. I might shoot for an internship to test the waters and pick an area that best reflects my goals in life? I've only done academic research in computer vision and data mining for mobile devices and a few freelance web development gigs.

I am 21, from China, college student, he is 29, real estate agent, American. 

About 4 months ago, I found him cheating after he was being emotionally abusive to me. After many struggles, I agreed to not leave. And now this relationship just feels wrong yet I cannot name what's wrong. I, of course, want this relationship and love him a lot, but...

I feel that he is not putting much effort into the relationship. It feels like he just wants to keep me there until he finds the next best one. I have this feeling because he plays Ingress (a game) and Dota (another game) more than he spends time with me. Also, he would put hours of effort to create a wonderful mission for Ingress game, but I truly forget the last time we did something together besides he had sex with me, played game with me, eating food with me, or sleeping with me. Undeniably, as Chinese, I tend to want guys to initiate events. I, actually, tried to propose some but he was either working, had already had an Ingress playing party (where people play the game together), or ""it is not a good time today"". 

He is also distancing me in a sense... He basically never calls me nor wants to video chats with me, and we can only be physically together at weekends because I have school. He also rarely texts back. Guys like real interaction more, I get it; he also argues that he just texts more often than calls and most of times he just feels he has nothing to say. You may wonder how he got me at the first place if that is him...He was not like this at the first!

He also becomes more silence besides not replying messages or not communicating on a daily bases. He always has this annoying problem that he get distracts very easily during conversations, because he honestly uses distraction as a runaway to deal with the pressures in conversations. I cannot tell enough how annoying this is, and this is becoming worse. He asked me 1 month ago if I wanted to room with him in the summer because he tries to move out from his current place and I will need a place in town for my internship, and I said yes. Now I have to move out from my dorm in 15 days, he still has not acted. (Since he is the real estate agent here, he takes the responsibility to find housing) After many times asking him, finally I said ""do you just not want to live together anymore"" and he EVENTUALLY said YES. I do not understand why he could not just tell me instead of avoiding the question, which causes me much trouble and pressure now. 

He always says he loves me, but I feel that he would only give me some attention from his life when i am physically close to him, when I talk about the potential of having a 3some (yes he DEMANDED for it), or when I cry. He used to give me much more attention if I got upset, and now he just uses silence. This poor communication and the indifference it shows make me feel really difficult about this relationship. 

Now whenever I talk about something, he says I am messing up with his head.

He says he loves me, but I cannot feel it unless I am 1)being extreme 2)talking about 3some or 3)before he wants to have sex with me. 

I do not know what's wrong. I think everything is wrong. I am so upset. Can somebody help me please?"

I am 20 years old and want to be an engineer some day. I haven't quite decided between electrical or biomedical engineering. But that's not my main concern. I'm an electrician apprentice right now, only 6 months in. I've heard that having this practical knowledge will help me in my future with being an engineer. Give me a leg up hopefully.
However, in the 6 months I've been in the program, I have been laid off twice already (both in the last 2 months). First time, I messed up and was gone from work a lot. I was having a hard time deciding if I wanted to actually be an electrician or not. But to make this short, it's probably why I got laid off from the job (not sure though b/c 30-40 other people got laid off and some of them were there everyday working hard.) We were told they just didn't need as big of manpower anymore. Second time happened today. I have to go to school every 8 weeks or so for a one week period. Afterwards I go back to work the following week. Well I was laid off for about 2 weeks before I was called to take this job, and I had a changed attitude when I took it. I didn't want to be that ""missing work guy"" anymore and just wanted to be a good, hard worker, especially if this was really going to help me become an engineer. Well I'm in school this week, and I received a letter of termination and my check. I know the project I was on was supposed to be finished up next week so they probably didn't need me, but it sucks. I'm in the JATC program and we have multiple contractors that take the apprentices to train them. However, one company just laid off 15 apprentices, the company I was working for last just laid off a good amount of people from the job I was on about two weeks ago ( I don't know how many were apprentices), and I got laid off with my company.
Pretty much, this comes down to, is this worth it? I've heard a lot and even read that a trade is a good skill to know. Especially electrician. Too many college students, not enough skilled workers, etc. But will sticking this out really give me a good edge for engineering? I'm attending school this summer to major in electrical, was going to do part-time throughout my apprenticeship and once I journeyed out, I would hopefully get an internship. Anyways, some things I know: 1- I don't want to be an electrician forever. I have asthma and value my health quite a bit. I respect all electricians, but I feel engineering would be better suited for me in the long run. I got into the program b/c my uncle gave me a heads up on it when I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. 2- Even though I don't want to be an electrician my whole life, I still have the goal of being a renaissance man. I want the skills you gain from the electrical field (I like what I'm learning, just don't like the work environment a whole lot), but the knowledge of an engineer. I want to create things to help society. Maybe eventually move into the business world one day. I just want to do a vast amount of things with my life. Multiple page resume if you were.
It's hard for me to know if this trade will truly help me in the long run. I can't plan anything in advance, because I don't know when I'll be laid off. The job roles with the economy. 5 years is a long time to deal with this. I feel I am a good worker, I know I am. I made my mistakes starting out in the apprenticeship, but I know what I am capable of. I'm rambling right now, I'm frustrated. I don't have much money and unemployment can barely cover my expenses. Especially going back to school next month. I can't get a job b/c I would have to leave it the moment the apprenticeship called me. Any advice or encouragement could definitely help right now. thank you. 

tl;dr: want to be an engineer, currently an electrician apprentice hoping practical skills will give me a leg up in the engineering industry, however the stresses and lay offs of the apprenticeship are making me really consider if it's worth sticking out, I do like what I am learning though, just don't like the work environment"

Dear ,

As an avid (blank), I was very excited to learn that an opening for an internship was available for (blank). As a student of public health, I’m very interested and eager to learn more about the position and hopefully get an opportunity to talk face-to-face about it. Going down the list of requirements for the opening- I’m your perfect candidate. If you’re interested in someone who is capable and willing to create original content while searching and reporting related stories while doing interviews to really bring awareness to issues, look no further.

This is the part of my cover letter in which Google is tells me to brag about my accomplishments. Instead of boring you to death with a plethora of bullet points, here are just three (3!) reasons why the jobs that I had make me the ideal candidate for this opening:

I’m highly skilled at communicating with people. My experience with working on a campaign as a volunteer coordinator helped me with dictating and processing information at a rapid pace while maintaining the quality of work that my employers enjoyed.

My work at (blank) gave me a real affinity for charitable work. I say *real* affinity because I’m all too familiar with being able to help one day and forget the next. Long gone are the days that I take my education and family for granted.

Lastly, my work as a receptionist in a residential building taught me more than I could have ever expected. My exceptional logistics and organizational skills are due to managing calls, packages, guests and cleaning at (blank).

All in all, an internship at (blank) feels like a definite step in the right direction for me. I can guarantee you that I want this internship more than any other candidate, and you will be very pleased with the quality of work that I deliver to your team. I hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,

I tried searching around the sub-reddit for something like this, but couldn't find anything in particular.

I'm finding some conflicting info regarding qualifications/job searching results around the web. I've read some stories where people with very reputable Master's degrees(some even with PhD's) in quantitative fields (stats, math, comp sci) with a few years of relevant experience who claim they can't get a job.

Then, there are some who will claim if you have a strong foundation, maybe an advanced degree, and get a couple years of relevant internships/positions, you should be set to make your way into the field.

For those who have gone through the process, what do you think is reasonable to expect for those who are trying to get into the field? Also, I'm wondering what is meant by ""Entry Level"" data science positions. Are we talking actual positions titled data scientist, and if so, I don't seem to see many of these positions that are entry level. Or are we maybe talking positions like ""quantitative analyst"" or ""data analyst""

Obviously there is no formula. A degree from X university and 3 years on your resume won't give you a data scientist job at some great company, and countless other factors (connections, interview skills, etc.). But I'm just wondering what some people's experiences might have been like. Let me know what you guys think!


(My story: Getting a Master's in Applied Stats at a very reputable university this year; not much professional experience but will try to get a good internship this year; have just begun learning python)

I've been dating my boyfriend for 2 years, most of which has been long distance. We see each other maybe once every two months and have spent winter/summer breaks together, since we're from the same town and I go home during break.

I took a gap year before college, so I'll still be in school for another year. At this point, I just don't know if I'm sure about this relationship anymore. I'll be interning this summer starting the first week of June and will be working through August, before I get back to school. 

Some potential areas of concern:

- I wanted to travel with him somewhere, anywhere, during May but he didn't seem very interested and shot down all my ideas (I did a bunch of research that was time consuming). Now, he tells me that he wants to travel in July with his friends and he'd love for me to come but I've already committed to my internship so I obviously can't take time off during it. He knew this and knew that the reason I wanted to go on vacation with him during May was because that was the only time I'd be free for the summer. I feel frustrated because I want to spend as much time with him as possible, since the only extended time we get to spend together as a non-long distance relationship is the summer months, and would feel guilty about traveling somewhere on my own without him in May but he doesn't seem to feel guilty about traveling without me.

- He is a self-declared gifting failure but doesn't understand that when you only start to think about what to give someone the week of a holiday or their birthday, you're stuck with limited options. Based on advice from this subreddit, I actually had a conversation with him about things like gifts and surprises, and he just said he knows and is really bad at these things.

- I feel like by repeatedly telling me how bad he is at being emotionally supportive, giving gifts, planning dates, and how he hates surprises, he's trying to lower my expectations for him. He used to be really thoughtful in the beginning of our relationship and that's who I fell in love with, not him in his current state of being so comfortable in the relationship that he doesn't feel like he needs to put in any effort.

- I've tried to get him to put in more effort into our relationship and it works for a week or so, but then he falls back in his groove of being comfortable in the relationship. I'm sick of having these conversations and feel like I'm a needy and demanding girlfriend, so my current mindset is to scale back how much effort I put into the relationship to match the level of his effort. It's not working well and I just don't know if I should stay in this relationship.

tl;dr: Boyfriend does his own thing in our LDR and I don't know if I should tough it out anymore"
34dm4w,3,2015-04-30,Ideas for professional work/development and learning new skills while traveling in Latin America,biiiotch,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/34dm4w/ideas_for_professional_workdevelopment_and/,"Hi all! I am 26, higher education/outreach/recruitment professional looking to change industries, degrees in economics and philosophy, quitting my job to travel and work abroad for a while.  


I am planning a (roughly) 6 month trip throughout Central and South America right now. Rather than it being a 6 month vacation, I want to be working and developing experience and skills that will 1) help me hone in on a career path, and 2) be useful to potential employers upon my return. While I am completely open to (and plan to do some) manual labor, hostel work, etc, I would like to also do work that might apply more closely to a career, whatever that career may be. I am also interested in learning skills that might not directly relate to my career though (like WWOOFing to learn carpentry or cheesemaking).  

&amp;nbsp;

**Industries of interest:**  
They are a bit all over the place, which is why focusing in on interests is one of my goals for this trip. They include but are not limited to: public policy, international economics, writing, journalism, development (more on the quantitative side) and microfinance, film production and broadcast media, communications and marketing, outreach, start-ups (more specifically within the sharing economy, companies like airbnb and uber), music, restaurants/beverages/wineries, and of course, travel and tourism.    

&amp;nbsp;

**My plans so far:**  
I am spending 1.5-2 months in Costa Rica doing a language immersion program and working on helping to build ecolodging/helping with the farm in exchange for room and board. One of my big goals for this trip is to improve my Spanish greatly.   



After that I will make my way down to Chile/Argentina (I want to travel through Cuba, Brazil, and Peru in particular). I haven't nailed down concrete plans for Chile/Argentina. I am strongly considering trying to do a work exchange on a vineyard/winery in Mendoza. I am also reaching out to an old professor who heads a microdevelopment organization in Chile to see if they need help. I definitely want to see Patagonia, but that will most likely be a trip that's just for fun. I also want to spend some time in Buenos Aires, but am unsure of what I would do there in terms of work. Like I said, I'm still in the initial stages of planning these countries so I have nothing concrete at this point, but I would be very interested in doing some sort of internship/work in addition to working on the vineyards.  

After that I am also considering going over the Italy and Spain. There are some WWOOFing places I want to check out in Tuscany that include vineyards, and I plan to research work/internship opportunities in Barcelona.   

In my spare time, especially while in more rural areas, I plan to further develop my skills with Adobe Creative Suite, learn some more video production, web development, and write a LOT (possibly freelance some articles). I'm also considering developing some sort of project I can carry throughout the trip, whether it just be a simple blog, or a video project, or a full research project.    

&amp;nbsp;

I am really open to anything! The background was just to give you a general idea of my interests and plans, but in the end what I'm really trying to accomplish with this trip is to learn new skills, gain new experiences, and do interesting work, regardless of what type of work it is or what industry it's in. I have some money saved up, but for the most part I'm not looking to spend money on work/volunteer programs unless they're extremely valuable. I'm hoping to mostly work in exchange for room and board.  

I would love to hear any ideas you have about programs, ways to find internships or more professional or skill-based work exchange programs, or some ideas of skills I could build up based on the regions I plan to visit.  

Thanks!

So my options are, comp sci major with minor in applied/computational math, or applied/computational math with cs minor.

A little bit about the programs, the computational math degree is about 1/3 pure math (analysis, abstract algebra, etc), 1/3 stats (probability/stats/more advanced stats courses), and 1/3 applied/computer based math (PDEs, differetnial equation simulation, numerical analysis, scientific computing, etc). 
Computer science is split between programming related courses (data structures, software engineering, a general languages course), part math (discrete, stats, and algorithms), part hardware/low level (MIPS assembly, courses over building virtual machines to parse languages, and operating systems). 

I am currently computer science but am considering switching. With the minor in CS I will have taken data structures, software engineering (goes over design patterns, unit testing, etc), discrete math, and algorithms. So I will be left out of the language parsing, virtual machine interpreting, and low level assembly courses. 

So my question is, if I want a typical software engineer job would the math degree + comp sci minor cut it? I have one internship as a software engineering intern, and I am looking to find another internship next summer. I feel that I will have a solid foundation for programming (through software engineering, algorithms, and data structures) and will be able to code general software. I am not looking for an intense compiler building job, or embedded systems, just a typical java developer, or ruby on rails, something like that. I have been doing programming as a hobby for awhile and I feel that most of what will make me a better developer is going to come from experience building software. I feel that I am kind of missing out on being able to learn something really interesting to me (math), by continuing on into parts of CS I am not particularly interested in, and may not even need much familiarity with. If it makes sense, math is what I want to study, but software engineering is what I want to do as a career. Any advice? Can I make this happen?

34e0ke,3,2015-04-30,"Me [24 M] with my Girlfriend [22 F] of almost 3 years are fizziling, need to get her back.",imlosingher,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/34e0ke/me_24_m_with_my_girlfriend_22_f_of_almost_3_years/,"Okay so a little background. I met her around the beginning of my last year of my undergraduate degree. She is awesome and super outgoing, very passionate, was always super nice to me and made me feel wanted. We went on a few vacations together, basically stayed with each other every night (we lived down the street from each other) and really clicked. Shes really good friends with all of my friends, and gets along very well with my family.  About almost a year after being together I had to move 2.5 hours away to go to grad school. This has worked great for the past 1.5 years. We switch up driving and staying at each others places over the weekends, we talked constantly and everything was great, it was working. 

I have a few weeks of this semester left, and will be moving closer to her for an internship, only about an hour and 15 minutes away, much easier of a drive. I'll be there till the end of the year, go back to school (2.5hrs away) for a final classroom semester of work in the spring and be done in May, most likely will be getting a full time position at the internship. 

We started having problems about 3 weeks ago, or at least its problems that I've seen. I don't think that i've helped myself at all, and feel like these problems are my fault, because abotu 2-3 months ago I was having doubts in the relationship. Nothing changed in her, it was just me thinking if its right and all that stuff. When I was with her I was kinda distant, our conversations were dry, I turned down sex, but I still felt something from her. All this changed for me and I realized what a fucking moron I am, and that she really is amazing, and that I really love her and that I would do anything for her. My spark for her came back. 

And right about the time that came back, hers left. 

We barely speak, our conversations are always the same on the phone, and when we're together she gives me no affection. I'm scared to even touch her, let alone try to kiss her or initiate anything more. I try to have good conversation with her and she just kills it. When ever i'm with her I feel like i'm being more of a burden and am annoying her. And that she's always mad at me about something. We used to go out and it would be fun and we'd flirt and all that, but now its just her feeling annoyed and wanting to go home. I've been going to her for the past 4 weeks, and each time i've been seeing her less and less. 

I finally had enough, and asked her whats going on. She said that spark and affection just isnt there anymore, and that its just different, and she doesn't feel the same, and that we're not flirty and fun like we used to be. She says she still loves me, and wants to fix it. But we don't know how. She suggested a break. A break where we'd still be together, and still talk, but just not see each other. I don't know how this will help, since we're already distance already, but i'm willing to give anything a shot. 

Recently when talking to her she's been contradicting herself about what shes been doing. Saying she woke up at 930 and going to the doctor at ten, then saying she woke up at 8 and worked on a homework assignment then went to the doctor, shit like that. She's also been going out more often than she usually does. Last night she ignored me. Read my messages and didn't reply, let my calls go to message. My mind is racing. I don't know what to do, I don't know what to thing, I don't know if there's someone else. I feel like everything I say and ask her digs this hole deeper.  I want this to work so badly, and she's told me she does to, but how can we fix this? 









   
**tl;dr**: Been together almost 3 years, I moved 2.5 hours away for school after about a year, and have been fine and working out, until about a month ago, where my feelings fizzled, but resurfaced right around the time hers was fizzling. I'm losing her and I need to get her back. I'm still in it, and she says she is. "

Where?",Sentient64,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/34e8s2/international_internship_in_computer_science_all/,"Hey there, I'm a Computer Science student at Kuwait University. I know it's most likely way too late for this summer (in case it's not, I'll take my chances in applying), but I want an internship where all expenses are paid and anywhere in the world is fine as long as it's safe, and preferably U.S, Canada, or Europe. I heard Dubai houses internships as well, but I cannot pay for my own stay there, it's too expensive for my barely-existing budget. So I'm hoping they pay for the expenses.

I'm really hoping that the company would give *me* money after the internship is over. I'm an absolute noob in this topic, so please excuse my ignorance."
34ee4a,15,2015-04-30,Lingering Questions post Dr. Phil Interview,birdsofterrordise,BravoRealHousewives,https://www.reddit.com/r/BravoRealHousewives/comments/34ee4a/lingering_questions_post_dr_phil_interview/,"Let's discuss the lingering questions post Dr. Phil.

* How long was Dr. Phil kept waiting?
* Timeline. I'd like to see a visual of that. Maybe I will make one when I am done with my last paper today.
* Where did she get the vodka in the first place? Did her daughter just have some in her apartment and think her mom was ""strong in her sobriety""?
* Do HWs actually write their blogs? They don't just talk to an intern who writes them for them?
* It would be gauche, but I'd like to hear from that random couple she was talking to. What the hell was that about?
* She has a table/booth at this place? Does this mean she goes there often? Is there drinking maybe more than we have heard about?
*  Why in the hell would you go to a bar if you are recovering? Even if you went there as a kid and have memories there? Why not just, sit in a McD's or something?
* Furthermore, you usually feel alcohol a lot quicker than pills or other drugs...at least in my experience. Unless it is like heroin or meth. Questioning if it is alcohol or a combo.
* Exercise is good, but is not exercising really the problem here?
* Her Character Kim doesn't drink and is sober. But Real Life Kim has been drinking and is not sober. Does she realize the difference between CK and RLK?
* Did the rehab place she checked into adhere to all her demands? Will that help her be successful/not successful? (She apparently reneged on Dr. Phil's ~~show sponsor~~ recommended facility.) 

I hope there is some kind of follow up and she gets better. The murder of her fiance sounds brutal as hell, the death of her mother clearly affected her, and the stress of being a caregiver is a lot.  But you can't be a good caregiver if you are out of it, not sober, etc. and she has to be honest with herself. =/"
34ei8q,9,2015-04-30,"Why I'm ""Crazy""",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/34ei8q/why_im_crazy/,"I need to start to live for now. I think the only way to do that is to air out my past – to lay the pain out on the table, cards exposed. I have a way with people – the way is “I’ll give you some of me, but you can’t have all of me.” It’s been my protection to wall pieces of myself off so they can no longer bring me pain. But that method only works for so long. Eventually it all comes welling up and if you open up to take a small peek it all comes out at once – it’s spewing, bubbling, boiling. It’s so painful that at times you feel like you may actually die.  

	I don’t have many good memories of my dad. The few decent things I can remember were taking turns reading chapters of Nancy Drew books together or going fishing. The rest of my memories are pretty sad. They are filled with years of mental abuse and a couple of instances of actual physical abuse. He was an angry person and based on my most recent interaction with him – he still is. 

My most vivid memory (not just of him but in general) was of him placing bruises all over my mother’s body in the kitchen of our old house after she had given him divorce papers. I remember her breaking the window and screaming out for help.  And I remember standing there, watching, unable to do anything for her. My older sister made it to the phone and called the police and they came to take him away.  The police only held him overnight but by that time we had cleared out and been taken to a battered women’s shelter.  I can’t remember how long we were there – it must have been at least a few months. I watched the 2000 presidential election and spent a Thanksgiving and a Christmas in the shelter.  We were enrolled in a nearby public school and my sisters and I took the bus to and from the shelter. I was ashamed to be picked up and dropped off there – even more so when a boy on the bus pointed out that I was getting off at a shelter for women and the majority of the bus laughed.  My shame was so great that I would spend the weekend dreading going to school and had a routine of being sick on Mondays (sometimes I was actually sick and other times it was an act). I constantly tried to hide, to make myself small, to go unnoticed. I became somewhat of an expert in that aspect so much so that at times I feel that way even today – without even really trying.

When did we leave the shelter? I don’t remember. I know my mother waited until she had a restraining order out against father (currently having issues writing the “D” word – bear with me). We went back to the house. My mom had us stay in the car while she went in to make sure he wasn’t there. That moment was extremely nerve-wracking – once again we were powerless to do anything should anything have happened to her. I later learned she entered the house well armed (you go, mama).

	My timeline is screwed up this point forward and some things are blurry, but I’ve tried to put it back as logically as possible. The restraining order didn’t seem to last that long. Before long, they were legally separated and he got us for weekends. I don’t think I ever felt safe during those weekends. Soon enough, he weaseled his way back into the house. I don’t think mom felt financially stable to take care of 4 girls all on her own. He was decent for a while. But it seems angry people can only hide for so long. Eventually something will trigger them back to their old ways. I’m not sure what the trigger was, but he started drinking, gambling, cursing more, etc. I saw the changes. I saw the anger coming back. Every time I would speak to him, he would put me down and make me feel like I was not good enough. So I did the only thing I could think of to protect myself. I stopped talking to him. I became unresponsive to questions/conversations.  I would wake up hours before him in the mornings to get ready for school and then crawl back into bed when I heard him waking up only to get up again and continue my routine once he left for work.  There were always a few hours after school when he was not there but as soon as I heard him coming home I would go into my room and hide in my closet with a book or magazine or homework and stay there until I knew he was settled on the couch in the living room for the night.

I became his target for anger. If he had a bad day, he would take it out on me – verbally abusing me. He would say things like, “You used to be so smart” or “you’re not a good daughter” or “you should be punished for acting like this,” etc. Even his jokes were jabs at me. He would constantly pick at me just to get a response. I continued my routine of not speaking to him. I would not give him the satisfaction of a response from me. Not even when he made claims that he loved me. I was past the point of loving him. He had done too much, caused too much pain, shown his true colors. He was not going to change. 

His anger at me reached a high point the beginning of the summer before my junior year of high school.  I remember getting up early before anyone else that morning and starting up the computer. Maybe 15 minutes later, I heard him starting to stir in the next room. Instead of going to hide like I usually did, I decided to stay on the computer and continue doing whatever I was doing. He stopped on his walk past me to the restroom, stared at me for a few seconds, and said, “love you.” I didn’t respond. I didn’t believe it. And what happened next proved that I was right. After a few seconds of silence and of me staring pointedly at the computer, I was hit clean out of my chair.  He had punched me in the nose with a closed fist. The disturbance woke my mother and sisters. I spent a few moments in my room crying and then made the decision to leave. I pulled out a suitcase and packed all that I would need for the summer (I had an internship that was starting in a month’s time at NASA). My mother and sisters were crying as I put my things in the car, but they never asked me to stop and stay. I had to get out and they knew it. My dad told me I wouldn’t be able to find a place to go and if I did I would just be a burden on them so I might as well stay. 

I didn’t know where to go from there, so I just went to the local park and sat under a tree for a little while. I had to find a place to stay because there was no way I was going to go back to that. I knew it would only get worse if I allowed him to hit me and then submit to staying under his roof. I watched it happen with my mother. I called a friend and she and her father came to talk to me. They knew an older couple that had a place in the country. I stayed with them for the month I was waiting for the internship to begin. I did everything I could to prevent myself from becoming a burden but they never made me feel like I was a problem. They enjoyed my company and I enjoyed theirs. I wish I could remember their names so I could say thank you to them today. (In my attempts to forget about my past, I suppose I suppressed their names as well – certainly makes me feel guilty).
	
The summer internship passed. I heard from my mom that he was starting to lash out at my older sister. He found a different target while I was gone. I felt guilty and afraid he would do physical harm to my mom and sisters with me gone. When the internship was over, I went back home. Things were “normal” that school year as far as I can remember; it was back to not speaking to hiding when he woke up or got home. The end of the school was approaching when I heard him say something threatening to one of my sisters. I told him that if he did anything to her, I would call the police (something that should have been done many times before).  He went red in the face, stood up quickly, and yelled, “The day you turn 18, get out of my house!” My 18th birthday was less than a week away. I don’t remember how long it was after this that my mom finally gave him papers again. But I know he was finally gone for much of my senior year.
	
There are more memories than these. There were several instances of holes being placed in walls by fists and thrown objects. There were times when my mother was pushed down. There was a lot of drinking and a lot of gambling. There were many instances where I begged my mom to divorce him again. To have someone there so he couldn’t hurt her again. I don’t remember all off it. Bad memories become blurry and out of place when you keep them locked away for too long.
	
My first year of college was pretty good as far as memories go. It wasn’t until my sophomore year that the next terror came in. I hadn’t dated at all during high school or my freshman year and by the beginning of my sophomore year I tried to open myself up to more possibilities. Sadly, the first possibility wasn’t so great. I went to a party hosted by some friends I had met in the dorms. I drank way too much and ended up being followed downstairs by a guy while I was helping friends clean up. I remember him kissing me continuing to follow me around. Not that I minded, someone was actually giving me attention for once. But I felt something was off about him. I begged one of my friends to drive me home so I could get away from him. The next morning I woke to a text from him asking me when we were going to hang out. I didn’t even remember giving him my number. (This would be at least one good reason for why I tend to steer clear of alcohol, kids).  I didn’t oblige at first, but he convinced me to meet him because I had “promised” the night before that we could go out. (I’m currently screaming at myself, “damn, you dumb push-over.”)
	
We saw each other several times. We went on a few dates. I introduced him to my friends and he introduced me to his. But I was clear on one thing with him – I was going to remain a virgin. One night, we were alone in my apartment and put in Hercules (don’t ask why I remember the movie…). He was lying on the couch and I was sitting in the chair next to him. I went to lie down next to him on the couch. The next thing I knew I was being forced down. He held my head back and forced oral sex on me. I was paralyzed with fear. I could do nothing to save myself. He was much stronger than me and if I fought back I was afraid he would do worse to me. So, I let it happen.  Afterwards, he went into my kitchen and started eating my roommate’s food while I cleaned up the mess he had left all over my couch and me. He left soon after that. Again, I’m not sure of the chain of events from this point until we finally cut contact with each other. All I remember was a final text from him, “I’m deleting your number. Enjoy your couch stain.” Needless to say, that was the first and last bit of dating I did for several (3?) years.
	
It may surprise some that this next part is the most painful for me currently. About a year and a half ago, I finally met someone I could be with. I don’t think I can go into too many details without having yet another emotional breakdown. Even now tears are starting to flow.  He quickly learned about all of the aforementioned pains. He was the first and only person who knew all of these things. He was a comfort when they were hurting me and he was the protection and happiness that prevented me from hurting. I’d never loved someone before. I gave him every bit of me. Heart, soul, body…all of it was his. But he was screwed up too. Not even 6 months into our relationship, he cheated on me with one of his friends. I knew he was starting to act strange. Whenever he spoke of his friends he would call them by name but he never said her name to me when he talked about her – she was just “one of my friends.” He started taking more trips to his hometown to visit his friends and many of these trips turned into trips to the town where she lives.  I’m not giving tips to possible cheaters, so don’t ask how I knew. Anyway, none of this proved he had cheated. I called him the night I saw he was in in her hometown to see what was going on, he played dumb saying he had been in his hometown for the day until I told him I saw that he had been in her hometwon. He became frustrated and asked me why I didn’t trust him (btw I learned this was AFTER he had cheated on me that he made me feel guilty for not trusting him). I dropped it for the night, but he was still acting shady in the days that followed. He stayed the night with me and the next morning I gathered the courage to finally find out what was going on. I looked on his phone at the messages he had with her and found out very quickly that he had slept with her.  I woke him up and asked him to be honest with me and asked if he had slept with her. He said no. I showed him the message I found. To day, I wish I had let him run like he tried, it would have saved me a lot more pain. But instead I asked him to stay and explain himself. He told me he had gone into our relationship expecting it to end and that he had never felt like he loved me (despite saying those three words to me almost every day). I found out from her that he had told her we had broken up the night they slept together. We never broke up as far as I knew. His excuse was that he was seeing our relationship in black and white, like it was over before it was actually over. 

I can’t go into the years worth of on again off again rollercoasters we went through after all of this. It was exhausting. I could never trust him and he was unwilling to help me trust again. I wanted so desperately for things to go back to what they had been before he had cheated. I wanted the bliss back of having that person who I loved, who loved me back, who made me happy, who made me feel comfortable and safe.  The rollercoaster was finally too much a few months ago. He instead said that he wanted us to be friends. I accepted this. I couldn’t take the pain of the back and forth. There were periods that we couldn’t be around each other because it was difficult to get over the physical aspects and the feelings we still had. I had several moments where I asked him to leave me alone for a while. Up until the last one he said the same thing, “I understand. I’ll be around when you change your mind.”

He made a promise to be my friend. I was okay with that because I needed that person in my life that knew why all of these parts of me were broken and still accepted me.  But now he doesn’t speak to me. I’ve become wild with finding a way to get him to speak to me. I’ve texted, called, emailed, etc. I’ve even driven to his house on a few occasions in moments where I couldn’t take it anymore. He ignores my very existence. The pain of him cheating and lying to me was nothing compared to losing his friendship. My safe place has been ripped away from me. With him all of the emotions stayed on the surface. They were in clear sight but they were manageable because I knew I had someone who cared for me and understood me. Now that I have opened the door for these pains and he is lost everything is bubbling over. The pain is unstoppable – it bombards me daily. It is scalding hot and a mess. One I cannot seem to clean up. This loss has placed some terrifying thoughts in my head. If I’ve lost him, what is stopping me from losing the next one who comes along? This is the fear that had driven me the past few months to try every way I can think to get him (not him, but that protective figure) to come back around.  Every attempt is a disappointment that leads to even more terrifying thoughts. I’ve thought of cutting myself, hanging myself, overdosing on pills, driving my car into a body of water or a tree, etc.

I cannot have a place of safety in someone who does not care for me.  I’ve wanted to crawl back into myself. I want to hide it all away. But clearly, hiding is no longer the answer. I need the people in my life to understand what I am going through. I need to stop hiding. I need to get better. The answer is not to confide in just one person or to confide in only myself. It is to confide in all. I’m showing the hand I’m playing with, terrifying as that is.
I’ll focus on what I do have. I have a wonderful mom, sisters, stepfather, stepbrothers, and other relatives. I have the best roommate and friend I could ask for – I know I’ve been worrying/frustrating you lately. I have friends both near and far – at work, school, here, back home, and scattered throughout the country. I have a wonderful guy I am dating. I’ve been afraid of getting close to you for fear that I would only lose again. This is an attempt to prevent the fear of loss from holding power over me any longer.  I am smart and capable. My Master’s degree is coming along and I am able to continue learning. I may have had difficultly keeping focus this semester due to everything that is going on in me, but I know I can finish and do well with it. I have a wonderful future ahead (wherever/whatever that may be) and I will continue working toward it.

TL;DR - dealt with mental and physical abuse from my father, rape, cheating boyfriend, loss of loved ones - can't deal with it myself anymore.

34epju,2,2015-04-30,[Web Development] Server migration testing stage: scripts/robots to test web applications?,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/34epju/web_development_server_migration_testing_stage/,"Hello, I am a computer programming student working my first internship. I guess I'm interested in going the 'extra mile' and being impressive. :-) 

We just migrated our intranet from one server to another. This involved changing from Windows Server 2003 to 2008, and also upgrading our platform from ColdFusion 7 to ColdFusion 8.

There are multiple web applications that pull from many different databases of different types. We've clicked around on the site and everything looks good so we've asked the departments that use the intranet to assign a group of test employees to use the new site for a couple weeks. 

I was wondering if there's some program I can make use of that would 'click through' our multiple applications and spam them with different query parameters to try to produce errors. If I would have to write such a thing myself, how would I go about doing that? (I know it probably wouldn't be worth the time at this point, just curiosity)"

She made it all the way to her second year of college without ever having a job, and applied to a sports bar down the road on a whim and was immediately brought on as a server, with no prior experience. While there she made *fantastic* money (two, three times what I get paid) and made a couple key connections towards internships with customers. 

Meanwhile, I've been consistently working whatever shitty minimum wage job I can find just to pay bills since my senior year of high school. I've been working for three years and have held a few miscellaneous low-paying jobs as I've moved around - grocery store cashier, delivery driver, ice cream scooper... - and in general have only ever been able to land shitty ""small-time"" jobs that don't pay well and have no opportunities for advancement. After seeing my girlfriends success with serving, I applied to a *ton* of nearby restaurants, and I *really* went all out and did it well. Full application, resume, cover letter, sharp attire, researched the company, made jokes with interviewers...Fucking nailed it every time. 

But no call back. I didn't get a call back from anywhere I applied. Only after I went back a week later to one restaurant did they offer me a part time position bussing tables, and at that point I had to take what I can get.

But then this week, my girlfriend randomly decided to apply to one of the restaurants I never got a call from, and, wouldn't you know it, they called right back the next day.

So now she will be making even *more* money at an even *nicer* restaurant while I'm still stuck being someone's bitch for 8 or 9 dollars an hour.

I feel like I'd have an easier time accepting it if my girlfriend had worked in the restaurant industry for some time before serving, but it kind of makes me jealous and slightly resentful that she could land two serving jobs back to back first try (with no experience), when I couldn't get shit even after a dozen tries.

And since it will inevitably come up, she is a little prettier than me (as most girls are) but we are both just normal, decent looking people who are relatively successful and liked in the other areas of our lives, so I don't believe there is any huge difference in our relative ""hireability"".

I feel bad for being jealous, and I don't feel negatively towards her, but I just feel a little shafted in general. 

**TL;DR:** Been working shitty jobs for 3 years, girlfriend lands 2 sick jobs in a row with no work experience. Am jelly.
What do?

**EDIT:** Okay, I hate to be the dude that includes a ""downvotes, really?"" edit, but at this point every comment I've made is sitting 7 or 8 points in the negative. Am I really that much of an asshole? I get that the things I'm saying are pretty grouchy things, but does the fact that I'm having this discussion with you guys, not her count for anything? I came here to vent and to talk about the way I feel in my relationship and how to cope with that, but for the most part all I'm getting is people telling me I'm a dick for feeling the way I do.

Truthfully, is how I'm feeling *that* terrible? I don't think I said a single negative thing about my girlfriend, and I was sure to stress the fact that inside I am actually *really* happy for her. 

Thanks so much to those with legitimate suggestions and words of wisdom.

34ex3i,6,2015-04-30,Internships for Networking?,0ut1awed,NetworkingJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/NetworkingJobs/comments/34ex3i/internships_for_networking/,"So I'm at a real loss of where to look for networking internships. 

I'm majoring in IT at UNCW but my real passion is networking. I'll be the first to admit that my actual schooling is doing very little education wise within networking. I was in an entry level Cisco course this previous semester and had finished all the material by spring break. I took the final and was allowed to move onto the second course which I will be finishing very soon. I've even signed up for the third course as an independent study with the professor over the summer. I actually wired my whole multistory house (with the permission of the landlord of course) with CAT5e and had it terminate into a closet where I have deployed a full enterprise network for my home including a Cisco router, switch, and AP. I've documented this whole process on a blog which I have on my resume. I should be taking the ICND1 within the month.

However I know experience is everything and I'm really worried about getting my foot in the door initially. The only kind of jobs I've held in the past have been within the resturant industry so an internship seems critical to bridge the gap. I'll be a senior in the fall  so this summer is probably my last chance for any kind of internship before I graduate. I've been to my career center but they haven't been too helpful. They post up jobs all the time for IT students but again networking isn't a huge player in the program so none of the jobs seem very relevant to it at all. I live in Wilmington, NC so any opportunities in the RTP area are very plausible but I'm just at a loss of where to go and how to handle it.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciate. Thanks!"

More info in description",yosepp1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/34f377/finding_a_job_after_college_with_a_comp_sci/,"I am currently a sophomore in college. Starting next semester I will be doing the Computer Science major in which I will be learning to program in Java. Right now, I am learning C++ hoping that by the time my classes start I will be able to make simple programs. After I feel comfortable in C++, I plan to move on to Python. If all goes well, I will graduate in 2 years with my degree in Computer Science, knowing the languages Python, Java, and C++. My question is, is that a decent combination? I am interested in Video Game design but I´m not hell-bent on it. My main hope is to find a decent entry level job. I will be looking for a summer internship during my senior year to help my chances.

TLDR: My 4 questions

    Is Java, C++ and Python a good combination of languages?
    Could someone give a very rough estimate of what entry-level salary I might make knowing C++, Java, and Python? (Rough because I know there are many other factors that determine that number)
    What might be my responsibilities in a job I might find? Could I be using all 3 languages at the same time or might I never use one of them again, like if I go into gaming and not use Java.
    What are my chances of finding a job right out of college, if I have a decent GPA (let's say 3.7 in the major)?

34f3oz,430,2015-04-30,"UPDATE: Ubloo, Part Four",DifferentWind,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/34f3oz/update_ubloo_part_four/,"[Part Three](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/33lwen/ubloo_part_3/)

I paced across my hotel room swirling a glass of gin, lost in thought. Tomorrow I had a meeting with the Louisiana Bank to view the old school that Robert Jennings had looked into. When I told them I was interested in buying the place they were a little surprised, and when I heard there was next to no interest in the place, I was surprised as well. The house, albeit dilapidated and in need of repair, was beautiful. The woman I spoke with on the phone informed me that the school had become somewhat of a local spook story for the townspeople. It was shut down when the funding ran out, and a lot of the students and their families were really upset with how the local government had chosen to send them elsewhere rather than provide additional funds. After that it went on the market, but I guess no one felt quite right about taking something that had done such good for those children. Fast forward a few bad storms and no maintenance later and the place had become a paranormal attraction, although no real activity had ever been documented there.

I took a long sip of gin and gulped it down. I couldn’t believe how accustomed to this shit I’ve become. While I wasn’t much of a drinker before, I had always had a taste for whiskey. Now this is all I can drink.

The hotel room I was staying in was dark and musty. My bank account was starting to run low now that I’ve been living without income for more than two months, and I couldn’t afford to spend lavishly. I thought about writing some prescriptions and selling them but I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. While the money would be great to have, I refused to turn my back on who I used to be. Who knows? Maybe this school will offer some new information I could use to possibly kill Ubloo. Kill? I shook my head. It’s a fucking voodoo curse, how do you even kill something like that?

I put my hands against my dresser and leaned forward over my glass of gin, watching the ice cubes bobble and clink against the sides.

“Doctor.”

It came from behind me. I spun around so fast I nearly fell, and my eyes had to adjust to the rapid movement. Before me, someone was beginning to come into view.

It was Andrew.

We stood there and stared at each other. He had on a plain black shirt and jeans. His hair was messy and tangled, and his once familiar bright green eyes were replaced by balls of pure white.
“Doctor, why are you here?” He spoke again.

My words caught in my throat, but finally I managed to push them out.

“I’m trying to find a way out, Andrew. I’m trying to beat it. I’m trying to beat Ubloo.”

Andrew slowly shook his head at this.

“You can’t beat Ubloo, Doctor. You can’t.” He said. “Ubloo is always there, always waiting, always watching.”

We stood in silence, my stomach churning in depression and nervousness.

“Well I have to try Andrew.” I finally spoke. “I have to try, because I can’t let this happen to someone else, I just can’t.”

And then I saw it. It slunk out of the shadows behind Andrew with slow, almost clumsy movements. Its skin was slick and gray, pulled taut against his body, and I saw every bone and muscle twitch and move as it hobbled over on its six long legs. It had to be at least six feet tall, probably more, and this was hunched down on its knees. Its big round head and those deep black eyes stared right into me. While it had no pupils I could tell it was watching my every move, examining me. The long trunk that dangled from its head swayed back and forth as it walked, as if it hung limp. It stopped just behind Andrew as he began to speak again.

“It will happen to someone else Doctor.” His white eyes staring right at me. “There is only one way out now.”

Ubloo’s trunk reached up and pressed itself to Andrew’s ear. I then saw its long, thin black tongue emerge from Andrew’s nose and he let out a shrill scream.

I covered my ears with my hands and slumped down against the dresser.

“NO! STOP IT!” I screamed, but to no avail.

Andrew’s flesh began sloughing off his bones in sloppy chunks, dripping like candlewax and exposing his skeleton and muscle tissue. He continued screaming as his body turned to a soupy pile at his feet. I watched as his face melted and revealed his jaw bone, and then I heard a sharp twang and saw his jaw muscle snap, and the bone fall crooked at an angle, all the while screaming in agony.

“PLEASE! I CAN’T! I JUST CAN’T ANYMORE! END THIS PLEASE!”

And with that Andrew stopped, his jaw still hung open. He was nothing but a half-skeleton now, with bits of meat and entrails caught between his bones that hadn’t made it to the floor. He was frozen, and then his head snapped and turned to look at me, and the balls of white rolled from the back of his head to reveal those bright green horrible eyes. Behind him Ubloo watched all the while.

“The end is the beginning Doctor.”

And then his skeleton shattered and his remains fell to the floor in the mound of flesh and bile he left behind, and Ubloo’s trunk fell and dangled below his head, and I heard him say it.

“Ubloo.”

My legs were tangled in my bedsheets like knotted wood. I laid in a pool of cold sweat, panting, staring up at the dark ceiling as the outline of a cold light fixture came into focus. 

I laid there panting for a while. Once I had caught my breath I stood up and walked over to my dresser and opened one of the drawers. Inside lay a pill bottle, and beside that lay a revolver.

While I still held on hope of finding a way to rid myself of this curse, a small rational part of me remained that there might truly only be one way out of this whole thing.

I pulled out a full bottle of adderall and popped three into my mouth. I grabbed an almost-empty bottle of gin and downed the rest of it. I turned and looked around the room, nothing. I flicked the light on and checked my watch. 4:37 AM.

It was time to pack.

I made it to the bank just after 7 AM. It wouldn’t be open for another hour or so, so I pulled out one of the many pints of gin I now kept in my car and emptied some of its contents into my coffee. The first sip burnt my tongue but I just didn’t fucking care anymore. There are worse things than a burnt mouth.

I kept thinking about what Andrew said, if it was Andrew. Could it have been the Ubloo speaking to me? It made no sense. If it can tell me to wake up every damn time why would it want to fabricate a vision of Andrew to talk to me? Hearing that thing talk would be much more freaky, in my opinion.

I met the woman who was to show me the school at the door. Her name was Linda. She was middle aged with brown hair and freckles, and had a brilliantly white smile. I took the time to really clean up my appearance for this meeting. If I was going to look like someone buying this house and squeeze information out of her, I’d have to play the part. My hair was neatly combed and I trimmed down and cleaned up my haggard looking beard. I put on some of my old work clothes that I ironed the night before and even put a spritz of cologne on. Truth be told, it felt good to dress myself up a bit.

We took her car to the school, which was only a few blocks from the bank. When we pulled up I got an eerie feeling in stomach, the way you feel when you see someone you’ve only seen in pictures before. I felt like I knew this place already with the amount of studying I had done on it.

“Now it may not look like much now but this used to be a real beauty I tell ya.” She said as she walked up to the big iron gate.

She pulled a key ring from her purse with three keys on it and fumbled through them. I watched her carefully. There were two gold keys and one silver one. She settled on the silver one and slipped it into the gate’s lock. I looked up at the fence and inspected the sharp pikes at the top. It wouldn’t be ideal to climb over, but if done carefully it was certainly doable.

“The yard is a little overgrown right now, we usually send someone out to mow it once every few months, and to check in on the place, make sure no one has been messing with it.

We walked up the walkway and ascended the front steps. They creaked under our feet as we made our way to the door. From the same key ring she gripped one of the golden keys and slipped it into the lock. The door opened inward and she began heading in.

“So, here we have the foyer and as you can see there’s an old open floor with high ceilings, which is all the rage nowadays.” She said as she shut the door behind me.

The house truly was beautiful and I can understand why it was easy for Robert to play the acquisition off as a good investment. Linda showed me the rest of the house, which was bleak and dusty. The floor boards creaked where we walked, and evidence of water damage littered the walls and ceilings. Most of the first floor was classrooms, with the exception of a small kitchen that the teachers must have used as a break room. Upstairs was the dean’s office and more classrooms.

I kept walking through the house, only half listening to what Linda was telling me, the other half just waiting for something to jump out, but nothing did. I was hitting a dead end. I had followed clues all the way up to this point, and now I couldn’t help but feel lost and alone.

When we were done viewing the house I went back to the bank with Linda to go over some of the documents and talk numbers. I took a seat in her office opposite her desk. She put her purse down and went to get us some coffee. When she got back, she sat down and pulled out the paperwork.

“We’re asking a minimum of $685,000, with all fees in the exchange of the deed covered on your end. There’s also a broker’s fee of $10,000 but to be honest I can see the bank waiving that if you can commit, they’re pretty adamant about getting rid of this property.” When she finished speaking she slid the paperwork over for me to look at.

I pretended to read it and then sat back in my chair.

“$685,000 sounds doable.” I said. “Although a similar home would go for almost double that on the market right now, especially one with this square footage and architecture.”

Linda knew what I was saying before I even said it.

“It’s just that,” I continued “I had heard some rumors about the property while I was in the area, and while I’m certainly skeptical, I’m also understandably curious.”

Linda sighed despite my generous wording of the inquiry.

“Well I can assure you there’s nothing to be worried about with this property. When the school was shut down they sent the students to public schools, which a lot of the parents weren’t happy about because there was still a lot of racial tension. The parents begged us for funding but it was just too expensive to keep it going. They chased off some of the first potential buyers, the house stayed vacant for a long time and then the stories started. After that, it’s pretty difficult to sell a house, especially one that had sustained damage and had bad blood behind it.”

I nodded. Made sense. Part of me was hoping there would be a story to go off of but all I ever found was the usual, run-of-the-mill tall tales; people seen in the windows, people going in and never coming out, etc.

“Well, I’ll have to speak with my wife about this and see what she thinks.” Saying that felt weird. I took a sip of my coffee. It had cooled down to a drinkable temperature, which made me feel a little better about what I was about to do.

“Of course, I understand.” Linda answered with a smile.

“In the meantime do you mind if I take a copy of-“ I reached my hand across the desk to grab the papers and dropped my cup of coffee so that it spilled onto Linda’s shirt and lap. “Oh my gosh I’m so sorry.”

“Oh!” She stood up and looked around the room for something to wipe herself off with. “I just-umm-one moment please.”

She rushed from the room and I heard her heels pacing down the hallway.

“I’m so sorry!” I called after her as my hands dug through her purse and found the key ring. “I’m so clumsy I should have warned you!” I slipped the keys into my pocket, and then pulled out the box of tissues I had hidden under my chair and placed them back on her desk.

“Oh it’s quite alright!” She said as she came back in with a roll of paper towels. “Happens all the time dear. Let me just get one of the interns to print you another copy of those agreements.”

Linda walked me out and I apologized to her again for spilling the coffee. She said she hoped to hear from me soon. I waved to her from my car and couldn’t help but chuckle as I pulled away at the sight of her standing there with a big coffee stain on her blouse.

Once I had gotten back to my hotel room I poured myself a glass of gin and sat on my bed. I threw two more adderall in my mouth and swallowed.

I’ll go to the house around 2AM. I’ll have to remember to bring the flashlight and some tools, just in case I grabbed the wrong keys. While highly unlikely, it was unlike me to ever leave myself room for error. I started packing a duffle bag. Flashlight, hammer, wrench, screw driver, crowbar. I walked over to my dresser and pulled out a ski mask. I felt something heavy underneath it move and looked down at my revolver. I stood there staring at it, and was jolted back to reality when my phone rang.

I pulled it out and read the caller ID.

It was Eli. I hesitated a moment and then answered the call.

“Eli, how are you?”

“I’m fine Doctor, yisself?” He said with that charming Southern twang.

“Been better, y’know.” I trailed off. “How can I help you?”

“Well Doctor, I’ve done some researching on that… y’know.”

“And?” I said back. Ubloo was nothing new to me, so I was less inclined to tip-toe around the issue than he was.

“Well I couldn’t find anything else about ‘Daiala Bu Umba’ specifically, but I did find something similar. It was in some other tribe’s history.”

My ears perked up and I felt my stomach flutter.

“Go on.”

“Well it says here, a member of this tribe was afflicted with terrible nightmares. They found him dead one morning in his hut, and the person that found him started getting the nightmares.

“Sounds promising.” I said, trying to hide the excitement from my voice.

“Well this went on a few times before the tribe caught on, but unlike other tribes, they didn’t banish the one with the dreams, instead they assigned him an ‘Ubuala.’”

“Ubuala?”

“Yes Doctor, that’s old Khoe for ‘The Waker.’ The Ubuala would sit with the person afflicted and wake him if he started to have nightmares by shaking them and yelling ‘Ubloo!’”

My stomach dropped. This was getting eerie, and started to hit me a little too close to home.

“Did it help?”

“Well it says it did, for a little, but then the tribe member started reporting that he was seeing the monster while he was awake. No one believed him, and then one day they found him off when he was supposed to be gathering water with his wrists slit.”

Somehow this didn’t surprise me.

“Well, then what?”

“The tribe’s elder commissioned that he would be the Ubuala for the man who found the previous cursed tribe member, and never left his side. Until one night, when the man was woke from his nightmare, he wrestled a knife away from the elder and killed himself before him.”

“Fuck…”

“Are you sitting down Doctor?”

“Yeah, why?”

“Because you’re not going to like this next part. It’s says that the elder wanted to rid his tribe of the curse, and that anyone who finds him dead will inherit it from him, so…”

My heart was racing.

“So?”

“So he asked that his tribe bring him somewhere that no one would ever find his body.”

Silence from both of us.

“Where?”

“They buried him, Doctor… Alive.”

I felt sick to my stomach instantly.

“Jesus, Eli…”

“I know, Doctor. Now this is where the trail runs cold. I had found minor reports of nightmares elsewhere in history texts but nothing after this. So I read into the art of voodoo. I learned that once a curse has been placed, the spirit will hunt until it has claimed everything it was promised. This is the only way to rid a curse, so I haven’t figured out how burying the elder alive could stop it.”

I choked back nausea and tears.

“Well is there any way to summon it again once it hits a dead end like that? I mean there has to be some reason it’s back.”

“Yes, well a curse can always be revitalized if it’s summoned again, but even still, it will only hunger for what it was promised, and whoever summoned it would need to know the exact ritual performed. You see, certain components are required for voodoo. The witch doctor who summoned Daiala Bu Umba cited using elephant tusks, snakes and many other things, as well as the remains of his whole tribe, and the book you gave me was all I ever found from the Binuma Tribe. Before that, everyone assumed they never even existed.”

My head was spinning from all this new information.

“Alright well, I don’t plan on calling it quits yet Eli. And if burying me alive won’t even kill this thing for good I’d hope to exhaust all my possibilities before even considering that.”

“I understand Doctor. I’m sorry I had to tell you this.”

“It’s alright, Eli, any information is good information.” I hesitated, and then asked the question that hung between the both of us. “Would you bury me if we had to, Eli?”

The pause was long, but finally, I heard that old Southern voice speak again, smooth as water.

“If we had to Doctor, I would.”

…

I reached the school at almost exactly 2AM.

I pulled the duffle bag from the back seat and put it in my lap. I exhaled deeply, and then opened the car door.

The night air was still and damp. I had parked a considerable distance from the school so I slung the bag over my shoulder and started the long walk to the gate.

As I walked I couldn’t help but think about what Eli had told me. About the elder, the Ubuala’s, everything. How is it that Daiala Bu Umba says Ubloo? Why would it tell me to wake up in the absence of someone else? I walked a bit further and then it hit me. I stopped dead in my tracks.

What if it isn’t the one saying Ubloo? What if it’s something else? Some other spirit trying to help me? Trying to stop the worst from happening? It made sense. It made just enough sense. That’s why I wake up from the dream, why I always hear it just before.

I felt butterflies grow in my stomach as I walk again. If the beast feeds on despair then it would make sense for some benevolent spirit to wake me up before it can have its fill. My mind was racing with this new information, and for the first time in a long while, I finally felt a tiny spark of hope.

By the time I reached the gate my shoulder was beginning to ache from carrying the duffle bag. I reached into my pocket and found the bottle of adderall. I took another one, just to be safe. I put it back in my pocket and pulled out the keys. I held my breath, stuck the silver key in the lock.

It turned.

Finally things were starting to go my way again. I opened the gate softly and slipped inside. I ducked down and silently ran up the walkway to the door. I slipped the gold key in, opened it, and slipped inside without making a sound.

I shut the door behind me and was surrounded by pitch black. I unzipped the duffle bag and fumbled around blindly until my hand found the flashlight. I pulled it out and turned it on. I shined it around the first room, half expecting to see something there. Too many horror movies as a kid I guess. I chuckled, and then began making my way through the house.

Again, I didn’t know what I was looking for when I was searching the house, but somehow I felt I would know when I saw it. I started upstairs and went through the office and classrooms. I knocked on the walls, trying to hear if there were any false passages or things behind them. I scanned the rooms and then moved back downstairs. I went through the classrooms and then the kitchen and then the classrooms again. After an hour or two of searching the house, I squatted down on my heels and let out a sigh.

I was going to have to come back another night and try again. Fuck.

The funny thing was this building wasn’t too much unlike the one I lived in back in Stoneham, Massachusetts. I got up and walked over to the walls and rubbed some of the grime off. Same color paint, or was it looked like. Same set up. Same hardwood floors. There was just something about carpets that I couldn’t stand. Probably because I hated to vacuu-

Then I saw it.

One floor board, a slight shade lighter than the rest.

I walked over and shined my light down onto it. While it was the same wood it looked lighter, the finish a little more pronounced. It looked… newer.

I dropped the duffle bag and pulled out the hammer and crowbar. I pried up the nails on one end and then pried the whole board back until it snapped in half. I had about three inches to see through. I tried shining my light into the whole it left but I couldn’t see enough. I went mad with excitement, ripping the boards up using the open space as leverage. I pulled another two back and then shined my light through again. What I saw almost made me sick.

There were bones on the ground beneath the floor. It’s not uncommon for Louisiana houses to be built a few feet off the ground, as to avoid flooding, although this one was considerably far from any bodies of water. There was about a foot or two of space and then dirt, which was absolutely littered with charred bones and ash. I searched around that patch of the floor frantically with my flashlight, and then I saw it.

Faded, but still there, was a large circle around the pile of bones and ash, with symbols that I recognized almost instantly.

It was ancient Khoe.

I sat there frozen, staring at the horrific inscriptions when I saw a piece of paper off to the side. I reached down through the floor boards and just with the tip of my fingers grasped it and pulled it up.

I opened the note and read it:

“I asked you how you sleep at night, now I’ve got my answer.”

Signed at the bottom:

“Monaya Guthrie”

I sat back on my heels bewildered.

“Monaya Guthrie.” I said to myself as I welled up with anger. She must have somehow summoned Ubloo back with this ritual and sent him after someone responsible for closing the school. My eyes welled up with tears of anger and frustration. But why? Why is the monster still searching? If it killed the tribe then why would it still be out there?

And then it hit me.

The witch doctor wrote that his wife was pregnant when she was murdered, and that he burned his entire tribe to summon the monster. But what if it wasn’t his entire tribe, what if what the monster wanted once it had killed off who the doctor sent it after, it still searched for this child? What if the witch doctor had somehow managed to save his child?!

My mind was racing frantically. While primitive it wasn’t uncommon for ancient medicines to be able to perform such a procedure. I mean, it’s just a premature c-section after all.

I stuffed my tools and the note back in the bag and stood up.

Monaya Guthrie, I have to find her. Or at least someone who knew her. She has to know what to do next. For fuck’s sake she might even be the descendant of-

The floor board behind me creaked and I froze in horror at the sound.

I spun around and shined my light and screamed.

There in the darkness, illuminated by just a beam of light, stood Ubloo.

It watched me with those cold black eyes and stared as I shook in fear.

I need to wake up. Fuck fuck fuck I need to wake up.

I watched as it slowly began to crawl towards me, the bones of its body visible with every movement under that smooth gray skin.

And then I realized. Never in a dream had I known I was asleep.

The panic set in like a fever. The tribesmen who saw Ubloo when they were awake, the way Andrew died propped against the wall facing the door. My heart was pounding out of my chest.

It wasn’t some benevolent spirit trying to wake me up. How could I be so fucking stupid?

It was Ubloo. All along it was Ubloo. Telling me to wake up every time. Making me feel safe at the last moment so that this time, this time I would realize there is no waking up. There is no escape anymore.

Ubloo stopped, tilted its head ever so slightly, and then galloped hard towards me. I screamed and turned and ran. I ran out the classroom door and into the hall. Halfway down the hall I saw a door and heard Ubloo crash into a wall behind me, chasing me. It was gaining on me and fast. I spilled out of the door and found myself in another classroom. I ran and searched frantically, finding another doorway. I turned a few feet before it and pulled the revolver from the back of my waistband. I shined my flashlight at where I had just came in and saw the door frame crash inwards as Ubloo came barreling through it. I fired three shots and saw its body flinch. Where the bullets had hit it there appeared small holes of black. It didn’t bleed, and I watched in horror as the holes simply closed up.

I ran through the doorway near me into the middle of the room and searched around with my light. No way out. I felt my heart pound harder as I realized this. I flashed the light around more and then I realized in horror that there were no windows either.

“No. No no no no no. Fuck fuck FUCK!”

I heard Ubloo approaching the door from the other room. I ran to the corner and turned to face it.
Slowly I saw the trunk reach around the door frame, and then its head poked in, those big black horrible eyes staring at me, trapped in the corner like a rat.

I clutched the handle of the revolver tightly and slumped down against the wall into the corner. This is the end. This is the end of Thomas Abian. The genius Doctor Abian who was entrusted with saving Andrew Jennings all those days ago.

I began to cry.

“The end is the beginning.” I said to myself as I cried.

Ubloo entered and was slowly crawling his way across the room to where I sat.

The end is the beginning. What a stupid fucking way to say it. I shook my head and tears fell into my lap.

I could hear Ubloo getting closer now.

I’m just going to become another fucking clue. I thought to myself as I sat there, crying like a baby. And to think I actually hoped to-

And then I realized it all, the dark horrible twisted sickness of it all.

The monster doesn’t feed on our despair, our sadness, it feeds on our hope.

It keeps us alive just long enough to think we can make it, and then it takes us.

The floorboards around me creaked from Ubloo’s weight as it got closer.

The hope Robert felt when he found the book, Andrew’s hope when I gave him the cyproheptadine, my hope when I found the ritual and note beneath the floor, and thought there may be a benevolent spirit.

But most of all, the hope that when he finally came for us, we’d wake up.

I began to cry harder as it all made sense.

It’s the perfect curse. One that gets stronger the more you think you can beat it. The end is the beginning after all. The end of my life is the beginning of its hunger for someone new to curse.

I opened my eyes and stared up at Ubloo. His head was just over a foot from where I sat. It knew, somehow it knew it was about to take what it came for.

“I should have let him bury me.” I cried as I raised the revolver.

I placed the cold heavy metal in my mouth and felt my teeth hit the barrel as I sobbed.

I opened my eyes just long enough to see its trunk reaching forward, to see my pitiful reflection in those dark empty eyes, to feel my finger grip the trigger, and I closed my eyes and readied myself for the end.

**VHOOP**

My eyes shot open. Where Ubloo once stood a plume of black smoke was now dissipating into the dark air.

“DROP THE WEAPON!”

I was in shock. For half a second I froze and then realized what was happening.

I turned and faced the officer with the barrel of the gun still in my mouth, wide-eyed.

“I SAID DROP THE FUCKING WEAPON NOW!”"
34f6eo,0,2015-04-30,I am graduating with a B.A. on Saturday and just got a summer internship offer in Philadelphia. I wouldn't be saving up much money due to low pay and living expenses. Should I take the offer?,pooch_n_hats,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/34f6eo/i_am_graduating_with_a_ba_on_saturday_and_just/,"I am not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have an overwhelming feeling of anxiety and some financial advice would really help me right now. 

My background:
I am a 23 year old lady who lives on my own. I have been paying my way through college by working as a server and student loans. A couple weeks ago, I quit my waitress job so that I could start applying for opportunities in my field. 

I got an offer yesterday for an internship in my field with a good company. The offer is for $12/hr, full-time and they are not willing to go any higher. If I take it, I'd be moving to Philadelphia for three months and would need to find an apartment there. I don't mind the move at all, I am really excited about the opportunity. 

With only $80 in my bank account and some student loans that will need to be paid soon, I am not sure if taking the internship is a smart move. My main problem is the price of apartments in a safe area of Philadelphia are too expensive for me to be able to save up anything this summer. I also am stuck paying for the rent at my current apartment because I cannot sublease it, which is $320 a month. (Already paid for May rent with left over waitress money)

While this is my only current offer, I will be having an initial interview tomorrow for a job that is located in the area I currently reside in. I also had an interview yesterday for a job that is, meh. 

Financially speaking, is it better to not do the expensive move and continue to look for jobs in the area? The company needs my response to the offer by Monday. 
Thanks!"

34fey9,0,2015-04-30,I'm not crazy for wanting to sell my house right? x/post from r/realestate,TRA8324,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/34fey9/im_not_crazy_for_wanting_to_sell_my_house_right/,"I'll most likely be getting a new job in the next couple months if my internship goes well. New job will pay relocation benefits which includes money towards closing costs.  
  
I bought my home in the beginning of 2012 near the bottom of the FL housing crisis for $80K. It was a foreclosure that needed a LOT of work. I have remodeled almost every square inch of it, torn down walls, put up new walls, expanded the master bathroom, new floors, new drywall, new kitchen, etc. I've probably sunk $50K into it and plan to spend another $10K to fix up the exterior and yard.  
  

The housing values in my area and my neighborhood in particular have rebounded very nicely. I live close to downtown St. Petersburg which has been booming lately. I estimate that I have about $175K-$250K in equity.  
  

I have had several people tell me that renting it would be a better idea than selling it, and that people always regret selling their first home, but this makes no sense to me. My houses is only a 2/2, and even though the interior is very nice, I doubt I would be able to get more than $1500/month for it. After expenses that seems like a pretty mediocre return versus the amount of cash I could get by selling it. I won't owe capital gains tax on the sale since I have lived there for more than 2 years.  
  

Am I crazy for thinking that selling is a much better option? I will most likely use half of the cash I gain to go towards a down payment for a new house somewhere close to Uptown Charlotte. The other half I plan to stick in index funds.  
  
 The biggest unknown of course is what the value of the house will be in 3-5 years. As I mentioned, the downtown area of my city is booming so house prices could continue to climb, but they're at the highest they have ever been, so maybe they won't go much higher. I know Charlotte is a booming city too, so that could be just as a good of a purchase, and i'm going to need a place to stay there anyway."

34fgk3,7,2015-04-30,My [20F] boyfriend [22M] wants to move out of state and wants me to come with him. I need some guidance.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/34fgk3/my_20f_boyfriend_22m_wants_to_move_out_of_state/,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for 8 months. He's originally from Florida and moved up to Michigan (where we are now) in order to finish school after his dad moved back to Pennsylvania (they were both living in Florida at the time).

He now lives with his mom and sister and is less than a week away from finishing school. I have already graduated and work a full time job at an incredible company with a lot of opportunity. Now, it is an internship and my full time employment is not a guarantee. This matters later. 

A little while ago, we talked about it and decided we wanted to move to Florida. He wanted to go back and at the time I wasn't employed past a part time job, so I said fuck it, let's go. He is very outdoorsy and has a difficult time functioning in cold weather. It's been hard for him because his car doesn't have a heater and he couldn't work because of all the classes he was taking at the time. 

He had money from his returns on his grants, so it wasn't like I was supporting him. He tried very hard to go out and do things on his own, but he's confessed to me that he feels trapped and like a child because he can't get a job and he has to rely on other people for transportation. He absolutely hates it and wants to get out very badly. 

Well, fast forward to today and I'm working full time. He's got one more class left and he's done. We've had some pretty serious talks about where our relationship was going and what we both wanted. He wants me to come to Florida with him very badly.

I told him that I can't move so far with someone unless I knew we were serious enough to be together for a very long time. He told me that he assumed us moving in together was a precursor to marriage. I asked him why he couldn't be here and he said he wants to get out of the safety net. He hates having to rely on other people and Florida is the environment (read: hot and accommodating to outdoor type lifestyles all year round) which he can thrive in. 

Apparently, he's also got some ins with some people at a company down there which he assures me is very likely to get him a job.

Here's my issue: I would be leaving literally all of my family, my best friend, and my job opportunities and network to do this. I have never moved before and this is a very difficult situation. He would do anything to make this work, even if it means being in a LDR for a little while to see how my opportunities pan out. 

I'm very lost. My heart says one thing, but my head says another. 
I love him. We're very similar people and we have been through some ups and downs in or short time together. I love him deeply and I want to move with him, truly I do. But in my head, I know how risky it is. I know I would be leaving everyone I love behind to be with him. I'm extremely torn. 
   
**tl;dr**: My boyfriend wants me to move out of state, leaving behind all of my friends, family, and job to be with him in Florida. What do I do?"

34flc6,0,2015-04-30,"Google internship in the summer, Amazon internship in the fall.",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/34flc6/google_internship_in_the_summer_amazon_internship/,"Two weeks ago I had to make a tough decision on what internship to choose. The clear two front-runners were Google and Amazon. I decided to go with Google and declined the Amazon internship.

Recently, I read about someone who received a couple internship offers, one of them being Amazon. He couldn't decide so he asked to defer Amazon's internship to the fall, which they were fine with. 

That got me thinking... I could have easily done that. I'm thinking that since it has only been two weeks since I declined Amazon's offer, I could potentially email my recruiter asking him if it is possible to intern at Amazon in the fall without having to go through the interview phase again.

Let's say Amazon allows me to intern there in the fall. Would it even be worth it?

Pros

* I would gain valuable experience at two different companies regarding tools, technologies, development processes, and culture.
* I would be able to see what both the Bay Area and Seattle are like.
* Greater chance of receiving a return offer, as there are now two companies that could potentially give me a full-time offer.
* My resume would be even stronger with Amazon on there.

Cons

* I'm not *super* excited about Amazon as a company. I've read many negative stories about them.
* This pushes my graduation back a semester. Not a big deal but graduating sooner would be better.
* Would Google be mad if they knew I was interning somewhere else right after their internship? They don't seem like a company that would care, but I don't want to ruin my relationship with Google at all as I would love to work there full-time.
* Might be better to focus on performing well at one company.
* A semester later in earning a full-time salary.

Let me know what you guys think."

34fxds,1,2015-04-30,New Laptop for Law School &amp; Gaming,Wolfeh56,SuggestALaptop,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/34fxds/new_laptop_for_law_school_gaming/,"Hi everyone,

I'm attending law school in August and my current laptop is going to shit with different parts no longer working at full capacity/at all. Because of this, I am looking for a new laptop that will last me at minimum through 3 years of law school. As for what I'm looking for:

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* Country of purchase: USA

* Budget range: $1000-$2000

* Purpose: The main purpose of this laptop would be to use during all 3 years of law school for papers, exams, internships, etc. However, I would also like reliability for gaming and *possible* recording/streaming. 

* Screen size preference: 16""-18""

* OS preference (Windows/Mac/Linux): Windows - Preferably not Windows 8 because I hate the layout, but I'll consider all possibilities.

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): I'd like to be able to run different steam games (CS, GTA V, Battlefield, etc.) and League of Legends at 60+ fps.

* Other performance requirements (video editing, CAD, etc.): I'm not sure how much I'd really stream/record considering law school is so time consuming, but I would still like the laptop to have the ability to do this.

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility): I don't really have a preference, but definitely not Samsung. My current laptop was a $1500 Samsung and multiple parts went bad after 2 years. I debated on Alienware, but a friend of mine suggested ROG (Asus) or MSI.


**Which of the following qualities would you prefer?**

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight -vs- High performance: I prefer high performance and battery life

* Build quality -vs- Low price -vs- High performance: High performance again, but I would love to have HIGH build quality so I know that it will last through law school.

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: High performance, but with high enough build quality that overheating won't happen. Fan was the first thing to go bad in my current laptop...

**Which features would you pay a premium for?**

* High resolution screen: Maybe - How big of difference is this in cost and is it a noticeable difference from regular resolution.

* A great keyboard: Yes - Preferably a keyboard that lights up under the keys.

* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: I have a great mouse, but reliable touchpad/mouse buttons would still be nice.

* Great audio: Yes!

**List any features that are critical:**

* This probably has to do with the gaming requirements section, but I want a very high quality video card and the ability to use 2 (and possibly 3) monitors.

I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to laptops and that leaves me with a question. Is $1-$1.5k a lot for a laptop? Would I get a better quality computer if I invest the majority of my money in a desktop and then bought a laptop for class and work outside of my house?

I look forward to the replies!"

For the future, I hope to become an arts administrator, working in highly reputable theatres throughout the country after stage managing (possibly touring) for a couple of years.  I have two education options left, and I cannot seem to distinguish my better option, so I was hoping someone may have some type of advice that may help with my decision.  My two choices are as follows:



**Illinois State University**

* Only $6,000/year (very inexpensive for my family)
* Degree in both Theatre: Design/Production (for my theatre/stage management experience) and a degree in Business Management: Organizational Leadership (for my administration experience)
* I have the financial freedom to support any summer internships I may wish to take on, any study abroad options I could dream of (which is highly weighted in my decision), and excess financial support to join stereotypical college-y things, such as a sorority
* Closer to home, my family could visit for my productions
* Not exactly the college experience I was hoping for, but I could make it work and possibly have the best time
* The two majors will require five years if I plan in study abroad, but that is financially possible for me
* Not a large presence of Arts Administration opportunities on campus, but if I try hard enough I may be able to find assistance with career planning



**University of Kentucky**

* $25,000/year (Very top of my budget, not any extra room for other costs, I will be required to pick up the extra costs myself)
* Specific program in Arts Administration available to me that can be finished in four years and includes all training necessary, also planning on a second degree in Theatre in order to gain extensive training in this area.
* The University as a whole has everything I could ask for and want of my college experience
* The distance from my home will not allow for frequent returns home or visits from family
* Not sure how juggling two majors, student activities, and a job would work out
* Possibility of no study abroad due to cost of the school (although I could find programs that will work under my price range, I just will not have my pick)
* Arts Administration is very present on campus and has a lot of support to find the right internships for what the student wishes to become involved in
* This school is trying out a new culture from where I live (in the North) and could be a really great experience for me



I'm sorry for the length of this post, but I just really hope someone out there may be able to help me make a decision.  I have been at a complete loss of any idea of what to do (choose the school I have dreamed about, or go with the money and hope I can have a great experience).  In regards to transferring, unfortunately for these majors they require four full years at each school, so I would only be losing scholarships and have to start again if I was to transfer in after a year or two.  My decision deadline is May 1, so I really could use any assistance, advice, or personal experiences anyone has to offer.



Any help is greatly appreciated.  Thank you!"

34g3eo,22,2015-04-30,What I learned while pressing charges against my father - some wisdom I can share with all of you.,semma333,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/34g3eo/what_i_learned_while_pressing_charges_against_my/,"Hey guys. I know a lot of you are struggling really hard (I'm still getting there, too) but I wanted to share a victory with you all, because it isn't just my victory, it's yours, too. 

On Monday, I got the call from the DA that my father had finally agreed to plead guilty and take the deal for 30 years. I decided to press charges back in 2011. In the summer of 2012, my father was arrested as a result of a recorded phone call I was able to get without his knowledge. I got him to admit to what happened, how many times each act happened, how old I was, etc. He threw in lies with the truth the entire way through, vastly underestimated the number of times on things, made it all about him, and gave me a list of excuses for why he did it ranging from ""I was molested by a priest when I was a kid,"" to ""I wanted to be the first one to love you."" 

In February of 2013, my mother and I had to go to the preliminary hearing and face my father, because he had pleaded not guilty and was going to drag us through court despite ALL the overwhelming evidence, as I had more than just the tape. I had to get on the witness stand and recount everything, things my mother didn't know. It was fucking awful. After that, I was told the next step was the actual trial and it would take a year or two because of schedules having to be synced, evidence gathered, statements prepared, etc. Well 2 years passed and with every month, I got sicker and sicker and sicker. I felt pounds added to me every day, lost jobs because I couldn't bring myself to get out of bed. Finally in September of 2014, I lost my job and I was finally hospitalized after cutting myself up pretty badly. I put every guy I was with through the fucking meat grinder with my panic attacks, the nightmares, the flashbacks, the sudden mood swings, the emotional issues, the insecurity, the attachment issues, the fear of abandonment. It was destroying and eating every part of me and my life and everyone I loved. And I was unemployed until 3 weeks ago, so I had nothing to do but sit around and think about it.

I was so sure he was going to be the sadistic animal he had always been and make me go back up on that witness stand and do it all over again, except in front of more people. The DA told me that a lot of times, the defense in these kind of cases will just keep pushing and pushing and pushing the date in hopes that the victim will succumb to the pressure and drop the charges. She said she suspected that was why it was being dragged on forever. Every month a new subpoena came in the mail with a new date and every month it just got pushed. I felt like I couldn't do it anymore. 

And then I got the call on Monday. I don't ever have to see him again. It's over. I have closure. And what's more, it's not that he plead not guilty and I won, I feel like for the first time in my life, I have a real father. I have never been angry, only heartbroken. When I think of this man, I think of building sand castles on the beach and dancing to Kenny Chesney until I fell asleep first, not the abuse. I was daddy's girl, and I WANTED to be daddy's girl, so so so fucking much. I worshipped the ground he walked on. Sure, he may be taking the deal in hopes that he'll still be alive in 30 years to get out, but he's also inadvertently doing something else for me in the process: admitting his guilt to the world and not making me go through this anymore. In a way, he's taking care of his daughter, letting me have closure, and accepting the consequences of betraying me and hurting me all the way to my bones and soul. I still love him. I don't wish him pain, thinking of him being raped in prison or all those other horror stories you hear about happening to pedophiles makes me want to break down and cry. But he worked hard to be where he is. 

Now that I've had a few days to process and reflect, I've been able to start forming a hindsight. I posted something about my victory on Monday in r/AdviceAnimals and it blew up. Suddenly, I got about a dozen messages in my inbox from people from all walks of life all asking for advice, for help, for an ear. One boy whose girlfriend had been abused asked me how he could take care of her. Another boy had been abused himself and asked how I had coped all that time. Another boy was abused, but didn't speak out, and then his attacker, his father, also abused his brother, it all came out, and now they're pressing charges - but he asked me how I dealt with the terrible guilt I felt for pressing charges against someone I love. Another girl had a perfect opportunity very similar to mine where she might be able to get a recorded conversation. Another man confessed to me he had had awful sexist views from growing up in a country that is extremely oppressive to women, but had come to see the error of his ways and wanted to apologize to me for ignorant men who might have offended me with their intolerant, uneducated views and what he could do to help other women and make up for it. 

And I had a good answer for ALL of them. They all thanked me, that what I said was exactly what they needed to hear. I have never been so fucking happy in all my life. I feel like I'm flying. What made me infinitely happier than it finally being over was being able to answer difficult questions that nobody could answer for me while I was in my darkest days. I felt so fucking alone. I realized I have real wisdom, real experience to help others like me. Yes, I'm still recovering, I'm not suddenly ""cured"" of my PTSD now that the legal process is over, but I know enough now that I think I can give insight into very complex feelings and issues. So I wanted to share a few EXTREMELY important things that in hindsight were things that got me through all this insanity and pain and bullshit and losing family. I hope maybe my experience can help at least one of you. 

**1)** Find something you love doing and do it just to express yourself. I don't care if that's music, writing, gardening, judo, yoga, hell, even video games. Just something that is just for you. Something you're passionate about. I found that when I just sat around, lethargic and depressed doing nothing but smoking pot and binge watching shit on Netflix, I was so overwhelming to other people because I needed social interaction and support so badly. All of this negative energy was just building and building, and if you know anything about science and physics, energy has to go somewhere. I realize now where it needed to go - just out. Out of my body, out of my head. I love writing, singing, and dancing. A couple months ago, I just started to make myself write again. And the more I wrote, the happier I became. I spent 9 hours one day just working on a screenplay. And I felt like someone was flushing some of the toxins out of my body while doing so. I wasn't writing about any of the trauma, I was writing a romance. Extremely good decision. If you're having a bad day and just don't feel like it, don't beat yourself up. Tell yourself you'll do it tomorrow. Tell yourself you'll do it for 5 minutes. Watch how fast you get sucked into whatever it is.

**2)** Get a pet. Any pet. Literally. A snake, a ferret, a chicken, a dog, a cat, anything. In the summer of 2010, I was so sick, so miserable and near suicidal. Then a friend from work had a death in the family and needed to leave the country very suddenly, but her cat had just given birth to kittens and they had one left they needed to find a home for, so she asked me for help. Obviously I said yes because I'm a sucker and arranged a home for the kitten. On the day she brought her over to my place, she showed up instead with TWO kittens. Apparently, one of the people who had adopted a kitten had to bring it back suddenly that day because their dog was trying to attack her, so could I please find a home for her too? I'm thinking, ugh, great. I've always been a dog person, my family bred and trained rottweilers growing up. Kitties are adorable, but I would've never in a million years have gotten myself a cat. 

Then she lifted up the carrier and I locked eyes with the poor kitten who had been returned and that was it. I had never seen a tortoise shelled colored cat, let alone with brilliant green eyes like that. I told her I had already found her a home. Maybe it was partly the state of mind I was in, maybe I was lonely (I was in a strange city for an internship), but something about this cat fucking healed me. I named her Maggie like I already knew her name and she became my fucking hero. Having something depend on you like that, needing you gives you motivation to get up and go to work, because you need money to feed her. You love it so much and she enriches your life. You get home from work feeling like you want to die, and then here comes a kitten running at me, mewing, crying for mommy, missing me. There is nothing more pure than an animal's love. I can't hurt myself, kill myself, what would happen to her? She depends on me. She loves me. When I cry, she'll hang out next to me or my chest. I've read some articles online about how petting cats specifically help reduce stress. I got her registered as an emotional support animal with the help of my psychiatrist so I can live anywhere with her, even apartment complexes that don't allow pets.

A pet can't and would never abandon you. An animal that loves you is forever. Last summer, my serious boyfriend just up and broke up with me after a year of living together and then MOVED across the country back to his parents' house, leaving me with an apartment I couldn't afford. (Part of why the hospital stay ended up happening, the scumbag....ugh) so 4 years later, she got a kitty brother named Oberyn right before I was hospitalized. Maggie was happier to have a friend and I was happier to have a new family member and a MAN WHO WOULDN'T ABANDON ME. (lol) But seriously, he became my second hero. He's the only man I need. It's funny, I have different relationships with both of them. I never used to think cats had real personalities besides somewhere between cool-ish to awful, but my cats are both SO different, and each heal me in different ways. Maggie is my princess, she's soooo loving and social to every person who walks through the door, she likes to climb everywhere, but is very independent. She's my baby. But Oberyn is my little man. He is SUCH a mama's boy, my roommates tell me he does nothing but sit in my closet and cry when I'm gone. He doesn't come out and socialize with them unless I'm there. He's a sweetheart to them, loves to play, chases the laser pointer like he's on crack, he's hilarious. Maggie has her own bed and sleeps on her own, but my little man wakes up next to me every morning, every nap, every time I'm sitting watching TV. He's just glued to me. And having his love and such ardent affection from this animal has gotten me through my 7 months of unemployment, recovering after the hospital, and just in general made life better. When they both start to fight/play, it cheers me up just to watch them be silly. They make me smile when I otherwise would never have even shown my teeth that day. And I will always be grateful. 

**3)** Don't jump into a relationship because it feels good to not be alone, for someone to love you, to take care of you, and if you do, don't let them be your entire support system. It's too much for one person to carry, the weight of the knowledge of what happened to me has weighed on every man that has loved me. They all want to ""fix"" me only to find that only I can truly fix myself. And while we're on that word - ""fixed"" implies you're broken. You're not broken. You're out of order. You need maintenance. Your friends, your family, your boyfriend/girlfriend, loved ones HAVE to be a support system for you, but ultimately, you will never be happy in any relationship unless you're happy by yourself first. 

**4)** Help others. While it's true that in order to take care of others, you have to take care of yourself first - I call it the oxygen mask rule - being there for someone else, helping someone in their time of need will make you feel self-worth and realize you matter, you're loved, and you're needed. Just because you have PTSD does not mean you are unable to be someone else's rock sometimes too. In fact, the exact opposite. We have thicker skins than a lot of people. We're sometimes desensitized to it all, numb, and we forget that there are normal, every day problems. Listen to your friend vent about her boyfriend. Cook a meal for yourself and a friend who's been having a bad day. Make cookies for someone. Listen. Once you start to learn what makes others happy and how to take care of them, you'll start to learn what YOU need, too. People give love the way they want to receive love - if you need words, more often than not, you'll be telling your lover wordy, long-winded speeches about why they're wonderful. If you're less of a talker and need actions, hugs, then you'll try to comfort others by hugging them, by doing something for them. And however you feel is the best way to take care of someone is often the best way to also take care of yourself. 

I'm sorry if this is long and rambly, but I had a lot to say. I love you all. Stay strong, be positive, remember to smile, get outside and get some fresh air, smell the spring air. Learn to enjoy the tiny little things that make a day go from average to lovely.

34g87s,1,2015-04-30,Changing Address to receive the credit report and other credit report and card questions.,NeedCreditReportHelp,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/34g87s/changing_address_to_receive_the_credit_report_and/,"Hi All,

I checked the search and the wiki and some google as well. But I couldn't get any satisfactory answer. So here is the question with a little background.

About me: I am an immigrant on an F1 Student Visa. I got into the US in fall of 2013 and didn't bother getting any student credit card and so I don't have any credit history. I recently applied for a Bank of America credit card (first week of April; the week I opened the account) and it was rejected. The reason given were that I had a poor credit score (494) because of **invalid SSN**, poor history, poor history at the current address. I have no other reasons to get a credit card denial. I am currently doing my internship at a big company which is paying well and I have a full time employment with the same company starting in July 2015. 

Questions:
1) I recently started the process to get the credit report from Experian and then dispute the information or get it changed. I have not done it yet. *How do I change the address on which I will receive the credit report?* I am currently living in temporary housing and that is the address on the credit report as this is the address on my BofA account. I am moving out very soon in about 10-12 days and won't have access to this mailbox. Should I change the address on the Bofa bank account and then would I get the credit report on my preferred address (my university apartment address)? If I just change the Bank of America account address, how long would it take for the bank to update that address with Experian? They want me to let them know of my decision to get a secured credit card till May 25th.

2) Should I apply for a secured credit card (which BofA offered) or wait for an unsecured one from Bofa. Or should I apply for a new card from my University's Credit Union with which I have a bank account since I came to the US? The card I was recently denied was in first week of April. I want to get the card which will improve the credit score the most and also give me a high credit limit. I also want to have the freedom to apply for an increase to my credit limit.

I am having a somewhat hard time getting setup in the American credit system and it has been a little frustrating. "
34gd3r,2,2015-04-30,"I [23F] need to quit my job because it's draining me completely, but my boss [late 20s M] is a really great guy to work for and I'm terrified to tell him tomorrow that I'm ready to look for other opportunities.",throwingitallaway93,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/34gd3r/i_23f_need_to_quit_my_job_because_its_draining_me/,"I graduated college about a year ago and doubled down on the job hunt right away.  It took a few months since I apparently double majored in Books are for Children and Made-Up Brain Science, but by August I'd found an entry level internship at a firm I'll call Company A.  

When I applied, I assumed that this would be an internship with a moderately sized organization.  On my first day, I arrived to find that Company A consisted of the CEO, the guy who interviewed me, two other people who were in the midst of transitioning out of the firm, and then me.  After about two weeks it was just four of us, and then after another month or so it was just me, my interviewer/boss, and the CEO.  

To make a long story short, I became an employee at Company A just as my boss was preparing to start his own agency that I'll call Company B, hence the small staff at Company A.  Since I'd just moved to a new city, it was my first job and the pay was steady and adequate for my needs, I agreed to follow him to Company B as an employee, and I've been working for him at Company B ever since.

It's just the two of us, which means that a lot of what has to get done we essentially split.  Being so close to so many different aspects of the business is teaching me a ton about this field works, and my boss is striving to give me as much variety and responsibility as he can despite my relative lack of experience.

Here's the problem: after doing this for 3/4 of a year, I've realized that I can't stand it.  It's a field that takes a certain kind of sociability and persistence that I just don't have.  The tasks I perform are unbelievably draining for me (sorry, won't go into specifics just to be safe).  I've had panic attacks on the job multiple times (I work from home, so it's not like I'm bothering anyone in the office, but it is embarrassing and it tends to mess up a large chunk of my work day).  Furthermore, I'd like to pursue writing more fully and my current job leaves me with no energy or time to do the things I'm passionate about.  I used to maintain another very active hobby that I adore, but there's no room for it anymore.  I had a major ""come to Jesus"" moment a few weeks ago about how miserable this job makes me and I've been preoccupied with finding an exit strategy ever since. 

Here's the problem, part 2: my boss has expressed interest in expanding the firm and wants me to take on a more active role in the parts of the business that I'm not interested in and, frankly, would probably do very poorly.  I'm not a saleswoman or a business development guru or a strategist and I never wanted to be.  I understand the value of learning to do things you don't like or aren't good at, which is a big reason why I've stayed as long as I have, but a career in this field just isn't for me and I'm starting to feel like I'm pissing away my time as well as my boss's, who could be looking for someone passionate and dedicated and way better at this than me while I could be learning how to do things I actually like.

I have a performance review tomorrow and my boss has suggested that we also discuss salary and future responsibilities.  I feel like it would be a douchey move on my part to let this conversation happen without bringing up my concerns about staying long term.  Also, despite my feelings about the job itself, my boss really is a fantastic guy to work for and I'd continue to be his employee in a heartbeat if it were in another field that I enjoyed, or if the work I did for him was just writing and editing.  

I feel like this is all my fault for not being more upfront earlier about how this isn't what I want to do forever and when I finally tell the truth tomorrow, somehow it's all going to turn to shit.  How the hell do I navigate this?

**tl;dr**: I started a new job about a year ago, realized over time that this isn't a field I want to continue in and I want to let my boss know so that we can both start making other arrangements.  My boss has no clue that his only employee is ready to leave and I'm freaking out about telling him during my performance review tomorrow."
34gghm,3,2015-04-30,Does this seem like a reasonable plan?,hound_and_fury,xxfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/34gghm/does_this_seem_like_a_reasonable_plan/,"I've been pole dancing for a year as well as training for aerial silks for a few months. These are my fitness loves and I have gotten so much stronger since I started! I know I'll continue to gain strength just by doing pole and silks training, but I would like to boost it if I can.  

I'm currently 25, 5'3'', 112 pounds with a pretty active full time job (10k-12k steps while at work) and a part time internship that I do mostly from home. I do pole dance Monday and Thursday, a bootcamp class (low weight/high rep, abs, etc) on Wednesday, and silks on Friday. I just got a membership to Planet Fitness. So, no squat rack or barbells unfortunately, but I was thinking about trying the [Alternative to Dumbbell Stopgap](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2e79y4/dumbbell_ppl_proposed_alternative_to_dumbbell/) in the mornings before work.  

So right now I'm thinking:  
* Monday: Push workout (morning), Pole dance (evening)  
* Tuesday: Pull workout (morning)  
* Wednesday: Legs workout (morning)  
* Thursday: Push workout (morning), Pole dance (evening)  
* Friday: Pull workout (morning), Aerial silks (evening)  
* Saturday: Legs workout (morning)  
* Sunday: Rest  

I'm also currently eating about 1500 calories a day during the week, not strictly tracking on the weekends. I think this is a deficit for me as I've lost about 8 pounds since I started my job in January. Do I need to up this if I'm adding more exercise?  

My main worry is balancing all of this while maintaining energy levels and time for my internship and fiancé. I guess I could try it for a couple of weeks and see how I'm able to manage it? What do you guys think?"
