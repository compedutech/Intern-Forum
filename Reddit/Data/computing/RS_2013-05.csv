1diidx,1,2013-05-01,I [24F] ruined my relationship with now-ex [20M] through depression. Need advice.,clichethrow,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1diidx/i_24f_ruined_my_relationship_with_nowex_20m/,"Cross-post for r/relationships. I apologize, but there's a bit of a long story here. Maybe I just need to get it out to feel better about it. Throwaway, because he and a bunch of mutual friends are redditors and I don't want them to see what's going on.

I [24F] met my now-ex [20M] (I'll refer to him as T) in December 2011, and have dated him for about a year and a half. I had just returned to school to finish up my degree after a 3-year hiatus, and had joined the school's car club, which he was a part of. I wasn't aware of his age (18 at the time), because he was so mature and even looked older. His age initially made me shy away, but it quickly became apparent that age wouldn't be an issue between us. The beginning of our relationship was full of cliche's. Pretty much love at first sight. Out of the dozens of long- and short-term relationships I've had, I've honestly never felt this way about anyone.

Our relationship progressed quickly, but at the end of the school year, we acquired internships 700 miles apart. We began a long-distance relationship, which continued to be just as fantastic as being together in person. We saw each other every other weekend, went on trips together on weekends, and overall things were just wonderful. Then, we returned to school and things started to go downhill.

Things began to go wrong for me the day I returned to my college town. I moved into a new apartment with a girl I hadn't seen in years, and it was immediately apparent that it would be a terrible living situation: my car broke down and my computer broke. My field requires a LOT of computer work, most of which can't be done in labs due to open hours and software needed, and I was living 20 minutes from campus. Needless to say, I was stressed.

T returned to school about a week after I did, and immediately offered his nearly-on-campus apartment up to me. I began my last year of school taking 6 classes where we're only supposed to take 3, so I'd be able to graduate this spring. He supported me, cared for me, listened to me when I was so stressed I thought I'd break, and continued to be his amazing self. I know I couldn't have made it through without him.

On top of the stress from the broken car and computer, I was stressed about money and family problems. My savings quickly dwindled, and I wasn't able to replace anything. I had worked full-time in my very well-paying field for 3 years during my educational hiatus, and still had all of the bills associated: car loan payments, insurance, cell phone, credit card (used to pay tuition the year before), rent, gas/electric, internet, etc. My savings quickly dwindled, and soon I had nothing left for food. T completely supported me for 3 months.

I began having issues with my parents as well: my mother is severely bi-polar, and often takes it out on me with every type of abuse possible. She stole what little money I had from an old account that still had her name on it. She was fired from her job, and expects me to take care of her after I graduate. My father, always physically and emotionally distant, finally decided that he hated my mother so much (they went through a horrible divorce when I was 2) that he couldn’t stand even seeing my physical resemblance to her. He hated talking to me, because I never had anything positive to report on. He decided he no longer wanted a relationship with me since I was “done growing up” and wanted to cut the cord.

All of this added together put me in a very dark emotional place. I poured myself into the work for my classes, holding onto the light at the end of the tunnel: graduation. I stopped putting an effort into my relationships, especially with T. I experienced all of the classic signs of depression (except for sleeping - I had to go with only 4 hours of sleep a night for 6 months to just get my school work done). T did everything for me, and I did very little for him. I acknowledged this, and tried harder to do even little things for him to make him happy, but he never appreciated anything. He never tried to understand what I was going through, and instead chastised me for having so many bills and not working.

Around February, after I'd barely passed two quarters of 6 classes with the most difficult course work I’ve ever encountered, things began to turn around for me. I had slowly bought enough parts to build a new computer, and had slowly bought the parts for my car, with the meager scholarship money I was receiving. I was able to become more independent again, but the routine of seeing T all the time stuck with me. I would go out with other friends about once a week, and went back to my own apartment more often. I began to notice that he'd stopped doing anything with anyone else aside from me, so I tried to encourage him to go out on his own with his friends more often. This is where things went bad.

T eventually became cold and closed off. He began accusing me of lying and cheating, saying he needed more and more space, and I no longer saw the man I'd been so in love with. He often claimed I didn’t care about him, and was just using him. Every attempt to discuss the issue was shot down; no matter how I tried to talk to him about things, he'd immediately get defensive, then start attacking me. I went from being a calm, rational, understanding individual, to a highly emotional cry-ball. T would be sweet and caring again one minute, then snapping at me the next for seemingly no reason. I kept trying harder and harder to make T happy, which seemed to only push him away more.

Things finally came to a head a few weeks ago, the day after his birthday. I'd got him a gift that I thought was really thoughtful and appropriate for him, and he didn't like it. I just looked at him, and said ""You want this to be over, don't you."" He agreed. Lots of crying on my part, lots of him saying this had all been a mistake and he never loved me.

I immediately took this break up as a time for self-reflection. I thought about everything that’s happened and changed in the past year, and realized that I’ve been severely depressed. I lost everything he and I loved/respected about myself, and withdrew from everything except my coursework. I’ve spent this time working on turning things around for myself, mainly by working out, eating healthy, and spending time with the friends I’ve been out of touch with this year. My course load has been easier this quarter, and I’m finally set to graduate in two weeks and have a VERY good job lined up in our college town. I’m starting to feel happy again, and realized I went almost 6 months without a moment of true happiness.

For the past few weeks, nothing has really changed between us. We're still having amazing sex, he'll cuddle with me when we sit down to watch a movie, and I drive him everywhere he needs to go as my car is (mostly) fixed now and his is broken. We spend the night together, go out to dinner together, and continue to be active in our mutual hobbies together. I’ve been helping him with his work, as his field is very similar to mine and I know a lot of the programming languages he’s learning. He'll be sweet and friendly one minute, then yelling at me and telling me to leave him alone the next.

I guess the point of all this story is that I want him back. I don’t want him back right now, or like it was for only the last couple months of our relationship. I want him back after I’ve fully regained myself and my independence, which I’m already close to. I want the old him back, who I still see every now and then. I see it when we’re out with mutual friends, or doing the things we love together. I’ve always closely followed this subreddit, and know that people tend to just say “you’re not right together, move on”, but this is different. I’ve never met anyone whose personality and interests so closely align with mine. Whose values and goals are so exactly matched.

My question is, how do I get him to talk about/understand what’s happened? Any attempts to communicate are shot down, with him suddenly shoving me out the door. I don’t want to fight, or argue, or beg; just explain to him that the girl he loved so much took a brief hiatus due to the stress that’s accrued from this year. He “doesn’t believe in depression”, even though I can see signs that he’s experienced it himself this year. I want to start over and go slow. Has anyone experienced this, or have any advice to give? I really need it right about now. Thanks for reading if you made it all the way through this.

TL;DR - Had a completely awesome boyfriend. Got depressed and screwed up. Want him back once I’ve fully corrected this.

1dicz2,167,2013-05-01,My time at a public elementary school,workaccount45,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1dicz2/my_time_at_a_public_elementary_school/,"I had graduated from college about a year before and was desperately looking for full-time employment.  I should note here I studied marine engineering, not computers/networks (did take a C++ VB class at one point), but I know my way around them pretty well. So like many others who post here, I'm not IT, but savvy enough with google to figure it out.  


In any case, an opportunity popped up for an ""internship"" position at a local elementary school whose district had just gotten a fat load of grant money for tech upgrades across the board.  The goal was to help select and implement hardware improvements across the district.  

My responsibilities included, but were definitely not limited to, researching and selecting age appropriate classroom hardware/software, instructing teachers in use of existing systems and programs (normally on the day that I learned of them and figured out how to make them work myself), troubleshooting minor issues, exchaning bad/faulty/worn hardware, maintaining the local website, etc.  The list goes on and on; I basically did whatever I was asked to do, no matter how innane. I didn't even spend more than 6 months on this job, but I still managed to get a few tales.  

The first is just silly:

So I'm sitting in my closet/office using one of three computers set up for the ""grant team"" working on the website content when suddenly a Wild Educator (WE) appears!

**WE**: ""Mr. Work!  Oh, good, I found you!""  

I was assigned the ESL school in the district, and this teacher had a heavy accent but was intelligible. 

**45**: ""What's up?""   *it was a pretty relaxed atmosphere*

**WE**: ""My screen is just flashing."" He opens and closes his hands rapidly to emphasize this. ""Flashing, and I can't get it to do anything""

**45**: ""Hmm, could be the video card failed...""  It had happened to a machine earlier in the week, so it wasn't outside the realm of possibility.  Some of the machines the teachers used were quite old and not well maintained.    ""Well, lets go take a look,"" I said, fearing the worst.

I sit down at the computer and look at a screen that could be used to induce epileptic siezures.  Wiggling the mouse... it moves just fine.  I notice Word is open and the search/find box is open.  

**45**: ""Has it ever done this before?  Did this just start?""

**WE**: ""No, never.""  He shakes his head earnestly.  

I close the search/find box and it instantly re-opens, screen still flashing, but i noticed something.  I hold down the mouse button down and the flashing stops.  

I look down at the keyboard.  I see the lower edge of the moniter devouring the F5 key.  I remove the keyboard from the gaping maw, flashing stops.  Everything works fine.  

**45**: ""Well that seems to have fixed it, let me know if you need anything else.""     He looks slightly ashamed at this point, and thanks me as I head back by my closet.  

~~                                                                                         ~~

The other story I have for you involves a teacher of particular brilliance.

**TOPB**:  ""Mr Work, I think I have a virus.""

Great, I'm thinking.  The network was pretty secure, so I'm puzzeled as to how she managed this.

I get to the computer and find all desktop icons missing (This teacher normally had her entire desktop filled with icons), startbar missing, default background, and a cursor.  

**45**: ""Can you tell me what happened right before this occured?""

**TOPB**: ""Yeah, I was trying to open an email I got from my friend about herpaderp activity for the kids.   I tried to open it at home but my antivirus wouldn't let me.""

**FACEDESK**^FACEDEsk^FACEdesk^FACedesk^Facedesk^facedesk

**45**: ""Let me get this straight.  Your *antivirus* at home detected a *virus*, and so instead of deleting it, you sent it here to open it?""

I call up the district admin over our school and tell him the situation.  After much facedesking, registry cleaning, and ultimately reimaging, the machine is functional.  

TOPB received some coaching in common sense.  

**TL:DR: THESE PEOPLE TEACH OUR CHILDREN!!!!**

1diblg,58,2013-05-01,Thank you all.,dcastro9,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1diblg/thank_you_all/,"You're sitting here, Freshman year, thinking, wow, this is going to be impossible. It feels like every professor is out to get you, it feels like you won't have the strength to power through it, I get it, its near damn impossible to succeed. What will I do? Your first exam is a 40, when you've never done below an 80. Everything you saw in orientation was far from what the reality was. You are going through the worst, you think to yourself, there's no way I can actually do this.

That's fucking bullshit. Listen very carefully, the classes you will go through at this place will seem impossible. It will seem as if highschool was a silly joke. They will test your ability to plan ahead, to be organized,  to know when each and every exam is, and to utilize every resource in your power to come even close to succeeding. You will go through a hundred impossible scenarios and still come in far from being able to answer that question on that one exam where the professor could have given less shit about you.

Sure, you can be mad. You can be angry that this place had no sympathy for your skill. You can leave, drop out and change schools, if you don't have the willingness to put in the strength and dedication that it takes to succeed, you will not make it. But if you do, there is nothing in life that will fucking stop you from tackling the future with a tenth of the effort you put in here.

But you think you have it bad? Look around you. Please, do me a favor and have a look at the world. You’re at an institution that will mold you to be the best, and you think you’re suffering? You have no idea what suffering even means. Toughen up because its now or never. Don’t make a decision you’ll regret, when your sheer willpower could push you to bigger and better places. You’ve fucking got this.

Like I said, this place is built to make the best of the fucking best. Georgia Tech students are far more hard-working than any other people I have met in my life. This place has prepared me for anything. I’ve gone through internships and it felt like I was on vacation. This place is like an unforgiving father who wouldn't take no for an answer. Georgia Tech didn't take my shit, it told me to toughen up and actually read every paper, chapter and word the professor sent out. It told me that the half-effort I had put in through highschool simply wouldn’t be enough. You’ve grown up living a lie if you think high school was hard. You need to buckle up and actually figure this shit out. The spoon-fed bullshit is over. This is real life.

Georgia Tech told me that studying would not be enough, that success required that you went above and beyond your strength and put in 110%. It molded me into a stronger, more confident individual that I would have not been had I gone to any other school. I've visited friends at various competing institutions and I have never seen the dedication that I see here. I'll be graduating in three days, and all I can say is thank you.

Thank you all for helping me push through this school when all else was against me. Thank you for helping me keep going. For all of you who are fighting the tough fight, keep on fucking going. This is a difficult institution for a reason. You will learn far more than Physics when you take the class, you will learn discipline. Trust me, keep pushing forward. Don’t let anybody stop you from succeeding. Push away from every single distraction, the end of the road is fucking worth it.

I know that when I look in the eyes of another Georgia Tech graduate, I know what they've been through. We've been through this battle together, and we've fought each and every professor, together. We have defeated the roughest of times, and we have what it takes to succeed. There are very few institutions out there that come even close to this privilege. Don’t take it lightly. However many years you spend here will change your life forever once you’ve graduated.

Thank you all. My undergraduate career has been a phenomenal ride, and I simply would not be here if it wasn’t for each and every one of you out there. Keep pushing strong."

Thank you for looking at this!

I'm a Junior attending a somewhat reputable university pursuing a B.A. in Computer Science.

It's hard. I'm not a savant by any means, but I love what I do, and I want to do this for a living.

It's always been my dream to work in the tech industry.

Being that I'm graduating next year, and that I'm absolutely certain I want to live in California post-graduation, I want to do an internship in the San Francisco area this summer to begin making connections and acclimating to the area.

I started applying to internships as early as February. I haven't given up, but I'm really discouraged. I know I could do really great things if I got the chance, and the advising, but I'm supposed to in a week and I still have nothing.

I have a passion for design, writing, graphics, web development, and working with a bad ass team on really exciting things.

I know I'm naive to expect this would be easy, but I'm lost as to what to do now. I'll continue applying everywhere I can find.

Again, thank you for looking at this. I appreciate that you even read this far :)

Warm regards,

Vaude

EDIT:

I've applied at internships through interhsips.com, internmatch.com, monster.com, indeed.com, craigslist.com, careers.stackoverflow.com, careerbuilder.com, and a few proprietary job boards.

I have an internship this summer in Massachusetts and will be living in New Hampshire (internship is on the state line).  I haven't traveled extensively in either one, but my whole fiance's family is from Boston, so we have a good support network.  Money is going to be tight for a bit, as I'm only working part time and he doesn't start his job for a few weeks.  We will be living together for the duration of the summer.  We're both from the Atlanta area, and will be driving the 17 hours up there.

*If anyone knows of good priced farmer's markets or csa farm shares in the New Hampshire/Massachusetts state line area, let me know!*

**THE BIG QUESTIONS**

1. I'm going to have to bring (cheaper) whatever cooking equipment I need, or buy it up there (more expensive) and haul it back (annoying).  I have access to soup pots, a wok, frying pans, etc that I can borrow from my family.  I do most of my own cooking in a wok.

2. My fiance is a very picky eater, but is getting better.  He has the metabolism of a ADHD bunny on meth, the lucky bastard, so he's skinny while eating all of this.  He likes burgers, sandwiches (meat and cheese), pizza, chicken fingers, hot dogs, grilled cheese, bagels, and general bread.  While some of the meat I don't have control over, if anyone knows of good, cheap ways to make these yourself or if it's easier to get them at a grocery store, you're my favorite person.

3.  How the hell do I put all of this together into a shopping list and meal plan?  I'm 22, and have never shopped for two before.  I'm hoping to make a once or twice a week trip only.  That's the bit that feels most overwhelming.

Thank you so much!  I'll be happy to answer any questions or clarify anything I muddled."

Depression has a nasty habit of making me underestimate myself. Things I said I could never do eventually start to get done. Boundaries are pushed and I just keep going.

I'm just looking for emotional validation. I've stopped talking to my parents about a lot of this stuff. They mean well by telling me I can do it, but that's not the problem. I know I can do it, it's just that it's tremendously difficult to keep going day after day. And they aren't brushing off my depression, but at the same time, as cliche as it gets, they just have trouble grasping how I feel.  

I just got an internship at a data center. It's gonna be good for job experience, but it just feels like an obligation. Maybe I'm expecting too much. During the interview the guy asked me why I wanted to work there. At that moment I realized that I just didn't have any passion for this. And because I'm paranoid as fuck I'm worried he'll see this and fire me, but fuck it. I think the only thing I really enjoy is solving problems, I'm just really good at sitting down and not leaving until I fix something. Despite possibly going into the IT field, I don't fit that tech stereotype where they love computers and technology. I just happen to be good at fixing issues with computers. It's just been a natural talent and I figured I'd foster that talent. 

I don't know anymore. I just feel like I keep doing things because I have to, not because I want to and it bothers me. I'm driven by a survival instinct, but I don't really feel alive. 

If anybody has any similar situations or stories to share I'd appreciate it. It always helps hearing somebody else talk about their experiences.

1dhfkc,10,2013-05-01,I've thought long and hard about whether or not I should post here... I guess now's the time.,iiRockpuppy,MyLittleSupportGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/1dhfkc/ive_thought_long_and_hard_about_whether_or_not_i/,"I feel as though I have serious issues. Like I'm a retard, and that's just who I am. And I'll never learn and I'll never be good enough for my family, at least not for an extended period of time. Not enough.

All my mom talks about is how good I used to be. When we still lived in Pennsylvania before my dad destroyed my mom's family business and we - me, my mom, my brother, and my sister and dog and all our possessions - were forced to move away from the shame our father brought upon our family to New York. My father was a drunk and never god the jewelry repairs done and even sold some of people's jewelry that they asked to get work done on. My mom was a fool to protect him and she suffered a harmful blow when he blamed her. So we moved away.

When we first moved up to NY, it was a very difficult change. The new house was much smaller and we had to put a lot of our stuff that we didn't have room for into the barn out back used as storage. When spring came around, the snow melted and the water rushed down from the hill right behind the barn and destroyed most of our possessions. The house was bad enough, with the toilet water dripping down from the ceiling whenever we flushed the upstairs toilet, and the water recking of sulfer. It was very hard for all of us after that. 

The public school right up the road was extremely different. I was only 5th grade and I had to go to middle school up here. I still had 2 more years until middle school back in PA. People were assholes and there was one point I was asked if I was gay because there was this kid by himself at a lunch table and looked like he was crying so I came over and tried to comfort him. So, that led to my mom taking me out of there to a new private school 32 miles away that we couldn't get a bus too. So now, with the money being spent on the new private school and gas money to get me there, it's even harder for us.

Meanwhile, my dad decides to get sober for his own health... like he couldn't have done it when we needed him to do it. When he still had the business and we begged him to. No, he decides to go to AA after we ove up here, and even finds a new woman there, which is against one of their rules. One of the biggest rules there is to not get into a relationship with someone at AA... but he always gets his way. So while he's got his new girlfriend, we're still struggling. Child support doesn't even pay completely for the gas that gets me to my school. We're (me and my brother) scheduled to meet with my dad every third weekend of the month, and he would cancel sometimes so he could be with his girlfriend. Or sometimes even, we'd come down and he'd drop us off at my cousin's house so he could go ""work"". Needless to say, I was constantly neglected.

Fast forward 5 years, present day (or year, I should say), life went on... things were still hard as ever. We've moved into a new house, much better even though it's got problems. Now, we can't afford the private school I've so desperately held onto and made friends at and I have to go back to the public school... they're all still assholes, and now that I like ponies, even more people think I'm gay.... Now, my dad's gotten married to that cunt girlfriend that distracted him from us. That same cunt girlfriend who threatened my mom when my sister back down to PA for Thanksgiving and told my sister, ""I can make your mom disappear!"" and attempted to do so by sending a letter to the police in Albany.

But my mom's got a job now, catering for films. Which is great, because I love film and sometimes I help. But it doesn't pay enough, we're still struggling. But it's definitely not as bad as it was in the old house. At least I have a computer and an internship at a computer store. At least I had a Wii and 3DS. At least I was in a school and there was food in the house. At least I still had the brony community and tons of great pony gear and other interests around me to shelter myself with when things got bad.

The beginning of the school year and I'm not doing a god damn thing, no school work being done at all and just goofing off everyday after school to the computer store and play video games. I am praying everyday that I might return to my private school with all my friends and the laid back life and easy grades because all my teachers respected and loved me... 2 quarters later, there's no sign of me going back and I'm failing. I actually quit my ""internship"" at the computer store because I realize my boss is an huge liar and steals money from people, charging a refurbished computer for the full price of a new one. He even did it to me, when I got my MacBook. Which was intended for movie editing, which I did next to nothing on and just played video games instead and reddit.

I was really fucking up my life very slowly, and then it all came crashing down in a split second. I was damaging my entire family's life because of the private school. And when I didn't have what I wanted, I got angry. Two months ago, I took it out, physically, on my own mother, the one who made everything happen for me... I wish I could have been taking it out on my dad. But my mom acted as the punching bag. And I'm ashamed of that everyday... And I'm reminded of that directly from her. And that angers me even more. And you can imagine why! Who would want to take it out on their mother? Who would want to take it out on anybody other than the one who dealt you all the pain and heart ache? I'm reminded from her almost everyday of what I did and keep doing and it doesn't stop.

Everything started falling apart after that. After getting my computer taken away, my connections at my private school were lost, and the video games and... my whole world that I sheltered myself in when things got bad. I had no communication and I lost all my friends. I had no way to relax... and I thought I would get everything back after getting my grades back up, because the computer was a distraction from my school work which kept piling up, but after it didn't happen. That's not all it took to redeem myself. She told me, ""There was no agreement like that."" And I feel like a retard for not understanding that... because my objectives are clear to me but I can't follow through. 

Three weeks ago, my opportunity to get back to my private school was taken away because I didn't do chores. I went upstairs and took my anger out on myself. I ripped up everything My Little Pony related I owned. Everything: posters I bought at bronycon, cards, figurines with autographed boxes, magnets, buttons, t-shirts... I threw it all away.

My 3DS ended up getting chewed up by our new puppy. There was a film camp my mom would've worked to get me too and I got that taken away because I was caught on the computer using her limited internet. Just yesterday, my mom threw the Wii out the window and I went out there I smashed it to pieces. You want to know why? Because she keeps telling me ""I was wasting my life with that *stupid pony shit*."" The only thing that made me happy and I was wasting my life with all ""that *stupid pony shit*.""

And I'm still reminded of it from her... **I don't need to be reminded of it. Because everyday I wake up and see the damage I've done. Me beating her, my 3DS and Wii now gone, my** ***""stupid pony shit""*** **is all GONE. I'm so ashamed of myself and I wasted so much of my life watching everything I owned being destroyed.**

...I guess I was wrong. I didn't have everything, I never did. And I don't feel like killing myself or anything stupid, I just want a way to turn my life around. I've realized my faults and I try to control my anger and try to do everything right but... nothing works.... Nothing I try works anymore. It's too hard for my mom to work around my rage issues because she doesn't have anybody else supporting her. So if she can't work with me, trying to make things better and control my rage, should I even bother? I've got job now and I do all my school work... and now I have nothing to ""distract me"" so I can do my chores. No computer, no video games, no ""*stupid pony shit*."" What the hell else should she expect from me? I'm only 16 and I know I'm going to need to mature but god dammit I DIDN'T HAVE CHILDHOOD BECAUSE OF MY FATHER. **I am mature.** I have people tell me that all the fucking time. SHE even has people because she tells me. But she never says anything like that about me. I can manage when I'm old enough, when I'll have a license and a car. But right now, I can't be the man of the house. I can't control my rage, I can't do it myself... 

What do I do? I still believe in friendship and tolerance, but it's too much for me... I can't do it myself, and I know I'm alone. I can't get friends at this new school, I've tried. Nobody in my life is willing to help me now because of what I've done... but I've realized my actions were hurtful and I'm trying to redeem myself, but so much gets in the way... and now that I don't have anything... what the hell am I fighting for?

**Edit** - I won't be able respond to anything, I don't know when my mom will be back... Until then, I suppose."

I am a junior undergrad math major I go to a top liberal arts school and I haven't thought about what I am going to do after I graduate until now. 

My internship search this past semester has been horribly unsuccessful. I tried mostly for finance internships but due to my lack of experience (who knew that mattered) I didn't get any offers. 

So here is my situation: I know some CS, some functional programming, some java, etc. I don't know algorithms but am willing to work on that over the summer. 
These happen to be the only hard skills I have. 

My question: Should I take a gap year to gain more experience and study for interviews or should I just go into my senior year and hope I get a full time job from on campus recruiting?  

I am feeling pretty bad right now since I spent the last few summers learning languages and doing research in labs, instead of spending time at an internship. I guess I just bought into the whole liberal arts thing a bit too much.

What do you recommend I do??

I have a few web/mobile apps I wan't to build as personal projects using this language as the RESTful backend. (I want to learn REST too).

I am very experienced with Java, however I have not used a lot of mainstream frameworks. I know how to use servlets, JSP scriptlets, JSF, Tomcat, and an unheard-of web service framework that my company uses. I also am pretty familiar with Groovy because Groovy is used in said web service framework.

I know basic javascript and jQuery, but I am definitely no expert. 

I have played around with Ruby and done a few homework assignments in the language and was very, very pleased with it. 

I know lots of C and little C++

I know a little Python, Perl, PHP, and Scheme from various school projects.

I am interested in exploring Spring, Play!, Scala, Lift, Ruby, Rails, Javascript, node.js, clojure, or dart.

It was glorious. I spent a year at the internship, and when that was up I went looking for jobs where there were none. At least for me.

I took classes and submitted resumes. I did gratis and freelance work to pump up my resume. I took more classes in related fields. I watched the other people I interned with get hired and do well while no one would take a chance on me. 

After 4 years of that, my money ran out and I started looking for anything I could get. I couldn't get clerical jobs in the industry. I couldn't get coffee shop jobs to keep me afloat. I couldn't get any kind of job whatsoever. I did manage to get one job that really wasn't too horrible, and the owner of the company paid me in bounced checks and moved to Africa.

So I tried to kill myself. I was locked in a hospital for over a week and sent an embarrassingly large bill for it. The state refused to cover me for reasons I never really figured out; I just got stuck with the bill.

So now I'm back in computers. Because, apparently, hard work and dedication are worthless. Skill is worthless. Talent is worthless. All that matters is where society decides you should work.

I walk in there and they drop my scholarship from both schools because all of a sudden that ACT score matters now and apparently I couldn't retake the ACT to acquire the scholarship a second time.

Yup. I'm a victim of shitty standardized tests despite having a fantastic performance record under a program overseeing students in a high-demand, hard-working field. I don't understand it, either.

At the minute I'm doing little bits of freelance web development work for people I know, and finding some work online.

However, as for looking for a proper job for the 5 months of summer I'm finding it impossible. I don't want to travel far which makes it more difficult.

For fixed term developer work (mainly web), most require a degree or a certain number of years experience in certain technologies. Companies don't seem to understand that you someone can do work to a high level without these things.

As for internships, pretty much all companies seem to be looking for students in between 3rd and 4th year, and ignore students before this stage. The university offered work for 2nd year students and then took it back and made it only for 3rd year.

I need some help in how to network for technical jobs, and how to get work without a degree. Tips on getting more and better freelance work would also be helpful.

A little background information:

I've been out of school for almost a year now and I haven't been able to land too many interviews. I've had my resume critiqued by my professor, engineering professionals, as well as friends. I guess it's time to see what Reddit has to say. 

As of today I've submitted 170 applications to various engineering companies and organizations throughout my state. I've had a total of 3 interviews. Company A was a one and done interview, Company B had me come back for a second interview but I didn't get the job, and finally the interview with Company C was straight up bad. I've also tried to apply to as many internships as I can but a lot of companies want students.

In regards to my resume:

* I had a crappy GPA (&lt; 3.0) so that's why it's not listed.
*  I didn't have any jobs/internships/research/volunteer work while I was in school (yes I'm kicking myself for not getting an internship; I had to take summer school practically every summer)

My school's financial aid office misrepresented many things to me; the difficulty of removing a cosigner was among them. 

I know; I know. Another (soon-to-be) unemployed English major who should have chose STEM or business.

I've won awards for my writing, and my grades are fairly solid. (3.81, as of this post.) I have a great deal of work experience. Of this, most notable is my two year internship at the world's biggest research institution, where I did technical and grant writing. I actually wrote the training guide used to instruct new researchers on a massive project. For the past year, I've worked for my university in one of their offices and as a research assistant for one of my professors. 

I'm at a crossroads. I want to take the exams to get my certification to teach as something to fall back on (I should have done this sooner), and I've been applying for technical writing jobs. Unfortunately, the sequester has hit my area hard. My mother's a professional tech writer who encouraged me towards the field, and even she admits that it's pretty barren these days. 

I've been applying for jobs left and right, and I've received few responses except for a few who seemed to lose interest once they learn I'm not graduating for a few more weeks. Public schools in my area won't look at me without my certification; I haven't even seen any paraprofessional jobs open up. Private schools are pretty promising, and I have a few leads but they won't know anything certain until the end of the school year. My internship isn't hiring. Again, budget cuts. 

Things have gotten better lately, so I shouldn't feel so stressed. My grades are fine. I've lost thirty pounds since January, and I plan to only intensify my weight loss journey once school is done. I've found an affordable room to rent upon graduation with people I care about. I've stayed with them in the past, and I know the rhythms of their household. I most likely have a part-time job I can start in a few weeks if I choose. I should be getting my license within the next week or two. (I failed on Tuesday based on my back wheel being two inches too far from the curb while parallel parking. Sigh.) 

Things are looking up, and I know the job market is tough with thousands of applicants graduating from college this May. Still, I really want stability. 

This morning, I woke up thinking about joining the armed forces, especially the Air Force. Health insurance, room and board, and steady income is a huge draw for me. With a degree, I can become an officer; I know the training/candidate schools are selective when it comes to college degrees, but I don't know how selective they are. I need to lose more weight, but I'm confident that I can continue to make progress on that front. Before I started college, I know I could meet the requirements for women easily; I just need to get back to that point.

My Sallie Mae loans are gathering massive amounts of interest, sending out job applications is making me feel worthless, and I don't really know what to do.

Do you have any advice? Or: ask me about my time as a semi-homeless college student! "
1dkhw1,12,2013-05-02,I was the victim of a mugging/attempted sexual assualt.,bradysaysblerg,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1dkhw1/i_was_the_victim_of_a_muggingattempted_sexual/,"I was mugged on Friday night. I was leaving a bar in the West Village at 1:30, walking uptown to get a cab back to queens. I took a right and immediately got pushed into a wall. He kissed me and started groping me grabbing my wallet from my pocket and phone from my hand in the process. He said “ I’m gonna fuck you right here.” The initial shock wore off and I managed to push past him and run. I got into the first empty cab I saw and told the driver my destination. We started moving and I said “..I think I got attacked.” He pulled over and told me to get out. I started running again and got to another cab. We got to 50th street and I realized that I must have dozed off. I felt my pockets and realized I didn’t have anything. I said something to the cab driver about how my wallet was gone and I had no money. At this point I was in shock or denial or something. Almost like I had forgotten what happened entirely. My first thought was that I left my stuff at the last bar or in the first cab. The cab driver said “You can’t pay me?! Well you’re going to jail. If you don’t pay me you’re going to jail.” I started crying and as soon as we stopped I got out and ran. I ran as far and fast as I could until I had to stop to throw up on the sidewalk. At this point I realized my jacket was gone and I convinced myself that I left my wallet and phone in the pockets. I started walking back downtown in the direction of the bar. On the way I ran into 2 police officers. I told them my stuff was missing and I had no idea where it went. Being inebriated, I stumbled a bit and their tone shifted immediately from somewhat concerned to condescending. They told me to revisit the places I went that night in the morning and I decided to keep walking. A while later I made it back to the nearly empty bar on Christopher and 7th. My jacket was on the back of the chair I had been sitting in, the pockets empty. I told the bartender that my stuff was gone. I had no idea where it was and didn’t know if I left it in my jacket pocket or in a cab, completely blocking out the fact that I had been a victim of an attack. She saw how hard I was freaking out, gave me the bars phone number and hope that someone picked up my stuff by mistake and would return it as well as $20 to get home. I was sitting on the N train looking out the window with tears in my eyes when it hit me that I had been attacked. I made it back to my place around 5am. My roommate let me borrow her phone to call my mom and I told her what happened, her knee jerk reaction was to be angry at me for drinking and then she started canceling my phone service and credit cards. I passed out on my bed in tears and woke up to my sister handing me a bagel and explaining what I needed to do to get my life back together for the last week of my internship with no money or phone in New York City.


To the Bartender who gave me money to get home:
You saved my ass. Neither of us had any idea what was going on and you offered me support when I needed it the most. I hope you like those cupcakes that I dropped off when I returned the money. I would have waited for your shift to start but just being in the same neighborhood, I was having a panic attack, and could barely breathe when I told the bartender the story.


To Stand-Up Comedian Jen Kirkman and her manager:
Saturday evening I had tickets to see Jen Kirkman preform at the Bellhouse. Having no way to prove I was 21 I assumed I wouldn’t be allowed in. It was a stroke of insane, you being in the same restaurant as me when I met my sister and her roommate for dinner before the show. You were really confused when I walked over and said “I hate that I’m being this person….. but I’m huge fan and I was wondering if you could sign my book.” You immediately smiled and said of course. I told you I wasn’t sure if I would be able to get into your show since I had been mugged. Your agent promised me she’d get me in. You wrote “Brady, Nobody better steal this book! XOXO Jen Kirkman” and gave me a hug before you left. I got into the show and when you were doing the impression of your mom, everything that was happening in my head was gone. When you asked two guys under 25 onstage, I sprinted up. You gave me a hug, seeming genuinely excited that I got in. You’re a good person, Jen Kirkman.


To the police officers who took my report last night:
I get it, I waited a long time to file. It makes your life harder, but maybe for one second consider that I’m freaking out and that sympathy might be in order. I don’t know what the right way to approach the situation and remain professional was, but I do know that you saying “So you almost got raped and waited 5 days to tell us?” was not the right fucking thing to do. It took everything I had to not just say fuck you and go back inside my house. You don’t fucking understand the kind of effect that has on person? That maybe berating me isn’t the way to go? That the shame and disgust and anger and embarrassment and sadness I’m feeling isn’t enough? You have to pile another load of guilt on my shoulders? What is wrong with you? I was finally in a place where I felt comfortable and sure enough in what events actually occurred that I was willing to tell an authority about it, but all of the strength I confidence I had rebuilt over the last 5 days vanished in an instant. I’m the kind of person that rationalizes behavior “well maybe they’re having a bad day or they just lost their phone or something” NO. You don’t deserve that. You made the victim feel like shit and are therefore doing it wrong. I regret reporting the sexual assault that was committed against me because it would have saved me a panic attack and a sleepless night if I hadn’t spoken to you on Wednesday. 


To my long distance boyfriend:
All I wanted was to be held after it happened. You are a few states away and when I see you on Monday, you promised to console me as much as you could. I want to apologize for piling all my shit on you. I was already a little broken coming into this situation and when I was attacked, I shattered. I hurt a whole fuck ton and I don’t know how to make it hurt less. I don’t know what the fuck it is that hurts but it’s unbearable and I can’t reconcile it with myself. Thank you for trying. I love you so much… you deserve a lot better than me, but the fact that you are here and waiting patiently for me to get back so you can hold me and tell me everything is alright, means everything and is the only thing I need right now. You’re one of the best things that ever happened to me. 


To my family:
My family is a constant source of support. I’m famous among you guys for solving problems before they are problems, but I don’t have a solution for this one and when I really need you, you’re here. Thank you. 
To everyone at work who offered help should I need anything: 
I’m basically a stranger to most of you and the amount of support and concern I was offered was incredible. You are all good people and help me restore faith in humanity


To my best friend in the world:
You have no idea how much you helped. Commending me for getting away and for being brave enough to talk about it. Reminding me about the great things in my life and telling how happy you are that I’m part of yours, talking about how your former mentor now has a lot to teach you. I love you. I’m so glad that you’re still in my life, that you love me, and are excited for my success and happiness, that being 6000 miles away hasn’t changed our relationship, and that you were the first one I came out to. I wouldn’t have rather told anyone else.


So reddit make me feel better, in the last 6 days I met the worst and best of humanity. How the fuck do I move past this? How do I make the panic attacks stop? What about this is hurting me so much? I didn’t even know what was happening when it happened. I do I defend myself if it happens again when I’m fighting against something that I am oblivious to? I just fucking need someone to tell me what to next.  

TL;DR: What the fuck do I do now?"
1dkhoz,2,2013-05-02,"""Taking space"" from SO (23/M) of roughly 3.5 years is causing me to be depressed (22/F). Lots of text, but I really could use some help.",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1dkhoz/taking_space_from_so_23m_of_roughly_35_years_is/,"I'm sorry for the wall of text, but I just cannot explain how I feel now without giving all of our background. I'm leaving out a lot of details just because I do not want to broadcast every bit of our relationship. I just really need some help. There is a TL;DR at the end if you just scroll down one mile.

My (ex)boyfriend and I have had a lot of problems. All of these problems stemmed from a decision he made when we first starting dating to not tell me something. He told me this thing two years into our relationship. At the time, what he told me absolutely crushed me. Now, it doesn't bother me at all. 

After he opened up to me about what he had been hiding, things just got bad. We fought on and off for about a year. I resented him so much for lying to me and not being as empathetic as I needed him to be. We were stuck in a really shitty situation because of his roommates that caused more stress on our relationship. We fought and fought and eventually, after a few months of knowing his secret, he decided he needed to take some time to think about our relationship. 

That, the idea of losing him, immediately made me change my ways. I wanted to let go of the resentment and I wanted to stop holding the situation in which we had no control against him. I did a pretty decent job of it, but really I was just suppressing my hurt. More than anything, I just wanted us to live up to our potential to be the happy couple we used to be. We used to be the couple that every other couple envied and that all of our single friends wanted to find a relationship like. 

We were happy for a while, but eventually my passive aggressiveness and his frustration from not finding a job (he was graduating) got the best of both of us. He took his stress out on me and I took my hurt out on him again. We started fighting again, but not nearly as bad as before.

Summer came and I had an internship near his home town. He still hadn't found a job so he moved him, which was about 30 minutes away from my new apartment. This was the lowest point of our relationship. I had moved on from my hurt and pain, but I still resented him for a lot of reasons. I never felt appreciated. Especially over this summer. I had helped him through and been there for him through a lot of problems; this was over two and a half years into our relationship at this point. He took his stress from being jobless out on me completely. He did a lot wrong that summer and I was heartbroken. Eventually, it got so bad that I had to break up with him completely. I don't really want to go into detail about any of it, but I really had no choice on staying with him or not. 

We broke up but it wasn't ever really like we broke up. We stopped hanging out, but we talked nearly every day and still spoke to each other like we loved each other. He got incredibly jealous at this point and then did something that made me cut him off completely for a while. A few weeks later, he had a job an hour away from my hometown now. I moved back home to go back to school. We met up because we just missed each other. It was great, until the end of it when he went through my phone while I was in the bathroom. He found some stuff out he did not want to or need to find out. Stuff that happened while we were apart. We got into a terrible fight. We decided it wasn't the time to think about getting back together.

I've never been very strong when it comes to being the one that decides to take space. I always fail within a day or two. I continued to talk to him even though we were broken up. We didn't talk everyday, but we did talk at least probably three times a week. I wanted to get back with him, but I was so hurt from how thing went the past summer. I was heartbroken. Once he started his job, he completely turned himself around. He took responsibility for his actions and grew up a lot. But I just acted single. I was going out every single weekend, which is something I'd never done before. I was meeting guys, talking to guys, and even hooking up with them. But I continued talking to him. I'm not proud of how I treated him. I regret it and would change it in a heartbeat if I could. I led him on for a long time. The semester went on like this the entire time. Eventually January came and he told me he just couldn't do it anymore. He needed to move on. I didn't argue. I didn't fight it. I knew he needed to. We weren't close anymore and we hardly talked. 

I tried to move on and he did too. For a month we had nothing to do with each other. It was the longest we'd ever gone without talking. I couldn't move on though. Instead of liking him less and less, I love and appreciated him more and more than I ever had before. With each conversation I had, even with my closest friends, I started to realize how perfect for me he really is. I missed him a lot.

I ended up calling him. He answered and we felt the same way. We both wanted to meet up and talk and just fucking hang out like we used to. We met up the next day. Everything was great. It was so good seeing him. All the stupid bullshit just immediately left me. I was over every negative feeling I had just because I missed him. Leaving his apartment that night was probably the happiest I've ever been in my life. I really mean that. 

We started dating again and both eventually cut off those distractions we had started talking to while we were apart. We really started to change. Our relationship had made a completely make over. That was until the first night we drank together. We went to a restaurant and had a couple drinks. 

He ended up getting a little drunk and his jealousies immediately came to the surface. He started asking about different guys. We got into another fight. We took a day or two to cool down, something we had never really both agreed to do. That was the best thing we could've done. We both saw that it was stupid and moved on. 

After about two months, we considered each other boyfriend and girlfriend again. We were back together and better than ever. We finally sat down and talked about the semester immediately after we broke up for the first time. I started to see how bad I had hurt him. I felt horrible and insanely guilty. I ended up telling him about everything that I had done while we were ""apart."" He needed to know since we were talking the whole way through. I did not cheat on him, but again, I definitely led him on. Just typing that feels like a kick in the stomach. 

He was mad, obviously. But he told me he wasn't going to break up with me. A couple days later, we hung out again for the first time. Things didn't go well. We didn't fight, but there was tension. 

He was supposed to move back to my hometown to go back to college. He was going to start moving his stuff back here last Saturday. His plan was to drop off his UHaul at his friends and then come spend the evening with me. He got to my house, we went back to my room, and he broke up with me. 

He said he's just really mad at me right now and he just really needs some time to move on from that anger. He also told me he's moving back to his mom's house and he's leaving tonight. He's moved four hours away. I was hearbroken and completely in shock. I'm still kind of in shock five days later. We aren't going to speak for four weeks. No talking whatsoever. 

We are most definitely going to get back together. He just needs time to get rid of his anger so he isn't just taking it out on me. He said that if he doesn't get a chance to let go of this anger, he's going to act on it and eventually it will drive us into the ground all over again. I understand that completely. That's what I did that drove us to break up in the first place. 

We plan to fully get back together at the end of summer, if not before. I completely believe him. We still love each other very much. We still want to be with each other forever. We had, before I told him everything I did while we were apart, been in the best place of our entire relationship. I loved him more than I ever had and in a way I never had before. We had both made very obvious changes. All of our problems at first came from a petty, immature, and prideful place. Since then, we've both moved away from that. 

I really love him. But it's hard to go through this. He's doing it for us. He's not doing it for himself. He wants to be with me right now just as bad as I want to be with him, but he knows it won't work in the long run if we get together now. It'll just be a short lived try. This is for the better of our relationship.

It's hard to keep that in mind all the time. I'm still just really sad from how he left. I'm devastated. Really, he probably did everything in the best way possible. I'm just really lonely. I lost that person I can talk to about everything. I know I'll get it back, but right now it's really hard. I'm finished with classes so I have nothing to do everyday. I am going to get a job. But right now, I'm even too sad to go out and talk to people about getting one. My two closest friends are busy. One of them lives a few hours away. My other is a school teacher here, so she's busy most of the day. I live with my mother, but she's at work all day. I'm just alone. I have plans for this evening, but still. I've spent most of this week alone. I'm crying for hours each day. Or screaming and yelling in frustration. I don't want to leave my bed. I don't want to do anything. I know once I find a job, it'll be easier because I'll have something to do. Something to look forward to. I've looked into volunteering, but I cannot find anything that's actually going on this month. I'm just really fucking lonely and it's making it hard. 

I know this is the right thing. I know it'll be worth it in a month or at the end of summer, when he moves back. It's just hard to keep sight of that all the time. I don't really know what to do.

Typing everything out, getting it out of my head, has made me feel so much better. It's reminded me that this is the right thing. It's the first mature move we've ever made in our relationship. But it SUCKS. I guess I just want to know if anyone had had any sort of similar experience and how they made it through. I just need some positive and uplifting words. Some encouragement. I know this is right and I know, from the bottom of my heart, that we will be very happy together, but right now, we have to spend time apart. 

**TL;DR** My (kind of ex)boyfriend and I have had a lot of problems based coming from pettiness, immaturity and pride. We've finally moved past that, but now he needs some space to move on from his current anger so he doesn't let his resentment run us into the ground. It'll probably be the best thing we've ever done for our relationship, but I'm still incredibly sad and feel hopeless. I miss him a lot and am trying to find ways to fill up my free time. I just want some encouragement from anyone that's been in the same position. Thank you!"
1dkbdd,1,2013-05-02,Need to choose a job,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1dkbdd/need_to_choose_a_job/,"So during my time in high school I worked at local Canadian retail chain Giant Tiger for 4 years before leaving off for university.  I am back in my home town in the summer.  My parents are poor, I live broke but I do what I can to make sure that I stay in school which means that I have to try to work as many hours as I can during the summer.

For the second summer in a row I am returning to Giant Tiger, they offer me about 20 hours a week but with call ins I almost always end up with around 35 hours a week. 

I recently have been given the opportunity to take up a job as an intern for a downtown development position which has to do with dealing with numerous local businesses and event planning which would be amazing experience for my resume as I am a business student.  This job is 35 hours a week guaranteed, sometimes more.  So my plan was to work weekends and occassional evening shifts at Giant Tiger and work the intern job racking me up about 50-60 hours a week.  The main catch with the intern job however is that it ends at the beginning of August.

I didn't see it as a problem but when Giant Tiger found out the managers started bullying me about it. 2 managers each one at a time confronted me on the floor telling me that I better not take this intern job as they want me to cover shifts and if I am not available to the shifts they want me to then they don't want me here.  The managers seem completely unwilling to negotiate but I want to try to explain to them my situation more formally.  

I have been working with Giant Tiger for years, am a known hard worker and well loved among the staff, not to mention that I always take extra unscheduled shifts without even a grunt and this is the way they treat me.  They have many other staff with barely any hours who are looking for more hours but insist that I be there to take them rather than just giving the hours to the other people.

I am broke and need to make all the money I can, so if I stay at Giant Tiger I will likely make more money however I can not get a second job while there.  If I get a job with the city it is great job experience for my resume but it ends in august and now I'm unemployed for a month.

1dkavz,1,2013-05-02,Any advice on what to change?,veazer,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1dkavz/any_advice_on_what_to_change/,"So here's my story, I'm 20, in engineering school (parents/scholarships paying 100% thankfully), and have the following going on:

At 18 years old I obtained $20K + interest from a settlement when I was 3, all is currently invested in mutual funds, hasn't made much, but didn't lose anything either.  Until turning 20, I had only worked minimum wage food service jobs and never had more than 2 grand in the bank.  Part of the reason is that 50% of what I made (matched by my father) went to a Roth IRA that had probably like 4-5K in it at my 20th birthday.  

Fast forward to April of this year, 3 grandparents died and I got 8 grand from one of them.  Father put 5K in my Roth acct, now just under 10K, and the rest is in checking.  I haven't spent much, but I did buy myself a computer, otherwise tried to save for gas and whatnot.  This summer I'm working an internship @ $20/hr full time for 12 weeks, so I'll have about 9000 more after this summer.  

I know keeping 10 grand in a wells fargo checking account is pointless, especially when they try to charge me a 13$ monthly service fee every time I blink, but should I do something specific with it?  Move it to something else?  Also, when should I try to start building my own credit, and how would you go about doing that? ($300 max cash backed card, or real credit card or something else?)  Anything else I should do with my money that's already invested?"

I started a throwaway account because I'd like to share a little bit more personal detail about my situation.  Here it goes:

29 years old.  Married.  Two kids born in '08 and '10.  Graduated in 2011 in Construction Management with $27k in student loans.  I was working in an internship that rolled into a full-time job at $45k/year after I graduated.  

My wife and I both fell into the trap of thinking ""We deserve some sort of reward for all the hard work we've done"" and went out and got two cars totaling $20k in loans.

A few months later we saw the light after sitting down and putting a budget together to see when we could realistically have a good down payment for a home.  We were saving ~$300 while making the minimum payments on all of our debt.  A down payment seemed impossibly far away.

One thing led to another and over the next 19-20 months we sold both cars and replaced them with a beater that I bought for $1 from my father-in-law, and a $3000 car that we bought from my wife's grandmother.

After a year at my job I got a promotion and a raise to $55k/year and by then we were aggressively paying off our debt.  Just this past March I got another raise to $62k/year and a $6k bonus that helped push us to make our last lump sum payment towards our [student loan debt](http://i.imgur.com/AVDk6Ql.jpg). 

What I'm actually most proud of is that we've cut our monthly expenses down from ~$3200/mo to $2100/mo while our income has increased dramatically.

We're now saving ~$1800/mo towards an emergency fund and a down payment on a house as our two bedroom/two bath apartment is feeling a little small as our kids get older (and bigger).

Sorry for the wall o' text.  Like I sad at the beginning, I hope my experience can help and inspire someone else to keep pushing.  My wife and I haven't been on any vacations, birthdays and Christmas are on the cheap, and it hasn't been very ""fun"" but definitely rewarding in the end."

I have had multiple programming classes as a physics major, and can pick up most languages quite easily. I am however missing formal training in C, which is a drag

I WANT to get an MS in engineering (ECE to be precise) but that costs money, and debt scares the crap out of me (lets just say its rounding out to be a little over my mean gross pay...scary shit man

I want a JOB preferably something technical, could I get into software...and how?

the problems I face (as I see it) are the following

1) I dont have a CS or CE degree (or one in the works) which would make online resume submissions pointless (without the magic buzzwords you get filtered I assume)

2) lack of networking opportunities, without being able to go through my school I'm at a loss as to where to start with personal networking

I haven't been able to find a job since. I didn't manage to land a single internship - paid or unpaid - during school (and for the first half I was working full-time before my company laid me off) and have no real legal experience. I haven't taken the bar because the industry is essentially dead unless your parents work at a firm or you went to a better school than I did (Suffolk - because I had to go nights.)

I've tried to go back into market research (job I was laid off from) but can't get hired there either. I've been selling odds and ends using Craigslist deals and Amazon to get by while working for free for a year as an ""intern"" with a startup in Boston. They paid my commuting costs and it never turned in to a job. 

I applied to the Startup Institute to try and find a path to a job that way but was rejected. I feel like it was because I'm too old (30). I am applying for entry level jobs against fresh grads or against my more experience peers who didn't go back to school.

I've applied to nearly 200 jobs since graduating and have had a dozen interviews  - some 2 or 3 levels - but no job.

I can't go on like this. I don't feel entitled to a dream job, but I feel like I've spent years of school and work and they count against me. For all the talk, you can't ""do anything"" with a law degree. It's a free excuse to be discriminated against for every position."

1djqmg,3,2013-05-02,How long is too long to wait?,rship,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1djqmg/how_long_is_too_long_to_wait/,"My bf [21m] and I [21f] have been together for almost 4 years, and we lived together for the past 2. We attend university together, and are graduating this spring. 

My bf is constantly busy with a few spurts of rest in between. He pays far less attention to the relationship in these periods than I do. I extend the same level of affection, desire and attention towards him, no matter how busy I am. Granted, he says he's always busier than me, and I can't really argue that with him. He definitely takes on WAY more work than I do, and really extends his limits. So, he stresses himself out way more than he should, but he gets great satisfaction from his hard work. This brings me back to my point: he works so hard and has very little time for me, even though we live together. We barely ever have sex, cuddle, spend quality time together, talk about  meaningful things that don't involve HIS work, etc. All of this is because of him, not me. I give him plenty of massages when he asks for them (which is at least every few days, oftentimes a little every day). If he wants to nap from 1am to 3am, but I clearly want to just sleep, I'll stay up to make sure he wakes up (he's a very heavy sleeper), thus sacrificing my sleep. I do this often for him. I make sure to wake him up in the mornings, too, even if it means I can't be to class as early as I'd like. I bring him meals when he's busy studying or working. I tell him I love him, I make it a point to hold his hand and let him know how proud I am of him. In return, I get very little. I don't ask for much, just the basics. I have to ask for cuddling or sex, and even those requests are denied. 

He is always busy. When I bring up my frustrations to him, he reassures me that it's only because of the stuff he's busy with. That once it's over, he can give me the attention and affection I want, but for now, he doesn't have the time for it. It's always something different. Sometimes, it's being at his family home (he lives abroad on breaks), so he can't skype, email, text, call, etc. Sometimes, it's his school organization. Other times, it's his internship, job, classes, research, theses (he's doing more than 1), etc. There's always something that takes up ALL of his time, leaving next to nothing for me.

I've been very patient, just waiting for this stressful period to be over. I've gone over a month without sex. Minimal cuddling time. I had to practically beg for cuddling yesterday, and we only cuddled for a few minutes. He says 'I love you' sometimes. For the past several months, he often (over half the time) comes to bed (or even just home many times) very late, past 3am. The other day he came home at 7am. I always wake up around 8:30 or 9, and I'm a light sleeper, so I was upset because he disturbed my sleep again. It's even worse when he disturbs my sleep between 3-6am. Anyway, I feel like there's a lot going on in this post, but the gist of it is that I don't feel loved, appreciated, or that attention is being paid to me. The icing on the cake is that even though I've been so patient, I feel taken advantage of. My patience is wearing thin. He's been out to parties, socials, and friend's apartments while he's been busy, so he's definitely making time for other people. Why not me?

Is it this normal to be so busy, and to refrain from normal relationship activities? I understand needing stress relief, so I have no problem with him going to parties and having fun with friends. It's just that I'd like to think spending time with me, cuddling with me, talking with me, having sex with me, is a good stress-reliever, too. Almost important to note: although he doesn't have sex with me very often because he's busy, he masturbates every few days. He tells me it's because ""it's convenient"". He'll masturbate in the bathroom while I'm in the apartment with him. You'd think having a horny gf in the apartment with you is convenient enough, but nope. Apparently not. He pretends to be oblivious to my advances, saying I ""never initiate"". This is not true. I have to also ask him outright if he wants to have sex, and he usually declines because he's: busy, tired, stressed, has other plans, etc.

TL;DR: My bf is always busy, leaving little time for me. I'm starving for his attention. Is this normal in a relationship? "

1djdx1,2,2013-05-02,"Is she ""that"" into me?",arz99,AmateurWriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmateurWriting/comments/1djdx1/is_she_that_into_me/,"""Yes I simply adore her and I won't let her go no matter what"", I tell myself. She is just the perfect girl for me or rather for anyone. We are in college together and I am sure there are so many guys in my college that would love to have her in their lives and be a part of her life. But none is as lucky as I am. I am the one she chose to be with - the first and only official guy in her life. Though there have been others but none she was really involved with. I am glad about it, though I wonder that do I even deserve her? But that doesn't really bother me. What does is that, does she love me the way I love her? If you think I doubt her, then you are VERY wrong! Doubting her is beyond me. She can never and I mean never cheat on me or think about someone else as long as we are together. In fact, there have been times when she has told me about fellow batch mates telling her that they have a crush on her. But what worries me is this ""Is she THAT into me?"". 

Let me tell you something about her. She is beautiful, an angel in herself. She is sweet and cheerful, has a smile on her face always and talks to everyone with ease and makes them feel at ease. She has her own unique way of living life, does what she believes in - irrespective of what the entire world believes around her. I am sure whoever knows her, respects her for the kind of girl she is - principled and untouched by most of life's pleasures like drinking, smoking, etc. Some may call her orthodox and uptight. She says she doesn't care. And I am sure she doesn't, otherwise she would have given in the peer pressure that exists regarding such stuff in a management school. Well I guess this is the reason I love her so much!

It hasn't been long since we have been seeing each other - just about a month. When she first told me that she likes me too, two days later she said she wasn't sure if she wanted a relationship. I know being in a relationship was new for her, a big change in her life. And knowing the way she is - closed to any change in life and extra thoughtful in everything, I knew she can think about it all her life without being sure. I didn't ask her to take a decision at that time itself, just spoke to her as friends for hours. I asked her again a few days later and she said she likes me. That was all that I wanted to know. 

College is off on a term break and we speak every day on phone. It is normal. But I have known since always, it is not easy for her - to accept me or rather anyone in her life. And so I fear sometimes that some day she would just say to me that she can't handle it. We meet rarely these days as we both have an internship and the timing just doesn't fit. 

Last night when we spoke, it was normal. But at the end she said ""Let us meet tomorrow. I want to talk."" This did not freak me out. But after a long pause she added the two words ""about us"". She had certainly given it a deep thought as she said it on a Friday, because it was only possible for us to meet on the weekends. I felt like the moment had come which was the only fear I had about her. She will say to me, that she can't handle it. ""No! I cannot let that happen. I won't. Maybe I am just thinking too much. I'll meet her tomorrow and remove any doubts she has. I'll not let her go just like that.""

I was waiting for her at the decided place today. I had reached before time. When she arrived and I looked at her, there was just one thought in my mind ""She is the angel of my life"". She looked so pretty. Her open hair reaching half way to her waist. Her face bearing a smile as always. We greeted each other. We talked about how are internship was going, work load, etc. I wanted her to start that topic that I was fearing. But after about half an hour, I couldn't wait any longer. I asked her what she wanted to talk ""about us"". She became silent. She often got silent on such things. I insisted her to speak something. 

She looked at me with a strong gaze. Her eyes wanted to say something but I didn't understand. Her smile had gone - something very rare for her. I knew she wasn't going to say anything good. She was trying hard to speak and I waited patiently for words to come out. Finally she said, ""You are the only guy I said ""Yes"" to. You mean a lot to me. Do you like me the way I like you?"". Her voice trembled on the last line and tears came till her eyes. She fought them back. 

I cannot put in words what I felt at that time - supreme happiness, to say the least. I was speechless. I just hugged her tight and kissed her on the head. ""You mean everything to me, I like you veryyy much"" I told her. 

It is half past midnight. I just kept the phone down after talking to her. ""Yes I simply adore her and I won't let her go no matter what!"""

I am currently learning Arabic and would love to become fluent (family is Palestinian.. have family in Jordan, so that is definitely an option). I was considering just looking into Arabic language programs, but would really like doing something where I get work experience and may or may not get paid (preferably paid...). I also speak Spanish pretty well (studied in Spain for a bit)

No criminal convictions

Yes, I'm willing to consider alternative destinations

Probably temporary...

I had heard that American companies and firms in the UAE might be interested in hiring western-educated graduates, but I'm not sure where to even begin.

Also, if there are non-Arabic speaking places where I might be able to work or intern in a PR firm (like the UK for example), how can I investigate further?

A little background information on myself:

23 year old male

about to graduate college


meditating off and on for the past 2 years... induced by a random/spontaneous kundalini experience- post concussion syndrome 


im a cool dude and very empathetic 

July 2012. 
I was living away from home working an internship when I got sudden news of my aunt being diagnosed with cancer. My aunt was one of my best friends and although the news was difficult I held my hopes high. What bothers me the most about this is that I only got to see her once before she lost her ability to speak.  We spent the last four months of her life communicating with our eyes and i could feel/see every emotion and feeling she was going through.  I would come home every weekend to visit her but the time i spent away at work during the week really effected me because all I could think about was my aunt and how i wasn't there for her at all times; this led me to turn inward and I've been stuck dealing with her loss ever since.

Whenever I meditate I can dissociate myself from these lurking feelings, however, its the opposite whenever I'm going about my everyday activities. 
I get an anxious feeling, somewhat like i'm dying. This feeling drowns out my concentration and leads to small bouts of depression. 

I feel like a part of me died with my aunt and I'm having trouble getting back to equilibrium because of this issue. If anyone can offer some advice on how to better cope with this issue or ways I can meditate on this experience it would be very much appreciated and helpful

1dj4t0,28,2013-05-01,I hate who I am,[deleted],confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1dj4t0/i_hate_who_i_am/,"I'm not really sure how else to say it. I'm too nice. I'm not assertive. I have no motivation to live to life the way I used to. Every day I wake up more depressed on the inside than I was the day before, but because I'm the ""leader"" of our social circle, no one can see it. My ""friends"" always use me to get stuff done for them, get alcohol, or generally plan out events so they don't need to expend their own effort. 

I haven't been on a real date in a few years. The girl I last tried with let me take her out under the assumption that it was a date, had a great time( going around to her favorite spots around town: romantic walk on the pier, restaurant on a lake front on the other edge of town, comedy show.. the works), pay for everything (I'm old fashioned this way), and then tell me she's seeing this other guy who ended up emotionally abusing her, but she really liked me and wanted me to wait for her because she didn't think she'd be with him much longer the way he treated her. She wasn't and again after the breakup, I expressed my interest in her and got the same response, citing that she wasn't ready to jump back in to anything, so I was patient with her because I really cared about her.

Cut to 6 months ago, that same girl, who I've naively held a candle for all this time because we've remained close friends in the interim, gets engaged. It's seemingly out of the blue, because she hadn't even mentioned that she'd been dating this guy to me in all our talks, but apparently it had been an ongoing thing that she didn't tell me about because she knew I had feelings for her. Naturally because I'm still crazy about her, I'm crushed. 

Every other girl I've ever dated has cheated on me, usually multiple times. Because I'm a doormat, I forgive them and take them back telling myself I won't do it next time, but she'll never do it again anyway so it won't matter. Of course I'd be wrong...This is one of my least favorite features, I always convince myself of the best in people, when in reality, a lot of people are fucking assholes.

I lost all motivation to succeed or better myself, put on 30lbs, started sleeping 10 hrs a night, skipping classes and alienating friends. I'd never do anything to hurt myself or others, but after copious self-reflection, I definitely hate who I've been my whole adult life thus far. Over the last 6 months I've seen all of my friends getting into what seems to be serious relationships or taking the ones they have to the next level. I've watched co-workers at my internship move on to better things. Even my younger siblings seem more together than me lately. 

I've tried everything I can think of to get over this, but keep coming up empty. My main problem is that I constantly come back to that girl. Even with her fiance she still complains (although much less frequently, and I've met the guy, he's genuinely a good guy) to me and mentions how she wished he was like me in certain respects. Every time I hear stuff like that, it's like a new wound I have to try and heal. 

The only resolution I've been able to come up with is leaving the whole area and never coming back. I know running away from your problems is a poor way out, but it's what I have.I graduate next fall, and the only thing I'm certain of after graduation is that I'll be moving away from everyone, deleting my facebook and skype, and changing my phone number so no one can reach me. I just had to get this out since the only friend I had to talk to about stuff like this is engaged, you guessed it, the girl. I've had no one to talk to for a long time and after next fall, I won't again, but it'll be by choice. I feel like that control will be the first step to changing who I am to be successful in the life I want to have.

Thanks for listening.

Have talked about marriage, kids, the whole shebang, we are on board with each other on everything but are happy to just be dating for now. Neither one of us is looking to actually get married anytime soon. I really see a great future with this man. 

So, he is going to be graduating from law school in about a year (I know I know, the field is crappy right now). I am currently living in a majorish city south of him, about an hour away. We've been doing this distance thing for a bit, but we are really sick of it. Problem is, he says he will be mainly looking for jobs in the MAJOR city about an hour north of him (2 hours north relative to me). Problem is, I HATE that city. Maybe I hate the city because of how in love with my city I am, but regardless, I would hate to live there.

 Additionally, my currently city has a lot of job opportunities for my field. MAJOR CITY has some too, but not as many and the competition would be rough because of MAJOR UNIVERSITY. Right now I have a really nice job that treats me well that I can grow with. I plan on working full time and getting my master's online (my job is flexible enough where I can do a lot of school work on the clock) and then moving on to something more related to my masters.

 He always seemed ambiguous about where he would look for jobs before, but now that he is solidifying his internship prospects and job hunting, it is looking more and more like he is focusing on MAJOR CITY, saying that he has more connections up there via networking and stuff.

I truly love this guy and want to make this relationship work, but financially and emotionally, moving to be with him doesn't jive. I would be sacrificing my fledgling career and I don't think that is a good idea for me to do.

My question is, how selfish is it that I don't want to even consider moving up there? I KNOW he could find something down here in his field, but moving up there is basically a dealbreaker for me. Is this relationship dead in the water? Should I cut my losses now, or hang on and see what happens? 

**TLDR; I hate the idea of moving to a city, but should I suck it up for my bf?**

Lately, i have been fighting with depression and loneliness, and have had a lot of stress.  Story is below.

Last month, I took a class that went overseas, as part of it's study.  ever since, i have not been the same, and have not felt the same as I did before i went abroad.  On this trip, i became attracted to a girl, only to find out that she did not find me attractive at all.  I figured she is very busy, already had a boyfriend to take care of her, and didn't need me bugging her when we we got back (I tried texting her, and she never responded).  she appears to be happy, and I am fine with that.

Second part of the story, I have been frantically trying to find work (i am a college student) and have struck out, and not hear back from anyone, and if i had hear back and got an interview, everyone has politely said that they aren't looking for someone like me; someone with more experience in the field (it is an internship. how am I suppose to have prior experience if an internship cant even accept me).

Third, i have been trying to involve myself as much as i can with the clubs on campus, and have taken on leadership roles in them, and volunteered to help with events and i greatly enjoy helping and finally becoming a leader. however, i find myself stressed out beyond belief because of trying to maintain a higher GPA, involving myself as much as i can, and trying to find a job, and then facing the consequences of potentially not getting a job, and having to go back home for the summer, and be even more alone.

I do have people i hang out with around campus, however, most of them are close acquaintances, and not good friends.  I figure why should i sit with them, or close to them, if i am just going to not talk, or bum people out?  So I normally have been going off alone, and in that case, i am kind of isolating myself because i can now see the world for the place it truly is; a lonesome cruel place, that if you are the little bit different, or try to act different, you will be spewed out alone. All my good friends are back home, and i dont want to bother them with my problems, and put that burden on them.

this just felt like the best place to say all this.

I won't be attending ND, due to bad family situations that affected my grades, which aren't important, but I may try to transfer once i can get away attend another college for a while. 

I guess I am looking for some ""insider"" knowledge.  I would love to have an internship this summer, or at the very least be able to be involved/help with something on campus.  I would like to have a ""job"" out of interning, but I am willing to work for free for purely the academic pursuit. 

So my questions are: 

 * Who do I talk to?
 * Are there already programs?  
 * What can I do to prove I would be worth it?


I would love to do anything in business, especially finance as this will be my major.  And computer science is next up, with international relations finishing last.

  I am pretty much willing to do anything, so pride or being overworked is not much of a problem.  I am also very intelligent and believe I can catch on to anything extremely quickly (I won't waste their time).

There was an internship for their chemistry department, but they had enough juniors, so they did not need us seniors.

Anything is helpful and I am looking forward to your responses!"
1dn7u1,1,2013-05-03,Been feeling a need to share my testimony,Baelzabub,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1dn7u1/been_feeling_a_need_to_share_my_testimony/,"I've been feeling a need recently to share my testimony with people and thought this would be a good place for it, so without further ado here it is:


I was born and raised in a Christian home and was raised almost entirely in a single church.  For my early childhood I went through the typical church kid's experience, of Sunday School on the weekends and prayer before dinner.  Things went fine like this until I hit middle school.  I had always been on the shorter side of the spectrum when it came to guys my age, but in elementary school nobody really notices the difference.  However it really started to show in middle school.  By the time I hit eighth grade I was standing at a tiny 4'8'', the shortest kid in the school.  This immediately set me apart from my peers, combined with the fact that I tried to keep my head down, I was the perfect target for ridicule of any kid trying to look cool.  However my school didn't stop simply at teasing or making somebody an outcast.  

By the time I was halfway through my last semester of middle school I had had two attempts on my life.  The first was a boy trying to slam my head against the floor and the second was a girl pulling a knife on me.  Both times I was saved by the security officers of the school and the matter was resolved, but the damage was done.  I had as of this point spent nearly a full year thinking that people didn't see me as somebody worth being alive, and so I began to contemplate suicide.  I would have gone through with my plans if not for a neighbor of mine, an (at the time) eleventh grader who saw somebody in need and reached out as a friend, despite how it would have looked to his friends.  He never knew what he did in saving my life because I never told him what was on my mind.  Merely having someone to talk to and laugh with for the first time in over a year was enough.  He helped me survive to high school where things took a turn for the better, beginning with me growing eight inches in the summer between eighth and ninth grade, but the damage to my faith had been done.  I had it drilled into me as a survival instinct that I did not ask for help from anyone.  And so despite going to church and getting into the youth group at the church, I wasn't really paying attention and never grew in my faith.  Spiritually, I was stuck at age thirteen.  

I never really noticed this difference all through high school because things never really got bad.  I graduated and made the transition to college without incident.  However, in March of my freshman year, I received a call from my mother saying that my friend from middle school, the one who had kept me from killing my self, was found in his room after hanging himself.  I was beyond devastated and had no idea what to do with myself.  I became a social recluse, only leaving my room for meals and classes and begin to revisit thoughts of suicide.  A call two weeks later informed me that his journal had been opened and his last entry was him wondering how Jesus could have let the world get to such a state without coming for the Rapture.  This was where my faith died.  I couldn't process how such an amazing person could be allowed to fall so far, why he couldn't have someone come to his aid like he came to mine.  I wondered if there was something I could have done and threw myself into parties and alcohol to ease my pain and anger at God.  Before I realized it I was drinking 4 nights a week at age 18.  

I kept this up for several months and watched my grades plummet and found myself put on Academic Suspension by the school.  Being home got me out of the atmosphere of readily accessible alcohol and also gave me a chance to meet my friends mother, who was understandably a bigger wreck than me.  I had already told myself I would tell her what I had never been able to tell him, about how her son had saved my life and how much I had looked up to him for years.  For the first time in nearly five years I allowed myself to cry and cried with her for nearly an hour.  All the pain from middle school, my anger, my sorrow at loosing someone so important, all came out in that time taking a huge weight off my shoulders.  Suddenly my mind was more clear than it had been in years and I was able to see what my life had become clearly.  I was still unsure of what I was lacking as my faith, before I lost it, was so immature.

I spent most of my sophomore year of college trying to figure out what I was missing, what the hole I felt was but to no avail.  Looking back, I'm sure there were signs aplenty that I just didn't, or wouldn't see.  It wasn't until this previous fall that God decided to stop with the subtle hints and decided to beat me over the head with his desire for me to know him.  My roommate was having friends over for drinks and to just hang out and people came and went as they pleased, but the last two people to stay were a pair of girls form the BCM, a campus ministry and church group.  We talked for hours about our pasts and the question of faith came up.  I told them my story to that point and even talked about the sense of missing something.  It was here that they actually laughed.  The first girl, Jen, said that she had been praying for my roommate (an atheist) that God could act to bring her to the church, and upon receiving the text inviting her over, felt that God was pushing her to go.  Her friend, Kim, had felt something similar that she was supposed to go with Jen that day and so went with her when Jen invited her to come to our apartment.  Jen and Kim invited me to come to see what the BCM was all about, and after a couple of visits I found myself not only going to church on a nearly weekly visit but also going to my first bible study.  As of this semester I have turned my life completely back to God and have dove headfirst into His Word.  And low and behold my grades have improved, I have an internship at a lab here at school for the summer and a happiness I haven't felt in years.


I know this was a long post but I have felt a weight on my heart to share my story with as many people as possible and this was the first step I could think of.  If you have any questions I will be more than happy to answer them and I thank those of you who actually took the time to read this."
1dn1s2,3,2013-05-03,2nd Bachelor's vs. Potential job offer?,IcyRadish,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1dn1s2/2nd_bachelors_vs_potential_job_offer/,"So I just got out of a job interview for an entry-level Software Developer position that seems like it would be a great fit for me (I love the working environment, the people, the hours are flexible, I feel like I could learn and grow a lot from working there) except for one big catch -- since it is a consulting type position where I would potentially have to fly out and work with clients on-site for weeks at a time, it conflicts with my previous plans of going back to school for a BS in CS.

Some background on me: Previous BA in Biological Sciences at a prestigious almost-Ivy school. Realized after graduation that what I really want to do is be a programmer, instead. Took a bunch of CS classes at the local community college and was planning on transferring to the state university (it has a pretty highly regarded CS department) this upcoming fall to pursue a post-bacc BS in CS. 

Tentative plan was to graduate by 2015 (with work/internships on the side), then potentially pursue an MA in HCI (looking at CMU's program), then move out to a location I'd like to live for the long-term (Bay Area, maybe) and settle down (by the time I finish all that I'll be in my late 20's... I'd like to start having children by my early 30's).

Now here is my big question - job or degree? I have no previous job or internship experience in the CS field and I had been hoping that being in a respected CS undergrad program would afford me greater opportunities to get my foot into the door, but if there's already a potential job that seems promising, do I still need it?

I know that not all companies care if you have the degree as long as you can code, but I've also read that that in many cases you need to get past the HR first before you meet the people that determine whether or not you can code? I'd rather have that security already there in place and get my degree when I'm still relatively young, than come to regret not having a degree and going back for it when I am much older. At the same time, from reading this subreddit, it seems that work experience is super-valuable as well, and I don't know if I'd come to regret passing up this opportunity to work at this growing company where I'd get to wear a lot of hats and learn a ton of things I can't learn in the classroom.

Unfortunately the university doesn't offer nighttime or online classes. There was always the option of a Master's (since I already have a BA) but even with evening classes I doubt they'd let me disappear for weeks at a time. The only other alternative I can think of is online classes - I've been considering the BS at UMUC (I'm also a Maryland resident) and that seems feasible, except I'm worried about whether getting an online degree from there would be a positive or negative on my resume? And what the quality of their education is? Does anyone have any experience with their program? Would places like Google/Microsoft bother being interested in me with an online degree? Also, would it affect my chances of getting into a top grad school?

Apologies for the wall of text, and any answers to my questions or extra perspectives would be greatly appreciated, thank you so much!

**TL;DR: Currently trying to change career paths, decent background knowledge but no work experience. Potential developer job (that requires travel) incompatible with my plan to get a BS (2nd degree) in CS at a decently-ranked school starting this fall. What should I do? And would an online BS in CS at a lesser-known school be an advisable alternative?**"
1dmqax,1,2013-05-03,Humanities student seeking experience in finance,dberesheim,finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1dmqax/humanities_student_seeking_experience_in_finance/,"Hello,  I'm currently finishing my junior year at a Big East school in NYC.  I'm a dual major in philosophy and rhetoric. ideally, I will receive enough funding from a graduate program to continue my education and get a Ph.d in the latter discipline.  However,  I am not going to bet the farm on that.  I was hoping r/finance could offer advice on how to develop my resume to possibly gain some form of  employment in finance after I graduate.

I know its going to require an entirely different set of knowledge, but I have a whole summer to study and I've found what I've learned so far not terribly difficult to pick up. Could anyone recommend decent introductory literature, as well as a few habits that could help me along the way? I do have a few outstanding concerns though:

How do I distinguish myself from a business student when applying for internships?  I have extensive experience in being contracted for academic research (been working for a phil/econ prof for a year and a half) but no office experience.  I am confident that if I can at least get my foot in the door,  I can make the case that I am intelligent and competent.  I view it as a matter of not having my resume put in the rejection pile.

Secondly,  I know like any industry, there are tiers of prestige amongst companies.  Intuition tells me I would have better luck applying to lesser known firms if I want to get interviewed.  Am I mistaken in thinking this?  I would imagine GS, MS, Citi, Moody's  all want the applicants who've been basically bred to write programs for Bloomberg one day.  I am not that person.  Should I try to develop just general professional and office experience before trying to move specifically to finance?

Lastly,  is this a lost cause?  Am I too deep into my education to be trying to get involved in finance?  I would like to think its not the case, but I could be wrong.  I view an internship as my golden ticket into an actual career in finance, as knowledge without experience is not desirable in any applicant.  I don't necessarily expect a paying position upon completing my undergraduate,  but having the work experience  is what will permit me to continue along that path and eventually find something.  I view now as the time to do this if I am ever going to but am unsure of both its feasibility and method of execution.  I will appreciate any advice anyone can offer,  even if its not what I hope to year."

1dmm16,3,2013-05-03,"I(24f) display typical ""cheating"" behaviors, even though I am totally faithful to my (25m)SO!",[deleted],ihaveissues,https://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1dmm16/i24f_display_typical_cheating_behaviors_even/,"We have been together for 3 years officially and 4 years unofficially. We started off on the wrong foot and even though I feel like he totally trusts me now, I still have do things that make me look guilty, even though I am not.

The ""wrong foot"" I mentioned was that we first began our romance while I was exclusively seeing someone else. My SO at the time (24m) decided he had enough of our home state and was going to move across the country to pursue his dream job. I was sick of school, needed a break and there was an awesome internship I got in the same place. I took it and I followed him down there 3 months after he moved. We did not live together but continued the relationship almost through the whole 6 month period. My current SO and I met through mutual friends and my relationship with my ex was definitely near its natural end; he didn't enjoy having sex with me, I wasn't ready to move in/marry/have kids (he couldn't wait). However 19 year old me didn't have the guts or respect to end the relationship on my own, so I let the kiss from my current SO do it for me. Then, I made it very clear to my current SO that I was not ready for the kind of relationship he wanted. This was all in a 2 week period and current SO never brought up anything about a lasting connection. I told him I liked him a lot, loved spending time with him but we never had any talks of exclusivity or monogamy. He thought that was implied by our actions and level of intimacy, I did not. I returned home after the internship and I started playing the field, being mostly honest about my intentions and whereabouts. I never outright said I was seeing other people, but I never hid the fact I was hanging out with other guys... And he never asked or questioned it. Long story short, he was not on board and we stopped talking (my choice out of the options he gave me-- all or nothing) once he found out I wasn't being ""faithful"" because I basically came out and said that I was not ready for a long distance, monogamous relationship with a guy I only knew for a few months and only really started liking the last few weeks of the internship. He was very, very hurt.

3 months later of no communication I realized I had made a mistake and asked if we could take it slow, begin talking and building a friendship but did not (stupidly) address the monogamy issue. Since I fucked it up last time by kissing other dudes, I did not kiss anyone else. Apparently, he thought we were still ""doing our own thing"" and I saw a picture of him getting a NYE kiss on a social networking site. I flipped and realized, if it made me this upset, maybe we should see where things go, exclusively. He was so upset that he didn't know I wanted this from him, said it was all he ever wanted in the first place, and we became exclusive a little bit after that.

There were a lot of trust issues, he made me feel so terrible for that first few months. I basically cut off all ties to other males, any post on my wall or comment from another guy was an accusation. I would get comments from males, and he would flip. I almost couldn't even go out without spending hours reassuring him, etc. I had to get a second job during school because I needed some extra cash and he said, ""you better not get a slutty job""-- implying bartender, shot girl, etc. basically, no credit was given where credit was due. I agree, it was toxic for a little bit because I really didn't feel like I had even cheated on him because we weren't ""exclusive"". I see where he is coming from to a certain extent, but I still stand by the fact that I got WAY more shit than I deserved and the 2000 miles in between us really didn't help. Regardless, we continued to work on it from both sides.
Fast forward to now, We made it work, I am so glad we did and now have been able to move to the same city and after a year of that, moved in together. We are happy. So happy, we love each other to pieces and I really have no complaints.

Wow-- here is my issue now. I do things that make me look like a cheater. When I'm telling him I'm going out with friends, I stumble over words, I try to make the location sound ""acceptable"". I over explain things so he knows every single detail, which makes it sound unbelievable (don't liars have every little detail nailed down so it looks like it is an honest story?) I turn off my phone as soon as he walks into the room ( I do this because I think it is rude to stare at your phone when someone else is there to engage with you, but it looks like I'm hiding something) I tilt my phone so it looks like I'm hiding it, even when it is something completely mundane, like online banking. I do not accept friend requests, I ignore males completely (not that I flirt when he isn't around, but will speak to them like humans). I have a strong urge to delete any communication from male counterparts, regardless of content.

 He still occasionally talks to one girl he messed around with (I am under the impression it stopped before sex) and has plenty of female friend (totally respectful) that I am fine with. I am very easy going about that sort of thing, he is not and it is actually making -me- more untrusting and urging me to monitor him like used to monitor me... It's only fair, says my brain. I basically am so anxious he is going to find a reason to see me as unfaithful that it has made me into someone who looks unfaithful.

TL;DR I act like a cheater, but I'm not"
1dmiej,23,2013-05-03,[UPDATE] [21/m] My girlfriend [20/f] (of 3.5 yrs.) and I are on the verge of breaking up and I have no support network to talk to.,redyellowblue5031,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1dmiej/update_21m_my_girlfriend_20f_of_35_yrs_and_i_are/,"Link to original thread &gt; [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1d5jld/21m_my_girlfriend_20f_of_35_yrs_and_i_are_on_the/)

First I want to thank the whole community for your support; I didn't expect such a response and I really am grateful. You people are all awesome.

I have accepted the internship, and I need to start looking for an sublet. Me and my girlfriend had a rather large blowout when we finally talked that day last week when I first posted. We worked things out to a point where we are together right now. We both acknowledged that we both are not happy with how things have gone and ~~want~~ need change. 

We came to the conclusion that she needs me there for her no matter what, and I said I can't put up with any violence. We have been working from there. She came to a bike race that I had registered for that Sunday and was very supportive. We had no major fights this week. However, while talking about the internship (and currently) she isn't happy about it. For her it comes down to a matter of that for how much pain and difficulty our relationship has gone through, it's almost impossible to have me away that long and still want to continue forward. I believe the reasoning for her is that having your significant other move out and into a different apartment for a summer with different people is something that wouldn't be much of a struggle in a healthy relationship, but we don't fit that bill and so it's very difficult to be trusting of the future and she has (and so do I) many bad feelings that need to be resolved. 

Our relationship is far from good, or even stable I would say. I want to work it out with her though. I am also reconnected with my old psychologist. I presented my theories on many problems I have. Basically, I think I'm emotionally and psychologically underdeveloped from a lack of feedback from my parents. Let me put it this way, I had a mother and father, but no mom or dad. I had a roof, food, clothes. But I had no compassion or feedback. No ""I love you"", ""you're important to me"", never saw my parents kiss, hug, hold hands, say I love you, etc. *Ever*. This came to a climax when my father passed away unexpectedly (sort of) at 57 in 2010. I've been sort of a zombie since then and haven't figured all this out. 

How does any of that tie into the relationship, you might wonder? I think it does because I never got any approval from my dad in any fashion. Nothing felt good enough. I think that in a weird twisted way, I see my girlfriend as my father in that I seek her approval and part of the reason I react to problems in our relationship is because of how I see her, and I can't deal with the rejection that what I've done isn't good enough. 

So now I'm here. All of your comments really forced me to think hard about what's important to me and what I want. I'm still figuring all of that out. This is what I have so far. I know I need professional help to get through my past issues so I can be a functional person who doesn't break down at the first sign of rejection/disapproval. I'm not sure how to fix my relationship exactly, but I know I want us both to be happy. 

Thank you. 

tl:dr

I posted about me and my girlfriend having serious issues last week, and I needed a support group. I got that support from this (awesome) community. I have since been to my old psychologist, accepted my internship and am still together with my girlfriend. I have some moderate psychological issues to sort through and still would love any advice, thoughts, comments on the situation. Lastly, Thank you for reading this, my old post and providing any feedback; I appreciate it from the bottom of my heart. "

I quit smoking for 40 days in preparation for my drug test last summer. It was brutal, but I was happy to get it over with. My ideal plan was to buy some buds, roll up a nice blunt, and smoke it on the ride home from the test. However, being home for the summer, none of the dealers I knew from high school were around, so sadly I couldn't find any.

Before the test, I wanted to make sure that I passed, so I drank a good deal of water before to ensure some clear-looking piss. Everything at the testing center went smoothly, but I was still upset that I was dry. And I stayed dry for 3 days. Just as I got a hold of someone, I received an email from the testing center saying that my urine was too diluted to get a good sample, and that I had to retake the test. 

Thank god for bad pot dealers. If everything had gone according to plan, I would've had it in my system for the retest, and my internship would've gone down the drain. So here's what I have to say to you:

MAKE SURE YOU RECEIVE CONFIRMATION THAT YOU PASSED BEFORE YOU TOKE AGAIN. I got lucky, but not everyone else will be. Be smart, be safe, and don't let the wonderful herb ruin your future. Toke on, my friends. "

Also, do you now only compose with the aid of a mirror?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4fg3?context=5)|I got the idea from studying Da Vinci.  I was fasicnated that he would write forwards and backwards.  In trying to write a theme for the man (not just the character) I thought that was an intriguing idea to apply to music.  I haven't resorted to a mirror just yet, but maybe for season 2.  it might come in handy!
[Any chance on doing another BSG live performance along with a DVD/CD of said performance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4fmu?context=5)|We're definitely working on some exciting live performance and DVD projects.  Hang in there! 
[Hey Bear! Enormous fan of your work on BSG. I think it's some of the most perfect, atmospheric scoring I've ever heard.  Can you score more video games, please? That would be awesome..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5etd?context=5)|Ok.  Because you asked. :) Stay tuned...
[Hey Bear - I love the gamelan and eastern sounds you use in the BSG series, as well as those incredible booming war drums. For an amateur musician who would like to explore and learn those eastern scales, what's a good way to go about it and is it possible on typical instruments like guitar and piano?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4fpt?context=5)|You have to go find the instruments.  You can't write for instruments you don't have access to, and that applies to orchestral instruments as well.  Find some players, some ensembles, in your area, and just hang out.  Ask them how their instruments work.
[Hi Bear, What is your favorite band? (Please say Dream Theater\) :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4x8f?context=5)|Hard to choose.  A random list... Oingo Boingo. Queen. Pink Floyd. System of a Down. Guns N Roses. Dethklok.

That took a lot out of me to write.  Then again, the entire final episode did that too.  That series was an emotional roller coaster and completing it was an incredible feeling.
[Hey, Bear!  I love your work!  I know you get asked this all the time, but what would be the best way to push for an official soundtrack of your music from The Walking Dead?  And why do you think AMC is so reluctant to release one?  It's pretty obvious that people want one, right.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4f8f?context=5)|[Link to www.facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Walking-Dead-Fans-cry-out-for-a-Soundtrack-Album/283650395045737?fref=ts)

Also Elmer Bernstein, Danny Elfman, Bernard Herrmann and Ennio Morricone to name just a few.  Oh, and Basil Poledouris.
[Seriously no mention of Human Target?  I still think the show was canceled because they replaced the theme.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r9p5e?context=5)|I loved that score.  Every once in a while I bring it up on my iPod just to remember how much it kicked ass. I am very honored to have worked on that show for a season.  :)
[What is your most favorite piece you have scored? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4ez8?context=5)|Wow, I don't think I could ever pick.  Most composers will always tell you that their favorite piece of music is the one they're working on right now.  That applies for me I think. 
[**MILD BSG SPOILERS**  Hey Bear, I'm a little late, hope you get around to answering this but I was wondering where you got the inspiration for using All along the watchtower for the cylon song. Was it the plan all along to use 1123 6536 5321 as the coordinates, or did that come up organically?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r6ev4?context=5)|Ironically, very little of all that was planned from the beginning.  No one knew when I arranged that song in Season 3 that it would be required to generate coordinates in Season 4.  Perhaps I was guided by the lords of kobol?  Because the melody I wrote to represent the final five and introduced in that arrangement happened to have exactly the number of digits necessary to create the coordinates.  Spooky...
[Will they ever release the BSG score on Spotify? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r7ub1?context=5)|Hopefully.  We're working on it.

[Hey, Bear! Thanks for doing this AMA. Your scores are absolutely brilliant in every way.  2\) If you could, would you score for Ron Moore again ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4r6p?context=5)|That was a blast.  My brother's voice was just perfect for that song and he has since been a featured singer, with his own original music, on ""Caprica"" and now ""Defiance.""  you guys will hear one of his songs featured in a big way in a few episodes from now.
[Thanks for responding Bear. I have a 7 year old who's trying to learn ""Kara Remembers"". When we both first heard it, we fell in love with it instantly. Thanks for being awesome Bear. Your music truly gives the stories more soul.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5ams?context=5)|Wow!  That's very impressive.  I imagine your 7 year old is playing the upper part right?  :)
[How do you generally become involved in a project? Do the producers generally seek you out or is there some kind of auditioning process? Thanks :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4vad?context=5)|All of the above.  Sometimes I'm brought in very early and I'm the top of the list.  Other times, I'm asked to submit some music that might be similar to what they're looking for since producers are casting a wider net. It varies from project to project.  Other times, as was the case with the ""Angry Video Game Nerd Movie"" I reached out to the filmmakers and said I wanted to work with them right from the get go.
[Can I just say that I love your wife's blog?  (Yours too.  But yours is more educational while her Florence entries had me on the floor laughing.\)  You two are awesome.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r56bh?context=5)|I know!

[If somehow Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles was to go back into production (or a sequel of some sort, a movie, webisodes, something\) - would you be willing to go back to composing music for that series?

I truly miss writing music for that show.   I still have so many variations of Sarah's Theme.  if I had the time, I'd just produce a ""Sarah Connor Season 3 Album"" by itself!

[3\) Have you jammed with Zimmer, Newton-Howard,  Williams, Jablonsky, any of those guys?  If not, what kind of project would it take to make it so?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5u9b?context=5)|Haven't jammed with those guys.

Every project changes me.  Every piece of music I write changes me just a bit.  I think, obviously, that ""BSG"" had a profound impact on me.  Not just creatively, but professionally.  It transitioned me from being an excited amateur to a young professional.  That was amazing.
[If you had to name one inspiration over all others, could you? Who would it be? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4fot?context=5)|This is extremely difficult.  But, I might pick Jerry Goldsmith.

How about a Concerto for Chainsaw?  I imagine that would wake you up in the morning.  :)
[Hey Bear, long time fan here. Loved the BSG stuff and the Sarah Connor scores were brilliant!  Anyway my question is would there be any chance you'd be willing to compose for the new Star Wars franchise?  Also, how did you become such an amazingly brilliant composer?

[Bear! I am a composer in Los Angeles, trying to establish myself in the industry, and using the tools available to young up and comers, for me especially, are the MIDI string instruments such as Action Strings for Logic Pro.  What are your thoughts on composers these days using MIDI instruments, specifically for strings and orchestral compositions?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r52g1?context=5)|Virtual instruments are a great way to communicate your ideas.  But, they're a means, not the ends.  I think spending too much time and energy dealing with them is counterproductive and prevents you from developing your own unique sound.
[Hi Bear! Maybe a naive question but what's the process for creating a score? Do the producers/directors come to you and say ""write us some music for a space show"" and let you run with it, or is there a lot of back and forth during the creation process? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r8kn9?context=5)|There's always a varying degree of back and forth.  And its always best when you're collaborating with people who have either the vision to express their desires, or the trust to let you move forward with yours.  Typically, most projects are somewhere between.  But, I rely on producers' input to realize my own visions.  Working with David S. Goyer on ""Da Vinci's Demons"" was one of those rare situations where getting notes always improved the cues.  He was able to make suggestions, not in musical terms, but in emotional ones, that resulted in better music.  That's a very fun situation!
[Hi Bear. I live in Bellingham. Some of my friends went to school with you n' stuff.  My question: do you ever come back to the 'Ham?

The Governor obviously created a new layer for the show, and as such, he needed a new kind of music.
[Is there a ""Go-to-set"" of scare or even zombie sounds in the composing industry? When my friends and I want to imply that something dangerous is is looming we immitate the shrieking violin sounds.

Those were the first things we eliminated when Frank Darabont and I started talking about the score for the show.  I go out of my way to not fall back on those old tropes, because we're so familiar with them.  They're not effecetive anymore.

[Hi Bear, BIG fan and thanks for doing this AMA!  I do some indie film and docu scoring from time to time, and I was wondering what do you do when you really feel like a piece needs some more work but there's a limited budget?  Do you go the extra mile ""on the house"", do you ask for more budget, or do you just let it go regardless of how you feel about the piece?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5jsu?context=5)|I never let something go if it doesn't live up to my standards.  If a project doesn't have a big budget, I tailor my music to whatever they can afford.  But, you should never allow yourself to get in a position where you write music intended for a big budget and then, by surprise, end up without one.  Sometimes horrible things happen, its true, but you should always do your best to know what they have to work with and tailor your creativity to the constraints.  
[Can you compare the music between the ""barn scene"" in WD season 2 vs. ""The Killer Within"" from season 3?

""Killer Within"" took me a week.  Not to score the whole episode... just that one scene.  And it really depressed me.  I had trouble sleeping.  It was not fun.  Totally worthwhile in the end, but the experience was very unpleasant.

[""Violence and Variations"" from season 3 of BSG is my all-time favorite piece of music ever. Did you ever think during the beginning of the show that you'd get to do such an epic piece as that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r62jv?context=5)|Not at all! At the beginning of the show, I was told there would be no themes and no orchestra ever! It was just minimal percussion and a few ethnic soloists.  Slowly, during season 1, that expanded to include a small string orchestra.  That group just got bigger and bigger until we had a full orchestra doing big sweeping themes at the end.  It was a natural evolution.

Those of you who haven't seen my video blog about working with them, check it out: [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oi9USqQCSwU&amp;list=UUU2Z9O7Qw7PCT6fPN0yaHg&amp;index=2)
[How do you do it? Do you wake up one night and write scores? Do tunes just come out of the middle of nowhere? The acoustic process of creativity has always alluded me. Are there tones you hear on the street that set you off into a world of composition? I wish I could see into your mind.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9rdoot?context=5)|You know, I do always hear music everywhere I go.  If I just sit still for a minute, I'll start hearing patterns in traffic, birds, wind.  Anything.  I think my mind is always looking for interesting sounds that can be ordered and given meaning.  I wish I could shut it off sometimes, to be honest.
[I've always thought that The Lost Room intro and The Walking Dead intro were very similar, at least visually. Do you pick up on any similarities, or am I coo-coo banana crumbs? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9rdwmj?context=5)|I can't say you're coo-coo banana crumbs, but I can't say you're not.

[Hi Bear! Love your work! Kat's Sacrifice and All Along The Watchtower are some of my favorite tracks! Two questions.  Why not release digital? At least from a direct website if not through stores like iTunes and Amazon MP3? I believe the albums can be restricted to require the purchase of the full album.  Some of the most amazing work is starting to turn up in video games. Austin Wintory for Journey as an example. Would you ever consider working on an indie game if it had a real concept and story?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9rk4dj?context=5)|Check out my new label Sparks &amp; Shadows.  [Link to www.bearmccreary.com](http://www.bearmccreary.com/#blog/albums/sparks-shadows) That's my philosophy about doing digital releases.  Expect a lot in the future. As for indie games, I'm way into that.  I already scored and released an album for MOONBREAKERS for my pal Ed Byrne.  I'm also already working on the unofficial sequel to ECCO THE DOLPHIN, called THE BIG BLUE, collaborating with composer Spencer Nilsen and game designer Ed Annunziata. Here's our kickstarter!

[Do you use acousitic instruments? Or a DAW? and if you use a DAW, which one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r78ea?context=5)|Well, I work with Digital Performer and a vast collection of sampled instruments, most of which are custom-made.  However, I'm very picky about using live instruments in the final product.  You'll never hear fake strings or fake winds and brass in my score.  The soloists, orchestra, percussion, guitars, vocals, winds and brass are always live.  (That's why it sounds good!) :)

[Hey Bear,  Long time lover of your music! Would you be interested in scoring a Steampunk series that I created?  Heh.  It's Matt.  True or False, did you perform Prince's 'Kiss' on accordion at Robinson's wedding, or was it a different funk song?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9ra2ir?context=5)|Hey Matt!  Looking forward to your Steampunk webseries!  ;) I definitely played some Prince tune on accordion at that wedding.  Honestly, I don't know why I quit playing accordion at weddings.  I should keep it up.  I could probably get some decent gigs! 
[Whatever happened to Knights of Badassdom? It seems to have completely vanished off the radar.  If the film doesn't end up getting released, do you think there's a possibility that you can get permission to release the soundtrack through your record label?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5nwm?context=5)|Your guess is as good as mine. ""Knights of Badassom"" is an awesome movie, with a fantastic cast. And I dare say, a fantastic score. I had an incredible time scoring it and I'm a little confused as to why it didn't come out a year ago.  I'm hopeful that the right thing will be done and you'll get the chance to see the film and hear my epic score one of these days...
[Hello Mr. Mcreary, first off, fantastic job on the Walking Dead! That soundtrack never fails to give me chills.  I have a few questions,  What is your favorite peice you've ever composed? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r62zk?context=5)|Being a composer is all I've ever wanted to do.  There really was nothing else for me.  When I was five, film music first caught my ear and I was pretty trapped from that point onward.  Luckily for me, I managed to carve out a living.  Because there was no back up plan!
[With Defiance (love the game soundtrack and the TV series so far\), it seems like you have a lot of control over the music. Do you choose the cool not-well-known covers of popular songs at the end of the last couple of episodes? Also, can we expect some moderation with those - I think having one at the end of every single episode would be bit too much.  And what is it like not only creating brand new songs, but songs made by aliens?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4w4i?context=5)|I have control over SOME of the songs.  The Nirvana cover I had nothing to do with for example.  But, the cover of ""Ooh Child"" this week was produced by me, and sung by Raya Yarbrough with whom I frequently collaborate.  As the episodes progress, you'll hear about half the episodes end with a needledrop pop song and half end with a score or song cue that I did. And doing the alien band songs is amazing.  What a challenge!  I have to design alien sounds for instruments AND teach the singers to sing in these alien languages designed by David J. Peterson.  It's a blast!
[Well, from one creative guy to another, do ideas just 'pop into your head'? Or is it more methodical, a evolution stemming from a seed of a thought, like the distant pinprick of a star actually being the light of a supernova flaring up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r8rsi?context=5)|Ideas almost never pop in there (like the Stay Puft marshmallow man!).  I get basic shapes or intrumentation ideas in my head, but I feel more like a sculptor than a painter. I have to chisel away at the marble for hours before I start getting to the details.
[Hi Bear! I love the music in Da Vinci's Demons. What's your favorite thing about composing the score for this show in particular? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r543m?context=5)|""Da Vinci's Demons"" is an amazing opportunity.  Not only do I get to write lush, lyrical melodies and produce the score with a full orchestra, but I also get to explore Renaissance instrumentation and music.  This is something I ignored in school and now I've gone back and done a lot of research.  So, the score has made me a better composer and at the same time, pushed me to write what I think might be my best music yet.
[I read somewhere that in the episode of BSG where Kara imagines her father playing the piano in the bar that they based the character on you.  Can you speak to that? The actor they used does seem to resemble you in photos. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r66ud?context=5)|You know, the character was based in part on me.  I had long talks with the writers as they were coming up with his dialog.  They even auditioned me for the role!  Except it turns out I can't act at all.  :)  The guy who plays the role did an amazing job, and I was there on set to help the piano performances come together.

1dlokh,1,2013-05-03,I [F21] am irrationally jealous of my boyfriend [M21]'s ex-girlfriend and want to stop feeling like this.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dlokh/i_f21_am_irrationally_jealous_of_my_boyfriend/,"How can I keep myself from getting irrationally jealous of my boyfriend's ex-girlfriend?

In a nutshell, my reasons for feeling this way are:

1. I have seen her facebook pictures and she is objectively more attractive than me (very slim, very cute, seems to have many friends)

2. I know that the only reason he and she broke up was because of long distance after high school, so he still cares for her. In a parallel universe, they could be perfect for each other.

3. She shares interests with him that I don't: she's a great singer, actress and performer. He really likes musicals and acts in our college plays.

4. Her parents are really accomplished in the academic world and have helped my boyfriend find internships, while he doesn't really have a relationship with my parents (because they disapprove of me dating a white guy).

I have been dating him for almost 2 years. We are both juniors in college, so his ex and him haven't dated in a very long time. He is a great boyfriend and seems to care for me, but I can't help but think that he has downgraded from his last girlfriend.

Before he and I started dating, he and I were very close friends and he told me intimate details about his ex during that time. This was freshman year, they had broken up due to long distance, and he still had very strong feelings for her. I know details about many aspects of their relationship-- when they first had sex, what her parents do, her interests, why he loved her so much, etc. 
After he realized that he couldn't be with her, he went through an angsty period, and around January of freshman year, he stopped talking about her as much because she had started dating someone new. By this time I had feelings for him. In February 2011 we started dating each other.

For example, I know that because she was a virgin and he respected her, he waited a long time to have sex with her and made sure she felt comfortable (they did so after 6 months of dating). With me, from basically day 1, he has been very touchy-feely and continually pressured me to have sex with him (I was also a virgin). We didn't have sex until 6 months into our relationship but I would constantly have to turn him down/ ask him to please wait until I'm ready. We have since talked about his behavior during the beginning of our relationship and he has apologized. He now always makes sure that I am comfortable about the physical things that we do.

I have not always been so insecure, but sophomore year was a difficult year academically and socially for me. I had a difficult time with classes (we go to a really hard tech school) and even socially, I started becoming jealous of more attractive close friends. I never voiced these insecurities. I think beforehand, I always identified myself as the 'smart girl' but in college, everyone seemed incredibly intelligent. So my new role for myself became 'pretty girl' and when that image (to me) was shattered as I gained weight sophomore year, I started having very low self-esteem.

Junior year has been much better academically. I've been mentally stable and happy, until about a month ago. About a month ago, I began feeling similar emotions of insecurity. I'm not sure what sparked this, since I've been exercising, getting fit, doing well in classes, and enjoying time with my friends. 

I have been seeing a therapist about these feelings, and he suggests that I talk to my boyfriend about how I'm feeling. So today, I admitted that I am seeing a therapist about insecurities regarding his ex-girlfriends. My boyfriend said that luckily he loves only me, but he's glad I told him about how I'm feeling. I didn't mention any of the reasons WHY exactly I felt insecure. 

Is this conversation over? I know this is something I should deal with, considering he's not at fault and I am simply battling with my own emotional problems. But what do I do? My therapist wants me to talk to him more, but I don't know how to bring it up again. My boyfriend didn't really seem to want to talk about it (he quickly switched the conversation topic to 3d printers).

He never compliments academic accomplishments nor my physical appearance, but to solve this problem, I'm not sure if seeking validation from him is the healthiest approach. I just want to at least hear him say that he loves me more than he has ever loved her. Is this wrong and unrealistic? 

TLDR: I keep comparing myself to my boyfriend's ex-girlfriend and can't help but think that she was a better 'catch' than me. How do I block out these feelings?"
1dliig,8,2013-05-02,"I just learned that my girlfriend is pregnant, and I'm absolutely terrified:/ help?",Max_Derpin,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1dliig/i_just_learned_that_my_girlfriend_is_pregnant_and/,"Here's the situation: My girlfriend and I are currently in college, she's a junior (21) and I'm a sophomore (20). We've been dating for 16 months, and have been having protected sex that entire span. We always use condoms, but not birth control. Something must've went wrong last month, because last Thursday (after realizing she was a week late) we got a pregnancy test that confirmed she was pregnant.

Regardless of how unlikely this all is, neither one of us is ready to be parents, are still knee deep in our college education, and don't have nearly enough money between the two of us. I advocated for an abortion, but she is too scared of it and her family would literally disown her if they found out she got one. We're probably going the adoption route.

Pretty much her entire family already knows, but I haven't told anyone in mine yet. I'm absolutely terrified to tell them. I feel like they will never look at me the same. To make things worse, she has an internship for most of the summer in the town where we go to school and is living there, while I have mine in my hometown about 2 hours away. We won't be able to see each other a lot this summer, and she will be by herself over where she lives (her roommates have moved out). I feel unbelievably guilty about not being there for her this summer, even though she repeatedly has told me she'll be ok.

What should I do? How do I tell my parents? They're coming to pick me up from school tomorrow morning to take me home for the summer. My head is literally spinning right now. I'm not ready for this at all:/

tl;dr My girlfriend is pregnant and we aren't ready to be parents. I have no idea how to tell my parents about it all.

**UPDATE:** Sorry for the lack of responses the past couple days, I've been going through a lot. I told my mother last night. She was shocked at first and seems a tad overwhelmed but after talking about it for a while and putting my GF on the phone, she calmed down very quickly. We're both looking at it all as rationally as possible. She is very supportive, but at the same time wants to make sure that my and my GF have multiple plans in place for this. 

My dad's been super stressed recently doing work-related stuff, so I'm holding off on telling him for a couple of days, when he'll be in a better state of mind to handle news like this. My mom thinks it's a good idea too. Hopefully he will take it as well as she has. It's a little weird knowing it's out there now, but my mom isn't treating me any different than before. She said she didn't want me too feel overwhelmed right away, and it's actually really comforting. 

My girlfriend and I are still pretty scared about the upcoming months, but I think we'll be able to get through it. Now the hope is to find the right adoption family. Thanks again for your suggestions and support. I really appreciated it.

Thanks to everyone's help (unbeknownst to you) I have chosen to live in Summerville for these 3 months. It was the right match of price, safety and location for me. I do have a few questions if anyone has any advice:

1) I'm an avid pool player (8-ball or 9-ball) and am looking for the best places to play. I'm especially interested in any summer leagues or tournaments. If nothing else, just advice on places to shoot. It seems like North Park Grill and Fast Break Lounge seem the best but you never know what you're getting with pool halls. I'd hate to walk into a bad situation, lol

2) Where can I play golf on a budget? I don't need a ""cutoff jeans &amp; a wife-beater acceptable"" type course but I don't want to put up a week's play just for one round.

3) Where can I buy health foods and local, free-range meat? Are there any famers markets, etc?

4) Any advice on ""must do's"" over the summer? I'm already planning on doing all the touristy stuff and possibly buying a bike to get a more in depth feel for the town. I'll have my car so I'm open to suggestions in the surrounding region as well.

Thanks a lot! See you all in about 10 days!

Background: I have 2 years before I finish my Computer Science, BS. I switched from Business (I have my AS) to Computer Science. 

I currently have a 3.48 GPA and I'm wondering what my prospects for getting into Graduate school would be, and if a PhD program (4 years isn't it? Or is it more?) would be worth it.

I currently have two interests: Software Development or Research and Development. It's pretty cliche but I simply want to do something important &amp; I don't think I'll enjoy a job that I can't be creative in. I really want to develop useful apps. 

For this reason one of my dream jobs is to work at Google, or IBM. I have a slight interest in AI.

From this subreddit I've picked up that self starting &amp; internships are really useful, but I have other questions.

What are my chances of getting into a good graduate school?

Should I spend the extra time (if I get into grad school) doing my PhD? Or is it a waste of time?

I'm also thinking about spending an extra semester in school to dual-major in math: how useful would that be in the fields I'm interested in?
Or maybe even spending a year extra finishing up the BS in Business Admin and double major Comp Sci + Business.

What else can I do to try to get ahead and seek out a good job?



EDIT:

It seems like I need to do a lot more research on what I'd want to do in research, haha. I've emailed one of my favorite professors to try to get more informed.

Also [czth's](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1dp8ez/should_i_go_for_my_phd_in_computer_science/c9shh6o) link &amp; comment is really useful.

[How did you end up homeless? Also, how did you overcome it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9rwph5?context=5)|I had never met my father before. And my mother died right before I turned 19. Since I was an adult the government offered me no support. So I took the rest of the money from her bank account and bought a car with it where I lived for about 9 months.
 |I overcame it slowly step by step. Being a cancer researcher wasn't my goal. I first started working at a fast food restaurant. I would bathe in the sink of a coffee shop every morning before work. But I got fired for being unsanitary. [I had caught bronchitis from eating at homeless shelters.]
 |Someone at a  local boys &amp; girls club heard my story and knew that I was talented in music and gave me a stable job as a music teacher. I worked there for 2 and a half years. I went back to school to study music but then changed to Biochemistry. I had excellent grades and then applied for internships in 2012.
 |I was rejected 8 times before I got offered  a nearly $8,000 package to do research at the #7 School of Pharmacy in the world. University of Michigan.
 |Then this summer I signed up for an internship at Lawrence Berkeley Labs and was accepted.
[You could make a whole movie out of your life ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s70hx?context=5)|Lol directed by Michael Bay.
[What precipitated your decision to switch from music to biochem? usually there isn't a lot of crossover between those fields and interests (although, oddly, I once spent a summer NSF REU with an undergrad who had made the same switch over\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s5ff1?context=5)|Bluskale do you have facebook there's some things to say to you.
[U of M huh? Go Green.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s1pku?context=5)|Green but yeah Haha. Michigan State is green. U of M is Blue.
[Hey nice! I have a lot of friends at U of M for grad school. Definitely eye'ing it up myself :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9sckfj?context=5)|Go! Amazing school.
[8000$ a year??? wdf how can u survive off that ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s59hi?context=5)|For a summer.

[Someone has to do it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s4hiy?context=5)|Hahah.
[Did you go to college? How did you get in and how did you pay for it? What did you major in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9rwtxr?context=5)|I went to community college for music.  Dropped out. [homeless] Returned for music, Changed to Biochemistry,  Then Chemical Engineering.
 |I received a good amount of financial aid. I also had to take out a lot of student loans. Every year I have to fill out a lot of paperwork proving my situation.
[Real question: What are some examples of the kind of work a ChemE does in cancer research?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9rxeok?context=5)|The good thing about Chemical Engineering is that it requires such a strong background in all sciences that  I have a strong Molecular biology background (as far as courses I've completed). So even though I'm majoring in chemical engineering, I'm going to be doing Molecular and Cellular biology research. So I'll be studying how the body attempts to repair itself against cancer. In short, one of the best things about Chemical Engineering is our ability to work outside the field of Chemical engineering.
[Obligatory reddit question: Which is the cooler disease to have: cancer or AIDS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9rxeok?context=5)|Typically, Chemical engineers concern themselves mostly with how can they produce cheaper pharmaceuticals. But as fields such as nanotechnology develop, a lot of chemical engineers are interested in nanocoating drugs so that way they can target cancer sells more specifically. These new technique hope to snipe out cancer, rather than kill it with a shotgun (chemotherapy).
[Do you have any ideas on how FAFSA and other financial aid could be made easier for low income students? It seems like people who are low income go through enough trouble that filling out exhaustive paper work is one extra hoop.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9scnky?context=5)|It sucks, but it is free money.
[I just got done bombing a final in Gen Chem II today. How many more ICE tables and acid-base titrations will I need to do before chemistry classes gets interesting again?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9rxxff?context=5)|Good news I have for you is that when it comes to doing research what you learn in your lab classes is by far more applicable to your actual work than what you learn in the lecture class. It also really depends on what field of chem you want to get into but I've never had to do an acid-base titration after Chem II, but I have had to use a photospectrometer dozens of times.
 |If you're good at really understanding chemistry and predicting what will happen you'll like O chem. But no matter what your skills you'll die in P chem. whats your major? wand what school do you go to?
[Your chemical engineering is different from what I understand it to be. 100% of the chemical engineers I know work in mines or in factories/plants, and none of them work in pharmaceuticals.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9sb1cj?context=5)|People with degrees in Chemical engineering do a wide variety of different things, I know one who became a lawyer. But if someone make produces large scale of pharmaceuticals that's definitely chemical engineering.
[You're still in school right?? Are they paying you to research while at school?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s1xxe?context=5)|Happy Cakeday btw.
 |Yes! I get paid pretty well. Definitely not going to be homeless this summer.
[Wait, do you mean you're sill homeless and you'll be able to leave this summer or that you're not gonna go back to being homeless?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9sbcb4?context=5)|No I'm not still homeless. 
[May have been asked (I'm too lazy to check\) but do you have any religious standpoint?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s48ot?context=5)|I am not religious. I consider myself an atheist. Though I would like to point out some of the best scientists I have worked with are Christians and they did not let their religion interfere with the integrity of their research.
 |Religion is what you make it. 
[I hear something like 80% of homeless youth are either sexually assulted or sexually propositioned within 3 months of being on the streets. From your experience, are these statistics accurate? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9ry7as?context=5)|I think I was really lucky to be an overweight black male which kept me in the other 20% but yes definitely. Mostly women and gay men that are propositioned. They usually end up pregnant (one of them by a social worker). I'm glad my sister was lucky enough to be under 18 and ended up in foster care.
[Have you contacted your sister at all since you last saw her? And was she aware of your situation? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9sa3gi?context=5)|We always stalk she's doing well in school I think she'll even do better than me.
[I keep seeing facebook posts from these ""green"" and ""conspiracy"" facebook pages about how Pharmaceutical companies already have a cure for cancer but don't release it because they make more money treating the disease than curing it, how certain fruits can completely cure cancer without the nasty effects of chemo, how marijuana is the best cure for cancer, ect. Now I'm no expert on cancer, me still being a high school senior and all, but I'm assuming this is all blatant bullshit. What are your thoughts on this? Btw keep up the great work man!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s0evf?context=5)|Hahahah .
 |Well refer to this for cancer being curable. [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9rzk3f)
 |America does have an obsession with Pharmaceuticals though, but we have to ask why is that. The best medicine is exercise, good sleep, good food, and lots of hydration.  But what happens when doctors tell people to stop drinking, stop smoking, or to lose weight. They get angry and they don't stop. They would rather take a pill.
 |Don't trust any science you read on facebook. Science is skewed in the media, even online. Really the best thing to do always is find the primary source and read the research yourself. If it doesn't link backto a website like nature.com, science.com, or some other scholastic journal and the publication isn't highly technical describing what exactly is being done, don't trust it!
 |Cannabis isn't evil but there are some people who are convinced Cannabis can cure all diseases, fix the economy, and bring world peace.  But these people tend to not to be the ones actually doing anything about it so take it with a grain of salt.
[There is a conspiracy theory that humans already have the cure to cancer but do not release it because it prevents overpopulation. Thoughts on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9rz6og?context=5)|Really frustrates me. I understand how people can see that but once you really understand what cancer is and how it works you will see this is not the truth.
 |First Cancer isn't 1 disease, it is a category of literally hundreds of diseases with all different mechanisms. There is no 1 cure for all cancer. It might be nearly impossible to construct one.
 |Another thing is that if 1 company did have the cure to cancer they would make billions off of it and easily dominate the pharmaceutical market. You can't keep it secret, we couldn't keep the Nuclear Bomb a secret, let alone the cure to cancer.
 |But I understand that people don't trust the government. but if anyone thinks that we have a cure to cancer are keeping it secret, they should come in the lab and try to do the actual research and see how tough it actually is. They should read the papers we have to read and understand how complex it is.
 |Steve Jobs was a billionaire but couldn't buy this secret cure for cancer? But I guess a conspiracy theorist would think maybe he did and faked his death?
 |Another way that we know its not true, is that even if they wanted to make it exclusive, they could just make it expensive. They don't need to keep it a secret. Everyday in the developing world people die from diseases that are already cheap and easily curable. Basically they don't need to keep its existence a secret to stop you from accessing it, they have many other methods.
 |Most of this is caused by scientific illiteracy which is a fault of the scientific community as well as the general population. 
[I took a graduate course on the biology of cancer. its amazing how many mechanisms/routes there are. i was a little troubled about how impressed i was by the whole thing. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s6uwh?context=5)|Really complex, I wish there were an easy way to explain it to people. Most people don't even reaally know what it is.
[Thank you for taking the time to reply, just curious what an experts opinion was versus the people usually discussing it. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s6dnn?context=5)|I'm glad someone is thinking critically out there, we need more people like you!
[Wow, this is really cool! Apart from the whole homeless topic, what is cancer research like? Is there a process or method to it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9rxo65?context=5)|Well There's many difference approaches. Some people are interested in surgical procedures, gene therapy, new medicines, revising old medicines, targeting the whole body, or targeting specific cells. But no matter what area you're in it takes a lot of literary research. A lot of reading the previous results of a lot of other people's research so you can draw your own conclusion. I'm working on someone else's research team so I won't be deciding what we do, then once we've figured out our objective and the procedure its running a lot of tests. A lot of measuring, a lot of flashing lights through liquids. A lot of gloves and a lot of measuring.
[Wow, I didn't know the research was so diverse! On another note, how's funding for cancer research in general?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9ry49f?context=5)|Its great right now but some people are trying to cut it!

[That's really impressive, to not only overcome being homeless but to continue working towards self-improvement through education. Congradulations on fighting through and not giving up. What would you say was your biggest challenge through the entire ordeal, and what was your primary motivation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9ry515?context=5)|People will promise to help you out and then get sick of you in less than a week. Sometimes you just survive because its the only thing you can do, and you simply just believe in yourself. It also sucks to realize you're the only person you can rely on but by going through that entire ordeal you never lose that drive.
[What has been the biggest change in your outlook in life from your time spent homeless?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s37mv?context=5)|Before I would hope to be given opportunities.  While being homeless I learned I had the make my opportunities.
[As a music lover, I'd imagine that there are certain songs, albums, types of music, of ""vibes"" that you associate with your story.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s67kn?context=5)|This song isn't fast but I'd always think of those days when I hear this one.
[Why do all my farts smell like baloney? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s594j?context=5)|Sorry I don't know. Wish i could help you out.
[What is your best piece of advice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s6ame?context=5)|Improvise. And always move forward. You never know what life will bring at you and when it will be taken away. 
[I just graduated undergrad with a Bio degree, been looking for jobs in Research labs. Mind telling me where you started in terms of looking for a job/internship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s53yo?context=5)|[Link to people.rit.edu](http://people.rit.edu/gtfsbi/Symp/summer.ht) [Link to www.nsf.gov](http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.cf) [Link to science.energy.gov](http://science.energy.gov/wdts/suli) [Link to www.pathwaystoscience.org](http://www.pathwaystoscience.org/Undergrads.asp)
[, congrats to you on your success. i wish you the best going forward.  second, i wanted to ask you what how you would describe the importance (ratio mix\) of 1. your determination/psychological hardiness to see through your difficult circumstances and 2. your raw intelligence/talent as it applied to the areas of academia you pursued.  How would you rate that mix as determining factors of your success? (50/50, 30/70, etc.\) ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9ryy5a?context=5)|That's a really hard question! Since it's pretty much these two factors, Determination and planning. To get through the difficult circumstances is definitely 60/40 Its too easy to just settle with sustaining yourself, which you will learn only works for short time. You have to always plan for the future when you're homeless, so it takes a considerable amount of intelligence. And its really trying on your willpower.
 |As far as school. The hardest part of school for me is simply organization and following directions. Science and engineering are too competitive to rely on natural talent. Only freaks of nature cannot study, no matter how smart you are you're probably not one of them.
 |The keys to doing well in science and math are simply. You have to schedule all your time. Schedule your study time, hw time, following those goals. Maintain your health and mind, eat well, exercise, and sleep. Sleep is one of the most important things. Schedule breaks too.  Being a successful student has only about 7% to do with intelligence. That 7% may or may not be a letter grade. 75% is using your time effectively and following directions. Even if you're an idiot you can pass any class if you simply follow directions and use your time wisely. Don't multi-task. I don't' even use music when I study. NO! TV under any circumstances. the other 18% is maintaining your mind, (sleep, staying hydrated)
[Do you tell people you've met after you we're homeless that you were homeless for a time or do you try and hide it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s6tsc?context=5)|Good question. Very few people know. I woudnt say I try to hide it. But I do keep it to myself. I never know if I'm applying for internships whether it hurts or helps me. I believe that it would be hard for me to obtain a leadership position. I will tell my class this week in a speech I'm doing.
[Did you have background education prior to biochemistry? Or did you learn everything during the time you applied for the classes?  There are courses I would love to take, but then my marks were not that great for them during high school..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s5yfg?context=5)|I took Chemistry in High school .first semester I got a C, second semester I got an incomplete.  Chemistry and math were my worst subjects in High school. But I was really good at bio.  I started college in Trig and I'm taking Multivariable Calculus next semester.
[You are attaching yourself to social Darwinism on purpose? Excerpt from the Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia entry: ""The theory was used from the late 19th century to support laissez-faire capitalism and political conservatism. Social Darwinism declined as scientific knowledge expanded.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s9cwy?context=5)|True, people Darwinism mostly said that certain races were better than others. But what i think blimp is trying to say that individuals should compete rather than races. 
[Did you ever feel like you would never get out of homelessness? If you did, how did you keep yourself from falling too far into depression?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s9pkq?context=5)|I did but every time I didn't plan for the future, I ended up in a shittier situation. I couldn't help but continuously plan for the future until it eventually snowballed. 
[What's your favorite color?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9rwr91?context=5)|Black but that's more of a shade not a color. Then green.
[Actually did you have a day where you wanted to give up on everything? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s5ssi?context=5)|All the time, when I got fired from my job was pretty bad. But I didn't have any choice other than to keep going.

1dofos,9,2013-05-04,"Trouble with a monster landlord, badly in need of advice. (Warning, enormous wall of text)",[deleted],toronto,https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/1dofos/trouble_with_a_monster_landlord_badly_in_need_of/,"I apologize in advance for a VERY long-winded and possibly slightly incoherent explanation of my situation. I want to make sure I include all of the details and I've barely been sleeping since this nonsense started.

 

In December 2011, I moved into an all inclusive basement unit of a 6 unit duplex. The landlord always seemed to be a bit... odd, but I had mostly no issues for a few months. 

 

In May 2012, my S.O. moved in and the landlord said that she required an increase of 75 dollars per month, to cover utilities. I did not argue, and signed a new lease with my S.O. on it. I have since come to find that this increase is illegal, but over a year has now passed so I don't know if it'd be admissible in court. She did not file for an above guideline increase with the board.

 

Soon after, the superintendent of the building, who had been there almost 30 years, was suddenly moving out. She didn't seem bitter about it so I did not question it. The landlords then began to renovate the apartment, claiming they were doing if for their son to live in.

 

Then, about mid-march of this year, the LL sent me a message stating ""Hi [laurlala], We are going to rent out the main fllor unit (above you). If u know someone who wants it, let me know. It's 1200 + hydro""
(That is with the exception of the [], the exact text. I have record of all of my sms interactions backed up to my email for reference, as things started getting more complicated from here.) 
I asked her in person something along the lines of ""doesn't your son need the unit?"" and she told me that he did not, and he was instead moving to their unit. 

 

Once again I did not question it. We moved in april 1st, Then the actual issues began.

 

On our lease it states that any people who are to live on the premises full time are to be approved by the landlord in writing. I did not want to rock the boat, so I asked her how this would occur, since my SO and I now had a 2 bedroom unit with a bedroom going unused. She said she had to discuss it with her property management company, and husband, then told us that a roommate would cost an extra TWO HUNDRED dollars a month. That's a 16% increase in rent on a house built/rented prior to 1991, which, if I had done my research correctly, was illegal. I asked her repeatedly to discuss this and she dodged my question. 
 
 
 
(LL= landlord, OP= me SO=My significant other. Just in case there's any confusion)

LL:I'm just waiting for a reply from a property mgr on another rental, so we know what to charge

OP:For sure. she's able to move in asap, so just say the word

LL:Your proposed room mate will need to fill out an application also

OP:That's fine, I'll give it to her whenever you can provide it

next day

*OP: Did you get an answer regarding an additional tenant?

*LL: Yes. It is $1400.  I told SO last night. I'll get the application for u today

*OP: Can we please discuss that increase tonight?

*OP: Will you be available around 8:30?

*LL: Is friend coming to do the application?

*OP: I'll call and ask if she's available

*LL: Ok, otherwise I'll leave the application under your door. Then we need to exchange keys

*OP:She has to fill it an application, but cant she also live with us as an additional tennant, not on the lease?

*LL: She first needs to fill out the appllication, then I need to add her to the lease and amend the rent

*OP:Are you available tonight to discuss this?

*LL: She goes on the lease.

*OP: She doesn't know how long she'll be in toronto, as she is looking for internships worldwide for her thesis. She doesn't feel comfortable signing on for a year.

*LL: She can do a month to month. Its 60 days notice to vacate

*OP: I'd much rather discuss this in person

*LL: U can call me

*OP: I'm at work

*LL: Ok. Talk later

 

When I got home, I knocked on her door and asked if she was able to discuss the increase at that time. She said she'd meet me in my unit. 
She stumbled in, drunk, at which point I showed her highlighted sections of the RTA, as well as some internet resources for tenants and landlords that I found, clearly outlining this exact situation, and informed her that I had come to find that her actions were illegal. She then went on a rant about how she had been ""in the business for years"" and that she had sued people (can this be interpreted as a threat?). She then let it slip that she ""kicked out the old superintendent"" and was ""running the place [her]self now"". LL also told us about how not having a name on the lease was a liability, citing a situation with Toronto Metro Housing, in which a grandmother on a sliding scale rent allowed her daughter to live undocumented in an apartment, got caught and lost her court case. She then wandered through the apartment claiming that she needed to test a key for the back door. 

 

Now my SO and I are not unreasonable people, and we understand that even though we are covering hydro costs, there is an inherent increase in the costs of water and wear and tear with another tenant. We offered to meet her in the middle, and pay an extra 100 dollars a month. She said that she would discuss it with her husband, we said thank you, and that we love the unit, and she left. 

 

The next day, this is the sms conversation that ensued.

 

*LL: After talking to my husband, he suggested we meet halfway between 100 and 200 and compromise at $150 for your room mate

*OP: One hundred was the halfway point

*LL: No, the rent is 1200 for 2 people. I want 1400, you want 1300?

*OP: Well theoretically i wanted 1200.

*LL: My offer has always been 1400. We did check a previous lease, and it was ano extra $150 and that was 5 
years ago

*LL: In reality, you signed a contract

*LL: So 1350 is $450 each on a 3 way split

*OP:I just spoke to the residential tenancies board. They told me that that which you are asking is an illegal rent increase, and the portion on the pertaining to additional roommates in unenforceable by the rta. I also asked about the metro housing situation. Sliding-scale rent based on income has nothing to do with a set rent not based on income. I'd like to go about this in the most amicable way possible, as you have been a fantastic landlord thus far, and I love the unit. I'd like to have new roommate on the lease too as it makes things easier on 
SO and I as well. A 12% rent increase is just too exorbitant.

*LL: Ok no problem laurlala. U decide what u want to do and let me know. Thanx

*OP: I'm willing to go about this your way in terms of paperwork and the lease, and I'm even willing to discuss a raise in price calculated by the overall costs of utilities. I really don't think we've been unreasonable in all of this, and I hour I haven't created any bad blood.

*OP: Would you like to discuss this in person tonight?

*LL:No, my husband told me not to worry about. Thanx

*OP: Would he like to discuss it with us?

*LL: No, you go ahead and do what you want. No need to worry about it. Thanx

*OP: Okay, well we'd like to amend the lease to include her name if possible.

*LL: No that's ok, we'll just leave everything status quo

 

After that, she was a ghost. She watched my roommate move in, didnt even say hello to her. She'd say hi to me if I said it first, but otherwise ignored our presence completely.
 


May 1st at 11:15 pm, she serves us an N12 form, stating that the landlord or landlord's family member requires use of the unit. I find this suspicious for two reasons - when she has moved out the previous tenant, i was under the impression that it was for her son. furthermore, she changed the name of the landlord to her husband, and some person who apparently lives in their unit, who i have never seen or heard of. (I have a suspicion that this is a parent of an international student who was due to mov into our former apartment, and that they have struck a deal with this person to get us out.) I went to their apartment where I knocked on the door, and she opened and I said ""what the hell is this?"". She told me to read it. I said I had, and repeated ""what the hell is this?"" I told her that she knows that this is bullshit, and that I found it very suspicious that her family just gave up personal use of the unit and needed it again, a month later, after signing a lease with a tenant. She told me to take it up with the landlord. (who is apparently no longer her)

 

The next day, I get a letter saying that I came to their house at the wee hours of the night, banged on their door, and harassed and verbally abused the now landlords wife in an ""emotional and hysterical manner"" Then they accused me of doing damage to their home by slamming the front door (the glass in their front door has had a crack in it since October of last year)



I sent texts to the number with which my landlord had ALWAYS contacted me for the past year pleading with them to be reasonable, and asking if we had until the end of our lease to leave. Once again, that night, a letter slips under our door, more threatening this time, and full of more false accusations and exaggerations, informing us that we are on a month to month lease, and that we had sixty days to leave. It also informed us that they had not received our rent (we've been trying to figure out what the hell to do), and called us to tribunal regarding this.
 


Our power was shut off the next day due to repairs that i had forgotten about. I asked her to fix it:

*OP: Our power is not on. Please fix it.

*LL: You were sent a notice on April 30, 2013 about electrical upgrades to the meters and there would be power outages between the hours of 10 am and 4 pm

*LL: Also, you were hand delivered a letter from my husband, [name] on May 2, 2013 to communicate with him in writing for any issues you may have. Thank you

*OP: Oh I apologize, I thought this was still a valid method of communication with y.all. Does he have a cell that I can text him on?

*LL: You can txt him at [phone number]

*OP: Thank you, very sorry to bother you.

 

ANOTHER letter slips under our door that night informing me that I have been harassing the former landlord via text after being told only to do so in writing (Is text not writing?) and that they are going to sue us for a laundry list of accusations. It also told me that I had ""vehemently refused to contact toronto hydro to put the hydro bill in [my] name"" After I had emailed them multiple times the month earlier to do so, and they got back to me yesterday (may 3rd) at which point we set up our account. 

 
I have no idea what to do. I plan to find another place, as no place is worth this level of harassment, but I want it legally on record that all of this occurred, so that if any tenants have issues in the future, that the RTA board has proof of earlier complaints. How can I best proceed?
 
tl;dr :landlord wants more money illegally, does not get more money illegally, attempts eviction, makes our lives hell."

Today we Celebrate **EVERYTHING** StarWars. Here at /r/SubredditOfTheDay its become a time honored tradition. It started when SROTD first [started itself.](http://redd.it/h3ppm) And last year's feature was even [better.](http://redd.it/t6ldf) I don't think I can top it. I mean for god's sakes man, there was a poem, a prologue and even a disclaimer! [Ah....](http://i.imgur.com/JQSzoAN.gif) We'd also want to take this moment and honor the fine Jedi MODS Masters and their wonderful achievements. But to do so, you need to know their past. Here is a brief history. 

A long time ago in a subreddit far far away. /u/Noche created /r/StarWars and it was good. Then came a mysterious fellow by the name of /r/jaxspider who promised to bring peace to the ~~galaxy~~ subreddit. And so he did. He vanquished the blogspam siths and did away with the boring default CSS stylesheet. He formed a council of wise Jedi masters to help him, first came /u/Wazow the ever present and motivated one. Then one day /u/ugnaught bumped into them and it was destiny. Over time the council has grown and become even more powerful. Even today they work hard to keep the peace in the subreddit. ~~For the night is dark and full of terror~~ Something something darkside. They are updating the rules as of late so stay on the lookout for that mod post.

Normally we ask the mods questions to make you, the reader, know more about the subreddit. But this is Star Wars. Its an American institution at this point. If you don't know about Star Wars... have you been living under a rock for 40 years? Go to /r/StarWars, HoverZoom over the pictures, comment in the discussion threads, and enjoy yourself. If you love any part of Star Wars, be it light saber battles, Expanded Universe questions or even  something nostalgic this is the right place for you.

&gt; To spice up this feature I'll  ask you the readers some questions instead!

&gt;&gt;1. What was your first Star Wars memory?
2. Whats your favorite scene and why?
3. How excited are you about the new movies?
4. Would you let the wookie win?
5. In your own words why is The Empire Strikes Back the perfect sequel? 
6. How would you torture Jar Jar Binks to the death?
7. Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, young Obi Wan Kenobi. Fuck / Marry / Kill. Go.
8. Star Wars is not without it's cringe worthy moments. What real life moment related to Star wars do you still cringe to this day?
9. What one thing would you like to be officially retconned out of existence? 

**Warning** If I made a mistake or grammar error, please be patient with me. I haven't featured a post in a while. What with all these wonderful writers &amp; super eager interns doing amazing work, I've become quite rusty."

Delightful cigar. Great draw and survived the heavy winds on the golf course- smoked it down to a nub.

A nice easy smoke, pretty light but enjoyable and a great stick to just pass the time as I watch some games. 

Camacho Triple Maduro-
Absolutely kicked my ass, had it over a bonfire this evening and my head was spinning but I loved every second of it. 

Just started smoking cigars slightly more than a year ago and trying to broaden my tastes and brand exposure. Suggestions?

I'm also okay with traveling within the Central Florida area, or further, provided that my home base can remain in Gainesville.

Anyway, if anyone does know of any leads in the area (technical or otherwise; I'm pretty open to anything), it would be of huge help. I can also send you my resume in a PM, along with my LinkedIn profile and email address for better correspondence. Thanks again for any help that you can provide!

*the case and PSU were in a combo so I arbitrarily split the total price.


When I'm at my apartment at school, this will be my workstation and battlestation.  I'll be playing games like StarCraft 2, Metro 2033, Crysis, etc. and doing work in NX/SolidWorks as well as Illustrator and Photoshop.  I am on a tight budget though, so please keep build suggestions under $700.  

My main concerns are:

* Money. I *am* splurging a little while on my internship, but I would definitely like to save as much as possible while building a good value machine.
* Compatibility.  I've tried to do my research for this, so I feel like the parts are all pretty good choices for what I'd like to do.  I did notice the PCPartPicker alert about how my mobo has USB 3.0 headers for a case with USB 2.0 front panel ports, but from some Googling, it seemed like it would be okay.  Of course, I'll take any help I can get.
* Timing.  I started buying these parts over time to take advantage of sales, and I'm assuming that the next big sales will come around for Memorial Day weekend.  My plan is to buy the rest of the components at around that time, unless I can get them on sale before that.

I am not going to immediately overclock, but would like to have the option in the future.  Please critique this build and help me figure out what I could do better!

Thanks in advance, BaPC!"

Stuck. 22, out of University for a year, still a waiter, my hobbies dont seem interesting anymore.",[deleted],getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1drc9q/just_kinda_stuck_22_out_of_university_for_a_year/,"I thought I would come here seeking a little advice. 
I am 22 and from the UK. I graduated university last year in Music Business (to some its a joke degree, however Music Industry is all I've ever wanted to do. Plus such a transformative industry riddled with uncertainty intrigues me, you have to be so well rounded for it). 
 
  Anyway, I have played drums or 8/9 years and now I work 42+ hours a week. The job is very busy constantly, quite stressful. I started learning HTML, CSS, jQuery, Java, and I also started learning Japanese. I have been studying these things for 7/8 months and now all I do is work, come home, have a beer and go to bed. I see my girlfriend as often as I can, and I have a horrible predicament where internships turn me down in order to give the position in order to give somebody with less experience an opportunity. On the flip-side though no one will employ me because I dont have enough experience. 
    
Now I get up each day, sit in bed for an hour or two then get up. I have nothing to get up to anymore, my hobbies, my HTML computer stuff etc. I know nobody who shares that shares my interests in real life. I cant talk to anyone about anything I care about without boring them to death. I don't play drums much anymore, I haven't practise Japanese in weeks, and I lazily go over my coding.
    
What do I do? I get up quite early, eat well, drink lots of water, I feel I should either apply for jobs I have no interest in and give up on what I want to do for a couple of years and live the normal 9-5 with weekends rather than 12 hour shifts that start at midday with no weekends/ evenings/days off. I just like being a waiter as if I get an internship I can be more flexible with my hours and work around it while paying rent etc. 
    
I apologise if the format of this seems terrible, but any advice, stories, direction I would appreciate it. This isn't normal is it? It can't be.

edit: I a word."
1dr90n,3,2013-05-05,How do I stop being so angry?,GravidRak,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1dr90n/how_do_i_stop_being_so_angry/,"Here's a rundown of the people involved for clarity:

J: boyfriend of six years. Relationship was rocky, lots of emotional abuse punctuated by good times. We lived together for over two years then separated after a domestic violence situation. The day after I found I was pregnant and told him about 2 weeks later. He moved in with his mom and I moved in with my Foster parents. I told him he could cut contact and not worry about me or the baby and that I wouldn't come after him for child support. He said he would like to make it work. We lived apart for the pregnancy and when our son was ten weeks old I moved in with him and his family for 2.5 years. Last year we moved into a rental house and had our civil wedding ceremony in December.

E: met her about two years ago as she was going through a painful breakup. Her boyfriend had cheated on her. She found out she was pregnant right after and I helped her throughout. She and the dad tried to make it work, but she ended up basically cheating on him and dumping him him 2 months into a year lease just as he lost his job. I advised her against getting back together with him and moving in with him, especially when she was more-or-less with this other Guy. Everything got ugly, but I supported her and ended up being her doula and breastfeeding support. 

Three months after the wedding, j blindsided me and separated from me. Two days later, he moved e in to our bedroom. I was too dumbstruck to protest. Her daughter was 9 months old and e basically let her trash the house with her finger foods. I became a maid. My son was confused and upset and I didn't make waves as to not upset him further. I stayed her friend for some reason. This went on for a month. Two weeks in, I became suicidally depressed and told both e and j I needed her to leave because I was going to end up killing myself. My son was becoming more erratic and upset. 

Neither cared. I found myself thinking my son would be better off without me and realized I was in the bathroom with a straight razor and a bottle of muscle relaxers. I put them up, called my psych and then called a friend, S, went over to his house and told him everything, sobbing. He is actually J's friend as well, but j told me to go talk to him. S was disgusted and furious and has given me his house as a place of solitude since. 

Anyway, e and j had a falling out because she was riding the line between two guys and j asked me for another chance. I gave it. He lasted a week before he was talking to her again about dreams, torture of being apart, and etc. I told him to.get his shit together and separated, but eventually told him I couldn't trust him and this relationship wasn't going to work. 

I'm stuck in this lease with him for 10 more months. I have no self-respect, pride, self-esteem, anything. I feel subhuman. I'm incredibly depressed when I'm in this house. I feel empty and the.only time I feel joy is when I'm with my son or S. J is still talking and hanging with E, even though he hates her kid. He regrets what he did and resents me for not wanting to be with him. I am so angry at him and e to the point of hatred sometimes. I don't want to be because I wont be able to bear the next 10 months. I need to be civil. The last straw for me was me trying to call him to to pick up milk for our son to have him reject my call and find out he has been forbidden to answer my call when he's with her. We also all work at the same place, which really rocks.

They feel they were in the right. Nobody has ever hurt me so badly in my life. In addition, j has told me he.only had the wedding to ""shut me up"". My youngest sister is happily married and expecting her first and my middle sister's boyfriend is custom creating a ring and planning a perfect proposal while she's in China on an internship. I feel so jealous and betrayed. I have decided to never pursue a relationship again and just focus on my son. What kills me is j is taking my son because a) he makes more money and I will have to work two jobs to stay nearby (I.don't believe in child support in this case) and b) I don't want to risk this level of depression returning and affecting my child. I probably sound like the worst mother ever and I have sobbed myself to sleep nightly over the guilt.

I'm getting into counselling and just trying to focus on my time with my son and the fun and long talks I have with S. He really helps to center and rebuild me. Oh, and I've lost 53 pounds in two months on a keto diet/exercise regimen and only have 63 more to go til my weight goal! 

Does anyone have any tips to defeat the.rage? I just don't know what to do? I think I.have rolled the pain in a shell of.anger as to not feel it.

Thanks for reading. :)

She had a nasty temperament, very low social skills, and did middling work at best , now somehow got a great job.  

It bothers me that those who excelled at their school and worked their ass off at internships or jobs are being left out in the cold. 

The nasty person is still at her current library job, where I haven't heard good things, but because her department head was meek and lazy the nasty one was never reprimanded and when used as a references apparently didn't want to upset her employee. 

Try to sabotage the new hire by letting the school know? Just ignore it? Find her weakness and commit a fun prank to mess with her?

I would love to think that the universe will correct itself and the good job will turn out to be one where she will have to actually do work. But the nasty one has gotten others to do her work in the past. "

I'm a third year computer science student. I'm going to starting a year and a half long internship in a few days.

Personally, I have little experience in ""real"" programming. I've had a couple of apps in the App Store. 

The position is of a mobile/web developer. I'll be starting of as QA and then (hopefully) moving up to a developer role during the course of the internship.

I'm sure tons of people here will have experience either being an intern or mentoring one. I was hoping to get some advice on how to get the most out if this internship. 

Any thoughts, comments, advise - I'll greatly approximate it all! :)

Thank you very much!"

One of love, loss, more loss, mistakes, hard work, redemption, and success.",DocAuch,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/1dqetu/my_story_one_of_love_loss_more_loss_mistakes_hard/,"For backstory, I'm 25-years-old. I got my Bachelor's in Geography from a school in NW Ohio. I still live at home with my parents. I've worked at McDonald's since I was 16, so 8.5 years. 

This is my story (so far). It really took off a few years ago.

Christmas 2011. I was in a relationship with a girl, my first and only serious one, for about 1.5 years. We had a lease to live together in the fall. She was on a Christmas Break trip with her dad in Cancun. She called the first few nights to let me know how her trip was going, but stopped a few days in. I thought nothing of it. Mostly because I spent the entire week building a custom-designed table for our future apartment. She came back Christmas Day and I surprised her with the table in front of my whole family. It was a great moment. 

The next day she tells me we had to talk. ...What. She sits me down and tells me she had been hooking up with another guy pretty much all week in Cancun. I was devastated, but willing to give her a second chance to make it work. It just wasn't the same though. 

I spent that New Year's drinking alone watching Avatar's special features haha. I was so alone, living at home with my parents. 

Things lasted a few more days until she called and broke up with me. That was January 9th. It kicked off a pretty terrible week. Later that week, my 35-year-old cousin hung himself. My mom, a breast cancer survivor, was unexpectedly in the hospital (turned out to be dehydration), and a few days later my best friend's grandfather died. All in one week. Not to mention, at work I was electrocuted one day, stuck part of my hand in a fryer, and my car slid off the road early in the morning. That week was hell. 

Also looming in the distance was the uncertainty of graduation. I was a Geography major and had fulfilled all of my requirements except finding an internship in the field. It would have been possible for me to not get my degree because I couldn't find a job. Feels a little backwards, doesn't it? (But that argument is neither here nor there). 

I was in a really rough spot, so I took to my fraternity (yeah, I'm an actual bro) and laid everything out to them in an email. I'm a pretty introverted person, so my problems are often internalized, but I just really needed some help. 

After that, I got really close with some of the best dudes I know. It was the perfect remedy for the negativity in my life. I got happier, got an internship, got over the ex. Things were looking up. Summer started and I left my job at McDonald's to start my internship. Life was good...and then I fucked it up...

Out drinking one night with some friends, I decided I wanted to go home. I woke up about an hour later as my car was fading off the road into a 6-ft ditch. Yep. I'm a dumbass and lucky no one was hurt. I was facing an OVI charge, which would surely screw over my future. I lawyered up and manage to get it dropped to a Reckless Operation, due to a number of issues with the police's procedures and reports. As part of the deal, I was sentenced to 30 days in jail. Thankfully 27 of those were suspended and I was placed on a 2-year unsupervised probation. The other 3 days were assigned to a driver's intervention program. 

Facing almost $3000 in total charges related to my accident, I had no choice but to get to work. I was granted work privileges, so I went back to work at McDonalds. I let the internship know what had happened, as it was transportation related, and they were okay with it. They let me finish out my term there. 

For almost 3 months, I would wake up at 6am, work the internship from 7a-4p, drive to McDs to work 5p-10p, then head home and sleep. I did that Monday-Friday, plus an 8-hour shift on Saturdays. I had almost no social life. It was exhausting, but necessary. I set myself up for it and had to deal with the consequences. It was no one's fault but my own. 

The internship ended in September of 2012. I was not offered an extension due to ""budget constraints."" So back to McDonalds it was. I had been a manager there throughout college, so that's how I invested most of my time while looking for a ""real job."" 

Application after application, resume after cover letter, email after follow-up email. I never got an interview. Not a single one. Kept sending them out regardless of how defeating it was. It was disheartening. So many of my friends were graduated and getting jobs, making money, getting girls, etc, etc, etc. and here I was...  a 24-year-old college graduate, living at home with his parents, in the middle of nowhere, on probation, working full-time as a Manager at McDonalds. 

For far too long, that is how I would value myself. I was constantly comparing my situation to that of my peers, and deriving my value and self-worth from that. I was down. I was low. I was ready to give up the job hunt and accept my fate that I would never do anything bigger or better that just work at McDonalds the rest of my life. 

Fast forward to February 2012. Still working at McDs, just grinding it out. It sucked, but I really liked most of the people I worked with. Early February though, I was hit again. One of my crew, 19-years-old, overdosed on a variety of things and died unexpectedly. Great kid. Saved up money to go to school. Was set to go to college in the fall. Then he was gone. This really shook a lot of people, myself included. Too damn young to go out like that. JC, my man, I miss you. 

March rolls around and I'll be damned, tragedy strikes again. Three sorority sisters from my university were struck head-on by a wrong-way driver 10-miles out of town on their way to Spring Break. One of those girls was my date to the final formal I had gone to with my fraternity the year before. SH, you are an angel. 

So much loss and pain in the two biggest areas of my life. My coworkers reeling from the loss. My university and Greek community reeling from their losses. Then I headed into April. I was at work and got a phone call from an old friend that one of my friends that I had grown up with was in an accident and things weren't looking good. I come from a really small town and had grown up with this girl pretty much my whole life. She was the second girl I ever kissed. She was one of my dearest friends. I left work to go up to the hospital to wait, as the doctors were running tests to check for brain activity. 

It was odd. I had grown apart a little from a lot of people back home, even though I still lived close-by. We are an incredibly close group of friends though, and so many of my best friends from my youth were there. It was a reunion of the worst kind. 

Anyway, waiting for the results still kind of haunts me. I was there when they delivered the results. I was there to hear her family howl when announced she had no brain activity and was only being kept going by life support. I was there to grieve with my close friends and family. I was there to say goodbye to a beautiful soul. AG, I love you, girl. 

Two years of just awful experiences. So low. So much loss and pain. Throughout so much of the years though, I lost focus of what was important in life. I focused more on being financially successful than leading a successful and meaningful life. 

Then I found this sub. It was almost like a switch went off after everything I had been though. My introverted and analytical nature, coupled with the motivation rampant here, made me realize that happiness and value are products of my own mindset and efforts. Quote after quote from here rang true. I began to litter the wall of my bedroom with post-its, each with messages taken from posts here. 

""Feed the right wolf.""
""Just because life is hard, doesn't mean life is bad.""
""Empty wallets never held anyone back; empty hearts and empty minds hold them back.""
And on and on and on. I began to keep a journal, to keep everything in perspective and as an outlet for my thoughts.

From there, still living at home, I decided to just make the very best of whatever situation I was in. I made a conscious decision to no longer consider my self-worth from the money in my wallet. I figured if I couldn't be rich in money, I would be rich in spirit and life. 

By now we're at Summer 2012. I started working out and dropped 10 pounds. I got a girlfriend. It only lasted a month because she moved, but whatever haha. I started a new position a McDs, which came with more money. I began to save up and budget appropriately. I was making all the right moves necessary to be happy and successful in life. I spent the rest of the year just investing in my life and relationships with all of the great people in it.

The grind was hard, but worth it. Yesterday was my last day at McDonalds, after 8.5 years. I'm moving out to Cleveland today to live with my best friend, who got me in at the company he works for. I'll be out of the country life, into the city, making double what I would at McDs. Bankers hours. No more coming home covered in grease and who knows what else. 

I haven't made it yet. I don't know it if I ever will. My story hopefully inspires someone out there to keep going. Not sure how the editing will look, since I'm typing this on my phone. Thank you for taking the time to read this, if you do. Don't ever quit.

1dpyzu,21,2013-05-05,I 24M Met a Great Girl 24F and Now She Is Not Ready for a Relationship,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dpyzu/i_24m_met_a_great_girl_24f_and_now_she_is_not/,"Sorry for the long write up here, but I am pretty confused right now as to what has occurred over the past few days. I (M24) met a girl (F24) a few weeks ago through mutual friends.  She’s a graduate student and knows where she is going in life and is very mature for her age. We hit it off pretty much on the first date and spent over 4 hours having a few drinks and just going back and forth about everything.


__
The second date went even better than the first. We went mini golfing, then to Froyo where we talked for almost 2 hours. After we drove back to get her car from the mini golf place we ended up going across the street and kissing, etc. for a while. Again, the date ended very well.


__
For the third date I picked her up from school.  We went to a nice restaurant, had a great romantic meal and laughed and talked the entire time. I then drove her home and met her mom, which we talked for about ten minutes and I got a good “vibe” from her. After her mom went to bed we talked for a while and then ended up having sex. Sex was incredible and the night ended well.


__
A few days later she invited me over to her house making the meal of MY CHOICE. I of course brought two great wines of her favorite type to go with the meal. The meal was delicious. Good conversation the entire time including when we got back. Ended up having sex again.


__
Two nights later she had me over to meet some close friends for snacks, drinks, and various board games.  Things went pretty good overall, the friends generally seemed cool and we all laughed throughout the night. A couple hours after midnight some of her friends began to crash out, so we went to her bedroom and talked/kissed and went to sleep.


__
Few days later for our 5th date I was going to take her out for drinks because she aced her last final of her first year of grad school. She ended up not getting out of her internship until a couple hours later than expected so she recommended that we just hang out at her house and have some drinks there. After we had drank some and were talking on the couch I told her that I wanted to be in a relationship with her. She told me at this time that her last long term relationship ended a few months ago. I had no idea up until this point that it ended so recently. The reason she ended the relationship with her last bf was because he did not want to get married, have kids so she felt there really was no future with him. I told her that I was okay with not getting in a relationship right now and just continue to see where this goes. We talked for some time about relationships, etc. We ended up having sex again, for another fairly great end to our little night.


__
The afternoon the next day she messaged me that her friend had canceled on plans to hang out with her after her internship and asked if I would like to come over and watch a movie. I did and we went to pick out a movie. Somehow we ended up picking up a movie that had direct parallels to her last relationship. It was supposed to be a comedy but it got pretty serious. Literally 80 percent through the movie she gets a weird look on her face and goes this movie is terrible I don’t think I can watch it. I agree with her and we shut it off. She then tells me that it’s reminding her of her last relationship. At this point I’m thinking uh-oh, we have been holding hands the whole movie, things going relatively well and then this. We go downstairs and she tells me that she told her mom earlier that night about what we had talked about the previous night, with her not being ready to be in a relationship. Her mom apparently said that she needs time to be single and learn to live like that for a while. She also told her to “be careful” with regard to me, which I took to mean be careful not to hurt me. When she told her mom I was coming back over that night, she said her mom rolled her eyes. I again reassured her that I was fine just keeping things the way they are, not jumping into a relationship just yet.


The next day we only sent a few texts, which was definitely less than usual but I figured that she was just busy.

On the 3rd I texted her Good morning! and she didn’t respond until that evening with basically:

Sorry I haven’t been talking to you as much. I realized I need more time being by myself. I’m not ready for a relationship like I thought I was. I am sorry to disappoint you :(

I responded saying that she has yet to disappoint me. That I understand that she needs more time. And also that knowing that we both like each other, I’d hate to see something possibly great for both of us thrown away just because she needs time.

She then said sorry if she’s “mia” for a while but she needs time to herself and to focus on stuff other than a relationship.

I clarified if she doesn’t want to hang out or talk at all and she said she does but that she just wants a “breather for a bit”.

I told her “Okay. That’s fine just give me a call whenever you’re ready”

She said OK. Thanks for being so understanding. It’s not like I just wanna stop talking completely but I think you know what I mean.

I actually don’t know what she means by that but I figured I would give it a week off from talking to her and see if she comes to her senses after a cool off period.

What are my fellow redditor’s thoughts on this? I’m sorry if this is fragmented, this is my first ever post about something like this.

TLDR: Met awesome girl that got out of a LTR a few months ago and suddenly changed her mind about wanting to be in a relationship. What is the deal?"
1dpyad,1,2013-05-05,No Direction,kersius,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1dpyad/no_direction/,"So a few years ago, I was working a dead end office job. I was really failing there, playing video games and surfing the web instead of doing my work. I started out as a star employee but slowly dropped. Finally, one day I went for a walk and decided that I was done. I have thought a lot about suicide over the past 12-15 years but that afternoon I made the decision that I was going to finally do it. A great weight lifted off my shoulders and I felt free for the first time in years. I decided to focus and finish college and study what I wanted to study: social work not business. After all, what's the worst that could happen? I could always come back to suicide if it didn't work out. I worked my butt off. Went to community college and graduated with a 4.0, perfect GPA. For context, when I went to college the first time, I dropped out after 2 years with maybe a 2.0. I then transferred to one of the best public universities in the US. I was still doing well, learning a lot and doing well in my classes. I got into the golden key society for the top 15% of my class. Last summer I had a great internship and learned a lot. I had a tough fall semester but still pulled off As and Bs. I start getting my usual anxiety about school and am nervous about applying to graduate school to get my Master's which I need to do what I want to do. I end up only applying to 1 graduate program, the one I think I am most likely to get into. The others are out of state and I can't see spending that kind of $ in loans to attend them. Fast forward to now. I get my notice that I didn't get into graduate school. The program that was supposed to be my ""safety school"" rejected me. Now I don't know what to do. I'm afraid that I will have to return to the hell that is retail, and that I won't be able to get to where I wanted to go. A BA in Sociology doesn't help much unless you're going to graduate school. 
Now I'm feeling that I gave it a shot, I tried my best and failed. I will graduate in two weeks but it won't help me much. Career wise I'm not much closer than I was 3 years ago. I've barely been able to hold on and keep pushing myself in school knowing that I was on track to fulfill my dreams. Now that it's been derailed I don't think I have it in me to keep going. I tried my best and it wasn't good enough. Some people just aren't meant to make it I guess. 
I look back at the decision I made 3 years ago and I'm having trouble not following through this time. I made a deal with myself then that I would give it a shot and I did. I really did, I tried my hardest and I failed. My fears were confirmed. I just don't know what to do.
TL;dr: Made a deal 3 years ago to wait on suicide plans and to try one more time. Didn't get into grad school which I need for career. Trying to find a reason not to commit suicide now."

1dpigq,1,2013-05-04,What's the best way to make my roommates use my deposit for rent?,BrackishSor,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1dpigq/whats_the_best_way_to_make_my_roommates_use_my/,"So I am staying 3 months in NYC for an internship and the only short term lease near my job was with (what I thought) were 3 Chinese students. When i went to look at the apartment, I noticed that the bathroom was not super clean but manageable and the kitchen seemed quite dirty. The living room had a ton of boxes/clothes sitting out and the room I was supposed to move into still has clothes/boxes in it.

The rent was pretty cheap and the head tenant told me everything was just super messy from the one roomate moving out and things would get better. Because I had no other options forthcoming I went ahead and took them up on the room. 

That's when the trouble started.

First off, when I moved into my bedroom two weeks later...there was still stuff all over the walls from the previous person. They had also left garbage out on the balcony and in my closet. There was also a bed left there, which was somewhat convenient but still unexpected. I thought the room was going to be actually cleaned before I moved in. 

I also noticed that the kitchen was messier than before...by far. Not only that but the stuff that was supposed to be cleaned out of the living room was still there. It became obvious that the way I saw it right off the bat was closer to the way things ALWAYS were, not just messy from the roomate moving.

Then to top it off I was shown a second bathroom which I didn't even know existed. This was the ""boys"" bathroom and I was supposed to use it instead of the one i was shown (Which turned out to be the girls bathroom). When I asked why there was a bathroom for the one girl living there I was then introduced to the fact that each bedroom in the 4 bedroom apartment (except for mine) had 2 people living in it! Not just me!

In short, i feel super mislead and would like to get out. I gave them a months rent as deposit, but haven't paid this months rent yet. I never signed any kind of agreement with the other tenants, so I'm wondering what you guys would do. Would you just tell them the deposit is this months rent and I'm leaving in june? Would you pay and suffer? Would you tell them nothing and just leave after this month?

Please help me! I've never been in a situation like this."
1dpi1q,0,2013-05-04,DUI...Next steps?,duithrowaway54,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1dpi1q/duinext_steps/,"First, I want to preface this by saying the decision to drive drunk was incredibly stupid.  There is literally no excuse for it.  I don't know why I decided to.  I am not trying to get out of the charges; I am guilty.  I have placed a call to a lawyer already, but also assume that I won't here anything back until Monday.  My mind is still just going 1,000 miles per hour and I was hoping to get some feedback about what to expect until I hear back.

While I admit fault, and I am not trying to get the charges dropped, I also want a lawyer to make sure I can get a fair punishment.  I am 25/F with no prior charges of any sort.  

I am a full time student, attending school as an out of state resident (originally from Virginia - this is where my car is registered &amp; I am licensed).  The offense occurred in Oklahoma.  I was pulled over for driving 5 under the speed limit (30 in a 35), and weaving.  The officer approached and asked if I had been drinking, and I admitted I had.  I don't know if this was a smart idea or not, but there was no denying it.  I figured I might as well cooperate and hope for some brownie points.  Anywho, I gave over my registration and then anxiety set in.  I vomited.  The officer had me get out of the car to perform the field tests.  I failed.  No surprise to me.  The officer asked if I would consent to a breathalyzer.  I then told him that I wasn't familiar with what my rights were in Oklahoma, and that I wanted to consult a lawyer first.  He immediately hand cuffed me and placed me under arrest.  I vomited again.  He asked me again to consent, and I told him again I wanted to speak with a lawyer first.  

I get down to the station and I'm processed.  I'm asked a third time to consent, and I again tell them I'd rather speak with an attorney before proceeding.  Nothing else is mentioned.  

I was released on bail this morning.  One of the sheets of paper I was given instructs that I need to appear at the court within 3 business days.  It doesn't really say what it is for - ""initial appearance and arraignment.""  Do I need to have a lawyer present with me for this visit?

I have since learned that refusing a breathalyzer in Oklahoma is automatic grounds for license suspension.  I have the ability to appeal the decision, in writing, with the Department of Safety.  Is this something I do on my own, or can I expect a lawyer to assist me with this?  In addition, I do not have any recollection of them telling me that my license would automatically be suspended.  I mean, I'm sure they did, but at the same time, I do not feel that I would have still denied the breathalyzer if I had known that.  I suppose that's neither here nor there, but I figured I'd throw that out there.

Finally, to complicate things, I am supposed to be leaving next Sunday to take a position out of state for a summer internship.  Am I even allowed to leave the state with charges pending?  Do I need to get clearance from the court first?

Any help would be appreciated.  "

1dpf4t,0,2013-05-04,"Reddit, why will putting myself through college be worth it?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1dpf4t/reddit_why_will_putting_myself_through_college_be/,"**TL;DR:** I am a 26-year-old who set aside a career to return to school and finish my BA through Columbia. I have one more year left, but at the moment, putting myself through school is so stressful that I feel like I won't make it graduation.
___

All but hidden in plain sight, a plaque on the left beam of Columbia University’s main gate bears this inscription: May All Who Enter Find Peace and Welcome. 

As a kid, when my family and I lived six blocks south of those gates, college seemed as accessible as walking through those doors. The campus became my playground: I tiptoed along fountain edges and raced past research libraries on my bike. On nights when the university opened its observatory to the public, my father and I would marvel at the telescopes as we gazed at the celestial phenomena. College encouraged reaching for the stars.

Shortly before I turned 14, my father and I had The Talk. Much as he advocated a college education, he’d never be able to finance one. I considered the acknowledgment generous; it allowed time to lay groundwork for the road ahead. So that’s what I did. I’d already obtained entry and a full scholarship to a prep school that had produced a former U.S. attorney general and Oscar nominees. Hoping to follow in their footsteps, I won a slew of local and national scholarships, studied two languages despite native-level fluency in three others, volunteered, occupied leadership roles in student groups and landed a top internship before even leaving high school.

That Ivy League-loving prep school  is now a 26-year-old without a college degree. The reasons do not include rehab, jail, pregnancy, terminal illness or joining the circus. These days, the gates are not of iron but cost.  

After high school, I spent several semesters at a nearby college, one I could afford without loans. When financial burdens became overwhelming, I justified my exit from academia by pouring energy into a career, and writing stories for places that you and your mother have heard of, until I returned to academic life and enrolled at Columbia University’s School of General Studies, which is designed primarily for those who have taken at least a year’s break between high school and college. Getting in was the first hurdle. Unlike the university’s other three undergraduate schools - Columbia College, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and Barnard College – financial aid is extremely limited.

One year, my adjusted gross income was under $14,000, and the government determined expected contribution to be $1,322. The grants from the school amounted to $9,600 and government aid totaled $5,000, leaving savings and student loans to cover the remaining $18,325 in tuition, which doesn’t include room and board, textbooks or meals. The financial aid director said that I “did everything right,” but that there wasn't any more aid to go around - at a university had a $7.8 billion endowment in FY 2011. 

To cut costs, I live with my parents but cover all of my personal expenses – food, books, clothing, the occasional night out with friends. If I forget to pack lunch, I consider skipping meals until I return home. A professor once ordered dinner for the entire class to celebrate the end of the semester, never knowing that I would have skipped eating otherwise. Of course, I work, and because of fluctuations in my schedule, my term GPA’s have varied between 4.0 to… not a 4.0.

The school’s healthcare plan offers mind-bogglingly amazing resources without additional charge: multiple on-site clinics, psychological counseling, even a nutritionist. The irony is that I’ve canceled off-site appointments when the $30 co-payment exceeded funds in my bank account. And I am far – very far - from alone, though I know I am for.
College is not for everyone, but as a character on the West Wing says, paying for it “should be a little easier.” I have one year until graduation, and at the moment, I feel like I won’t make it there. So, Reddit, why is any of this – the all-nighters, the exams, the monumental efforts that resulted in literal failure, the years of debt ahead -  worth it? "

1dt01r,1,2013-05-06,Can't decide what to do about my marriage [29m/28f],neversure42,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dt01r/cant_decide_what_to_do_about_my_marriage_29m28f/,"My wife and I have been together for about 5 years now. We got married two years ago. This is my second marriage; I had an ill-advised first marriage when I was way too young that ended after about 10 months. No kids.

I don't even know how to start this. Things seemed really great when we met and for the first few years I was incredibly happy and in love. It only seemed to get bad around the time we got married.

We got married by a judge at the courthouse, mainly to get her on my insurance with a ""proper"" ceremony to follow. People found out about this (my fault) and this ruined her expectation of a ""proper"" ceremony so we never had one. Resentment built up over this for a long time. A year later, she was late getting home one night and acting suspicious. I glanced over at her phone and she was texting a male coworker. After a long string of denials, I found out she had a romantic interest in this guy. She had been giving him rides to work for a while.

What followed was the most emotionally painful period of time I have ever endured. She kept telling me she was done with this guy, then I'd find out she was still seeing him. It went on for a couple months. Finally I couldn't take it anymore and I asked her to move out. She wanted to call it a ""separation"" and not a divorce because she didn't feel ready to let go of me just yet. While she was moved out, she started seeing two additional guys. 

Now, all of this behavior is crazy and way out of character for her. She had always been a kind, empathic, sweet person, and I never would have thought she was capable of hurting me this badly. She had been having trouble with anxiety in grad school and had started seeing a psychiatrist who put her on an astounding variety of things: Klonopin, xanax, lamictal, wellbutrin, in addition to vicodin, soma and ritalin her regular doctor was prescribing her and a daily weed habit (she was high pretty much any time she wasn't at school or work, and sometimes went to those things high too.) I felt at the time like she was on so much stuff that she just wasn't herself. She wrecked her car twice during this period. She had always had a tendency to smoke too much weed and I never thought she needed the vicodin or ritalin prescriptions, but she seemed to manage that stuff pretty well. The other stuff just sent her into a tailspin, I think. 

A big part of the pain from this period of time was how worried I was about her. I knew she was on way too much medication and I worried that she would get taken advantage of, or would destroy her career, or would flat out die in a car wreck. It wasn't even about wanting her back, it was about wanting her to be healthy and safe.

Fast forward a few months. I make a decision that I am done with her and ask her for a divorce, in the same week that she finds out she's going to have to go to Colorado for an internship. She tells me that when she pictures herself starting a new life there, she pictures me with her, that she loves me and misses me, and she wants me to come with her.

I think about it (shit, I've always wanted to move to Colorado anyway) and tell her that if she gets off all the drugs I'll do it. She agrees and spends the summer weaning off of everything. I thought maybe a fresh start would be good for both of us. So we move to Colorado, and we've been here for about a year now. Things seem much more stable; she still probably smokes too much weed, but she's off all the other crap, and I don't believe she's still cheating. She seems genuinely remorseful for the things that happened and she's seeing a therapist to try to deal with the parts of herself that led her to do these things.

The thing is, it seems like something within me has changed. I remember the way I felt about her when I proposed, how happy I was. I remember fantasizing about the children we could have, about growing old together. I remember how proud of her I was, always talking up her grad school accomplishments. I don't feel those things anymore. I don't feel like I can trust her. I feel a lot of doubt and fear about the future. She wants to have children soon and I just don't know; I feel like I would need to see a lot more stability from her, for a long period of time, before I could think about bringing a child into this.

I think that if we weren't married, if she was just my girlfriend, I would dump her and leave. But since we're married, and especially because this is my second marriage, it seems like a much harder decision. I don't want to admit defeat and give up on it. I desperately want it to work, but I'm not sure I will ever feel the same way about her again, not sure I will ever be able to trust her. I'm not sure if those feelings will ever come back, or how long I should wait for them. And I want to keep my word. And I don't want the stigma of being twice-divorced.

I have no idea how to even begin to think about making this decision. Neither choice feels particularly appealing.

**tl;dr: Wife cheated on me for months right after we got married, and now even though things seem to be better I'm not sure I want to be married to her. I'm also not sure I want to be divorced. I don't know how to make this decision.**"
1dsvit,109,2013-05-06,"I'm (20F) currently dating the man (42M) who ""molested"" me when I was much younger. AMA",confessHer,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1dsvit/im_20f_currently_dating_the_man_42m_who_molested/,"I say ""molested"" in quotes because while I'm sure that's what most people would call it that I didn't feel taken advantage of or harmed at all when our first relationship began. That later changed and I have hated him for years. Now we're dating again and all my friends know about it is that I'm dating a much older man. Let me try to explain.

When I was eleven years old my best friend's parents were divorced. She spent every other weekend at her dad's house and sometimes I spent the weekend there with her. His place was outside of the city, a small horse farm with riding horses, goats, a five minute walk from a lake, really nice place. So much different than the city.

Mr. Dean was really cool too. He would bring us out for ice cream, let us just wander his property without constantly checking up on us, that sort of thing. He treated us like mature adults not little kids and I loved that. I even told him that once one night after my friend had fallen asleep. That's when he gave me his YIM ID and said that if I ever needed to talk to an adult about something I didn't want my parents to know about, he'd be there for me.

So we became YIM buddies. I kept this secret from everyone, including my friend, because like Mr. Dean said his daughter might think he's using me to spy on her (he did ask about her a lot: how was her home life, was she happy in school, things like that). As for my parents he pointed out that they wouldn't understand how a girl my age and a man his age could be friends. That much was definitely true, my parents were very over-protective. So he was my secret friend and I thought it was really cool to have a grown man as a friend, especially one who was always complimenting me so much and telling me how special I was. It wasn't long before I developed a crush on him.

It took me awhile to realize he was flirting with me. Thinking back about it I now realize he had been flirting from the start but at eleven years of age I had little self confidence, especially with older boys and men, and just couldn't believe a guy like Mr. Dean would be physically attracted to me. That changed when he found out from his daughter that we had taken my parents new digital camera out for a school project, probably hinting she wanted one for herself (she was always trying to get him to buy her things). When he asked me about it online I said that yes, my parents had a new digital camera and it was awesome. That's when he asked me to take some ""special pictures"" of myself for him.

He didn't ask for nudes at first, only pix of me in my underwear. I remember being so embarrassed when he asked for that. But he explained it would make him feel special to know that I trusted him enough with such pictures especially if I was taking them only for him. So one day I relented and took about a dozen pictures of me in my nicest undies, all while making ridiculously silly poses due to my embarrassment, and sent them to his e-mail account.

After that things began to escalate really fast. He sent me a picture of his penis with the title ""Look what your pictures did to me!"". He then asked me for nudes and by now I was feeling older and sophisticated so I complied. He started asking me if I ever touched myself (I did) and then if I ever thought of him while I touched myself (I did). That led us to full on Internet sex. He then started providing me with passwords to (legal) porn websites, asking me to watch various videos and then chat about them. 

Basically within two months of beginning our online friendship he was turning me into his personal little pervert girl. And I was happy to be that for him, I wanted to make him happy. Whenever I disappointed him he would disappear for a few days and when he came back I would be so relieved that I would do anything I could to make sure he didn't do that again. He was manipulating me like a master psychologist or something which isn't much of a stretch: I eventually learned that he went to grad school for a masters in social work and then interned for awhile as a adolescent psychologist. He never finished the internship because his stay at home business really took off and he ended up focusing on that exclusively. But still he had the skills. He knew how to turn a bratty tirade of mine into the exactly conversation he wanted within minutes. He especially knew how to use my insecurities and desire to please him to his advantage.

That's what led to our first real sexual encounter. I was almost twelve now and he said that it was time for us to spend some real time together. He came up with the whole plan and then one day after school I met him at a nearby gas station and he brought me back to his farm for the night. My parents thought I was at a sleepover at another friend's house. He had a cell phone that he'd given me the number for to give for them. When they called later that evening, which of course they did, he answered and pretended to be my mystery friend's father. We ended up using the fake friend throughout the course of our relationship with my parents never figuring out that she didn't exist.

He started things off with me slow, very slow. I'd never even kissed a boy before and he knew that. He also knew how extremely nervous I was. That first time we basically just made out but we did both spend pretty much all of that night naked. He fingered me to what I mistakenly thought was an orgasm and then he showed me how to reciprocate by jacking him off. 

After that night we started seeing each other a lot more often. I lost my virginity to him shortly after my 12th birthday. We ended up ""dating"" like that for about two years. During that time he really messed with my head as much as he did with my body. He explained that promiscuity was a natural thing and that I shouldn't turn into people like my parents who saw sex as this dirty, evil thing. He actualy encouraged me to be with other boys and that's what I did in my stupid attempt to please him. I got pregnant when I was thirteen, most likely from a boy from my neighborhood. After the abortion my parents cracked down on me even more than ever so it was awhile before I could see Mr. Dean again. But we saw each other most nights, online, sharing pictures of each other and talking about the most perverted things imaginable. He once convinced me to try and seduce my older brother which led to his disgust and horror and a threat to tell our parents. When I tried again due to Mr. Dean's insistence he followed through on his threat and my parents put me into therapy. That was the beginning of the end of my relationship with Mr. Dean.

Up until two months ago I've hated him for what he did to me. He definitely abused me, both physically and mentally. He made me love him but convinced me through subtle means that I wasn't really worthy of love myself. He exposed me to things no child should be exposed to and gave me a warped view of sexuality and relationships. 

And despite all that I am now dating him. For the last two months since randomly running into me at work we have been dating openly. He hasn't changed much either and I hate myself for being too weak to do the right thing and cut him off. But there's this part of me I can't explain that enjoys reliving the past. After a wild spree after the last time I saw Mr. Dean back when I was fourteen I had only been with two men in five years, both serious relationships. Sure I've been a bit of a party girl at times but I haven't been a slut, not until I started seeing Mr. Dean again two months ago. Now he's involved me in three three ways, all with different male friends of his, and one semi-gangbang.

None of my friends know about any of my recent behavior or the past Mr. Dean and I share. Outwardly he comes across as a normal, educated, very intelligent and polite man. Some of my friends initially questioned why I'd date someone old enough to be my father but all of them have come to accept him. Some are even jealous because he's extremely handsome and obviously very well off financially. He showers me with gifts and will be taking me to Puerto Rico next month for an entire week and he's paying for everything. All of my friends think he's a romantic and I let them believe that. But none of them know the truth of our past or what he is currently trying to return me to in the present: he wants me to be his doting little pervert girl again and he has been succeeding. Worst part is that I don't know if I want him to fail. Just the thought of him getting bored with me or something makes me upset. 

I'll try to read any questions you might have and answer them through this afternoon or if you just want to comment or give advice that's fine. If you viciously attack me for being a horrible person I'll just ignore you though."

I am a freshman at a state school with no security courses taught here nor any active security groups. I am trying to get a couple of students together to start in a CTF team, but I really don't know what I am doing in that regard. We do have a decently ranked CS program in light of not having any security specific classes.

* I am a good CS student; to the point where I have tested out of classes and have been approved for taking grad courses next year
* I would like to either be a software engineer or a pen tester after I graduate, and would like to know how to best prepare for pen testing since I have the SE part covered with past experience.
* I have a SE internship at a fortune 100 tech company in a hardware group (nothing to do with security) and I'm wondering how I should approach the security departments at said company to express my interest and possibly be invited to join their team next summer if I am given the opportunity.
* As far as I know, there are only two pen testing orgs that operate in my state
* I have WAHH 2, CEH study guide (v7 I believe), quite a few Cisco books for CCNP and CCNA which I will probably study for, but not take the exams. I like having knowledge even if I don't have the certs. Quite a few other books in security from lock picking to SQL injection (more advanced topics of SQL injection, not really beginner topics except the first couple of chapters).
* I have recently gotten into a lot of trouble at my university for ""hacking"" their registration system (I basically just bypassed part of the system to register for classes early) so they will probably not be too happy if I try to organize a CTF team or an infosec club on campus because I received a total of 68 months of probation from various departments on campus.
* I am also interested in malware analysis and have done a lot of this on .NET and Java malware in years past. I am very proficient in Java bytecode. This could be another avenue of work I may pursue, but I am at a loss for what goes into getting into this field.

Thanks!"

I want her to move in with me in a year.   She wants to but she is too afraid of her family.  She still live at home and still needs permission to go go hang out on weekends and no overnight trips.

Its frustrating.  Waiting.... I don't know when we will start our life together.  She says she definitely will in three years when I start my residency (mandatory internship for doctors).

I mean a 1 year wait compared to 3 years seem like nothing in the scheme of things, but emotionally I'm frustrated.  Part of me wants to end it when I get back after finals in 16 days.  Other part of me says she is worth the wait.  I'm more frustrated at her inability to stand up to family.  If she didn't want to go to NY and wants me to comeback to California, I will be fine with it.  Problem is she does want to go to NY, but she ""can't"". 

I tell her this and she say wait for a year and see how it goes.  She is trying to summon courage to move out first in an apartment 15mins away from home.  Problem is she had apartment for two months and still haven't told family yet.

I can't fault her family, since her dad died when she was 6, brother raised her practically.  So he is really protective of her.  Talking about juggling jobs in high school and college to support family type of sacrifice.

As you may know, getting a non-profit started can be really difficult, and has many expenses. As a college student, all of my finances are spent to pay for classes and books. I’m currently working 40 hours a week at a non-paid internship, so I cannot have any other source of income.

Ever since I transitioned at 14 years old, I knew that I wanted to dedicate my life to helping the transgender community in all possible ways. I know my soon to be non-profit, TUFF, will change the transgender community and help to better so many lives, especially those of our at risk youth.

TUFF (Trans United with Family and Friends) needs help getting its 501c and raising money for supplies to outreach to the community! You can help!!
Since I was fifteen, I've wanted to work in the transgender community, trying to help individuals less fortunate than I was. Realizing how expensive transition is, and how many insurance companies don't cover anything in that area, I knew someone had to help those who couldn't afford to transition.

I've realized that once a person medically transitions, their entire life changes. They are happier, confident and hopeful, and for some people this is the first time in their lives they've felt like this. I don't want anyone to be held back from giving the world their all and reaching their full potential just because they can't afford to transition.

What is TUFF? TUFF is a non-profit organization, based in Los Angeles, that gives financial assistance to transgender and gender variant individuals, and can be used towards the cost of transition and medical needs. The money is distributed on an as needed basis. Recipients must apply for an award, and are chosen based on their financial need, personal, social, and advocacy goals for the future.

Who can apply for funds? Anyone who identifies along the transgender/gender variant spectrum, regardless of their financial needs. Applicants must fill out an application form that requires them to provide information about their medical transition history and financial needs. They must also submit 2 essays that ask about their future goals and involvement within the transgender/gender variant community.
What is this fundraiser going to help TUFF with? Right now, as executive director and founder of TUFF, I am using my own funds to pay to file paper work, purchase fliers, buttons and posters and travel across the countries to various conferences and workshops to spread the word about TUFF. As a college student, using my own income has proven to be extremely difficult and hard, especially when I also need to fund my education. By donating to this fundraiser, you can help launch TUFF and fulfill my dream of running and creating this non-profit. 

I know that left and right there are campaigns online asking you to donate. But know, this is an extremely important cause that can help save thousands of lives.
I ask that you spread this message to anyone you see fit, and to help get the word of my fundraiser out there.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and thank you in advance for your donation,

My life is going NO WHERE.",geeewee,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/1drh6p/wiser_redditors_how_do_i_stop_stagnating_and_stop/,"My life isn't moving forward at all. I feel trapped in and I want to do something about it.

Please someone tell me how. 

A week ago my 22end birthday passed and even for being young I have not even done simple things people my age have done. I'm not depressed. I don't want to feel better, I want something to change. when I look objectively at my life it's just really bad, and yet I can't see my life improving.

I had a pretty bad childhood and grew up as a latch key kid with little support(I was an immigrant and my parents were usually busy), my childhood was filled with bullying and not fitting in due different background which caused some serious lack of self esteem, confidence issues, and inferiority complexes.

I'm currently not depressed at all but the state of my life has really been stagnate for the past few years. My life is generally tedious and uninteresting, yet I feel I'm not in any position to change anything about it. I want to get out of this but I feel like there's dead ends everywhere and it causes this immense feeling of extreme frustration and feeling of being trapped. 

I graduated HS 4 years ago now and I've been attending a small boring community college. I didn't feel passionate about anything and couldn't figure out what I wanted to do which caused some serious time wasting and bad grades. The place was packed and I often couldn't get any classes I needed which wasted a lot of time. I began taking classes I didn't need so I could acquire priority in registration. During my time at community college I often had extreme bouts of negative emotions, felt depressed, extremely lonely, bored, directionless, regretful. I withdrew from a lot of classes and this screwed me over. I had nothing to strive for, no goal, I was going through the motions, and began to have issues sleeping and started having awful grades, this kept going down in spiral. The campus was often empty, drab, and no one was around. There were no clubs. I just wanted to get out and I could not. I'm socially proficient, yet despite all attempts I found it extremely difficult to make friends at community college(due to the nature of the place).

I constantly feel like my failures eat up the present and destroy my future. everything constantly repeats.

I graduated HS without accomplishing a thing, without good memories, friends, or or any accomplishments. I couldn't get accepted into the university of my dreams and 4 years later I still can't.

I entered jr college full of regret, pain, and loneliness. I spent the first year without a single friends. Massive depression, massive regret, loneliness, my grades suffered. I was totally apathetic and unmotivated, and even suicidal. just wanted some friends. Loneliness was crushing. My eye was never on the ball, I didn't even know what to major in, I didn't know where I was going, where I wanted to transfer or anything. I was completely lost for years and in limbo, this lack of goals led to massive failure. I messed up in a lot of classes and could have passed many of them since the courses are easy as cake, but I've always had tons of problems, depression, massive insomnia, lack of motivation, loneliness, no girl, no friends, etc and withdrew a ton of classes. My GPA is awful, it's 2.9 and it's embarrassing. I can't even wake up in the morning. I have massive insomnia. I felt like a failure and still do.

-21 I finally decided on a major. My mood has stabilized significantly. I'm currently working towards my major of choice. I feel bad that I fucked up again, it feels like everything just keeps repeating itself. I've been aware of it for years but have no idea how to fix it. I just keep making the same mistakes again.

-22 During the last few years I put significant attention towards my social life, changing the way I dress, talking to people, becoming social. I'm an excellent socializer and extremely quick on my feet. I still have no new friends(due to the commuting nature of jr college) but I'm better with women. I still feel like a failure in my life though. I want to be successful.

I'm 22 and I don't have a degree. I don't even have a girlfriend. I even got a second chance to change my life when I entered jr college and I fucked up again.

I FEEL SO BEHIND in life. I have done NOTHING for the last four years, NOTHING. I don't know how to advance my life further.

I feel trapped in college. I just want to graduate and get out and have some sort of ""new"" accomplishment for myself. My life is not moving forward and I don't know what to do.

I spent the two years or so slowly improving myself even more, talking to people, dressing better, going to the gym every so often, but not much changed in my life. I still have only 3 friends and no social network to speak of. My weekends are spent at home, yet I highly dislike being at home all the time, I often feel VERY alone and VERY lonely. I did finally just recently find a girl and we went on a date, went well. I do look good on the outside and people often assume some very positive things about me(That I'm cool, have friends and that I'm intelligent and get good grades and have my life together), but the reality is I'm a failure. I often feel very odd when people compliment something positive about me.

--Compared to many people I am incredibly underdeveloped life experience/success wise for my age, yet at the same time I have the potential but no conducive environment for it. I'm not around anyone successful, I'm not around anyone my age who's doing something fun, or interesting, I don't have a group, there's no one for me to ""network"" off of. I'd love to get into a niche, or meet some person who's doing something interesting, or be in a place where something is happening. I'm still in the same town I was when I graduated, surrounded the same people, and experiencing the same things. I hate my life everyday. I have potential and but I'm not in the right places and around the right people............I'm just here......stuck.

Most people my age are living it up, having so much fun with their lives, yet I'm stuck here and experienced none of it. Fuck I haven't even gone to a real party yet, and I just recently got my first kiss. I'm so behind compared to the way people seem to generally view me, and it's really annoying. My lack of life experience makes me extremely frustrated. I'm wasting away my 20s and some of the best time of my life, where I have the time, youth, and energy.

In the last six months I finally settled on something for a major. I need about one more year till I transfer, at the same time that many of my peers are GRADUATING and getting internships and jobs and getting paid well. This is something that causes me a lot of turmoil. MY GPA IS AWFUL. it's 2.9. I won't be even going to an interesting university or experiencing anything new. I live a couple of miles from the school I will be going to.

My failure eats me up inside. I know it's not a race but I personally WANT to finish already, I can't bear being in the same situation any longer. I so badly want my life to ""start"" and I keep feeling like my life hasn't ""started"" yet. It's like big puzzle piece and I want the puzzle to finish but the goddamn fucking pieces aren't coming together and I can't make them together because they're just not there so I have to waste more of my life. A lot of those four years of life were completely wasted, I try not to dwell on the past but I'm still not going anywhere. I just wanted to get out of this place and I can't, I have to wait about one more year, then after that there's at least 2 more years when I transfer. This makes a total of approximately six years to get my degree. Now let's just hope I even get a chance to get a job....that's another story.

My parents are very old and sick, and I'm from a lower poor class. They're very demanding and negative about me, and I admit I have many short comings. I need to step up and I always needed to but I never did and wasn't able to, and I let them down.

I feel trapped in my situation, I'm trapped in school, I'm trapped in my lacking social life, I'm trapped by my lack of money, I'm trapped at home. I want my life to start already, I want the rocket to launch but I feel grounded, stuck in the dull black tar pit of my life. My personality is one that seeks novelty, yet my life is extremely monotonous. After four years and seemingly no feeling of ""moving forward"" anywhere school has become a chore. I have a constant feeling of ""frustration"" like I'm stuck, trapped, at a stand still, like I'm trying to run but I'm bound. The ennui of life is bearing down on me and I feel like there's no novelty or purpose to my life. It feels like I'm in life's stream swimming in a pool of molasses.

I just wish there was a clear list of things to do that I can accomplish to stop fucking up in life.

tl;dr

-I'm 22 now

-only 3 friends, no social life.

-stagnate life that is going no where

-people around me are growing and i'm here wasting my life, no degree yet, still have 2 years of school

-no money, poor, parents sick, very old

-4 years wasted at community college, still not done, feel trapped in my situation

I just want to be successful in life for once.

1dvnro,46,2013-05-07,Graduated too long ago but not enough experience to find a job. I'm stuck and utterly confused about where to go from here.,stuckengr,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1dvnro/graduated_too_long_ago_but_not_enough_experience/,"**Edit: Wow, thanks for all the feedback and advice everyone! I'll try to respond to people individually later tonight.**

I'm a 24 year old guy that graduated in 2011 from the University of Michigan with a degree in mechanical engineering. I did well in my classes. My GPA was ~3.3 and I always worked hard and had a good grasp of the material and tried to take leadership roles in my projects. I graduated in 4 years, but admittedly didn't put effort into career development while I was a student. I guess I didn't realize how important that was. I guess I always just assumed that I'd apply to jobs and get interviews and everything to fall into place. In hindsight, that was a stupid assumption. In any case, I didn't start going to the career fairs until my junior year, and I wasn't able to secure any internships during the summer (which wasn't entirely uncommon anyway. A very small percentage of my classmates were being accepted to internships). 

I graduated without a job or any real sense of what I wanted to do in general. I'll try to spare you the boring details, but mentally, I was struggling. I was overwhelmed with the idea of graduating and battling with some depression problems, and I decided to take some time off and travel. I had always regretted not doing a semester abroad, and this seemed like a good choice at the time.

That extended into 2012, and then I was back home and ready to resume my job search. But nothing really came out of it. Days turned into weeks. Weeks into months. And before I knew it, 2012 was coming to a close without having made any real progress. In my mind, I had good grades from a good university, and *someone* would want me. I also had lots of people saying things like ""Oh, engineering? You'll find a job easy."" So I guess I convinced myself that something would eventually fall into my lap.

Then this past January, it hit me. I'm fucking up. I've been out of school for over a year and a half, I'm financially dependent on my parents, and my career search was pitiful.

I had a big change in attitude. I started working with a career counselor to revamp my resume and learn how to market myself and network. I had family friends willing to put me in touch with engineers they knew, and I set up and went on networking trips to different cities. I started talking to a couple different recruiters at companies. I phoned in to the Michigan Engineering Career Resource Center for help. I have friends at engineering firms that have passed along my resume. I've reached out to people on LinkedIn to network. I'm going to job fairs. I've even applied blindly to job postings I find online. 

And literally nothing has come out of it. I try to stay positive, knowing that all it takes is *one* person or company to say yes, but I'm getting very discouraged. Half the time, I don't even hear back from companies. And nobody I talk to seems to be in a position to be of any real help. Basically, my job search is falling flat. And I'm starting to panic.

The reality is that I'm 2 years out of school with no applicable experience. (I have some job experience with computer / IT work, which is better than being a camp counselor, I suppose, but it's not directly engineering-related.) And the gaps are starting to grow on my resume. And that seems to be a big hinderance to even getting companies to talk to me. At this point, I'd be willing to settle for *anything*. I'd take an unpaid internship just to gain experience, but I don't even seem to qualify for that. 

So I'm stuck and I have no idea what to do. The path I took post-graduation was unorthodox, and looking back, I know I made some mistakes. If you feel the need to call me an idiot for not realizing the importance of internships or for not taking the job search seriously until recently, go ahead. I've spent many sleepless nights regretting the past 2 years of accomplishing nothing, so it's nothing I don't already know.

But my point in posting here is to try to figure out where to go from here, because what I'm doing isn't working. Maybe I need to consider going back to school in order to start fresh and ""get back in the game""? I don't know. Can anyone give me some guidance?"
1dvmz5,2,2013-05-07,"Tech Startup Interview, Thinking About Getting a Blazer",g2x222,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1dvmz5/tech_startup_interview_thinking_about_getting_a/,"I might have to fly out to southern California in a couple of weeks for an interview for an engineering position at a smallish (&lt; 100 employees) Internet startup. From what I've seen, they dress very casually and comfortably at the office - shorts, jeans, t-shirts, etc.

While I typically wore suits for internship interviews at bigger, more corporate companies, I'm planning on dressing down for this. I was thinking dark jeans or olive chinos, a blue ocbd, and walnut strands. My parents think I should also wear a blazer, and while I don't think it's necessary, it's probably not a bad idea.

After looking around a bit, I'm not entirely sure what to get. Material, structured vs. unstructured, color, solid vs. patterned, fit. 

This will be my first real blazer, so I'd like to get something versatile of decent quality. Brooks Brothers has the friends &amp; family sale, so I've been primarily looking there. I've also browsed J.Crew, but they don't seem to have as wide of a selection.

Here's what I've found so far in my size (36S):

* [Fitzgerald fit, Saxxon wool, Grey, Made in US, $360](http://s7d4.scene7.com/is/image/BrooksBrothers/MM00143_GREY?$bbenlarged$)
* [Milano fit, Linen, Navy mini-stripe, $336](http://s7d4.scene7.com/is/image/BrooksBrothers/MM00213_NAVY?$bbenlarged$)
* [Black Fleece, Wool/cashmere, Grey-Navy plaid, Made in US, $375](http://s7d4.scene7.com/is/image/BrooksBrothers/FM00072_GREY-NAVY?$bbenlarged$)
* [Black Fleece, Camel Hair, Grey, Made in US, $435](http://s7d4.scene7.com/is/image/BrooksBrothers/FM00063_GREY?$bbenlarged$)
* [Madison fit, Wool, Tan Plaid, $336](http://s7d4.scene7.com/is/image/BrooksBrothers/MM00224_TAN-BLUE?$bbenlarged$)
* [Fitzgerald fit, Linen, Tan, $336](http://s7d4.scene7.com/is/image/BrooksBrothers/MM00193_TAN?$bbenlarged$)

They're all a little steep price-wise, but I don't mind paying for something in this price range if it's high quality and something I'll use for a while.

Thoughts? Advice? Give me a few options, because some of the items I found are on sale and will probably sell out soon.

Thanks!"

1dvhec,17,2013-05-07,I[m19] am experiencing severe burnout and my mother[57] is threatening to stop paying tuition,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dvhec/im19_am_experiencing_severe_burnout_and_my/,"This story is bit complicated, but I'm going to try and reduce it to the bare minimum you need to know. 

This year and semester in particular have been very hard on me. I've experience depression, burnout, and self doubt, without getting into the specifics too much. At this point, I really need the summer to recover. I'm a 19 - almost 20 - year old male from the USA. 

I should preface by saying that in the past, working over the summer has been an issue between my mother (57 - highly conservative and traditional) and me. I attended a rigorous boarding prep school for high school, and was usually so exhausted and emotionally drained by the end of the year, that I needed the summer to relax so that I could function properly during the next school year. I finally did get a job last summer - nothing special, just a cashier position. 

Of course, this is no longer enough for my mother. In her eyes, the fact that I go to a top university means that I need to be getting internships during the summer, because she believes that I am one of the only students who hasn't had internships since they were in high school and because she believes that if I do not have an internship now, I will never secure a job. On top of that, she believes that my desire to rejuvenate over the summer means that I never want to work and will never hold a job. She has in fact told me that she worries about me becoming homeless because of what she has decided is a complete lack of interest in working (not true!). What more, the profession I am trying to enter (classical music) has nothing to do with any of the internships that she wants me to enter. 

Because of the difficulties that I have experienced this semester, I know that I will be on the path to either dropping out of college or perhaps becoming suicidal if I do not stop and take the break I need now. I have told my mother this via email, but she was not responsive, and has said that a break of no more than a week is necessary for any type of exhaustion, and that if the school is as stressful as it is, then I need to switch to a community college near home, because ""if I don't want a big fancy job then I don't deserve a big fancy education."" Switching schools is really not a good idea at this point, because the amount of money saved would be trivial, I have a near perfect GPA, and I've implemented a dozen or more measures to ensure that I will work at a humane pace starting in the next semester. 

It seems as though my mother is completely ignoring the many things I've done right to get where I am and can only focus on the fact that I do not want an internship in the field she wants me to enter. I refuse to talk on the phone with her anymore, because all communication with her becomes emotionally abusive very quickly. I do acknowledge (and have told her) that I see that her intentions are in the right place, but the fact of the matter is that my interactions with her have been a significant contributor to my depression. 

Today, I will be meeting with my adviser to discuss what happens should my parents stop paying my tuition. I will also go to my school's counseling services to see if I can get some sort of official recommendation for an extended break, and maybe that will convince her.

I have shown several of my friends the correspondence, and although they are biased, they do say that they believe my mother is being incredibly unfair. At this point, I am scared to return home for the summer in two weeks, and am desperately trying to arrange alternative housing with friends. 

The arguing reached its climax yesterday (and may continue to get worse), and since I woke up today I have been nauseous to the point of not being able to concentrate from being nervous and anxious. 

At this point, I'd just love it if my mother understood my position better, but I'm not sure how to do this as I sent a very neutral toned email explaining my concerns (and not accusing her of anything!). It seems as though she is disregarding what I believe to be some serious mental health issues that need to be addressed. 

Therefore, the ideal situation would be for my mother to understand and back off such that I feel safe going home and spending the recovery time I need, but I'm not optimistic for that outcome. I feel that if she properly understood, then she would realize that the measures I've taken to ensure that I do not burnout in the future will be effective, and that my self-imposed work pace is the problem and not my university - which would hopefully stop her threats. 

Does Reddit have any advice for me? 

tl;dr - holding an internship this summer will exacerbate mental health issues to the point of dropping out of school and/or suicidal behavior, and mother is dismissive and threatening to stop paying tuition.

(x-post),beautifultranslation,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dv2ij/a_family_member_is_in_a_codependent_relationship/,"Background:

My brother (19) is in quite the situation. Several months after beginning college, he began dating a girl. The relationship seemed to get pretty serious fairly quick. To date, they have been dating for about 6 months. The girl has a background of mental instability and sexual trauma that we are aware of. While they have been dating, the girl has attempted suicide, has been 51/50'd, and was reportedly raped *(I say reportedly because she refused to alert authorities and I also fear she may be claiming this to salvage a relationship that seemed to be fizzling. I feel bad for questioning her, or anyone who claims this, but it is what my gut is telling me. I hope this does not minimize sexual assault or lead others to believe that I am quick to dismiss such a serious claim).* All of this occurred within the past 2 months, but is not the first time she has experienced depression, attempted suicide, or been raped.

Soon after the girl was 51/50'd, my brother began having panic attacks and claimed he was dealing with depression. In fact, his girlfriend essentially diagnosed him (since she has the exact same issues) and convinced him he had these illnesses, for lack of a better word. She convinced him to see someone. Over the course of a month, he began seeing a psychiatrist, therapist, professional counselor, and an intern counselor. He was quickly (like in his first visit) prescribed a mood stabilizer, and anti-depressant medication, and klonopin for anxiety.
Over the course of a month, he seemed to deteriorate emotionally. He struggled to maintain his studies, had frequent anxiety attacks, and seemed more depressed than I have ever seen him.
Fast-forward a couple weeks. We find out that he has been abusing prescription drugs, has been struggling with alcohol addiction, has been possibly shop-lifting, constantly lying to friends and family, making awful choices, and has reportedly gotten engaged (though he has not told us this). He has become someone we do not recognize. We feared for his safety.

We pulled him out of school for a few days to work with him and surround him with family. We find out that his problems with addiction were more than we realized. He is unhappy with how things are and begins to see how upset his family has become. In the meantime, he continuously sneaks away to see his girlfriend and gets seriously upset when we try and get him back home. We knew he was in an unsafe place and this girl was not a person he should be around. When he is with family, he becomes more of the person we know him as; however, he seems to become someone else when he talks with or sees her. We believe that he is in an extremely unhealthy, dangerous, and codependent relationship.

After he comes home for a few days, we all come to accept that he needs a rehabilitation program. He wants to go and knows that he needs to get clean and work on himself. He checked himself into a rehab center last week.
He calls when he can. He has, on more than one occasion, requested we send him his girlfriend's phone number. We politely refuse because we are uncomfortable doing so. We want him to focus on himself and just get healthy. He gets upset when we refuse to give him what he wants. Truth is, if he wants to contact her, he will find a way. We know that -- we don't want to enable the relationship or feel pressured into doing something we are uncomfortable with.

We know that the girl is not the source of the problem. He makes his own decisions and is responsible for them. But we do feel that she manipulates him severely. Her (very recent) sexual trauma and past emotional problems lead us to believe that she is in no place ready to develop a healthy relationship. The relationship screams codependency and appears very toxic. Our greatest fear is that he will return from rehab in 3 weeks and jump right back into the relationship without having developed the mental strength and skills necessary to deal with his personal issues and issues within the relationship.

I'm not quite sure what I am looking for, but I feel that I need some outside advice. I would like to hear some opinions from others outside my family. I apologize if I skimmed over anything or did not go into enough detail.

**TL:DR** - Brother in rehab for prescription drug addiction. In a highly toxic and codependent relationship. Fear that he will jump into the relationship immediately after rehab without developing the skills and mental strength necessary to get healthy. Looking for advice."

1duvm3,2,2013-05-07,A former company that I wrote blog articles for is threatening to give another writer the credit for my work if I don't create a Google + account,[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1duvm3/a_former_company_that_i_wrote_blog_articles_for/,"From October 2012-April 2013 I wrote weekly articles for the blog of a beauty company that my friend is, unfortunately, the CMO of. She texted me yesterday and said that if I don't create a Google + account then she will be forced to put my content under another writers name. I actually did create an account about 4 weeks ago, even after I was no longer doing contracting work for them, but after several attempts of them being unable to figure it out I deleted my profile. I have been asked why I wouldn't just give up to avoid conflict, but I have over 20,000 words that would be given to someone else. It is unfair and frankly sounds to me like theft. Legally speaking I was hoping someone could tell me if I am fully covered or if there is some loophole I don't know about. I never signed a contract.  I'm sorry for the wall of text, but here is the entire text convo for context if that helps:

Her:  Hey girl hey!  I'm working with one of my interns on ramping up our Google+ info - I'm wondering if you could take a min and link your profile to the new ***** beauty profile? My goal is to make sure all our writers keep their association with their content, but because Google looks highly upon content that is linked appropriately to a google+ account, it's a must  for us because of search ranking. For everyone that can't help us make this change, I will have to roll your content up to another active blogger which I would HATE to do. I really want you to keep the cred for the great work you did for us!  Honestly, it takes 30 secs :) hope you can help us'

Me: Hey I have already done this twice I'm not really sure what else I can do. And just to be clear are you saying that you would change the name of my stuff that I have written to someone else's?

Her:  I checked in w ******** and she had noted that she was unclear on which G+ profile you linked to. I have 2 girls who have been completely unresponsive and what I sent was a copy/paste. Now that I have info that you've been trying to work this thru I can work directly with you on it. For folks that are unresponsive I don't have a choice but to roll it up to someone else. Google dings us hard w the authorship jig

Me:  Can you explain to me what exactly rolling it up to someone else means?

Her:  Yes, it would push the posts under someone else's Wordpress profile

Me:  Would it still have my name on it

Her:  Not if we rolled it to someone else. But it's a non-issue if you've been working on it. My intern was unclear on what was going on w your account

Me:  I have to be honest ********** I don't really appreciate the tone you came at me with regarding this. I would have been happy to help if you would have approached me nicely but instead you said you were going to just give my content to another writer if I didnt cooperate. As someone who considers you a friend I'm not sure why you felt it was necessary to try and strong arm me. Please just remove all of my writing from the website

Her:  I think you're reading a little too deeply into it. I voiced over and over that my goal was to give each writer cred. I stated 3 times that I wanted you to keep the credit - could you point to the language I used that made it seem like my intent was anything else?  I'm really confused

Me:  The intent wasn't the issue it was the tone and the fact that you would think it was acceptable to give my writing or anyones writing to someone else for any reason. I'm sorry this isn't working out how you would like but I'm not going to make an account at this point and I'm not giving my consent to you using my content so the only option now is to just take it down.

Her:  ******, I'm not sure where this is coming from but as a friend I'm going to honor your request

Me:  I appreciate it thank you

Her:  Could you please let me know how you read into tone via text?  Again, I'm still confused. I've tried to be ultra supportive, I feel like this is really out of left field and my communication was not a strong arm. If it was, I would have used very different language. But now, here we are. Your friendship obviously means more to me, but I need to learn ur communication style. And I hope you can see what a precarious situation this puts me. I hope we can talk this through

Me:  I'm not going to argue semantics. You didnt approached this as someone who is a friend so I didn't feel the need to respond like a friend. You set the tone and if you can't see that I would suggest showing this to someone you trust will give you an honest opinion of how you sound. Nothing more to talk through just please take everything down.

Her:  How about taking a walk to talk it thru in person. Actually I sent this to 3 other people and got a completely congenial response so honestly I'm really unclear on what brought you to this conclusion. I really wish you could at least point out how you got here so I can see how we can remedy this.

Me:  I would be happy to walk with you or talk with you at some point because I believe this can be separated from our friendship if we want it to be, but just so you understand the situation well I'm not going to change my mind regarding removing the content.

Her:  Available tomorrow? And I hope you understand that each piece of content is an investment for ******, so I'm will try to push it but I'm not sure how the company will need to handle it. I'm more interested in ensuring that you and I can come to terms w this so I can understand why this upset you so badly

Me:  No I am helping my sister this week because she is about to have her baby but I am available next week. And the company has no option but to take it down. They can't falsely use my content under someone else's name so please have it taken down by Friday.

Her: Like I said, I'll do what I can."

I have a few questions on what the IT/Systems Admin job market is like in Germany and whether it is realistic that I could make it.

First off, I'm graduating in about six months with a computer science undergrad degree at the University of Oregon. I have my Network+, and Security+ certificates and I'm working on getting the CCNA and CCNP certifications. Sadly I have no professional work experience or internships, all I have is unrelated work doing groundskeeping for my university and unfortunately it looks like I'm going to be stuck with this. Additionally though, I do have an uncertified B2 level understanding of German from classes and work outside the classroom.

With my certifications, degree, and some hobby work (I run a private video/music server and a public web/email server) would it be realistic that I could find a job as a jr. systems administrator or similar after graduation? Where would be the best place to look? If it's unrealistic, what should I work on to improve my CV?

I am working on a BS in Statistics and Mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh and am interested in data analysis, statistical modeling, data mining, machine learning, and Big Data in general.  Background is as follows:

* Current GPA is a 3.377 with a 3.625 for last Spring.  My Statistics GPA is a 3.52, and a 3.59 when a class taken outside my university is included (I received an A, but it appears as transfer credit on my transcript).  I have a 3.59 when both Statistics and Math classes are included (excluding that class that doesn't appear on my transcript).

* Two Calculus-based mathematical statistics courses, along with two linear algebra courses: one applied/theoretical, and one scientific computing-oriented.

* Regression, including work on an independent project

* [A week-long statistical modeling workshop](http://www.samsi.info/workshop/undergraduate-modeling-workshop-may-13-17-2013) with SAMSI in North Carolina, where I modeled climate data in R.

* General experience with Python.  I've done some small mining of Twitter with it.

* Some experience with Java, but I will be taking an introductory course on it this summer.

* Basic understanding of MATLAB that will improve this summer with a numerical linear algebra course

* R

* Excel

* LaTeX

I do not have any SQL experience but am looking to gain some, if possible.  I am a fast learner and can pick it up if need be.  The same applies for any other database management system, including (and especially) SAS.

I will be in Pittsburgh starting on May 20.  Please message if you are interested in hiring me."
1dukv5,1,2013-05-07,Question About Myself,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1dukv5/question_about_myself/,"So I guess this is going to be a pretty long post. 

I've just finished my first year of college at a very prestigious university. Its the place that I have always wanted to be, and I always thought about going here before I actually got in. I did fine, and I am basically satisfied with my grades, social life and related things. However, college was really, really stressful for me, much more than I expected it to be. My job is really time consuming and my schoolwork was also tough (gotta beat the standard deviation scores!). I felt like I never had any time to stop, or slow down or relax. 

Over the past year, starting in the late spring of 2012, I have had several short intervals of depression-like feeling which lasted anywhere from 1-3 days, only to go away for like a week. I would often think about how what I was doing in life was very pointless and there would be no worth in it after I died. I had ideas about suicide, but they are really only thoughts, and not real intentions. They were more like ""what if"" questions that I thought about in my mind. Sometimes I would cry at night too. I would also often think about negative things about myself.

Also, even though I have only smoked pot a few times (I tried it for the first time last fall), I often found myself wanting more of it during these phases. I like the way it makes everything feel different, and how it makes me think in radically different ways. I guess its just an easy way of escapism for me. I worry about what will happen when I have as much access as I can to it, which is probably going to happen this summer and next semester in school.

So now its the end of the year, but I don't feel accomplished at all, despite all that I have done (pretty much straight A's and a good position in a school organization). I should be happy about finishing, but I see all my peers lined up with these summer jobs and whatever, and I have nothing and no internship despite applying to some.  

I feel like my mental health isn't normal, but I also I feel like its not enough for me to go see a doctor, because usually I AM fine. I know this might scream BIPOLAR but I still don't know if its really that severe. I haven't told anyone about these feelings either. I doubt anyone knows about it because whenever I am with people I am usually ok, and I smile a lot with them. What are your thoughts?"

Edit2: for those interested in my routine/diet (copied from a comment of mine)

I follow the flexible dieting protocol, where I have a set # of macronutrients (proteins, fats, carbs) that I try to hit for each day. In addition to this, I make sure I get 2 servings vegetables, and at least 1 serving fruit just for overal health/wellness. Throughout my weight gain, both my calories and macronutrients have consistently increased. I partition them at ~35-40% protein, 20-25% fat, and 40% carb.
For my routine I follow a push/pull/legs/off split. Where push= chest/shoulders/triceps legs= self explanatory lol pull= back/biceps
In terms of compound lifts, I actually only recently started squatting, before that I was just using the leg press. I've put a primary focus on incline dumbell bench as opposed to flat bench, and I'm going to learn to deadlift this summer when I move to my new gym."
1ducdc,1,2013-05-07,"[23/M] here, dating a [20/F]. My depression, gf being hesitant to open up, this stupid routine, and on top of it all, it's a fairly new relationship. Advice needed.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ducdc/23m_here_dating_a_20f_my_depression_gf_being/,"Wall of text:

1. My grandmother passed away in January and I didn't really get a chance to cope until very recently. The week prior to her death, I managed to acquire two jobs (an internship at my university and a tutoring job) so I kinda just stayed busy and kept my grieving to a minimum. This worked for me for awhile, but it came raging to the forefront a few weeks ago.

2. Met the gf in February. Things were fucking awesome. Lots of fun and general excitement. I worked very hard to get her to be with me, so of course I was pretty elated when it panned out. We are very different in personality, though. For an idea, I'm an ESFJ and she's an INFP.

3. I'm very much extroverted and social. She's definitely social as well, but not even close to the extent I am. I'm fine with that, though. We acknowledged our differences very early on, but as you'll see soon there needs to be some changes. 

4. Fell into a terrible routine. In our defense, we were both horribly busy with school (plus I had my jobs still). We made time for one another at the expense of our social lives. In hindsight, this was a horrible idea; but if we hadn't done so we would've only been seeing each other once a week so...maybe it wasn't?

5. Work and school really, really wore me down (or at least that's what I think happened). Normally I'm a outspoken and cheery dude, but I noticed some drastic changes in my behavior. I became disinterested in hanging out with people, my grades, going to class, etc. I became quiet and mopey. I slept WAY more than usual. I don't know if I was just burnt out or if I was just depressed, but it was bad. But anyway, this funk lasted for a month but finally subsided around finals week (last week).

6. During this funk, I became pretty fucking boring. I know I did. And it drove me crazy. Along with it, I'd question her on stupid things. Like, if she was snappy or being distant I'd ask her what's up whenever she was probably just tired and grumpy. I'd worry about our relationship; I'd read into what she said too much... Fuck man, I was paranoid. It's amazing she didn't ditch.

7. To add to this nonsense, I really didn't realize what was going on with me at the time. It took a friend pointing out to me that I was being shitty (mopey, sad, quiet, etc). But once I did acknowledge what was wrong with me, I made a conscious decision to fix it. It's been a little over a week into working on it, and I do feel loads better (school's over so that was a big weight lifted as well). Went and visited my family, grandma's gravesite (I actually felt closure. The day of the funeral I had to leave home to go back to my school/work combo, so I didn't get a chance to deal with it).

8. I told her about all this around a week ago. She asked if I wanted a break and I told her no, that I wanted to work through this and be with her at the same time. I told her I was sorry for letting my issues creep into our relationship, and that next time I would come to her with it. She says she understands, but is just really concerned (for reasons I totally understand).

9. My issues with her: she's been hesitant to open up with me since the beginning, yet she told me last night she wants more of a relationship. I told her the two don't exactly go hand-in-hand, that I really wanted her to come to me with concerns and really anything. Now I understand that I wasn't exactly up front with my situation, but I genuinely didn't realize it was happening other than me being a bit testy at times (rarely around her). I'm willing to be vulnerable with her and always have been, but she has really taken her time doing this. I acknowledge that everyone is different when it comes to this, but my god, it's frustrating. To boot, it seems like everything I ask is too personal for her to talk about. This makes it nearly impossible to get to know her, so of course I'm feeling a bit distant myself.

TL;DR: Fell into a funk with everything; dealt with it pretty well on a personal level; however, this funk crept into my relationship, and I feel terrible for it; girlfriend won't open up because of who-knows-what, and it's testing my patience  (we have plans to talk about this communication business next week when she visits, but we're still talking via phone); I want more communication and comfort (as does she), but I'm scared to death that I may have ruined everything. 


I just want an objective opinion and some advice. Give it to me straight, please. 

And I'm so sorry if this is a jumbled mess of a post. As you can probably tell, I'm pretty scatterbrained at the moment."

Last January I enrolled at a local state university where I have a 3.8+ GPA.  I have 14 credits left to finish out my BS in Economics and had a question regarding how I should finish it up.  In order to get the BS I need to complete Calculus II (I know, should have done that way back).  I also have to take 7 credits at my present school which will be done online.  These are the options I presently have:

1.  Complete 10 credits online at present school and take Calculus II at another school in my hometown, allowing me to finish up by the end of June.

2. Complete 7 credits online at present school, take Calculus II and an Economics course at Harvard (which has open enrollment for the summer, but at significant cost,)  this would result in me finishing up by the middle of August.

3.  Complete 7 credits online at present school, take an Economics course at Harvard, and take Calc II at a local community college online.  This would also result in me finishing up by the middle of August.

4.  Complete 10 credits online at present school, take Calc II at Harvard, finish in mid august.

5. And finally, the all online option - 10 at present school and Calc II at community college, finish the 10 by end of June and calc ends beginning of August.

Sorry for the rant-length post, but I was hoping I could get some advice from y'all.  I'm thinking that at least having Harvard somewhere on my Resume could be helpful, particularly with the way they are automatically screened today.  On the other hand it is at significant cost and could have a negative impact on my GPA.  Thanks for your time!"
1du144,1,2013-05-06,Moving from SE to Pen Testing/InfoSec,[deleted],AskNetsec,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/1du144/moving_from_se_to_pen_testinginfosec/,"Hi guys,

I am a freshman at a state university with no security courses taught here nor any active security groups. I am trying to get a couple of students together to start a CTF team, but I really don't know what I am doing in that regard. We do have a decently ranked CS program in light of not having any security specific classes.

* I am a good CS student; to the point where I have tested out of classes and have been approved for taking grad courses next year
* I would like to either be a software engineer or a pen tester after I graduate, and would like to know how to best prepare for pen testing since I have the SE part covered with past experience.
* I have a SE internship at a fortune 100 tech company in a hardware group (nothing to do with security) and I'm wondering how I should approach the security departments (or if I should at all) at said company to express my interest
* As far as I know, there are only two pen testing orgs that operate in my state
* I have WAHH 2, CEH study guide (v7 I believe), quite a few Cisco books for CCNP and CCNA which I will probably study for, but not take the exams. I like having knowledge even if I don't have the certs. Quite a few other books in security from lock picking to SQL injection (more advanced topics of SQL injection, not really beginner topics except the first couple of chapters).
* I have recently gotten into a lot of trouble at my university for ""hacking"" their registration system (I basically just bypassed part of the system to register for classes early) so they will probably not be too happy if I try to organize a CTF team or an infosec club on campus because I received a total of 68 months of probation from various departments on campus.
* I am also interested in malware analysis and have done a lot of this on .NET and Java malware in years past. I am very proficient in Java bytecode. This could be another avenue of work I may pursue, but I am at a loss for what goes into getting into this field.

Thanks!"

You dislike my boyfriend because of his grades? AT LEAST HE GRADUATED FUCKING HIGH SCHOOL AND GOT INTO ONE OF THE TOP COLLEGES IN THE NATION. And what did you do? DROP OUT TO GET MARRIED. You didn't even make it past high school. You can't complain. You also can't complain that my 3.5 in the Engineering School is a 'shitty grade' because if 'someone got a 4.0, so can you'. No. You don't understand college. You don't understand what credits means, what curving is, what prerequisites are. All you know is ""WELL WE DID SEVEN PAGES OF HOMEWORK A DAY BACK IN HONG KONG."" 

KISS MY ASS SEVEN PAGES. I DO, READ, TAKE NOTES ON, AND MEMORIZE TEN FOLD ON A WEEKLY BASIS. 

I didn't bring him up in conversation, YOU DID. You can't turn around and say ""oh, but you were hinting at it"". NO YOU JUST WANT TO ANTAGONIZE ME. THAT'S ALL YOU WANT TO DO BECAUSE YOU LIFE IS SO BORING BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO LAZY TO LEAVE THE HOUSE. It's not because of your 'physique' or how 'tired your job makes you'. I've seen you go on seven hour shopping sprees which you FUCKING DRAG ME TO EVEN THOUGH I HATE IT. You're just lazy and addicted to pigging out and watching Chinese dramas. WOW. SO MUCH MORE PRODUCTIVE AND HARD THAN BEING AN ENGINEER. 4.0 FOR YOU. FOUR POINT FUCKING O. 

You're not pissed because I laid me head on his lap, because GOD FORBID FUCKING PREGNANCY. BABIES EVERYWHERE. LET ME STRAP ON MY BABY HELMET AND SET MYSELF IN A BABY CANNON AND SHOOT MYSELF OFF TO BABY LAND WHERE I CAN JUST HAVE BABIES EVERYWHERE BECAUSE I LOVE BABIES. You're not pissed because I chose to sit next to him rather than in the passenger seat. You're pissed because you don't have friends anymore because you bitched every single one of them out because you think you're MORALLY RIGHTEOUS ALL THE TIME (no, you're not; you're stubborn half the time) and your precious daughter finally found someone else to share her feelings. SHARE. THE KEY TERM IS SHARE. 

WHY CAN'T YOU BE HAPPY I FOUND SOMEONE I LOVE? And someone that loves me back? And actually does stuff with me that I like? I don't like Chinese dramas. I don't like shopping sprees. I don't like grocery shopping. I like looking at architecture and admiring nature and hiking and mountain climbing and playing TF2 (which, according to you, is a violent abomination though you fund my brother for his CoD games). I like drawing and analyzing the distribution of forces in strange buildings and you think all of these things are A TIME WASTE BECAUSE YOU'RE. TOO. LAZY. AND GAS. WELL WE CAN TAKE WALKS AND TALK ABOUT THINGS ||NOT|| the past. You dwell in the past like a fucking Smeagol. 

You hate on my boyfriend, who cares for me and goes out of his way to see if he can cheer me up, when all you do is put me down: you don't try hard enough (no, I shit out equations day and night), you don't try and find jobs (well it's not my fault they all happened to be unpaid internships BUT THEY'RE JOBS AND MY ENTRY LEVEL SALARY IS MORE THAN YOU AND DAD'S COMBINED). You hate on him even though dad gambled away all the money and perpetually annoys you and you don't even bash on that, but you hate on the one person who I genuinely enjoy being around?

I'm an adult now. I have to leave the nest sometime and you have to suck that up. I'll fly fucking back because I have these fancy metaphorical wings people like to talk about; I'm not a heartless fuck who'll sayonara-the-fuck-outta-here just  because she has a man. I just want to move on with my life and grow a little. Experience more than melons and the latest Chinese celebrity gossip and you hatred of every human being around you except yourself.

You can't drive an argument by talking over me. You can't assume you're right and just shoot for sarcasm right after I throw the harsh truth out. You're not bettering your points; you're making them immature. 

Stop it.

1dtwba,1,2013-05-06,A family member is in a codependent relationship and is currently seeking help for drug abuse. I fear his relationship may prevent him from getting healthy. Need advice (x-post),beautifultranslation,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1dtwba/a_family_member_is_in_a_codependent_relationship/,"Background:

My brother (19) is in quite the situation.  Several months after beginning college, he began dating a girl.  The relationship seemed to get pretty serious fairly quick.  To date, they have been dating for about 6 months.  The girl has a background of mental instability and sexual trauma that we are aware of.  While they have been dating, the girl has attempted suicide, has been 51/50'd, and was reportedly raped *(I say reportedly because she refused to alert authorities and I also fear she may be claiming this to salvage a relationship that seemed to be fizzling.  I feel bad for questioning her, or anyone who claims this, but it is what my gut is telling me.  I hope this does not minimize sexual assault or lead others to believe that I am quick to dismiss such a serious claim). * All of this occurred within the past 2 months, but is not the first time she has experienced depression, attempted suicide, or been raped.

Soon after the girl was 51/50'd, my brother began having panic attacks and claimed he was dealing with depression.  In fact, his girlfriend essentially diagnosed him (since she has the exact same issues) and convinced him he had these illnesses, for lack of a better word.  She convinced him to see someone.  Over the course of a month, he began seeing a psychiatrist, therapist, professional counselor, and an intern counselor.  He was quickly (like in his first visit) prescribed a mood stabilizer, and anti-depressant medication, and klonopin for anxiety.  

Over the course of a month, he seemed to deteriorate emotionally.  He struggled to maintain his studies, had frequent anxiety attacks, and seemed more depressed than I have ever seen him.  

Fast-forward a couple weeks.  We find out that he has been abusing prescription drugs, has been struggling with alcohol addiction, has been possibly shop-lifting, constantly lying to friends and family, making awful choices, and has reportedly gotten engaged (though he has not told us this).  He has become someone we do not recognize.  We feared for his safety.

We pulled him out of school for a few days to work with him and surround him with family.  We find out that his problems with addiction were more than we realized.  He is unhappy with how things are and begins to see how upset his family has become.  In the meantime, he continuously sneaks away to see his girlfriend and gets seriously upset when we try and get him back home.  We knew he was in an unsafe place and this girl was not a person he should be around.  When he is with family, he becomes more of the person we know him as; however, he seems to become someone else when he talks with or sees her.  We believe that he is in an extremely unhealthy, dangerous, and codependent relationship.

After he comes home for a few days, we all come to accept that he needs a rehabilitation program.  He wants to go and knows that he needs to get clean and work on himself.  He checked himself into a rehab center last week.

He calls when he can.  He has, on more than one occasion, requested we send him his girlfriend's phone number.  We politely refuse because we are uncomfortable doing so.  We want him to focus on himself and just get healthy.  He gets upset when we refuse to give him what he wants.  Truth is, if he wants to contact her, he will find a way.  We know that -- we don't want to enable the relationship or feel pressured into doing something we are uncomfortable with.


We know that the girl is not the source of the problem.  He makes his own decisions and is responsible for them.  But we do feel that she manipulates him severely.  Her (very recent) sexual trauma and past emotional problems lead us to believe that she is in no place ready to develop a healthy relationship.  The relationship screams codependency and appears very toxic.  Our greatest fear is that he will return from rehab in 3 weeks and jump right back into the relationship without having developed the mental strength and skills necessary to deal with his personal issues and issues within the relationship.

I'm not quite sure what I am looking for, but I feel that I need some outside advice.  I would like to hear some opinions from others outside my family.  I apologize if I skimmed over anything or did not go into enough detail.


**TL:DR** - Brother in rehab for prescription drug addiction.  In a highly toxic and codependent relationship.  Fear that he will jump into the relationship immediately after rehab without developing the skills and mental strength necessary to get healthy.  Looking for advice."

Anyway, to get right into it. I've just been informed that I will have an intern position at EA Sports Tiburon this summer here in Maitland, FL and will be working directly with the Madden team. They've asked me to compile a list of things before I go in as they make the final changes to Madden 25 this summer and I thought it would be great if I gave this community a chance to voice their opinions. So, if you would kindly list some of these things for me so that I can add it to my recommendations, that would be great.


* If you could add 5 new things to Madden, what would they be?

* If you could take away 5 things from Madden, what would they be?

* What game mechanics do you like, and which ones do you dislike? 

* How important is presentation to you? (Pre-Game, Halftime, Stat updates, etc.)

* List 5 tweaks you would make to this next years Madden

* What would you change about Connected Careers to make it better for you? (Will be called Connected Franchise in Madden 25)

* What would you like to see the next-gen implement with the new Maddens? (Live stream, touch pads, social networking, etc.)

* Do any of you use the Kinect with Madden?

* Do you feel the ratings are accurate? 

* If you were to list 5 over powered things in Madden, what would they be?

* If you were to list 5 under powered things in Madden, what would they be?

I really appreciate the feedback, and hopefully a lot of this information takes some serious consideration from the upper guys at EA Sports. I'll do my best to work some influence at the position I am in. "

I'm trying to line up some prospective internship opportunities when the time comes.

Unfortunately, the companies on the eastside that I am finding myself somewhat interested in state ""interns must be enrolled in a bachelor program at a university"", which may or may not nix me out, but it seems to float on the former. Obviously, a paying internship would be ideal, but if you know of anyone who'd be willing to take on an intern without pay....I'll also buy that.

I'm a prospective chemE major. As a whole, I'm finding it somewhat hard to make connections as a CC student in eastside, since our career center is terrible, and no one seems eager to join an engineering club I'm trying to get together.

Any general advice you can give about getting an internship would be great. If you have anything specific to the title, that's even better!"

Normally, I don't have a fear of rejection. I've been able to deal with girls saying no when asking them to go out with me. ""Meh, there's always someone else."". In this case, I am fucking terrified.

My ex and I broke up during my senior, her junior year of high school. It wasn't on the best of terms, but it wasn't malicious. We had been together for the better part of the best two years of my young life.

She's easily the most beautiful, brilliant, well rounded, *amazing* woman that I've ever met, and is still the best thing that has ever happened to me. She was valedictorian, I had great test scores on my ACT / SAT, but was also a stoner with no motivation. She tried her hardest to motivate me, to get me ready for college, to get me off my ass. She really cared. We loved each other.

We decided it'd be best to take a break since she was studying a lot and I was, well, smoking a ton of pot and partying my senior year into the ground. We still kept in contact, and even had community college courses together. To be honest, we still had a bit of a relationship, but we had to strain ourselves to keep it as casual as we could. She came to a birthday dinner of mine with my parents, and we were on the track to getting back together, against our ""better"" judgement. We both knew I wasn't going to get into the university she was accepted to for at least a year while I finished my courses at CC. Stupidly (at least now I think it stupid), I took my former best friend's advice and cut all ties to her. I was obviously still in love with her, and her with I, but I couldn't take it knowing that we wouldn't be together for at least a year (turned out to be longer). I was immature and selfish. I felt, and still feel, like such a prick. She was trying to reconnect with me and I just blew her off so we wouldn't each be hurt.

I didn't talk to her for almost a year after that. My life fell apart. I moved out of my parents' house at 18 because my adolescent hubris wouldn't allow me to stay with them. How dare they ask me to take out the trash and be home by midnight?! I'm an adult!

I wish I could jump back in time and break my own jaw. It'd be worth the scarring.

Moved out of their house, lost my car (a brand new car they had bought for me), got a shit box of a Kia and moved in with some friends. Stopped going to college. Spent all of my money on pot and alcohol. I can't lie, it wasn't a *bad* time, but I still missed my ex (hereby now referred to as 'B', because I'm not creative enough to come up with a nickname for her that isn't one of her initials), and was going no where in life working a dead end job at a gas station.

I reconnected with her a bit, but being the brash, arrogant dicksnap I'd become within the year that we had broken up, we ended up arguing (not something that happened more than in a healthy relationship), and I didn't talk to her for a while after that. Started dating a trashy girl, moved in with my grandparents' house.

During this time, I never stopped thinking about her. I still haven't. Got a new job at a department store that wasn't quite as dismal and shitty as working graveyard at a gas station. Started school again, not bad. Still thinking about B.

Talked to her on and off, blah blah; more whiny filler about how much I miss this amazing girl I left behind. Every time we talked it was like we were still dating, but we would eventually abruptly stop again, and it was beginning to be hard to deal with. We both went through SO's like water. I was never happy in a relationship without her - I'm still not.

More time passed, my grandpa died. Grandma moved out, I moved back in with the friends I had lived with in my high school days. She came down to our hometown to visit on holiday from Uni. She invited me to come see her, which would become the first time we saw each other in person in almost two and a half years. I still had some of her stuff stored away in the attic and my closet, so I figured it was a good enough time to go see her.

I was sweating bullets. By the time I got there I had already gone through my undershirt. The butterflies came back just the same as they always did. More than anything I just wanted to see her face again.

It was awesome. We just sat in her driveway for something like three hours, staring at the sky and catching up with each other. She spoke of college life, and the boys she dated and left behind. Her parents were home and are pretty strict (see also: insane), so we cut the night short, exchanged hugs, and promised to meet up again.

A few weeks later she was down for her mom's birthday, and we saw each other again. Went shopping, had fun, but didn't do anything not related to being only friends. 

She begged me to come up and stay at her dorm, but I just couldn't do it at the time. I had no money, or time. I told her I would as soon as I could.

Again she came down (this all happened within a period of about two months) for a weekend trip with her roommates. We met up for dinner, and it was obvious that there's still something there. We both wanted to embrace and start over, but that is somewhat inappropriate in a restaurant setting with her friends one table down from us. We parted again, and again she asked desperately for me to come up and see her, and even to hurry and finish college so I could go back to university. 

I couldn't. I wanted nothing more but to drop my life and go back to her, but it just wasn't possible. I had bills, and a job, and a life that I couldn't just drop and leave.

Fast forward to about a month ago. I've moved, not far, but definitely away into the city. I have a decent desk job and am finishing college. 

By now, we've both found new SO's (again), and the school year is ending. I told her I could drop by and see her if she wanted while I was up further north to visit a friend, but she was busy with finals and has an internship out of state for the summer, but that she'd be back in the fall. Before she leaves, though, she's coming back to our hometown (and coincidentally I will also be there when she will be) to visit her family. 

Her current boyfriend lives where the internship is (long distance relationship), but recently more than ever I've been dying to tell her how I feel.

I don't want her to go back to her boyfriend and forget about me. I feel guilty dating someone while contemplating this entire situation, but I can't help it. It's eating me up inside and I need to tell her, but I'm entirely too scared of what may come of it. 

None of the relationships I've had since her have worked out, and it's all because I always put her in front of whomever I'm dating. It's unfair to the girls getting pushed aside, and it's unfair to me to be in a relationship that I just don't want. Four semi-serious sounding relationships have come and gone for me, and I've been apathetic towards all of them because of how much love I still have for this unbelievable girl.

So, Reddit. What should I do? I don't want her to think I'm just some obsessed ex with an infatuation - it's not overtaking my life, but I feel like a large chunk of me is missing without her. I think she feels the same way, but I really can't tell, especially with her having a boyfriend and not being able to talk to her very often due to our busy schedules. 

I feel horrible telling her all of this now, but I always thought I'd just get over it like every other relationship I've had. I definitely haven't. It's still eating me up inside. 

It's so rude of me to bring this up while we're both dating people, I know. Has anyone else gone through something like this? What would you do in my situation? Tell her now so that she has the summer to dwell on it, or take a chance and wait until she gets back home to let her know?

**TL;DR:** The love of my life is still within reach, and I don't know how to tell her how I feel because I'm unsure of how she'll react to it.

I wasn't sure if this counts as 'relationship' advice, because right now we're not technically dating, but I still think of what we have as somewhat of a relationship. 

If this is inapplicable to the subreddit, or borders on being a rant, I really am sorry, guys. I'm just lost and looking for some guidance from someone other than my manly roommates.

Thank you in advance."

Whenever I try to log in to the RuneScape website at work (Yes, I'm that pathetic, but I don't have time to play otherwise), I get redirected and it comes up with an SSL Connection Error.

This applies to both the main RuneScape site as well as the Old School site. I can't log in to the forums to post, log in to edit my account, nor vote in any polls. I can play the game just fine (excluding the betas, due to the fact that you need to log in to the secure site BEFORE accessing the game), and there are no websites blocked at work. I work in the IT Department as an intern, and I have the ability (and permission) to change anything necessary on my personal computer to get it fixed. I narrowed down that it's not a router/domain issue by using a different computer on the same domain and it was able to connect fine. 

It doesn't do this on any other site (that I've seen), and I did some research on it but didn't get very far: most just told me to make sure SSL 2.0 and TLS 1.2 are checked under Internet Options, which they are. I've tried different combinations of these two settings as well, though I'll change them again if anyone thinks a certain combination would work best. 

For reference, in Chrome I get the message:

In Mozilla Firefox, the error shows:

And IE just says it can't display the webpage... Fricken Microsoft...

Anyway any help would be appreciated, if I can't get it fixed it's no big deal, just wouldn't mind playing the RS3 Beta when there's nothing to do here at work. Thanks for taking the time to read the novel."

Just a few days ago, I suddenly began to feel depressed again, but for no real reason. I just feel really tired, and I have no motivation to do anything. I have an internship at a really cool company starting in a couple weeks, and I don't even feel excited at all. I can feel like its slowly getting worse. I woke up this morning, sat up and just didn't even want to move for like ten minutes as the feeling slowly set back in. My head has just felt really, odd, lately. 

Yesterday evening, all of a sudden, I mean like within seconds, I suddenly felt fine. Like great, the happiness slowly crept back into me and I almost felt like crying in relief. As night came though, and I laid in bed, it slowly crept back, and I went to sleep hoping it would be gone. And it didn't.

I'm only 19 and if this is depression, I don't want it to spiral out of control like it did those years ago. I want to feel excited and happy about things again.

Feel free to skip the somewhat technical parts.


*****
###Background information
*****

I'm a college student completing his last semester towards an Applied Computer Science bachelor's degree, ""majoring"" (for lack of a better analogy to the system in my country) in Mainframes. During this last semester I'm required to run an internship which I have, of course, chosen to do with a company that employs a Mainframe. In my case a bank whose name I will not disclose.

I finished the assignment for this internship halfway through the semester, leaving me with some spare time. And even though I only start up Minecraft sporadically to check up on Westeroscraft's progress, I had this crazy idea to run a Minecraft server on our IBM Mainframe. 


*****
###How to do it
*****

I managed to get it running in one afternoon, so I did not encounter too many problems but here they are anyways.

z/OS doesn't have a web browser, so I had to FTP-put the .jar file on to the Mainframe. I didn't expect it to run off the bat so I just followed the Minecraft Server Wiki step by step guide (I had only ever run a Minecraft Server under Windows) to see what I would bump in to. Java -version gave me an error that the JVM couldn't be started. Turns out the problem was that [my user didn't have a large enough address space](http://i.imgur.com/GVzHM7F.png) when I logged on.
When you log on to an IBM Mainframe, you are assigned an address space, or room to work in. This is comparable to the RAM you are provided with when you log in to Linux or Windows. Except the address space is virtual. Your LPAR can have 10 Gigabytes of RAM physically allocated to it yet you can have a couple hundred virtual Gigabytes being used by running tasks and users. You'd be stupid not to since the resources on a Mainframe are so fast you could never hope to saturate them with a 1:1 virtual:real ratio.

So back on topic; I had my address space enlarged. Turns out [company standards dictate the maximum you get per user is 8 megabytes](http://i.imgur.com/Lxlwi2J.png), which was enough to start a JVM to run java -version, but hardly enough to start a Minecraft Server. The default value was much less as to save space when people that don’t need large address spaces log on. This was why java –version didn’t work. [I bypassed the 8 Mb policy](http://i.imgur.com/d1VbeQt.png) by issueing a request for alteration and I now had [2 Gigabytes of address space](http://i.imgur.com/iUN41NX.png) to work with, quite comfortable I'd say.
 
So I was able to [start the Minecraft server](http://i.imgur.com/VgvD0zj.png) with the same terminal command you’d use on your Ubuntu or Fedora box. It created the map and was (hopefully) listening for connections. It wasn't throwing any errors so it appeared that the TCP/IP libraries (which I feared for the most) translated over flawlessly.

Next problem was not Mainframe related, but rather Bank related. When I fired up the Minecraft client on my workstation and tried to log in, I was unsurprisingly faced with a time out because the port, when trying to move data outside, was blocked, making it unable to reach the login server. No problem, I just went in to offline mode after copying my %appdata%/.minecraft folder from my home machine to my workstation. I added the DNS name of the LPAR on which the server was running to my server list and behold, it existed. When I tried to connect however, I received a timeout after 20 seconds. I could see on my terminal that I tried to connect but timed out. As I mentioned before, I've only sporadically ran Minecraft Servers in the past for a handful of friends on a home machine under Windows, so I'm not very familiar with the intricacies that come with Minecraft servers. It turns out that the Minecraft client authenticates itself to Mojang servers so that unique things such as names can't be forged (or anyone could log in with a name that is present on the administrator list). This however is not possible for me to do considering the Bank's network doesn't allow traffic to the outside over most ports. So I had to change the server.properties file, which the server had created, to run the server in unauthenticated mode. When I tried to edit it however, [it was all gibberish](http://i.imgur.com/STXAIJV.png)!

Something you might not be aware of is that Mainframes don't use ASCII or Unicode character sets, but EBCDIC, also known as the best way to encrypt data (that's a joke by the way, you’re pretty OG if you get it). The Minecraft server was writing the file in ASCII but the Mainframe can't read it (well it does, but the MC server writes “a” to disk as 0x61 and the Mainframe reads it as “/”). So I had to FTP-get it off of the Mainframe on to my ASCII-capable workstation, edit it, and FTP-put it back on. In binary mode mind you, because the Mainframe tries to convert to EBCDIC whenever you send files to it.
So now when I start up the server it's in unauthenticated mode.

[And that's all](http://i.imgur.com/J4SyXdc.png), I was able to [connect to the server with no problems.](http://i.imgur.com/KaBjfdz.png) I know the pictures could easily be forged, but I couldn't think of a fool proof way to prove this thing is running on a Mainframe without disclosing what company I interned at. So I hope that the level of detail that I'm going in to is enough to convince you.

The only sad part is that our workstations only have 3 Gigs of RAM and no GPU, so the frame rate is abysmal. As a result it's not possible to check the performance of the Minecraft server with the client itself. If you know of a way to test server performance without the need of a client that renders frames, please tell me.


*****
###Our system
*****

For the sake of this post I'll mention what resources the server has at its disposal;
Our system consists of two z196 machines running 15 General Purpose CPs (Mainframe jargon for CPU) and 1 zIIP (CPU built specifically to run DB2, XML and Java workloads) each. These two machines run in what is called a Parallel Sysplex. [Feel free to read the wiki page about that](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Parallel_Sysplex), it's one of the concepts that define the Mainframe and allow it to be as reliable as it is. Each machine also has 330 physical gigabytes of RAM.

All the LPARs started on our system allocate 30 logical CPs combined. Yes, even CPUs are virtual on a Mainframe. These things are so fast you need to double (or more)-load them to make them cost efficient and not run idle too much. These CPs are quad cores that run at 5.2Ghz, watercooling optional. But they're so specialized that you can't really compare them to consumer CPUs. Your and my CPU is a jack of all trades while the IBM CPs are specifically trained workhorses. The four different levels of CPU cache are stupid fast. And while 5.2Ghz might not sound that fast, it is magnitudes faster than consumer CPUs if you're running the right workloads on them.
Just to give you an idea, our systems handle about 40 million transactions (don't think money transactions, read up on [transaction systems](https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/basics/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.zos.zmidtrmg/zmiddle_8.htm)) every day. Two years ago at 20 million transactions a day this meant peaks of 1500 transactions a second. The average execution time of each transaction was 0.03 seconds. I don’t know how many transactions a second we peak at nowadays.

The LPAR on which I started the Minecraft server was one of two LPARs used to convey tests before new things are implemented on to developer, audit and production LPARs. For this reason they're the weakest of the LPARs as to not impact production system throughput. What this comes down to is that the LPAR on which the server ran was allocated 2 Logical CPs and 6 Gigabytes of RAM (it usually runs on 3 Gigabytes, it’s running 6 temporarily for tests concerning my assignment). Because of how many CPs are allocated to the other LPARs, this means that it was able to take up a maximum of 6% of all the CP power available on the Mainframe. The memory doesn’t matter much because the address space I reserved is virtual. I could have reserved 12 logical gigabytes and the Minecraft server wouldn’t have noticed because the, at that point inevitable, paging is so fast on a Mainframe.
Interesting note; the two production LPARs that handle transactions generated by things like eBanking services have about 21 Gigabytes each at their disposal. 21 Gigabytes goes a long way on a Mainframe running z/OS compared to some datacenters that need silly amounts of resources to keep things running.

I'm really wondering what kind of a system Westeroscraft is using. They can always migrate to mainframe, it'll only cost you a million to get started. Or two million if you want stupid amounts of assured uptime. Comes with DDoS protection. I doubt a Kickstarter would suffice though. Then again I’m not even sure if Westeroscraft is the heaviest server online at the moment. They’re the biggest one I know of anyways. I wonder what hardware/setup they use.


*****
###Conclusion
*****

So this concludes my disquisition. I’m quite happy that I’ve successfully managed to start a Minecraft server on a Mainframe. It’s something that I wanted to at least try ever since I learned that IBM Mainframes can handle Java workloads. Not to mention it’s a great way to fill a slow Friday afternoon.

What makes me content is that I've managed to connect a relatively new concept with what is perceived by the general IT-initiated public as an old concept. I hope that those who read my post will understand that the Mainframe is no longer the concoction of boxes in an engineer-filled room. It's still a valid way of providing IT services. And not because of the need to retain legacy, but because the Mainframe is still very economically viable. It just happens to be so that the workloads in which Mainframes are specialized happen to be the workloads generated by institutes that are often out of the public eye.

When I went home Friday I withdrew some money from an ATM at one of the bank branches of the bank that I'm doing my internship with. It was the weirdest thing to realize that just hours ago I had worked on the same machine that was now processing my request.

I’ve also Googled a bit and I’m pretty sure that I’m the first person ever to (successfully) run a Minecraft server on a Mainframe. Or at the very least publish it. I’m willing to bet that it’s the most powerful hardware, and operating system too really, that a Minecraft server has ever run on.

If you read this far down I'd gather that you might be wondering if you can connect to the server and check it out for yourself. I'm sorry that due to bank policy, I'm going to have to disappoint you. The Mainframe doesn't allow connections outside of the Bank's network. To rub salt in the wound, we have a 100Mbps up and 100Mbps down connection for our workstations only, for the Mainframe itself it's likely way more. Our Mainframe would truly make a sick Minecraft server.

I'm genuinely surprised that I managed to write some 3000 words about this subject. Gives me somewhat of a reassuring feeling about the thesis I'm supposed to be writing right now. Sorry about the wall of text, I couldn't help myself I hope you enjoyed it.

**EDIT**;

Can we have a Mainframe flair for submissions? ;)

**EDIT2**;

Going to bed, will answer any more questions on the morrow."

I've only been doing really serious job searching since January (between August and January I was helping my dad fix up the house, as well as helping my grandparents with errands and the like).

Recently, I was provided two offers with companies I had interviewed with.

The first place to make me an offer would be a better fit for my career path. However, it's only been offered as an internship with pay (albeit fairly low). I was originally interviewing for a full-time position, but they ended up not needing a full-time employee--at least, not until last week, when a position opened up due to somebody else leaving. Instead of offering me the full-time position, though, they just said they'd like to try me out via the internship position, and then if I fit, they'd give me the full position. So like I said, this position would be a better fit for my degree; but at the same time, it's a bit of a risk, because I may not end up getting the full position if they don't feel I fit with them.

The other offer is more solid. It's full-time, benefits included, etc. However, it's more on the tech support side. I'm very familiar with IT support, as I've been doing it since high school, but it's not *exactly* the career path I'd like to follow. It's worth mentioning, though, that this position has the added benefit of being around home, meaning I would be able to live at home without paying rent, and would be able to save up money faster.

Sorry that this isn't worded terribly well, I wrote it in somewhat of a hurry. But, that's my pickle, and if you guys can give me any advice, I'd greatly appreciate it. If you need me to clarify anything, just let me know."

When I was a child I was put into a gifted kid's program and I've been in honors and AP courses ever since.

I couldn't wait to grow up because I had so much in store for my life. All everybody could see was how successful I was going to be when I grew up because I was smart and talented.

Well, not genius level, but common sense, and still fairly smart. Especially good at maths.

Growing up, I spent a lot of time on the computer. I ended up learning a lot HTML when I was 10, and programmed my first games when I was 11. I have never stopped using the computer since, and it has taken me seven years to realize that I wanted to do computer science when I grew up...


And everything felt wonderful for while. Until every organization started telling me I wasn't good enough for anything I wanted to do. I had so many dreams until all of this happened within one month.

I was denied from a math summer camp. I'm a 4.0 unweighted and two years ahead in math, future software engineer, rank 1 out of over 300 students. AP classes in calculus, compsci, physics. I thought it was because I wasn't poor enough but someone richer than me at school was chosen, and not me. All I can hope was that I was overqualified because I wasn't even waitlisted.

Then I wasn't chosen for this position about managing communications within a division of an organization. It didn't even matter if I qualified. Just mess up on an interview and life is unfair. I grew up making websites, and nothing was really going right. 

Lastly, I was rejected from a microsoft high school internship. I guess this kind of blew all my hopes and dreams away. It literally made my whole life feel USELESS because I obviously can't get into anything I apply for. I did more computer things than I listed, but even people with less programming experience were chosen and I'm just feeling like my life is a big pile of unfairness and everything sad.

All of this has made me so depressed. I started crying every day and thinking about ways to give myself a concussion so I can lose IQ and become more social-able. Obviously, that's a shitty idea, and then I realized I'm not thinking normal anymore.

My mother doesn't take my seriously because I'M JUST A TEENAGER. So that's right. I'm sixteen and I grew up being told that I was special and now I don't feel special anymore and it sucks. I can't deal with it by myself. 

I want my hard work to pay off. 
I want all of this to be worth it. 
I don't want to wait for success. 
I want to be happy now. 

My 4.0, AP courses, class rank. It's all useless. It's meaningless. Nobody seems to care about that anymore. Nobody even cares that I had so much passion for CS but now.... Now I feel ready to stop trying. "

As I have people I know graduating, I realize how much time my depression has taken from me. 

How unfortunately, I lack the things to be where I want to be.

And how I let fear pin me down and feed off me.

I’m trying 23 this year.

Twenty-fucking-three.

And I go on tumblr and see these awesome black alternative girls and I get sad, because I don’t have the money for nice clothes.

I have money to barely feed myself.

Truth is, I wear about the same set of jeans and shirts every week. I’m not sure if people have noticed, but it makes me feel so bad when I open my closet and realize I only have like 3 choices in jeans and maybe 7 in shirts.

Truth is, I only have two bras I wear interchangeably and they don’t even fit me properly.

Truth is, I’ve been splitting my paychecks in half, and putting it in a savings account.

Because when I somehow eventually get my license (if I ever), I can buy myself a car.

I feel bad for being jealous that everyone around me didn't have to work for one. Family members brought it for them, or passed it down.

But God, that independence… 

That will open so many doors for me.

Monday as I walk to Food Lion and back in the rain, three bags in one hand, trying to hold an umbrella, a sad image.

But that is my life. 

Everyone is getting or has internships in shit they want to do.

Due to no car, I can’t do that. 

I can’t find another possible high paying job somewhere else.

What am I doing with my life?

It’s been almost a week of break. I went to the movies once, which was nice. But so far it’s been me sitting inside as usual.

I can’t be like, “LET’S GO SOMEWHERE.” Because, it’s not up to me. 

I’m just grateful when people put up with giving me rides.

And now I just fucked up this past semester and may have to drop my english major.

And I just think, “Damn, why am I such a goddamn loser?”

Legit.

I wear the same clothes.

I may get teased that I take too long to get dressed when going out, but it’s because I never get that chance to try and make myself feel pretty.

I sit in the same damn place.

I do the same thing.

These 18-20 year girls on tumblr are living the life I want and I’m almost 23.

And I’m paranoid of losing time.

I’m awkward with people.

My body is all sorts of fucked up. Who the fuck even gets thick hair on their stomach?!

I am disgusting. :|

I can pop my back now, and when I stretch I crack.

My back hurts.

I am literally aging faster than I want to.

I always imagined myself by now being confident and a badass.

Who has awesome grades, which surprises people because she’s goth with piercings, but really, she’s a nice person.

Who doesn’t fucking let guys take advantage of her feelings and then cry cry cry. :|

And then on weekends she goes clubbing, or bowling, or a movie.

Who is comfortable with her money and doesn’t starve.

It sucks when I want to go get McDonalds or something because I’m hungry. But I can’t.

So I sit there.

I literally just am like, “Okay. Well…this sucks.”

Maybe I’m being whiny because I’m on my period.

I’m entering my senior year, and guess what?!

I am the same if not worse than when I entered.

Nope.

Nope.

1dwyd6,1,2013-05-08,I need some advice about getting into the field,reinhs,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/1dwyd6/i_need_some_advice_about_getting_into_the_field/,"Hello everyone, I recently graduated in Decemeber with a B.S. in Anthropology.  After I graduated I immediately found a job, but in an unrelated field.  Through my school's anthropology department I was introduced to, and fell in love with GIS. Considering that there are very few jobs for anthropology undergrads, I decided to sign up for an introductory GIS in order to pry my way in to the world of GIS and earn a certificate.  The intro class went very well and I found myself even helping out a lot of the geography majors who were struggling around me within the class.  However, i'm really starting to wonder how useful I will be to employers offering GIS related jobs who are not anthropology-based.

So my question is, is having a GIS certificate and an unrelated undergraduate degree enough for an entry level technician job, at the least?

Also, I realize that what may be even more important is presenting the actual work I have done, and my technical skill with using the program.  Which is why I plan on taking up an internship, given the opportunity, as well as work on academic GIS projects.

So, should I work on earning a certificate and building individual skill, or should I work on all that while also planning on earning a more applicable undergraduate degree?

1dwpuo,67,2013-05-07,Was not expecting that at my 32 week appointment..,MrsEllimistX,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1dwpuo/was_not_expecting_that_at_my_32_week_appointment/,"So I went in for my 32 week appointment with my midwives tonight. I asked my mom to go with me, since my husband had to work late tonight. When my mom asked me how long it would be, I told her maybe a half an hour - they'd ask me the routine questions, get my weight, BP, use the Doppler on my baby, and that should be it. 

Wrong.

During the questions, I told the midwife I was still having my 2-4 BH per hour, which has been normal for me since about 20 weeks. I laughed as I told her that I found it funny that they give us all these PSAs and brochures and pamphlets and I get emails from The Bump and WTEWYE about all the signs and symptoms of preterm labour, and that you should call your care provider *immediately* if you're experiencing any of them - and it seemed I had them all. She didn't laugh. When I told her that Arya has dropped three times since Wednesday only to rise again each time, and that I could feel her pushing against me when I put my hand down on my crotch, she got slightly concerned. She suggested a cervical check. 

She inserted her fingers and I grimaced and yelped s bit, as any kind of penetration has been excruciatingly painful for me since about week 10 (I explained that to her). Turns out I'm fingertip dilated, about 30% effaced, and very soft. She also decided to do an exam and swab for bacterial vaginosis after I told her how painful it was when even just her two fingers were inserted. Positive.

So it seems that I've had an infection since at least week 10, which has most likely been causing my crazy amounts of contractions, severe back pain, excruciating pain during sex, and is causing me to dilate/efface prematurely. I've been prescribed something for it and am going to pick it up in the morning.

I also got lectured by three midwives and two interns about how I need to call them when I'm having issues. I told them that I don't want to be the woman who calls every time she feels a little funny or has a silly question every five minutes. They got upset with me and said that's what they're there for, and they want me to be well and they want to know what's going on.

They also told me that I will be on weekly appointments now to monitor my cervix and make sure it doesn't change anymore. They said they're not super concerned about it, but that everyone needs to be on alert. 

On the one hand, I'm really happy that we found this out. Within 48 hours I should have relief from most, if not all, of my symptoms. What a relief. Also, in all my worrying about being a baby, it's nice to know that my symptoms ARE abnormal, and that I SHOULDN'T be going through all of this.

So here's my PSA: don't try to stick it out! Call your doctor or midwife if you think something is wrong, and don't let your pride get in the way of your health or your baby's health. Also, for the ladies who are experiencing horrible pain during sex, it might be an infection! Get checked! You might find relief, and won't need to suffer for 22 weeks like I have!

TLDR: Turns out I'm dilating/effacing prematurely. It's my fault for preferring my pride over calling my midwives with my preterm labor symptoms. All should be well, but I'm on weekly appointments just to be sure. "

I'm a mechanical engineer recently graduated from a university that taught drafting for engineers using SolidWorks.  During my internships, I stayed on board with a company that using Pro/Engineer Wildfire 4.  I used it a little bit, just for measuring parts.

I've now graduated (yay!) and I'm working at another company, that also uses Pro/E Wildfire 4.  Now I'm doing some design work, and getting... ""introduced"" to everything Pro/E needs to throw at you for you to create complete parts, drawings, and assemblies.  Now that I've learned it a good bit, I want to say that Pro/E SUCKS.  The user interface is clunky, bloated, and nonintuitive, errors offer little explanation, and all the implementation details seem to lack polish, and it is generally frustrating to use!

Comparing this to SolidWorks, for example, is almost not even a fair comparison in my opinion.  The non-terrible user experience in SolidWorks probably yields double the real-world productivity compared to the same task being performed in Pro/E.  I've been told by some of the older guys at my company that Pro/E isn't that bad- but I'm inclined to believe that they only stick to that opinion because they've molded their perceptions to accommodate it after using it for years.  I've also been told that the additional powerful features Pro/E has make up for the differences- but I don't see them being important for our company, where the geometric details of our manufactured products are not too terribly complicated.

I know that Creo has taken over as the replacement for Pro/E, but I think this is still a relevant question, given Pro/E's still-large use in industry. 

So guys, what do you think of Pro/E?"

The author's situation seems pretty similar to mine.  Here is my situation summed up in bullet points:

* Graduated with BSCS from a highly ranked university with low gpa
* Had a few internships at reputable companies during college
* Unsuccessful with job search (1.5 years) focused around the bay area, even with recs from friends
* Probably had hundreds of phone screens and several on campus interviews, but no offers
* Accepted into MSCS program at local school, but haven't enrolled yet
* A little awkward at first encounters, but otherwise sociable (1000+ friends on fb)

  I think I am a competent programmer in that I can reliably churn out stuff, even if it's not the most elegant or efficient.  I haven't been doing that many side projects during my time off from school.  Open source projects (especial big ones) are kinda intimidating.  Been just playing around with new frameworks and doing stuff like project euler to keep my skills sharp.

I went to Europe last summer to intern at what I thought was going to be a really cool company. My supervisors were pretty much aloof, the weather was dreadful, and I hardly ever went out. I got along with a few other people from my university and other Americans, but the people in the country I went were not very friendly (which is probably a biased cultural perception). 

After the first week, I put up a calendar counting down the days until I could go home. It seemed like each day was a month long and I remember telling myself ""5 more hours, 4 more hours"" etc until I could get home. I had an awful 2-hour commute one-way to/from work every day. I stayed in my room a lot watching TV shows on my computer and eating. I think I might have been depressed. 

The last night I was there, a guy somewhat assaulted me in a club (I was very inebriated, he led me to a corner despite my protests and tried to get in my pants [thank everything I was wearing high waisted tights under my skirt]) and that didn't really even phase me at the time... looking back, it was actually quite a terrible experience that I didn't take seriously. When I got back to the US, I had never been happier to be an American and return to the country I sometimes scorned.

I got home and told everyone I had the summer of my life. I lie my ass off every time I'm asked about it. I spent a ton of money on this ""opportunity"" and I feel like I squandered it by being pathetic.

I'm looking for a friend, as the title of this post shows. I'm pretty lonely most of the time, and I'm looking for somebody to help me pass the time. After getting out of a pretty abusive relationship that lasted the majority of my high school ""life"", I'm left with no friends, and nobody to talk to.

About me: I'm a 19 year old guy, who is introverted. That being said, it's not easy for me to make friends. I'm looking for somebody who I can relate to, and have intellectual conversations with. I want to hear about your day, but that doesn't necessarily mean that I want to tell you about mine. I enjoy reading SciFI, Fantasy, Non-fiction, and many other genres. Reading is one of my biggest past times, and I easily become addicted to book series, along with all the lore related. I'm an apathetic atheist, and don't want to be badgered with religious beliefs. I'm currently going to university, studying CompSci, and I have 3 internships a week. 

What I'm looking for: A beautiful personality. Somebody to help my day go along via text/email. I want a friend who can make me happy, and somebody who will take her time and get to know the true me. I may be rigid when we first meet, but I warm up quickly to people, and am very loyal to those who actually respect and understand me. All races, ages, and shapes are welcome. I prefer to talk to older females, because they're more mature than my current shitty generation. (I'm not specifically looking for a relationship, but if one forms after a long amount of time, so be it. I will let you know if I'm interested.)

What I'm not looking for: Somebody who will stop talking to me after a day. (This makes me very sad, and hurts me.) I'm not looking for a bitch. (You know if you are one.) I'm not looking for a fwb. I'm not looking for somebody who I can sext. 

If you're interested, send me a PM, and ask me anything. c:

I made the *mistake* of getting a girl pregnant around two years ago. My son is now 16 months old. I had been dating his mom for the past year.

In this year, she's cheated on me. I've paid her child support even though we were dating and I've been in his life. I do not and have not been living with her. I make okay money, 38k before taxes. I was giving her $500 a month (What a fool..).

I've finally had it with the lies, the bullshit, the greed, the selfishness. I have absolutely no custodial rights to my Son. She refuses to put me on the birth certificate. I have met with an attorney, but I'm not entirely sure I like the outlook.

I would prefer joint custody of my son. I have no problem paying child support. He's mine, I love him. I've played by their rules for about a year (not taking him out of town, not staying at my home).

Her and her mom have a history of domestic violence. I'm not sure if this would make a difference in court. Basically, I can keep doing what I'm doing (being glued to their house to see him), paying $500 a month and having nearly no rights.. or I can pay my attorney and see my son every other weekend.

I currently see him thurs night, fri night, all day saturday and all day sunday.

I own my home. I do not do drugs. I do smoke, horrible habit. I don't want to fuck with this girls life, but she's fucking with mine. 

One more detail, she's an intern at the local PD and she's friends with many of the cops. Around 2 weeks ago we had a fight, verbal over the phone. I told her to leave me alone. At this point she had a key to my home. I refused to answer her calls. She said she was coming to my house.

I told her not to, I then barricaded the door so she couldn't come in. She's fairly small (around 100lbs) so I didn't think she could get in. Wrong. She got in, got in my face. She attempted to kiss me. I ran out the door and took off as fast as I could. 

Remember when I said she had cheated? I caught her at a cops house on 4/21/13. We shared a cell phone plan, I did a search on his number. 2000 texts in a month. 

I stayed away from my house for around 2 hours. I finally go home. I find the back door wide open, the thermostat to the furnace was set as high as possible. It was around 2:00am. Great, there's a knock on the door.

It's the fucking police. Guess who it is? It's the cop who she's been texting/hanging out with. They ask me some questions, she claimed I spit in her face. They ask if she had hit me etc, I told them no. They looked for marks, they found a scratch. Nobody was arrested.

He had a partner with him. I have a recording of her coming into my house (Mostly audio) you can hear the door being kicked. 

I also have a recording of her knocking for 10+ minutes. I have a recording of the police as well. 

This seems very rambly, I may have missed some details. I'll go through it when I'm not at work and correct any errors.

TL;DR kids mom has full custody of our son, I was paying child support (it's not court ordered) but I've recently stopped. She went crazy."

thank you for reading this post. I am a Master Student International Organization and International Relations ([http://www.rug.nl/masters/international-relations-and-international-organization/](http://www.rug.nl/masters/international-relations-and-international-organization/)) at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands looking for an internship in NYC.

Besides my Master, I have a bachelor degree in Information Technology (Essentially: programming.). At the moment I am working as a founder and co-owner (since a year and a half) of an IT-related business here in the Netherlands (http://www.noverius.nl). I am a social person, a quick learner, independent and driven. 

Ideally, the internship would have some link to international relations/international organization, but the only actual requirements for the internship are that they are a) of sufficient academic level and b) have an international character. As such, viable internships range from international investment banks to non-profits such as amnesty international. 

Given that I am a currently co-owner of a profitable company, preferably the internship would not last more than 3-4 months (since any longer would be hard to sell to my fellow business partners). Longer is possible; however, since in that case I would have to step down from my position as business owner, actual opportunities in regards to eventual employment or participation would be appreciated.

If you have any questions for me, if you wish to ask me about my previous experience or a resume, I will be happy to answer here or in a PM.

Kind Regards,

1e0ppx,0,2013-05-09,Starting an outsourcing firm,outsourceTHRWAWAY,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1e0ppx/starting_an_outsourcing_firm/,"Hi all,

Background info: 
I'm a college senior who is currently studying Business Admin and CIS. I have a partner who is also a Business student. My partner and I are both currently located in Southern California. I'm from the Silicon Valley, and my partner is from India.

As business students, we've noticed all those people who want to start various apps/websites/etc. Problem with this is that they do not have the technical know how to implement any of their ideas, and they do not have the sufficient capital to hire a team of coders (which leads them to pissing people off by offering unpaid internships). 

I have a few friends who have used freelancer.com, and other online outsourcing websites, but all of them have been unhappy with the results for a variety of reasons (mainly due to lack of communication). 

We realized that we can use our capabilities/resources to create an ideal solution; my partner can get a team of coders together in India and we can afford to pay them a going rate. I can communicate with the emerging startups here and act as the middle man between the startup company and the team in India. 

The company will guarantee communication; if the customer wants to chat with the team, we will set up a video conference within 12-18 hours to talk about progress, etc. We plan on treating our team with a lot of love (we will provide them new Macbooks, a nice office, etc). 

I have a pretty thorough understanding about the Software development process. I understand that things like gathering requirements, and documentation are prime areas for failure due to the communication gap. Those are the two things that I can work on from the States (I'll eventually have a team here to do that). 


I understand that I need to do a lot of research, etc, but before doing any of that, I just want to see what the /r/entrepreneur community thinks about this.

tl;dr: 2 partners (1 American, 1 Indian) want to start an outsourcing firm aimed towards startups who have an idea but not enough resources to implement that idea in The States. We will offer a better quality product than websites like freelancer.com"

I'm a recent college grad (sort of) and I'm looking to get an iPad before I go off to my music therapy internship for a few reasons. Primarily, I'd like it to have a more portable device that I can transport things like songbooks, etc so I don't have to carry around giant books and binders full of music. Second, I like the idea of being able to pull up music during a music therapy session if a client requests it. Third, I think it would be a nice, portable way to be able to do documentation right after sessions.

That being said, I need help. I know the iPad 4 has been out for a while, and the iPad 5 is due to come out... soonish? I was wondering if you guys thought it would be better to hold out and get the iPad 5 (not being able to guarantee that I'd have it before I moved to the middle of nowhere for my internship) or if I should go for the iPad 4 because it'll be a little less expensive, but it'll still run great.

Thanks for your help!"

Ok so this is a throwaway for obvious reasons. Part of my shilling program is completing 600 hours on /r/canada. My program is a ""how to win friends and influence people"" course. I am interning with a major Canadian Political Cparty and frankly i am pissed. I am an unpaid intern doing work that is pretty much the exact same thing that people are being paid for. I work in a high production computer lab processing large amounts of leftist bullshit.

This company runs interns year round and has about 15 in my lab. We make up a large percentage of their labor. Personally i don't understand how this is not illegal. They have pretty much converted 15 potential paid jobs into free labor and we are talking about a party that probably makes billions.

Now i go in every day happy and do my work because i actually had to pay this party the maximum of $1100 to shill for fucking free. I don't have a choice, but to complete this if I wish to ever dine at the same table as Dear Leader.

What are your opinion on these unpaid internships. I think they should be banned or companies forced to pay shill interns at least minimum wage. What about you guys? Is this an issue we can get /r/Metacanada to rally behind?

Personally i plan on meeting with my MP about this. I have also contacted another MP who i know about this issue and we have some sympathetic ears.

I have taken the embedded systems course at my school, and I am working as an intern doing embedded systems development at a small company.  However, I am confused about the startup and initialization process for a microcontroller.  In the course at school, we used an IDE that auto-generated the startup code.  At my job, the microcontroller board comes with a rapid development platform that includes templates that take care of loading the RTOS and setting everything up.  I've been trying to read the code in the templates, but I think this platform may be a little too complicated for me as a beginner to follow.  Here are my questions:

1.  In the real world, do most microcontrollers come with some sort of startup/initialization code, or would that be the embedded systems developer's job to write?

2.  Can you recommend any resources for learning how to write startup code?"
1dzr1u,1,2013-05-09,I'm not sure the path I'm taking in college will be a path I'll enjoy for the rest of my life.,confessionyguy,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1dzr1u/im_not_sure_the_path_im_taking_in_college_will_be/,"I've switched majors a few times. I entered college as pre-med biology. My reasoning was thin and immature: I have many older siblings in all different fields, doctor isn't one of them; I enjoy the show scrubs; I like helping people; I did well and enjoyed Biology in high school.

However, I was stressed about the work and dedication involved in that major as well as the career after it. I told myself that maybe I wouldn't be able to deal with failing to cure people. Or that 80+ work weeks weren't worth it. I decided to change majors.

I was taking a math class and because I was enjoying the topic and doing well in the course I thought that maybe I could become a teacher of math, high school level. I liked my Calculus teacher;  I really enjoy teaching things to people; I like that math just has a solution, unlike other less tangible topics. I tried being a Mathematics major, even planning out my course schedule for the rest of college. Then, taking Calc III and Linear Alg at once (probably poor decision), I realized I didn't like math *that* much. I changed majors.

I like computers and video games. I was taking a intro to java course. I thought, with my joy of 'tinkering' with programs and game emulators, I might enjoy programming for a living. Progamming courses are time-consuming. With my ADD assignments take my 12 or more hours that take friends 2 to 4. I have a paid internship in computer science, and a degree from my school would really pull me through.

 But sometimes I start to think about the life of a programmer, and maybe I was better off a pre-med, or maybe I should try being a teacher again. But it's too late. This school is expensive. I have a very generous grant, but I feel like I'm squandering it with my indecision and my inability to do well in classes. I'm silently stressing myself out but barely voice it to others. I don't know when my grant will run out, and I'm afraid I might not even pass this semester. My school is hard, but are other schools going to be any different honestly? Calc is Calc, programming is programming.

I enjoyed just pushing carts at a store while in high school. Now working in an office setting makes me worry about the fact that I finish my tasks too quickly and I really shouldn't have as many hours as I ought to. Or I waste too much time at work, perhaps in the real world my employer will find that I don't output enough code. What do I do then? Stress upon stress upon stress."
1dzpoh,5,2013-05-09,I feel unworthy of asking my Ivy League LD-FWB to be with me.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1dzpoh/i_feel_unworthy_of_asking_my_ivy_league_ldfwb_to/,"I (22F) met this guy (26M) [let's call him Ryan] spring of 2010. We dated a few times right before I went away on a summer trip and he left to start business school at an Ivy-league (relevant later on) school on the other side of the country. 



I assumed that would be the end of it. An awesome summer fling. But no. Our undergrad college is in his hometown. Turns out, whenever he would come home for the holidays, we saw each other. We decided to be FWB, which we defined as: actually friends, sexually monogamous, and still requires a break up. 



When we met, I was a virgin. I was pretty close to having PIV sex with a previous bf, but other issues made me not trust him enough to take that final leap. It was not the case with Ryan. He was always very straight-forward about how he really liked me, but it wouldn't be fair for us to be anything more when he's away. And his actions reflect that. I really trust him. We are also very sexually compatible and like to explore the same things. We eventually went ""all the way"" about 10 months into it. My first time was wonderful, with someone I really cared about and trusted.

At some point, about a year after it all began, I asked him if distance wasn't a factor, would he see us together, or would he want to at all. I told him I have realized I do want an actual partner-in-crime share-our-darkest thoughts type of relationship, and I needed to know if that could be possible with him if distance wasn't a factor. He wouldn't give me a straight ""yes"" or ""no"". 

His answer was that there was no point in thinking about it because he's in the east coast and I'm in the west coast, and when we both graduate (me from undergrad, him from business school), we could still be far away depending on where our jobs take us. He doesn't want me to ""wait for him"" because he might not come back to his hometown if a better job opportunity arose somewhere else. And he doesn't want to have a serious relationship while apart (which, I agree with him on that part).


Last December (2012), he initiated a talk as he drove me to the airport, after I had mentioned that we've known each other for over a year. He wanted to make sure that I know he's not looking for a serious relationship. Right now his mind is in his career and nothing at all. He's not even thinking about relationships AT ALL. I took his word for it, but I'm also afraid this was a kind way of saying, ""I don't want a relationship *with you*. He said that both of us are, in a sense, using each other. He said it was hard for him to have this conversation, but he felt like he needed to have it bc it has happened to him in the past, where he has similar situations with girls, and they wouldn't move on. He didn't want to, but he cut them off 100% so they could move on. He likes me, and wants me to stay in his life. I will admit, I was offended that he thought he would ever be a better judge of what is best for a partner than the parter herself. I told him if he ever wants to end it, to end it because he's bored, found someone else, or whatever... not ""for my sake"". That's very condescending. I told him I'd worry about myself and my ""moving on"". I also told him I didn't want a serious relationship, bc I am only 22. But after thinking about it on the plane ride, I realized we both could've meant very different things by ""serious relationship"". When I say I wasn't looking for a serious relationship, I meant that am not assessing boyfriends for the potential to spend our lives together. But I do want **A** relationship. 

Since I got those answers, I have made an active effort to date. Truth be told, I haven't been on more than 4 dates since then, all of which were first dates that never progressed. It's just that the number of guys I find attractive enough to flirt with is significantly less than when he wasn't in the picture. Most of the time, when I want to feel close/wanted/horny or anything else that might lead to me reaching out to other people, I direct that to Ryan. I text/chat/skype/snapchat/whatever him, and I'm happy just to talk to him from far away. And I'm always happy when he does the same. 

My reasoning is that: if Ryan is just upping my standards for potential dates, while giving me a safe and comfortable sexual outlet with someone I care and trust, it's OK. I'm keeping my options open for that someone that might give me everything I need.

And I don't know if that's unrealistic. 

He called me today after his final exam. He is officially graduated and coming back to his hometown, where now I am living. I can't help to feel inferior and unworthy of being with someone like him. Although we both went to a very good school in CA, he's the one that graduated with all kinds of honors, active in student government, went on to a top-tier grad school, and now is about to start a Director-level position at a VERY large company (known all over the world) in August. Whereas here I am, first yeah after graduation, with a GPA that wouldn't get me into any decent grad school, unemployed after I quit a sales job I hated, no employment prospects that could have anything to do with my science degree, and getting a little too excited for a couple of tutoring gigs I've gotten this week. 

It hurts me that he's never seriously asked me to visit him at school. He's said things like ""get over here now"" and things like that, but never actual plans with dates or details. And while I moved away from his hometown for that sales job, he did see me when he would fly over for interviews to this new city, it was never just to see me. Although I did come visit him (I asked him if I could visit) in NY for his summer internship. I don't feel like he's made an equivalent gesture: the flying out to see me.

Now that he's graduated, I found out today he will be traveling around the world with his business school friends and his brother. He had all summer, no school to worry about, and we haven't seen each other since January, and he didn't even bother to schedule a trip to LA to see me. That, to me, says a lot of how much he misses me/wants to see me. His parents still support him, he's made tens of thousands in between undergrad and grad school. I am unemployed, and my parents don't support me financially anymore. He is the one with access to make our meeting happen. 

I also don't feel worthy of mentioning how his actions make me feel right now because he's post-finals but before his graduation ceremony. I don't want him to be thinking about how he failed while he should be the happiest about his achievement, and looking forward to his big trip.

I will also admit I'm scared he will sleep with someone on that summer-long trip. I don't see why he, as a single guy backpacking throughout the world, drinking and partying, would not. I have no reason to believe he's slept with someone else yet, but if he did, it would be very hard for me to find out anyways.

Rationally, I would do that same things he's doing. I put myself in his shoes and I hate what I think of myself. I would be embarrassed to bring someone like me to meet his friends at a school like his. I would feel like I'm lowering my standards, so I'd keep someone like her around for the fun, no strings-attached sex. But I'd also be a nice-enough guy to let her know that that's all I want, and I don't want her holding back because of me.

Am I holding myself back from finding a fulfilling relationship? Why can't I appreciate what I do have instead of wondering what might be? 
I want to be able to tell him how I feel ( that I do like him, I want to be with him, and that I feel inadequate next to him) and be able to handle rejection and end the ""relationship"" with Ryan 100%. I don't know if this imbalance of power is just one of the reasons we're not a good fit, and it would just be best for both of us to find someone else. But I am so happy just hearing from him, and the days when we ARE together, these worries just fade away. Do they really fade away? Or am I just captured in the reuniting bliss, but we're never together long enough to fade and for the real issues to arise? Am I just projecting the my insecurities on to someone, or am I actually harming myself by staying in this ""relationship/situation""? Will it seem like I was indeed waiting for him if, once we both live in the same city, I spill my feelings for him in a ""now we can be together"" kind of show?

1dzln0,1,2013-05-09,Questions about therapy and SSRI's...,[deleted],OCD,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1dzln0/questions_about_therapy_and_ssris/,"Okay, so I was diagnosed with OCD not long ago, although I feel like I've had it for the majority of my life. These past five months became unbearable to the point where I was driven to depression. 

Without going deep into the specific contents of my OCD, (mainly checking and ""pure O"" type stuff) it all got to the point to where I couldn't bring myself to get out of bed in the mornings, and I had severe insomnia at night. Since I've sought help and been diagnosed with OCD, I've been better able to cope and actually live my life better, but it's definitely still a work in progress. Like everyone, I have my good days, bad days, and horrible-awful-unbearable days.

Anyways, I had to discontinue therapy (it was through student counseling services) because I'm going home for the summer, then traveling a lot for an internship. I'll be in the same place for about 6 weeks in between moving around to other areas. Is it worth it to look into therapy in the city I'll be in this summer? How much can I get accomplished in 6 weeks? Or should I just wait to continue therapy in the fall? Both my psychologist and psychiatrist didn't seem to think it was necessary for me to find someone over the summer, but if it can keep the ball rolling in recovery, I'd like to.

I'm starting Zoloft tomorrow, and I'm really really really hoping it takes the edge off of my racing thoughts and will help lift this depression. Especially because the job I have will likely be stressful and may trigger a lot of my symptoms. Any good stories about Zoloft to give me hope?

TL;DR
Can I get much out of therapy if I can only see someone for six weeks?
Any good stories about how Zoloft/other SSRI's helped you or someone you know?"

I'm 21 years old and in my senior year in college. I study computer science and have a very comfortable life. I'm successful in my academics and have loving friends and family.

I just got done with classes and undergrad work last week and started working at a summer internship 2 days ago.

I'm tired of the life I'm living. I know it sounds bad and that I'm taking it all for granted, but I'm bored. I don't enjoy working. I've lost motivation. My grades are slowly declining. I don't really enjoy life, but I'm not strong enough to kill myself. 
I know I should take a vacation. But I don't want to go anywhere. When I think vacation, I just think of lying in my bed doing nothing. 
I don't want to quit work, though, because I know the grass is always greener on the other side. I don't want to quit and realize I made a mistake later down the road. 

I know someone on reddit has probably felt the way I feel. I feel lost. Direction-less.
What have you people done? 


**edit:**  I'd like to clarify, I don't think I'm depressed. I'm positive I won't kill myself. I still have fun with friends and exercise daily. I eat healthy. I'm just not sure what to do. I feel like I should continue with my major, since I've made such progress in it and finding a job after graduation should be easy. But, when I think about the future and envision a 9-5 job for the rest of my life....iuno.."

My roommate found the wallet on a sidewalk after drunk-biking around the White House one night. He sent the girl, Min-Young, a Facebook message, but she didn’t reply for a week. 

Today, I decided to Google her home address from her driver’s license. Nothing came up, except real estate and a church newsletter stating a different name, ‘choong-han’ for that same address, all written in Korean. The church said they didn’t know a ‘Min-Young’, so I asked if that was her mom or dad. They remembered, said yes and gave me her dad’s phone number. 

I called and her mom answered, took down my name, number and was skeptical on how I knew how to speak Korean (I'm Filipino and studied abroad in Seoul). Then she called her daughter. Min-Young called me just a minute afterwards and she came to pick it up. She said her mom thought I was a scammer because she didn’t know how I knew all this information. hahaha. 

What a great way to end my internship here in DC as a journalist and put those skills to use.

This is the third weight loss segment of my life. I want to do it right this time. Also, I have potential kidney issues. Help?",Fatalfable,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1e3eg3/i_just_finished_finals_its_been_over_nine_months/,"Thanks for helping me out guys. I am going to give a lot of background. I want you guys to know my history and where I am coming from as it might help. If you could care less about my past just skip to the ""Now"" Section.

 Here are the 3 phases:

**Phase 1**

I'm sure like many of you out there, we were bullied. This was the catalyst to my life in exercise and fitness. I learned everything on my own (well, the internet). I started out in 9th grade as 5'5 and 190lbs. I never really improved my diet at first, I just started exercising. I lost my first 30 with Dance Dance Revolution. I reached a plateau and learned about dieting. I also picked up the gym. Some food choices and terrible form later I dropped another 15 lbs. I plateau'd until the end of junior year of highschool. Me and my friends picked up longboarding and thats all we would do. I mainly lost it due to malnutrition of skating the streets of NYC all day and only eating a slice of pizza and an arizona. Right before I left for a summer music program I was about 135lbs and 5'7. I also had a starvation period during this time where I was deliberately trying to become anorexic running 5 or 6 miles a day and trying not to eat for 2 days followed by a binge eat. 

During the summer program I gained about 18 lbs (Regardless of maintaining my weight lifting at the local gym). I started thinking I was gaining muscle and kept on eating more and putting on more lbs. By December of that year I had bumped back to the 160s. 

**Phase 2**:

I freaked out, went hard on my research and tried changing all of my food choices again. I started eating egg whites, sweet potato, chickens, salmons, cutting out some junk food. My portions weren't the greatest and I still wasn't counting calories well. I started running to school and back home and lost about 15 lbs by the summertime (I still maintained gym workouts).  I tried picking up insanity but I could never stick it out. 

Towards the end of the summer I had dropped to 148 and met up with a polish bodybuilder. This is where everything changed. He taught me about how to correctly count calories, manage my macro nutrients, change food choices, and introduced me to the world of park workouts. I started learning slowly and we exchanged emails for a while. My real turning point with diet was when I asked him if I could have honey in my oatmeal and he said ""Stop being a little bitch and only eat what you need. Do you need honey?"". In my first week of eating 6 times a day, managing everything, doing my park muscle workouts followed by an hour of low intensity power walking, and skating all week long, I lost about 8 lbs in that one week after plateauing for months. I lost 2 lbs each week for the three weeks following and stopped there. 

I continued running, doing sessions of insanity here and there as college started but it was a struggle to maintain. During the month I had between fall and spring semesters I started insanity. I ate 6 times a day. My entire diet consisted of chicken, sweet potato, peanut butter, whole wheat/grain bread, greek yogurt, kashi cereal, fruits, and brown rice. That's it. I was extremely determined and nothing was going to stop me. I was sleeping only three hours a night because of school work, and often work still do my workout day If I pulled an all nighter. I almost finished the program but with two weeks left I got very very sick with the flu for 2 weeks and completely through me off my game. I vowed to myself after this I wouldn't go back to a gym. I loved it and gained about 6 lbs while losing fat. I simply maintained until the end of the semester. 

**Phase 3** :

By May (of 2012 at this point) I started working out at the park again. I was beginning to fulfill a long time fitness dream of doing a full perfect form wide arm pull-up. My workout plan was a two day split of pyramid workouts. 

Day 1:
pullupx1, Pushupx10, pullupx2, pullupx10 etc. to 5 reps then back down.

Up until I could do full pullups I would jump up, hold 10 seconds, and slowly come down. That would be 1 rep. 

Run for 30-50 minutes. Towards the end of workout find hill and sprint up max speed and walk back down 6 times. 

Day 2: 

Same pyramid idea with dips &amp; whatever this is (http://www.bodyrock.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/ReversePushUp11.jpg) which worked on my biceps and back.

I also did 50 squats each leg x2

Same cardio.

1 day rest and repeat.(Sometimes no rest. I'll keep looping these two days)

Diet was the same as during insanity time and usually had my calories at around 2000-2300 a day. 

I had significant gains in muscle. By August I was in love with my new found strength and was like a monkey. Anything I could hang off of I would do so and if I could I would do pull ups. I was able to do 6 slow and controlled pullups by doing this workout.

The first week of August I had to fill in at my friend's job for the following 5 weeks. There, I worked 3 days a week for 36 hours. 3 to 3 as a barback. This was a really tough job that required a lot of heavy lifting, and running around the building. You also got no chance to eat except for the customers left overs when cleaning up their bar food in the kitchen. By the time you got home you were usually too tired to even eat. 

At the end of those five weeks I dropped 15 lbs from muscle loss, fat loss, and from being malnourished. 

School starts a few days later and it soon gets rough. I can't do schoolwork at home so I decide to solve my procrastination issues by sleeping at 6 or 7 pm and getting up at two in the morning. Get to school at 3am'ish and stay there until 5:30pm when I would drive home. No exercise was done and diet was thrown away as there are no local options. Winter break I began drinking a significant amount of alcohol. I got depressed. School started again and the shenanigans continued. While I wasnt getting there at 3am anymore I was still in school for 12 hours a day and later on in the week I had to put in internship hours plus homework. I began drinking basically every weekend to the point where I drank 500-750ml each time I drank. Some weekends going to 2 liters.

Did I also mention that my diet for this time has been mcdonalds, burritos, and pizza? (In my school this is all I have available)

**Now**: 

Now, half way through college, 25lbs heavier, deciding to quit drinking all together before it becomes a problem, I am happy, motivated and ready to get started.

Info:

Age:19

Height: 5'7/5'8 

Weight:160

How often do I exercise?: 0 days a week

Diet:Terrible compared to my old standards. I took out the terrible things but It still isn't a ""bodybuilder diet"". I am completely comfortable drastically changing my diet as long as I have a plan. (How many calories per meal, what are in these meals, when to eat these meals and why) 


**What I want**: 

Lose these 25lbs of fat I gained. Have muscle strength gains. I don't want to say I can bench press 300lbs. I want to say, ""I can do a hand stand, I can do 20 pullups, I can do 100 pushups, I have a 6 pack"". 

Goals for summer:

I. Drop 20-25 lbs of fat

II. Reach 10 Wide arm, slow and controlled Pullups

III. 70 push ups straight

IV.  7 minute mile runs for a 10k



**What I want from /r/Fitness**: 

I. Help me establish a workout plan that targets the major muscle groups of my body that can be done at a park? 

II. Help me establish a diet that will supplement my workouts and allow my to lose fat in a quick and healthy fashion. 

III. Help me figure out how to maintain some of my fitness level and at least not gain any weight when I go back to school. I'm absolutely sick of losing weight and building my fitness level over and over again. 



**Considerations &amp; Kidney issues**:

I had cancer as a child and had a kidney removed as well as parts of several other organs. Ever since my creatinine NOT creatine levels have been very high. This is can be worsened via large amounts of protein. I am recommended not to push it more than 70 grams a day. If my levels go to high, my kidney can become so overworked, it will fail and I will need dialysis. If I can keep it under 70 that would be great.

My park has monkey bars, pullup bar, and longbars for dips. There is also a pole attached to this area that can be used simply for climbing.



Thank you so much if you have gotten this far. It really means so much to me if you can help out. I'm a classical guitarist and music therapist in training, if I can somehow repay using my skills I would be more than glad.

1e3cmo,4,2013-05-10,Finally employed in my first professional job and it was because of networking,razorblade2099,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1e3cmo/finally_employed_in_my_first_professional_job_and/,"A lot of this is copy and paste from a post I made in a forum, but it's finally happened. I finally found professional work in the industry, company, and city I want to be in.

I'm a recent graduate in accounting/finance. I left university without coop or internship experience so I've been struggling to find entry level work for a while. I started my CMA training anyways so it would show employers that I have the raw talent for accounting and analysis. I've been passed over a few times for more experienced candidates despite making good impressions on the interviewers. One time it was for an internship position. Imagine that, experienced accounting personnel are applying for paid internships. Mind you it was at a internationally recognized company but still.

I met this senior manager at a volunteer event/function over the weekend. He was impressed by the level of hard work I had shown during this event and had agreed to meet me for coffee. Before meeting him for coffee, I did my research on his educational and career background. I asked him about why he decided to obtain two accounting designations. I asked him about about how he was finding his transition to his new role. Then I asked him what it was about the industry he worked in that fascinated him. 

After this, we began to talk about the industry and the company. I had specific questions prepared that I asked in order to help me better understand the industry and then I asked further probing questions when he answered. We talked about the future of the commodity that the company dealt with, as well as the world wide issues surrounding it. I was able to relate specifically to facts that the MD&amp;A/annual report and CEO have touched upon in news interviews. During all of this time, I had a note book out that I used to take notes on anything that he said that I did not already know. 

We then began to talk about myself and my own experience. The type of character I display and the positive attitude I had. I asked if he could refer me to the controller for an interview for a AP Admin role that the company had posted, and indicated that I knew it would still be my own responsibility to earn the job and convince the controller that I was the right fit. He asked me if this is what I really wanted to do, and I explained that in all honesty it wasn't, but it was a way for me to get my foot in the door. It was at this point where he offered to look into creating a FA job for me at the company. 

Now ask yourself this, would he have even considered this if I had not been prepared for this meeting? If I had not shown the initiative to do the research and to reach out to meet him directly? If I had emailed him my application, he may have forwarded it to the controller, or more likely forwarded it to HR, where I'd get a courtesy interview but I'd probably be dismissed because of my inexperience.

This morning I received the job offer. He called me back to the office and explained that although he wanted to create the FA job for me because we both agreed that was where my talents indicated where I should be, he couldn't because the yearly budget had been made and he couldn't justify adding to the head count at this time. Instead he gave me the AP Admin job. Assuming I perform well, we agreed to revisit the possibility of creating the FA job for me next year. 

For all of you looking for work who are in the same boat as I was, I must stress the importance of networking. Over half the interviews I have received have only been because I network. But networking is not something you only do when you're looking for work. It's about building something for yourself and others. And in the end, networking isn't going to get you the job. You still have to earn this. It will however get you the interview and a chance to earn it."
1e3aw3,1,2013-05-10,Somewhat portable budget gaming pc.,Slippery_John,buildapcforme,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1e3aw3/somewhat_portable_budget_gaming_pc/,"&gt;What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using.

It's going to primarily be for gaming. It's a present for a friend who has been using an old laptop that I gave him two years ago (which was only ever midrange, and was 2 years old when I gave it to him). 

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

$500

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

I plan on doing the build over the summer, since I got a sweet internship that's paying well. I understand that the prices will fluctuate, but I want to get a good idea of what to look for.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Just the tower? Operating System? Keyboard, mouse, monitor, speakers/headset, WiFi adapter, etc?

We can make do without most of the accessories since he has some from his even more ancient pcs, but I'd like to include a monitor that isn't a shitty crt.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

I will be purchasing in Austin, TX and to be perfectly honest I have no idea as I don't currently live there.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

Like I said, he has a keyboard and mouse. They're really shitty, but they'll do.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line?

Doubtful. Maybe way down the line, but somehow I doubt the form factor will allow for much

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

I want it to be small and durable, so that he can move it around. So mATX probably

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS? Is it 32bit or 64bit?

Yes, I am absolutely swimming in legit Windows licenses, and worst-case scenario the license on his current laptop will transfer. I have both 32 and 64 bit licenses.

&gt;Extra info or specifics:

I really don't know anything about AMD (I'm more of an Intel+Nvidia guy), and I have a strong feeling that that's the way this build is going to have to go. However I would like to note that I want this PC to last as long as possible since I doubt he will have the money to upgrade.

Finally, as prices are bound to fluctuate, I'm fine with the build going a bit over budget."
1e37yk,1,2013-05-10,8 classes to go,[deleted],ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1e37yk/8_classes_to_go/,"   8 classes to go and in all honesty I don't know how I will do it. I just started to see a doctor and get medicated but how do I get past bad habits?

   By bad habits I mean, ADHD has caused so much stress that I no longer am able to look at things that mAy be negative. I don't check my grades during the school year, I avoid reading emails since it may regard to my school loans or academic probation and I just don't see how I can fully function in this world when I am like this. 

   I have to intern twice in addition to my 8 classes and I can't get past it. In fact, I really wanted to take 3 classes this summer but have yet to sign up in regards that I may have another hold or another setback. Ie developed a ""wait to the literal last minute and pray"" method and sometimes it works out but sometimes it doesn't. The further I get into my profession, the more likely this method will not work at all. 

TL;DR: Unattended ADHD has caused problems, built the habit of avoidance if a negative outcome/emails is an option. How can I get myself to break the habit?

Thanks guys in advance, I've been a lurker of this subreddit for a while and it got me to accept that something may be wrong and to go get help. "

I'm 18, and in college. Currently in NYC for an internship this summer. I'm okay when it comes to game in college, it's *way* easier than when you don't know anyone.

So I'm in NY, and I don't know anyone. Literally not a single person, which kicks ass because I'm forced to be social.

Started an under-21 GothamSeddit groupme, and went out with some of the guys from there last night.

**FR:**

I knew I had to approach, and kick this AA but it wasn't until last night that I finally approached. We went to an NYU bar that doesn't ID, and the guy I was with was killing it. He was mad social, ridiculously good at talking to girls, and I was like standing there thinking I don't know anyone.

So I opened a set of two girls - they weren't that cute but I really just needed to get out of my head. Turns out they were both PhD students, and they had some pretty cool stories to tell. I felt like it really ended up being interview-ish, and that made it kind of awkward. Still, I think I held conversation with them pretty well, but exiting the set was a little hard. I got a phone call, so I just left after that. Any tips on how to exit a set better?

After that, I opened a girl with her friend (""Is this seat taken? No. Great, hey I'm Vulkreem""). She was pretty cool and we talked for a bit and I had her laughing a bit. After I left, the guy I was with introduced me to his set, and I was **awkward**. It looks like I'm a lot better with sets I open myself - how do I fix this?

After that we left the bar, and walked around a bit. Everything was pretty dead and another guy from the GroupMe came. We walked to Union Square (this was around 2am), and it was dead so we decided to head back. I was feeling kinda shitty, because I hadn't really had much success all night. I'd opened sets on my own which was pretty cool for me, but I was still pretty awkward.

I got to the subway station, and it kicked ass. A cute girl sat next to me and I opened her (I literally wouldn't have done this yesterday). We started talking, and another girl comes and sits next to me. The original girl leaves once her train comes, and the girl next to me opens by saying ""Did I hear you're Australian?!"". 

We get along really well, she was a little tipsy but mad friendly and I definitely ramped up the kino. I'm annoyed that I didn't kiss her, because there were so many damn opportunities. She tells me she's living in Brooklyn and that I should crash, but I tell her I have work tomorrow so I can't, and I tell her to crash at mine. She agrees, and I'm thrown off. Definitely didn't expect that.

I'm trying to work out logistics, and I realize I need to get up at 7 in the morning for work. I mention that and she decides not to come back with me because she doesn't want to be kicked out at 7. I didn't push for it (should I have?) because I felt like it'd be a hassle.

She also opens another girl who's sitting next to her and we all start talking. I'm super in-state, not in my head at all, and girl #2 asks how me and girl #1 met. I had my arm around her so she's surprised we met 10 minutes ago :)

Their train comes, they leave, and then mine comes so I leave.

**Sticking points:**

* I can't tease for shit, and I'm generally not very funny.
* Kino, kino, kino. If I don't kino when I first say hi, it's generally pretty hard for me to just start

##Stats:

&gt;A/S/L and do you love where you live?
&gt;&gt;30-Something, New Englander. Life is good up here, if you're into mountains, good food and craft beer.

&gt;Relationship Status?
&gt;&gt;Legally binding.

##Favorites:

&gt;Cats or Dogs?
&gt;&gt;Growing up, we had a coon hound and a siamese cat. After those two moved on, we had a chocolate lab and a beagle, and then two more cats, and then we raised two of the cats those other two made...

&gt;&gt;Cats are fine, but I'm a dog person. We have a 3 year old [mutt shepherd pound puppy](http://i.imgur.com/hKdy3uc.jpg). People who don't enjoy dogs concern me. 

&gt;Favorite beverage?
&gt;&gt;I live on coffee, water, beer, and wine. And vodka. Give me the hoppiest IPA you can find and I'm happy. [Heady Topper](http://i.imgur.com/G2f701x.jpg), as a Vermonter I'm proud to see we managed to take over the #1 spot on BeerAdvocate.com's top 250 not too long ago.

&gt;Food?
&gt;&gt;The Reuben is the one true sandwich. 

&gt;Favorite movies/tv shows?
&gt;&gt;*True Romance* would have to be my all-time favorite film. Quentin Tarantino writes a better screenplay than anyone out there, not enough people appreciate this film. [Christopher Walken interrogating Dennis Hopper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3yon2GyoiM) is one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. 

&gt;&gt;Honorable mention to: *The Jerk, Run Ronnie Run, Raising Arizona, Scorsese, Christopher Guest, and Woody Allen.*

&gt;&gt;For TV I grew up on Seinfeld, the Simpsons, X-Files and Northern Exposure. Then, The Sopranos, The Wire, Fringe, and Curb Your Enthusiasm. Currently, Shameless, Game of Thrones, Parks &amp; Rec, and House of Lies. And Jeopardy every night.

&gt;Music?
&gt;&gt;I’m a degenerate Phish fan. But Primus, Sublime, Hendrix, Pantera, Grateful Dead, The Clash, NoFX, Bad Religion, John Lee Hooker...just about anything but that country twang.

&gt;Books?
&gt;&gt;*The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* series is probably the top of my list. I found an old beat-to-hell paperback copy of *The Restaurant at the End of the Universe* in a Ground Round parking lot when I was about 10, and I re-read them all every few years. Many years later, after a fellow redditor said 'No please don't', I created [r/vogonpoetrycircle](http://www.reddit.com/r/vogonpoetrycircle).

&gt;&gt;But Kurt Vonnegut is the best writer out there. Dry sardonic humor, and most everything he said was simply put and vaguely profound. Everyone should probably read everything he's written. 
I also have a weakness for [Stephen King](http://i.imgur.com/gTYC1m8.jpg?1). Growing up, me and my dad would read every King novel that we could get our hands on. 

&gt;&gt;And Hunter S. Thompson, Cormac McCarthy, Chuck Palahniuk, Mark Twain, Isaac Asimov, and Michael Crichton. Also others.

&gt;Games?
&gt;&gt;I've lost my gaming mojo over the last few years, I grew up obsessing over anything Tim Schafer; mostly Grim Fandango, Day of the Tentacle, and Monkey Island II.

&gt;&gt;I've spent years of my life at the poker table, and play some rummy, cribbage, and Risk. And as much disc golf as I can manage.

&gt;What is your favorite word or expression?
&gt;&gt;“Hey”. I use it constantly to acknowledge, without engaging, random people throughout my life.

##Miscellanea:

&gt;What makes you laugh?
&gt;&gt;Dry wit and jokes with some depth. Good humor should make a good point by taking something we overlook and exaggerating it to the point of absurdity.

&gt;What is your biggest pet peeve?
&gt;&gt;People. Specifically:
&gt;&gt;* When they don't pay attention during a movie.
&gt;&gt;* When I'm reading and they're doing something around me.
&gt;&gt;* When they leave **00:01** on the microwave.
&gt;&gt;* When they forget to remind me about something I specifically asked them to remind me of.
&gt;&gt;* When they wear looney tunes T-shirts in public.

&gt;What was the best thing about the last year?
&gt;&gt;Finally getting my parents to Fenway Park was pretty nice. 

&gt;What are you looking forward to in the year ahead?
&gt;&gt;Same thing I look forward to every year. A week of camping with some friends for the 4th of July, out on an island just off the coast. It's my only good excuse to bust out [my America shorts.](http://i.imgur.com/xPuJE6m.jpg)

&gt;If you were granted one do-over, what would it be?
&gt;&gt;I'd have done some internships during college. Graduating with no experience makes it tough to claw your way up the resume pile when you're up against people who have actually done the job already. 

&gt;A butterfly flaps its wings... what small thing have you done or said that lead to something disproportionately larger?
&gt;&gt;My old college no longer allows students to use rocks or cinder blocks as doorstops in the dorms, because I was a moron. Which I assume has saved countless lives since implemented.

&gt;All things considered what is the most important thing in the world to you?
&gt;&gt;Being good to good people and letting the rest be.

##Concerning reddit:

&gt;What is the origin or meaning of your user name?
&gt;&gt;Kurt Vonnegut’s alter ego Kilgore Trout, and my old baseball jersey number.

&gt;Total number of reddit identities you’ve had?
&gt;&gt;I’ve had lots of one night stands, two semi-regulars, but mostly just this one.

&gt;What is your favorite part of reddit?
&gt;&gt;The community. Some of you people are really good people. And there's someone around every corner that can teach you way too much about any random thing you'd ever like to know, if you look in the right places.

&gt;What do you do when you’re not on reddit?
&gt;&gt;My usual routine on a day off is grabbing a coffee, heading to the dog park, wandering over to the used book store, and then finding a deck to drink a pint and enjoy a meal of food. 

&gt;&gt;Other than that, I play some disc golf, read, go hiking, watch baseball or listen to it on the radio.

&gt;What subreddits, if any, do you moderate.   What about those communities do you like?   
&gt;&gt;[r/fantasybaseball](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball), [r/vogonpoetrycircle](http://www.reddit.com/r/vogonpoetrycircle), [r/politics](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/)

&gt;&gt;I took over r/fantasybaseball a few years ago, and it’s grown from 50 to 6,000 pretty quickly, and I’m just starting to draw in some regular writers and “baseball experts” to do some random IAmA style things. And I’m a fantasy baseball addict, so they may not realize it but really I’m just using them to feed me good info all day long.

&gt;&gt;r/politics is tedious business, but I do enjoy a good heated political discussion, and the modmail’s entertaining enough to make it all worthwhile.

&gt;Do you think reddit has changed in the last year or so?
&gt;&gt;Yes it’s very busy.

&gt;If so, do you think it’s been for the better?
&gt;&gt;I'm sure pros probably outweigh the cons.

##Final Question:

&gt;Is there anything you'd like to plug/promote/advocate?
&gt;&gt;No I think we’re done here.

ADD ""bootcamp"" activity ideas?",4months2run,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1e256j/summer_has_started_and_i_need_to_make_some/,"(Skip to the next paragraph if you don't care about how I've come to the conclusion that I need to do some self-improvement) 
I'm a 20 year old female unmedicated undergrad junior next semester, and last semester was the worst of my life so far. I was late EVERY SINGLE DAY to all but one of my classes, every club meeting (that I was usually running as well), and most days at work. Not just one minute late either, usually 5 minutes, even 15-30 (without any good reason other than I forgot) at least once in every class that I was late to. I tried waking up earlier, tried eating breakfast, tried getting more sleep, tried setting all of my clocks fast by 5-20 minutes, skipped taking showers several days in a row, tried running, nothing worked. The only reason I wasn't late to one class was because it was directly after another and within the same building. I also turned in most of my homework late (bless my professors for even allowing that), even a final paper. And of course when I did my homework it was usually not fully done since I could never manage to either do it or just plain remember to do it about an hour before it was due. Luckily what I did do I very well since all of my professors remarked that it was sad that I was doing so poorly because of failing to complete assignments when I apparently understood the material. Tests have progressively become more and more of a nightmare over the years and by the end of this semester I needed over 20 full minutes to calm down enough to be able to read the questions fully, having at least learned that was where half of my lost points came from thanks to previous tests. This was my first semester with mostly 50+ student classes (its a very small college) and these huge lectures were a nightmare, usually resulting in me falling asleep or doodling in order to not fall asleep. When comparing my notes to my peers I found out I'd completely misheard huge points and therefore couldn't trust what I wrote. It was also a nightmare trying to keep my friends this semester since I kept forgetting to talk to them and forgot when dining hall hours were, resulting in me having to eat alone most days. My room was a huge stressful disaster zone. Laundry became carpet and I didn't let anyone even look past my door, hurting my social life again. I ran away from all the stress that accumulated by either zoning out, sleeping, or hyperfocusing on either a tv show or book series (usually book series, tv series takes days instead of hours to finish and I absolutely can't do anything else when I'm hooked on one, making them wayyyyy too dangerous for me- I could literally not care about eating or leaving my room for days if I get hooked while alone). I became so sick with anxiety by the end that I was throwing up at the thought of the paper final (6 pages, not the longest I've done either) and seriously considered walking out of my final tests (which were much better than I thought they would be much due to the extra hour we all got for them). I ended up having to pay someone to pack and clean out my room for me too, just barely managing to pack what I needed to take home on time to catch the plane. I absolutely cannot do this ever again. If nothing else, I don't think my sense of self worth will be able to handle it. I haven't let anyone know the full extent of how bad this semester has been, even made a freaking throwaway for this post, and am praying for C's at this point.

So I've decided not to do a full time job or internship this summer and focus instead on self-improvement to help me survive (and get over how depressing this semester has been).

**Things I think are important that I improve on:**
1) Attention span during long lectures/ability to read so much as a paragraph of my textbooks and retain the information

2) Time management

3) Organization

4) Sleep schedule

5) Stress management

**This is what I was thinking of doing:**
1) Having a strict sleep schedule that will mimic what I will have to do at school

2) Mindfulness meditation daily for at least a few minutes. I've done it once a week for a few weeks before and it was very helpful in clearing my mind. It's never been about quieting the mind, rather just being more aware of my thoughts and feelings as they come and go. It helps the most in preventing myself from drowning in ""I'm so stupid"" thoughts and I hope it can prevent freak outs when presented with more than one thing to do at a time.

3) Hot Bikram yoga a few days a week (I freaking love it and best, am *good* at it, but was too busy during school. I don't like other forms of exercise because ""I'm bad"" at them and therefore they're embarrassing...), I've heard regular exercise helps immensely with ADD.

4) Updating my blog every day, which will get me writing about something I love (its not a personal blog).

But I don't know how much those will help with time management which I think is the key to managing most every one of my problems.

I have 4 months of vacation, so I figure that's a good amount of time to have plenty of failures and restarts in making any kind of positive habit changes without any repercussions. Or am I naive? Haha.

Do any of you have any other concrete activity suggestions for ways I can practice the improvements I want to make?

1e23tx,0,2013-05-10,I just need to talk about how I have been feeling the past few years.,username1523,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1e23tx/i_just_need_to_talk_about_how_i_have_been_feeling/,"Well, I really need to type out how I have been feeling recently because I don't feel comfortable actually talking to anyone about this.  This is going to be really long so read whatever you want, I'm doing this for myself mostly.

I guess I'll start with a little information about myself.  I'm going to avoid as much detail as possible.  I am a female in my very early 20's and am nearly done with school at a four year state university.  My major is in a difficult engineering field.  I think that I have had a very normal middle class upbringing.  My scholarships pay for my college tuition.

In middle school I felt like I had a lot of friends and loved hanging out with them all the time.  Sometime in early high school I stopped having so many friends.  I felt awkward around people and never knew what to say in any situation.  I was very quiet.  I still had a few good friends and quite a few people that I talked with occasionally from the one musical extra curricular activity I participated in.  

Around this time I got really into a certain mmorpg video game and spent most days playing it when I got home from school.  I would frequently decline invitations from my friends and family to do things because I thought it would be more fun to stay home and play the video game.  This attitude persisted through sophomore and junior year of high school.  I had two boyfriends over this time, for about a few weeks each.  It started the same with both of them.  I randomly decided that I liked them, flirted with them until they asked me to date them, and then I basically did nothing with them and wanted nothing to do with them.  One of them broke up with me, and I broke up with the other one.  I basically felt nothing about those relationships, or ending them.

Senior year of high school I for some reason become interested in my friends again and hung out with them frequently.  I pretty much quit the video game for the year.  I also become interested in a guy that we will call Jack that was my year in school.  I flirted with him for a semester until he asked me out and we began dating.  I liked this guy a lot and was very excited about our relationship.  I couldn't believe that he was interested in me as I thought I was kind of a loser and had no chance with him.  

Fast forward to the next Fall, when I began college.  I was still in a relationship with Jack and we went to the same state university where a lot of people from our high school went to college.  I guess I was under the impression that college was supposed to be full of friends and fun, and I think I was disappointed that that was not my experience.  I was not in a sorority or anything like that, and neither was Jack.  I signed up for a women in engineering camp type thing for a few days before classes started to try and meet new people, and I really tried, but it was mostly awkward and I didn't make any friends that I kept in contact with.  I was rooming with two friends from high school in the dorms.   I was resentful of their college experience, as they both seemed to be making a lot of friends and always had events to go to or friends to hang out and drink with while I felt alone except for them and Jack. 

My relationship with those two friends slowly got worse.  I would frequently lash out and make fun of their classes or their majors, as I was an arrogant engineering major and thought their majors and classes were easy and useless.  I couldn't stand listening to them complain about how hard their communications class was.  For unrelated reasons I am no longer friends at all with one of them.  The other one and I are still very good friends and still live together.

This whole time I was spending way too much time with Jack because I felt like I had no one else.  We had one big fight freshman year because one of my roommates called me out for having him over too much, and then he blew me off the next day for dinner with my parents, and things spiraled downhill, but we got over it and never broke up.  I was basically resentful of anyone who had friends and went out ad had a good time doing anything.  

Sophomore year was a really bad time.  My classes got harder and more specific and I had no friends in them.  I wanted to go to major-specific events, but I didn't want to go alone so I stayed home.  I had still basically not made any new friends in college at all. I started working in a professor's research lab, doing menial work and actually somewhat enjoyed the company of my coworkers but never did anything with them outside of lab.  

I was taking the maximum allowed number of hours the second semester and was very stressed, and typically did not want to engage in any sexual behavior with Jack and snapped at him frequently.  I was making the best possible GPA this whole time which I think put a lot of pressure on me to continue getting A's.  I felt like it was really the only thing I had going for me and if I made a B I would be a mediocre loser without any friends.  I kept telling Jack that I was sorry for how I was treating him and that it would be better when I was no longer stressed.  I cried frequently.  I actually won the only award from my department given to sophomores that year.  That summer was not a very good time either.  I took one very stressful summer class, but after that was over in June I was extremely bored all the time.  I hung out with Jack a lot but that usually consisted of us both being bored together.  I wasn't really excited to see him anymore.

My junior year started and I applied to be one of the dozen tutors for my department that has office hours and plans events for sophomores and was accepted.  At this point some people in my class did actually know who I was since word had gotten around I guess that I did really well on the tests.  I had made two kind of new friends in my summer class because they were friends with one person that I knew from high school.  I was still really bitter about my college experience being pretty much worthless in terms of having any fun, and I knew that was probably my fault but didn't know what to do about it.

Jack had turned 21 so we could at least drink when we wanted to, which I saw as a good thing because we had had limited access to alcohol before.  We didn't drink much at all though.  I did get to know some of the other tutors but didn't get their numbers or do anything with them outside of events.  I still kind of dreaded going to the events and socializing.  

I actually made one friend that I had most of my classes with, but only because she is really friendly and pretty much forced her friendship upon me (which was a good thing).  I was starting to cheer up at this point as I had about three new friends in my classes, but still felt like it was pretty pitiful that they were my only friends as we were not close and they had plenty of other friends.  My relationship with Jack was okay.  I tutored someone privately that I ended up liking a lot.  We got along really well but haven't really hung out as he's a guy and I didn't really feel comfortable with that.

The last semester was actually not bad, although it was really rough grade and stress-wise.  I think I still got all A's.  I started being included in a group of people in my major basically through constant proximity since we all had the same schedule.  I went to a party with them recently and felt pretty awkward, but then went to the bars with a couple of them and had a decent time.  

I don't know what I think about Jack anymore though.  It's been eating away at me for a while that I don't know if I still want to be with him.  I feel like he constantly disagrees with me and I don't feel loved or supported, even though I see him trying and doing things for me all the time.  I don't feel like he is ever really interested in things I tell him or my stories.  I feel like we never do anything fun.  But I also think that might be me never thinking anything is fun or me not wanting to do things that could be fun.

I don't know if I could break up with him though.  I should still be attracted to him because nothing has changed but I am never really interested in sexual things and occasionally give in just so he doesn't complain or think I don't like him.  There's nothing wrong with him.  He does so much for me, but he doesn't tell me he loves me and I don't know... compared to how excited I used to be about him I don't know how to feel anymore. He makes me angry a lot when I try to talk to him about my feelings.  I tell him that I'm just not happy with my life and he doesn't understand.   He gets very sad and won't talk about it if I try to address problems in our relationship. 

What's bothering me is that I don't know why I can't feel happy.  I don't know what's going on.  I don't really feel strong emotions about anything.  My one new friend always tries to talk to me about her boy issues and I don't feel like I can relate at all, I try to give encouragement but I feel emotionally shut down.  I really love my family but I just don't feel like talking about myself at all when my mom calls and asks how things are going.  I usually give a few word answers and feel terrible about it because I'm not even interested in talking.

I am about to move for an internship over the summer and will be alone in my own apartment.  It should be really exciting but I don't even feel like I want to do it.  I don't want to deal with meeting new people.  The bad thing is I don't even feel that sad about being away from Jack all summer.  I've never been with anyone except him and I don't know how I feel about that.  I wish I could try being with someone else without hurting him or losing him in case it's the best I'll find.  Not that I even think I could find someone else at all.

I don't know... I think I have low self esteem.  I feel very unattractive all the time even though I know I'm not that bad.  It doesn't help that one of my only new friends (that's a guy) complains that there are no good looking girls in our major and how he never meets any attractive girls, etc, and he complains about this to me.  So I don't know if he's including me in that or what but it's a little sad.  I feel like if I did break up with Jack I would just be completely alone, I would be people's acquaintance third wheel type friend.  I don't really feel like anyone else would date me.  The best I've felt recently was when I was at a somewhat friend's house and their mom told me I was too attractive to be in my field.  I get a compliment like this every once in a while and it's usually the highlight of my month.  I used to post pictures of myself on the forums of my mmorpg guild because it made me feel better that people on the internet would compliment me.  I'm pretty embarrassed by this now.

I still feel like the only thing I have going for me is my grades.  I worry that I should be trying to go to grad school or something, but I also don't even want to deal with trying to apply and pick one and all that.  I have no idea why I picked my major, I feel like it's just something that happened.  I'm not that interested in it, but there's not really anything else that I like better.  I have practically no hobbies and don't even know where to begin as nothing sounds enjoyable.  I spent pretty much every day the last semester doing homework and studying or hanging out with Jack.  I don't know what I want to do with my life but I know that at the moment I'm not very happy, and I don't know what I can do to improve that.  

Now I have an overwhelming urge to edit this as it's long and probably doesn't say what I want to say but I'll just post anyway.  "
1e22xs,1,2013-05-10,"[22/m] First dating experience with (22/f), seeking guidance",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1e22xs/22m_first_dating_experience_with_22f_seeking/,"First off, let me say I am terrified of being found here by a lurking friend. But oh well, I'll try to keep it informative enough to just give myself away, and short enough to miss a lot of information.

It starts with this girl. I've known her for a few years since she's been in my major, and in the past two semesters I've worked more closely with her in classes. Attraction developed, she was with a guy in a long-distance deal, but I pulled the nervous gunman card and expressed my interest while she was still with him. She said she was surprised, I hid it well. Then told me she was glad I finally let her know.

About a month later, she's broken up with the guy after they both agree it's for the best. It takes me two weeks after this to finally ask her to go out with me, and even though she's not available that Friday, she said she'd ""really like to some time"" and the smiley faces &amp; exclamation marks started showing up in texts.

So for the next week or so we kept on throwing ideas out there. Either one of us was working, or out of town, but it was raincheck after raincheck. Following a few beers one night, I invited her to come out to a bonfire and do some stargazing with me. She was passed out but responded the next day, disappointed that she didn't get my text. She hadn't been to a fire in a year (city folk...) and never really stargazed, or saw a meteor.

Finally I had enough beer one night to bare my inner manchild, and I texted her some really sappy, dripping-with-desperation stuff about what it's like for me when she lets her hair down, and something about wanting to hold her hand... She responded with ""I'm really blushing right now,"" told me that she wasn't good at this kind of stuff (what?), and then I took that opportunity to ask her if she wanted to grab a late breakfast after our final the following day. She said that sounded good, smiley face, hooray.

I should take this time to mention that we are now both aware of the fact that at the end of this semester, she is graduating and moving back home, while I am heading the opposite direction for an internship. So not many opportunities to see each other due to night jobs. I am actually writing this from said internship location, and the convenient time to see her is over. It will easily be a month before I even have an opportunity, and according to her summer plans she will be busy with family, and possibly getting a call back on a job that will seal the long-distance deal.

Anyhow, the ""date"" was OK. Since it was my first I didn't rightly know how to get to know someone on such short terms, so I asked her about her career plans, aspirations, etc. Nothing very personal, not even flirty. It went well, she said she wants to hang out more, and she alluded to coming back down to the college town over summer (where I will be finishing my degree) to have some local fun. I didn't immediately recognize this as her desire to come back and spend time with me, so I just kinda let that subtle invitation pass unnoticed.

The date ended with a very awkward goodbye, as we both drove to meet at the restaurant, and I had no idea how to leave without just saying ""Well, I guess I should go."" She acknowledged it with a kind of ""oh..."" face and a few words, but I walked off much too quickly and I feel like I didn't quite communicate that I was having a good time. In retrospect it seems like I kinda ran from the place.

What am I even doing? I don't know, and any advice at all is appreciated. I wish I had more clear-cut questions, but I've decided to text her less. She told me to send her pics of the stuff I'm doing at this internship, so I may wait a handful of days and then send her a picture or two...

Suggestions? Questions? I'm all ears... TL;DR:

Don't know how to sort this out.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1e1s0k/i_25m_find_my_gf_23f_a_little_too_impulsive_and/,"I'll preface my post by saying this: Although we're in an LDR, we meet frequently and it's all going better than expected. I don't have any major complaints. I also have no intention to part ways with her. 

However, here goes:
My gf always had a very restrictive childhood because of her conservative and over protective parents. As a result she has always fancied a more happening/adventurous lifestyle that includes travel, sports and so many more things. I've consciously tried to be as supportive as I can, towards this. Thanks to the distance, she has been doing things all by herself or with friends for the last couple of weeks and months. 

Now that she is pursuing her internship, she has a bit of financial independence and time on her hands. She has been treating these two months as a letting-herself-go and having-fun period. I'm with her on this but I find some (very few) of the things she wants to do a little too impulsive and immature. 

For eg: 

1. She wants to go check out the most unsafe area in her city because she's curious. I ask her to reconsider since I'm concerned for her safety but she overlooks it all and says she'll be ok. 
1. She doesn't usually drink but she has jumped at every opportunity to go out drinking and gotten really tipsy. To a point where someone has to escort her all the way back home.


I feel helpless. I'm don't like imposing my ideas or opinions on her but I really hope she respects my requests. She has been pretty dismissive about the seriousness of some of my concerns. (If she by any chance reads this, she'll tell me I'm thinking/worrying too much). Please note that I'm from a country which is known to be terribly unsafe for women and that's where my concern/fear stems from. 

I am on the verge of starting my own business and that has been very taxing. After 15 grueling hours at work, it gets to a point where I don't feel like trying to convince her any more, but that constant fear seems unnecessary and gets really annoying.

How do I get around this?

**REALLY Long Story**

My anxiety issues first really appeared junior/senior year of high school - pretty much during the whole college application process. I just found myself getting really nervous about the prospect of college and my grades. So, I stayed home a lot. Which led to me failing a Biology class. Which made my fears even worse.

I ended up fine, graduating on time and being accepted into my first choice. I figured that the jitters I was having were part of your typical high school experience. Except, they never left. 

I went to a college out-of-state, 8 hours away. I experienced some homesickness (thinking about mom would make me well up) but I adapted well enough, made some friends, went to parties and joined some clubs. I thought everything was fine. Then I started having my doubts.

My school was very small and the degree program was very focused - you pretty much needed to declare your major freshman year to graduate on time. I was going to study zoo keeping. One of my friends, however, broke down the math one night. She was trying to justify why she was transferring out. I don't think she realized what she was doing. As I nodded and agreed with her, I felt that redhot feeling of doubt in my stomach again. She rambled on about how much it would cost to attend our school, our prospected salary, how much debt we would have to pay off... I got scared, started having near-nightly panic attacks about my future. I hid it well (I always hide it, I'm a very good faker) but I became more withdrawn, stopped hanging out with my friends. At the end of the year, I transfered out.

I thought I was being too rash with my decisions. So I got a job at a vet's office, taking a year off to decided what I wanted to do. Of course, it turned out to be one of the most stressful jobs ever. My manager, though I don't think she meant to be mean, was a nitpicker. Everyday when I left for home I knew there was something that I missed, that I would probably get lectured the next day. The Doctor was a dick. Since the turnover rate was high, we were short staffed most of the time. I was originally hired to work the kennel. I ended up being promoted to a tech. I had no experience in this field but I was running tests, holding dogs, learning to take blood. I was stressed all the time. I cried in my car during lunch all the time.l This was almost everyday for the next year.

I fantasied often about plowing my car into a tree on the way to work, just to get away from the stress. At home I was probably a monster, I was always snapping at my family and constantly on edge. You know those chills you get when you get really scared or nervous? I had those everyday.

Last year I got accepted in a nearby college that my friends attended. I was able to quit my job. For the first year I lived in a house of six people and had a blast. I originally entered thinking I was going to pursue an English degree but, again, I became concerned about the future. So I transferred into the business school. 

I don't why I did it. It was horrible. I tried being attentive but I found myself feeling over my head. I don't know why, I knew the material but I became lackluster. I didn't have any energy to get out of bed. I missed a lot of classes. My grades suffered. I started getting those nervous jitters again, school was constantly on my mind but still, I found myself chained to my bed, looking at my clock knowing that I was missing classes. I was both terrified and uncaring. I ended up being placed on academic probation and had a nervous breakdown in my car, scared I was going to flunk out of college. Called my mom, cried about my problems. I also - get this - lied to her and told her I was talking with a counselor. I wanted her to think I was getting help, I didn't want to worry her. The closest I got to actually seeking help was a voicemail I left for the school's therapist, asking to schedule a time to meet with him. I never heard back, so I never pursued it.

I got some of my shit together this year, worked hard and got taken off academic probation. Found a major I really enjoyed (despite the fact my job outlook is still poor), found a new hobby (photography), got an internship at my local paper, a column in my school's newspaper. I even applied to become an editor at my school's newspaper and I have a good feeling I got it.

Everything is going pretty good, right? 

Nope.

These anxiety fears are now constant, no matter how good or bad I'm doing it's always there. Money, grades, my future, finals - I feel like I'm always tiptoeing around, that I'm about to breakdown again even though I can't pinpoint a reason why. It's like I'm waiting for something to happen. 

My parents went out of country to attend a wedding, I was left to watch my siblings. We were left $600. There's less then $100 and I don't know where it all went. I have rent due in a couple hours, $400. I have $10 in my bank account. My mother already said not to worry about it, but I am. I had a panic attack. Those thoughts of just... being dead are still rampant. 

Then Allie, of Hyperbole and a Half, came back and discussed her battle with depression. I realized that a lot of what she was dealing with was what I have been constantly battling for the last three years. She wrote something along of lines of wanting to be dead but not actually wanting to kill herself and it was so close to home that it scared me.

I'm just tired guys. I just want to wake up one day and be normal. I'm sick of being sad or nervous all the time, it's really starting to wear on my... well, nerves. I want to stop having this thoughts of just... being dead. I want to stop being mean to everyone around me. So that's why I'm finally asking - where the hell do I start?"

1e1gfr,2,2013-05-09,"Need college advice, narrowly missed academic probation this semester and don't know how to pick up the pieces",[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1e1gfr/need_college_advice_narrowly_missed_academic/,"Sorry for the long backstory....  Basically starting college I didn't know what to do with my life, so I majored in Biochem and set my hopes on applying to medical/pharmacy school, despite the fact that I've always been terrible in science and never had a much interest in the field (my entire family is in the medical field, so I suppose I felt a little pressure). I did surprisingly well though and maintained a 3.6 GPA, although my highest grades were in my general ed classes (I made As in every non science class I took).  Then, sophomore year, I got a job in a pharmacy and hated it.  I was also becoming burnt out from taking upper level science classes that didn't interest me, so I panicked and decided to transfer to another university and get a degree in hearing sciences, then apply to grad school for audiology.  My reasoning for audiology being: medical field, high demand job, not as much rigorous science.

This is where things fall apart.  Had trouble making friends, had trouble adjusting to my new uni which, in retrospect, was a terrible fit for me.  Lost quite a bit of weight and was even worried that I was developing an eating disorder.  Looking back, this is the point where I should have sought counseling, asked for help, etc.  Stupidly, instead of doing any of these things, I panicked once again and decided that I had picked the wrong major, and if I changed my major everything would be better.  This was by far my biggest fuck up.  I switched to nutrition science, based on the fact that I had many requirements for the major already filled from my previous biochem requirements, and a mild interest in nutrition.  (My first semester GPA was 2.1 by the way.)

Although the next semester (this past spring) got better towards the end, it wasn't soon enough.  Things were still bad at the beginning; I still didn't have many friends and was pretty isolated and really sad.  Nutrition science is more demanding than hearing sciences, and I barely had any motivation to keep going.  I should have dropped classes, probably even should have withdrawn from my semester, but I didn't.  I thought if I forced myself to keep going things would get better.  Grades were still terrible though and I now have a cumulative GPA of 2.00.  The minimum not to be on academic probation.

Outside of academics, at the end of the semester things began to shape up.  I got a fun part time job that I'll keep this summer/next year, made more friends, am soon moving into an apartment with a great roommate, and was pretty happy the last few weeks of school and genuinely left feeling like I belonged there.  The last couple weeks of school I was actually happy, felt like myself again.  It's too bad these things didn't happen earlier, or I probably could have salvaged my grades.

The problem is, where do I go from here academically?  I am signed up to retake the classes I did bad in this summer, which would drastically raise my GPA.  I know I am capable of getting As in these classes if I retake them.  But that doesn't change the fact that I am in a challenging major with only a 2.0 GPA, and I have no job prospects with this major without going to grad school.  I will never be able to get a job doing research in a lab or an internship with my current grades, which are a necessity for my major and for applying to grad school, not to mention that I don't even think research is something I would like.  

Overall I made a terrible decision switching into this major, and I don't know if, after I retake classes, I should suck it up, and finish in this program, because I'm already a senior and this is what I committed to doing, or if I should find another major I'm interested in and good at and could still probably graduate in the same amount of time.  I just hate how indecisive I feel, I feel like I've lost my mind.  Most frustrating is that the classes I did bad in here were still easier than the many of the classes I took as a biochem major, and I know that I could've done really well under better circumstances.
I suppose I'm just looking for any suggestions, or anyone who can relate."
1e1foz,3,2013-05-09,"Not even looking for people to read this - Just need to write something about my disrespectful, lazy, live in boyfriend, or I feel like I will explode at him. Glad this sub exists!",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1e1foz/not_even_looking_for_people_to_read_this_just/,"It's really frustrating. He doesnt do much around the house, and it kind of hurts my feelings, really. All of the advice on Reddit is ""talk to him, tell him how you feel"". Welp, I have, a ton of times, and nothing really changes. Instead of getting angry about it, I actually get hurt. I want him to want to help me out, ya know? 

We split up the chores when we first moved in together, but there's never been one week in the almost full year weve been living together that he has done them without 1) me asking, 2) doing a half ass job. One of his chores is to take the trash and recycling out, but he will wait until they're literally overflowing and smelling. It's so overflowing that we have to put recycling items next to it, we cant even fit it inside. Still, he doesnt even take it out. Before we moved two weeks ago we had a big back porch and he would just take the bag out of the trash can and put it on the porch. One time I counted and there were 7 bags back there. He was too lazy to bring them to the dumpster. I think he thinks it's normal, but Ive never had a boyfriend be so disrepectful or just plain disgusting with that. When I tell my friends or have them over they are grossed out, too. I know I'm not the crazy one. 

I should also mention that his only chore was to take out the trash and recycling. I clean the house, do all of our laundry, take care of the cats solely, and only recently (1 week ago) asked him if we could switch off with scooping the yard (we have two dogs) and the dishwasher). I do all the vet appointments. If there is something wrong with the house I set up and meet with the plumber, etc. I handle all of the bills. His dishes are constantly piling up in the sink and smelling, even when we have a dishwasher 1 foot away. His dishes pile up so high that sometimes I cant even refill our Brita and have had to use the bathroom sink on a number of occasions - and just to even wash my hands sometimes.

He complains that he's busy. He works as an engineer, and does work hard. I dont mean to make it a contest, but I hate that excuse.  He works full time and volunteers for 1 organization. I work full time at a non-profit, volunteer full time for two organizations, am in grad school full time, AND just started an 8 hour a week internship. It's really, really, really hard to take it all on.

We have two dogs and he doesnt do anything for them besides walk ONE of them in the morning. He doesnt take them to the park, doesnt spend time with them. When he gets home from work he just lays on the bed. I'll get home and ask ""have the dogs been fed?"" ""no"" ""have they been let out"" ""no, I JUST got home"". Well, they're living creatures, man. Theyre youre responsibility. 

He adopted a dog last February before we moved in together that ended up tragically passing away a few months later. For the first few months he would walk her everyday, 5 miles a day. Why wont he do that with our dogs (1 was mine before, and 1 we adopted together)? It's like the second we moved in together he lost all of his responsibility traits. He used to come home every lunch break to let his dog out. He's never done that once with ours. Not once. He knows I will take care of them and obviously not let anything happen to them, so it's like he just sits back and lets me handle it. They're two big lab-mixes. Theyre sweet hearts, but a ton of work. I guess I should have saw it coming, because before we moved in together I was the one who ended up taking care of his dog at his apartment. I would go over on my lunch break and let her out for him. Towards the end, I saw her more than he did.

I am so drained with work, volunteerships, internships, taking care of our pets, AND trying to be a good girlfriend. I just broke down and cried the other day in the shower from exhaustion. I am also a damn good girlfriend. Being on Reddit has made me realize how good of a girlfriend I am. It's also made me realize that he's kind of... shitty. I cant believe some of the stuff guys on here do for their girlfriends. I dont need an award, but I would love a ""thanks"" every once in a while. Some recognition, ya know? I literally dont ask for anything. I split everything financially, I'm not clingy, I have sex with him WHENEVER he wants and give him head 4 - 5 times a week without ever asking to cum on my own. It's been weeks since Ive cum, but I dont complain or say anything. I'll just take care of myself on my own time.

On top of it he kind of puts me down a lot. He's made it clear on more than one occasion that he thinks his work is more important than mine (I work with animals in the nonprofit world) or that hes busier. Tells me I cant do certain things, ""youll screw it up"", micromanages when I am taking a project on on my own. It really fucking hurts.

I volunteer as a rape crisis hotline advocate, and I'm also a ""survivor"" myself. Never once has he asked me how I'm going or how it's affecting me. We also have a huge issue going on at my organization right now that is affecting the dogs at work. Staff is so upset that people just break down crying in the halls. HR had counselors come in for us to talk to. He never asked me how I was handling it, updates, or if I was okay. Again, not looking for attention, but even a quick ""you doing okay?"" would mean the world to me.

With all that being said, I think this frustrates me the most because he is genuinely a good guy. He is truly one of those ""nice guys"" girls talk about. I really did luck out in terms of having someone that is trustworthy. I would literally trust him in a room full of naked girls and not blink. He does love me, and a lot, in his own fucked up way, though he doesnt really show it with his actions. He's just lazy, and thats what is so frustrating. Besides that, he's as perfect as you can get, so I guess you cant get everything you want, right? I would rather have a good relationship with someone who is a slob than a bad relationship with someone who empties the dishwasher regularly."

I graduated with a Masters in Information Science in 2011 from one of the Tier 1 institutes in India. Before that I completed a Bachelors in Information Technology (2010, by correspondence) and a Bachelors in Life Sciences (2009, full-time.)

Uptil December, I used to work at one of the largest Internet companies as an analyst. My job was mostly to review content and analyze data related to workflow issues, and suggest improvements with respect to the same.

I left the job, because I wanted to shift over to Software Engineering. My coursework includes most of the subjects taught in a regular Bachelors course in Computer Science. I can also code fairly well. While I don't have the experience of an internship, I have attended a summer school with a software giant. I also have a Masters project (related to GIS) to showcase my coding skills.

For the past couple of months, I've been prepping up and applying aggressively (through applicant tracking systems, job boards and referrals) to software companies in the hopes of an interview call. I think I have my resume and cover letter straight (keyword-optimized and tailored for each job.) However, all I've received uptil now is a rain of rejections. :(

A friend had asked for my resume a couple of days back to send to his brother, who works for a networking giant. Here's what the guy sent back:

*Problem is that this guy has not done a BE/B.Tech. and the minimum qualification here for being a developer/tester is a BE/B.Tech. :-(. Though his profile is quite interesting, they will definitely disqualify him based on that single criterion itself.*

A BE/B.Tech. in Computer Science is the indian equivalent of a 4-year BS in Computer Science. Software ompanies down here require a BE/B.Tech. in Computer Science *or an equivalent degree* for consideration for a entry-level job.

**Is it totally necessary to have a BS/BE/B.Tech. in Computer Science to land a job in software development? Does a B.Sc. in Information Technology \+ an MS in Information Science make the cut (assuming that the candidate has taken identical courses?)** I've landed interviews previously with two very big software companies (one through a referral, the other through a consulting firm,) but after reading this message, my brain seems to have frozen.

Am I asking for too much? If not, how do you suggest I go about this?

Thanks."

I recently got a 2 month summer internship doing front end web stuff. I decided to take it because I live in a pretty empty state and the internship is in a city where most of my friends live and jobs are. The internship is mostly front end HTML, CSS, and Javascript with a few Java projects on the side. I'm very comfortable with Java, C#, Python, PHP, and SQL. I have a decent amount of experience in what the internship calls (mostly class assignments and some little websites I made for fun) for but I'm worried about disappointing. 

What would normally be expected of me for this as far as HTML, CSS, and Javascript go? Should I apply for other jobs during the internship?"

The job literally saved my life as I was heading on a very bad downwards spiral. I was hired full time and was tasked with basic level 1 stuff. Laptop repair, smartboard adjustment, and basic networking. I fought for a file server and new laptops for the whole school and made a great ticket site to keep things in check as well as managing the inventory with my coworker. But thats about it, the rest of it comes down to plugging in usb ports the right way and air dusting projectors that overheat.

However theres no incentive to do more than the very basics. The mdf and idfs are old and degraded, no domain controller, a decrepit wireless configuration that turns a 20mb up/down into 300kbps, owa 2003 managed off site that gives users 20mb of space, the fileserver is a mac because thats the only thing for sale and its trash in a 98% windows environment, theres an old content engine proxy that hits up a vip farm that gets in the way of everything, no wsus, no software updating procedure, we run out of license keys all the time, the users are a bit technologically inept and thats ok but some of them refuse point blank to learn anything more, we had a consultant come in and convince the school to buy ipads that have been nothing but a headache and i keep getting the feeling that the people i work with dont understand why all of this upsets me. 

The school has a gigantic budget but only about 25k can be computer related though I have to check since somehow we spent 450k on lenovos.

I dont know what steps to take to rectify any of this or if any of it is even worth it. Men and women of sysadmin, am i over reacting over a simple job or is this just what i should be getting used to in education?"

1e5h4o,1,2013-05-11,The only day I didn't mind staying 45 minutes after closing,[deleted],TalesFromThePharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePharmacy/comments/1e5h4o/the_only_day_i_didnt_mind_staying_45_minutes/,"*This story is an old one for me, back when I was just a wee Pharmacy student intern at the local town Pharmacy/grocery store. One of my Pharmacists (Let's call her M) was married to a doctor in town (let's call him DrM). We got scripts from him and his office all of the time.  On to the story...*

It was mid-week, and our after-work rush had just started. I was working with a Pharmacist who was not M today, let's call her Jen.  In walks this lady with two prescriptions. I quickly glance at them, Omeprazole &amp; Oxycodone, and I knew we had enough of both in stock (let's call her CII Lady, or C2L). I told her that the current wait time was around 30-40 minutes (much longer then normal for us, but when there is a rush, what can you do?), while verifying I had her information in the system. She was polite, courteous, and told me to not worry, that she would be back much later that evening to pick them up.  I thanked her, and went back to the mad scramble of filling scripts. 

After the rush, I went back to C2L's scripts, as she said she would be back later that evening.  I scanned them into the computer, and started entering them.  The oxycodone prescription popped up first on my screen. I enter it; the label prints. As the omeprazole script pops up, I do a double take. I reach over and grab the hard copies of the scripts, and look more carefully at them.  They are definitely DrM's prescription pad. No doubt there. C2L's name, drug, sig code, quantity, etc, all look like his typical semi-horrible handwriting.  

But his signature... it just looks off. 

Normally, DrM's signature reminds me of John Hancocks signature, all smooth and graceful. This signature, however, was more sharp and angled.  Thinking I was losing my mind, I dug around in a few profiles to find other examples of prescriptions from him.  None of them quite matched the scripts I had in my hands. I checked with Jen and she agreed it looked a bit funny but overall did look like a legit prescription.  She said to call the office and verify anyways.  After all, that's part of our jobs and her license on the line. 

Of course, the office is now closed. 

Knowing C2L was coming back that night, I hesitantly called Pharmacist M at home.  When she picked up, I told her I was calling with a question for her husband regarding a script and *profusely* apologized for calling them at home.  He doesn't mind and came to the phone. I asked him if he saw that particular patient that day.  He confirmed he had.  I then asked him if he wrote for a CII for her.  There was a *long* pause on the other end of the phone. He then replied with, ""No, I did not.  She asked for one, and I refused."" I thanked him, said I may be calling back later with more questions, and hung up.

Well, now. 

Never been in this position before.

I look over to Jen, who is looking at me expectantly. When I shake my head, her smile fades slightly. She reaches over to the store phone and pages overhead, ""Security to the Pharmacy at your convenience please."" We *never* page security to the Pharmacy over the intercom.  Only with our panic buttons, which I have thankfully only used once before (that's a whole other story). So Leo, our lovely off duty cop, turned security take his time coming over (who happens to be fairly good looking, totally non-relavent to the story, but anyways). While he wanders over, I start our local chain call (I am still unsure if this is a common thing in Pharmacies or not, so far all 3 stores I have worked in since have also had one) to alert the other Pharmacies in the area that there has been a fake CII Rx found coming from DrM's office and to be on guard. 

Leo arrives, giving us a funny look. Jen lets me explain to Leo what has happened, and I finish by asking him if he would like us to call the local cops for back up in case she comes back in or if he would like to handle it if she arrives (him being an off-duty cop and all, and currently our on-duty store security). He tells me to give him a few minutes, and walks quickly away.  (I found out later, he told the store directer he was clocking out, getting his gun and badge, clocking in as a cop, and going to be chilling with Pharmacy for a bit. He's a bit protective of us, can you tell?) In the meantime, I called the Walgreens across the street, found out they were in the process of also filling an Oxycodone script for C2L, and they promptly stopped filling it.

When Leo returns, he inspected the scripts, asked to see a real one to compare it too.  So I printed off an old copy from another patients profile, ripped off her name and DOB, and gave it to him, and told him about the Walgreen's Rx across the street as well. He walks over and looks at their Rx as well, and confirms that it matches my faked one. Calls DrM to confirm what I had told him. Over the next hour: not one, not two, not even three, but *Four* other Pharmacies contact DrM stating they have also received CII Rx's from him office written for C2L this evening. Knowing this was no longer just a one-faked Rx issue, and now likely an intent to distribute, other deputies were dispatched to these pharmacies for statements. Security cameras are watched. Statements are taken. DrM lives close to us, and he even came in and visually confirmed our Rx's were faked. By this time it was closing time for the Pharmacy, and C2L hadn't showed, but we were still getting reports from other Pharmacies regarding similar faked Rx's from that evening for her. Fourty-five minutes after we closed, Leo's phone rings.  He grinned at us (have I mentioned he's good looking?), and said ""We got her!""

The next morning, we got a bit more information from Leo: 9 confirmed faked Rx's for controlled substances, 3 were successfully picked up, she was caught at the last store on the other side of town, but only that third Rx on her person.  Success!

The scary part is: *if I hadn't known DrM well enough to know his handwriting and signature, I would never have known it was a fake prescription.*

**TL/DR:** Nice polite lady brings in faked prescriptions for controlled substances, we almost fill it. Cops arrest her a few hours later at another Pharmacy picking up another faked Rx. She forged a total of 9 Rx's, totaling nearly 1100 tablets of various strengths of Oxycodone. Only managed to illegally pick up 3 of them.

1e54fd,1,2013-05-11,My lawyer was a Politician...,[deleted],politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1e54fd/my_lawyer_was_a_politician/,"My Lawyer was a Politician…

I was recently arrested and afforded a lawyer by the State; the only problem was that he was a Politician. I had three weeks until my trial and trusted my lawyer to fight my corner. 

By mid-way through the first week I hadn’t heard from him and we hadn’t actually discussed my case or the details of my alibi. We had no meetings, no calls. I finally got through to him on the Thursday and he explained that he’d been busy networking with other lawyers and people from the legal profession – for my sake. I wasn’t entirely sure how him dining with big wigs in the legal profession really helped my case and I was concerned that maybe he was busier politicking for his own career, rather than my life - but I pushed my doubt to the bottom of my gut. After all, he is the lawyer – he must know what he’s doing.  

On the second week I got a txt that read “will run campaign 4 u, LOL, Dave”…I was confused and promptly requested to meet with him, was he mocking me? He explained that he thought LOL stood for ‘Lots of Love’ and at this moment I began to question both his sanity and intelligence – how could one be so oblivious? I asked if we could discuss my case, he placed his right hand on my shoulder and assured me that all would be ok and that he had somewhere to be and left. I began thinking about preparations for a life behind bars.
    
The final week had begun and we still hadn’t spoken about the actual facts of my case. He called me whilst he was walking between a ‘working’ brunch and a ‘working’ lunch. I pressed the matters of the facts of the case and he explained that his assistant and interns were drawing up some briefings for him now and he would read over them from his blackberry. He then began to sing…”no Whyalla  wipe-out there on my TV, no Whyalla wipe-out” – it didn’t make any sense!

The trial came and there I was, sat in the dock with no savior and no sense of redemption. The Judge asked that the defense council rise, my fear froze for a second but my hope continued, I murmured ‘please, surprise me’. 

My lawyer stood…”Members of the jury, my client is innocent…. for the Prosecution is incompetent. This Prosecutor lost his last case, he had that opportunity to put a similar defendant behind bars and failed, so you see – how could my client possibly be guilty?”. I couldn’t believe it – what the hell? Was this some Lawyer thing? Was he a genius or really this bad? I  quickly looked to the Jury to gauge their reaction -  two nodded along vehemently in complete agreement, and one shook her head - she was horrified by his argument. I didn't get it, how did they have such strong opinions based on so little? Most, however, looked confused but played along through fear of looking stupid. They were clearly wondering what it was that they weren’t getting, but in reality, there was nothing to get. You see, the stupid were, in fact, the smart.

  Once my Defense council have finished his opening speech, the Prosecution rose…To my amazement his first words were “No, members of the Jury – the defendant is guilty because  it is in fact the Defense council that is useless!” I sighed with relief, you see, the Prosecution lawyer must also have been a Politician! He continued “the Defense council’s loss to win ratio is 18.2 to 9” – I saw that nobody knew what this meant but the Jury continued to play along in order to look ‘with it’. “Objection!” shouted my defense, “he has abused the statistics, my ratio is 3 to 14!”. Numbers were just being shouted across the Courtroom, nobody knew how these numbers were thought of, nor what they stood for anymore but somehow they always proved, beyond doubt, that whoever was saying them was correct.

This continued back and forth, nobody knew what to believe or what they were talking about. All I knew was that sure as hell wasn’t about me…. In fact, I’m sat in the courtroom right now, they’ve been bickering for over an hour now and the Jury, Judge and I are bored – we’re all on our phones and that’s where I’m writing this from…

TL; DR – If you wouldn’t want your lawyer to act this way, why should we accept it from our Politicians?

I've been interested in programming for a long time, and am currently majoring in ComSci. For the majority of my programming career, I've been told I'm good at programming and regularly gotten good marks and whatnot. However, the further I've progressed down my chosen path of study, the more I realize that knowing how to do stuff in a specific language is nowhere near as important as knowing how to be a good programmer. I *really* want to be a good programmer. Unfortunately, I suffer from a crippling lack of ambition (I play too many vidya), and a woeful inability to not look at what I have to learn in small sections. I recently started a development internship and have been given a ""reading list"" from the guy who seems to have taken the responsibility of mentoring me. I'm reading up on the stuff he's mentioned, and it's interesting, but I feel like a lot of it isn't really sinking in, and am confronted by this gigantic wall of things I don't understand yet, which causes me to shrink away and go back to other, simpler things (I'm up to 600ish points on codeacademy in the space of about a week, currently working on python).

Anyways, that's all just a lot of backstory for a simple question, which is: Where do I start? How do I get involved in the greater programming community, such that I can learn how to be good at what I do, as opposed to just know a lot of languages and be bad at all of them? I know that the key is practice, practice, practice - I'm just afraid that I don't have enough knowledge yet, and that I'd only be reinforcing bad habits.

Thanks in advance :D

tl;dr Where do I go to learn to be a good programmer, as opposed to a good code monkey?"
1e47o1,20,2013-05-11,I've just started work at my first coding internship! I'd appreciate any advice you have for me.,lostcats,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1e47o1/ive_just_started_work_at_my_first_coding/,"This summer, I was fortunate enough to land my first coding internship. It's a four-month internship on the web development team of a large organization.

A week has gone by, and I haven't done much coding yet, but this will change soon. Part of the slowness has been due to difficulties in getting the proper software set up (not exactly the fastest organization), and trying to familiarize myself with the workplace and its technologies. It's my first time using Visual Studio, C#, and ASP.NET.  Prior to this, most of the coding I've done has been with Java and for school - I've just finished up my second year of CS. It's my first time coding professionally, and I've been quite nervous. 
  
Already, I'm feeling overwhelmed here. Some things I'd like to know about:
  
1. What's the best way to ask for help? I have a great supervisor who understands that I'm an intern here to learn, so I know he doesn't expect perfection from me. I mainly follow his direction, but he is very busy. If it makes any sense, I'd like to ask good questions and not feel like I'm annoying him. I know it's a mistake - not getting help when I need it, especially when I need clarification.

2. How can I get better at understanding and reading other people's code? I'm not great at this. I was rather overwhelmed when I saw the code for the project, although I don't know what else I expected. I felt like I was just thrown into a project. I did receive some clarification from the supervisor and another developer, but I think I should be more self-sufficient. 

3. Will I ever begin to feel like I know what I'm doing as time goes on? I feel like I don't really know what I'm doing, except for following the guidance of others.

4. How can I make the most of my internship? Already I feel like I will continue to feel overwhelmed if I don't take an active role here. I know I have a lot of things to learn. Although I'm nervous, I'm excited to actually be coding things that will be used by people.

5. Any general advice/helpful tips/things you wished you knew when you were an intern?

I probably sound really worried... I do often doubt my own abilities. Thanks for any advice."

I'm going to be moving into the basement apartment of my grandmas house so I don't have to pay rent and can save up some money for the move. I currently live in a town in which the median household income is like $20-24k. The town that I am moving to has a median income of $33k.

I'm basically looking at this as I have six months in which I am going to pour most of my free time into searching and applying for jobs across the country before I have to start repaying my student loans. I'm working a minimum wage ($7.25/hr) job right now in which I get tips (I'm a bellman) that I'm saving up in a literal piggy bank. I make about $300-400 (take home pay) every two weeks and I've gotten $300 in tips from 4 slow weeks of work (hospitality industry obviously picks up during summer months).

What suggestions do you have for someone who is trying to make this move from a small town life into a larger (at least 30k population) town to start my adult journey? Is there some kind of rule for how much I should save up based on where I'm wanting to go? The huge ass cities (NY/LA/Miami/etc) are pretty much out of the question. 

I read that Forbes list of the best places for college grads that suggests Dallas, TX (5.9% unemployment, $900 average apartment, $46.2k average income), Houston, TX (6% unemployment, $800 average apartment, $47.5k average income), and Denver, CO (7.4% unemployment, $970 average apartment, $50k average income).

How much can be placed in these types of lists? With those numbers, what should I try to save up before making the big move? Doing something like this, is it reasonable to sell my car to put towards the savings when I'm ready to move and just invest in a bike or scooter or something? I'm really just looking for any kind of advice. Really desperate to make this move and start making things happen for myself and my family who have always lived in this area I'm in right now.

I'm a Spanish guy who has just finished his Engineering degree (Industrial Engineering, which in Spain is basically a broader version of Mechanical Engineering). I've been studying this last year in the UK and I just love it in here, so I would like to stay here and try to get a job as an engineer in here.

But life's never easy, so I have some problems with that:

-I would love to work in the automotive sector. Cars are basically the main reason why I've studied engineering in the first place... and I'm afraid that if I apply for a job in, say pressure vessels, I will eventually become ""this engineer specialized in pressure vessels"" and it will be hard for me to move to cars.

-Even if I've finished all of my exams... I'm not technically a graduate yet. Because of the way Erasmus grants work, if you go abroad you cannot do your last year AND your last year project. That is, you can either do all of the 5th year subjects but no project, or do them back in Spain and then go to [insert country here] and finish your project there. Either way your stuck for a 6th year (thanks, bureaucracy). However, some companies might consider me graduate (since I could do the project in just 3 months while working for them) or let me work with them on a project that I can use as a final year thesis.

-And well... I'm Spanish, and I don't know if that's good or bad for applying for a job in here. I know for a fact that engineering is way harder in Spain than in here, but potential employers probably won't know that. My English is quite good anyway (well, you can probably judge for yourselves by reading this) so I shouldn't have any problems with the language if I finally start a career in here.

So here's the question: What do you think I should do? Try to apply for Graduate jobs in here, even if they are not automotive related? Student Internships? Should I go back to Spain, start the final year project, and meanwhile look for jobs in the UK?

Thank you r/engineering!"

I broke up with my boyfriend of two years immediately when I started going to a well known ""party"" school. I got into a lot of risky situations and let people take advantage of me. I joined a church group in hopes of making some lasting connections, and as soon as I dated a girl (I'm bi) the pastor made a public announcement that I would be going to hell. Everywhere I turned, the places I put my trust into backfired on me. The end of it was talking to my advisor about internship. I was an art student who was always top 2 or 3 of my class and won various awards. The school itself had purchased some of my work. When I inquired about where I would go after college, my advisor offered up that it may be a managerial position at Walmart, or something of that nature. I was so angry and lost and confused, I packed all my things and took my small amount of savings and got an apartment in Chicago with a friend of a friend. The girl I lived with became one of my best friends, we did everything together. At the end of the summer, I found out that she had ripped me off the whole time on the rent and pocketed a profit for herself, even. I had been living VERY meagerly to support my lifestyle, living on just around $10 a week. I was so hurt to find out that even she had betrayed me. 
     So in short, in a span of about two years, everyone I ever knew, loved, or trusted managed to screw me over somehow. And that brings me to where I am at and the problem I have now. I am in a way better spot now, I am going to a kick ass culinary school and have secured a summer internship at one of the world's greatest restaurants. I have an apartment in the gold coast area of Chicago. I have a fucking iPhone. All these things I never thought I could achieve, I did. Because of my distrust for people however, I spend a lot of my time alone. I over think. I try to hang out with people but when they start to do anything less than awesome, or even are slightly annoying, I distance myself totally. The last two semesters, I have hardly made any friends. I am quite content to sit by myself in my free time and avoid people. I can tell it isn't healthy for me though. I used to be quite social. Now I am introverted and I feel that I have a hard time trying to function in social settings like parties and bars that used to be very fun for me. How can I get myself out of this funk, and become more open minded about people around me? I would love to find a boyfriend or a girlfriend some day, and I know thats a big step away from how I am now, but I want to know that I could trust someone again enough to let them in.

I have purchased ADSL from Pick N Pay and I have had the PPPoe connect a couple of times on and off, but it still does not establish an internet connection to be able to pull up a webpage

Apparently another intern had bought an airport extreme wireless dock and that worked, but we really do not want to spend $150+ to get one.

Does anybody have any experience with this or advice? Thanks!"

So I'm back in Austin for the summer, staying with parents one last time (I plan on getting an internship next summer and never moving back) and I'm just kinda looking for a girl to meet up with sometimes and talk with. I'm not sure what I'm really looking for, but not any committed relationships. I just enjoy spending time with a girl, especially cuddling.

I'm not here looking for just hook-ups. If that's what you want thats great, if not then just make sure I know and I won't try anything.

I just generally like having fun. I'm a PC gamer, I love the water (swimming and such), animals are great, technology is where my interests are and I think Austin is the best damn city there is. If you're interested, just message me. Also feel free to correct my writing in the comments, I know I'm bad at it and Reddit loves to correct these things."

2) The company didn't really specify the dress code, so can I just go in with a dress shirt + tie without the black suits?

I've been looking for internships during the summer and I'd sometimes run into full-time job listings. I rarely see any that accept applicants with just a bachelor's degree. 

From what I've heard from one forum, a minor in stats is not very useful because it doesn't cover enough material to be of much use and that one should major in math or CS and then get a master's degree in statistics, since so little companies hire people with just a bachelor's in statistics.

Any advice would be appreciated. 
Thank you!"
1e67ai,7,2013-05-12,Just venting.,Tua26982,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1e67ai/just_venting/,"Throwaway account. Just need to get this off my chest and unsure who to talk to. 

I got a chance to catch up with my dad today. I haven't really seen him much after my teen years and I never really cared about that, to be honest. I was already old enough that I relied on my friends more than a father figure. Sure, I had to google how to shave after accidentally nipping myself like an asshole so many times and do other things I assumed would have been taught by a father but I never thought of it. 

Today, he came and visited me at my grad school. He lives in another country and was visiting our hometown which is almost 1000k miles away from where I currently am. He attempted previously to meet me and I agreed in a heart beat. Twice, he bought tickets to come down to see me, but usually after i thought about it, I would withdraw my agreement. I'm in the midst of finals and I need to start my internship which is another 1000 Miles drive from where I'm currently located (2k from my hometown) as soon as my last exam is done. I don't even know what compelled me to agree with him when he asked to visit me. 

Nevertheless, today, he came down to see me by taking a flight down here and then taking a 2 hour bus ride to see me. The original plan was for us to just hang out for 45m during my lunch break from studying. Honestly, I didn't really care for seeing him so if he wanted to see me so bad, fine, whatever. I'll take a quick break from studying. 

But, he missed the bus and ended up just taking a cab up here, instead. I'm irritated by that point because I kind of feel bad. He's going through all this trouble for what I assumed was going to be an attempt to bond after only being in contact with me intermittently in the past 12 years. I'm a grown ass man in my mid-20s, I really don't need to have those father-son moment. I'm too old and too jaded to give a shit. I have more important things  right now to consider- my exams and work. 

But then he came up and for some reason, my mind went from ""I don't give a fuck, just don't take up too much time"" to ""OMG! My Dad's visiting me!! OH SHIT!"" Like, internally, I felt like how I felt when I was a kid trying to show my dad my new bike tricks. Instead of just grabbing coffee like I planned, I ended up dragging him into my car because I wanted to show him that I learned to drive stick recently (to which he commented "" I see you're still not good at it, but fuck it, dude can't even drive stick!). Then, I aimlessly drove around my campus and started pointing out landmarks to him (Yeah, that's my biking trail! And that building there? Yeah, I lived there last semester! Oh! Let me show you our football stadium!). 

Even after parking, I deliberately took the long way through campus to get to my favorite restaurant because I wanted to show him where my classes were. I even fucking pointed to the windows in the library that I look out of when I'm taking my study breaks (I don't even know why I pointed at that). While at the restaurant, the waitress that always serves me was there and I was tempted to introduce him to her just because I wanted to say ""this is my dad! he came to visit me!"".
Even after we finished eating and I took him to his bus stop, I insisted on waiting with him. Hell, I even sat there and showed him the stuff I was studying because I was trying to show him that I grew up from the high school kid that failed 9th grade and was repeatedly suspended from school. He was actually interested in what I was studying and was impressed by the subject matter. I'm extremely embarrassed to admit it but I felt really proud right then. 

Like, he left 10 hours ago and is probably on the plane now to go back to his home. And, I'm actually really sad that he left. I haven't felt the urge to cry in over... well, 12 years now. Nothing ever makes me sad. I'm usually very stoic when it comes to my feelings. Nothing makes me happy, nothing makes me sad. Just... neutral. But as soon as I came home, I just felt nauseous and slightly light-headed. I thought I ate something bad but then it occurred to me that I was just, well, sad. I've always hated feeling emotional because it's inconvenient. 

But here I am. It's 2AM I haven't gotten any studying done for my exam on Monday nor did I pack to leave later that night. And here I am, I'm just really sad. He gave me a hug before he left today and I didn't hug him back since.. well, I never hugged my dad before and it felt weird. But I kind of wish I did. To make up for it, I decided to accept an internship with a company in his home country that was extended to me recently as that would lead to getting a full time offer there after I complete school.   

Just.. had to get that off my chest. Thanks!

I'm 21 and male attending college, she's 19 and female, living at home and working. There's more details to the breakup in my previous posts in r/LDR, which I'll list at the bottom.

I broke things off about mid-March, I'd realized I wasn't too happy with the relationship. I felt like we were on very different levels when it came to our ambitions and motivations. It wasn't an easy choice, I still love her very much and probably will for a very long time, but it was a necessary decision. I found our recently that she's already moved on to another relationship, which I won't lie, stung slightly. It's only now I've worked up the nerve to start deleting photos, videos, and the other various post-breakup chores that come up. 

The problem I've seen arising now is that I don't know how to process all this and which step to take first... I've thought about trying to date other people, even just casually, but I can't seem to work up the nerve to even speak to a woman with anything more than a professionally polite tone. School's over for now, I'm going on an internship in June and it lasts 6 months, so I'll be home for quite awhile. I feel like a lot of old confidence issues I've had are resurfacing; self-doubt, poor self image (physically and emotionally), my sleeping pattern is screwed up... I feel like a mess again. 

I apologize if I sound like I'm whining, I'm just not sure how to handle this. Any advice you can offer would be a great help, and thanks for reading.

Since it's a PR internship, I have the impression that most of the women in the office will be dressed well, and I need to dress to impress! So far, my business casual wardrobe consists of approximately two blazers, a pencil skirt, and a dress. Would like to expand upon that.

My stats: 5'0, 112-115 pounds. Don't know my measurements, but I'm pretty sure I'm a rectangle/apple shape? Bra size is 32B. Not that curvy, which has given me problems with finding business casual in the past. I find it really hard to fill out dresses with my small bust, and my narrowish hips/small butt make finding tailored pants and skirts difficult as well. Petite sizes seem too big, but the juniors department often has ill-fitting pieces.

Here's a picture of me for reference: http://imgur.com/aGLSQZa

1e9ulb,15,2013-05-13,I believe Strong AI will lead to an Intelligence Explosion that changes our entire civilization. CMV.,DanyalEscaped,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e9ulb/i_believe_strong_ai_will_lead_to_an_intelligence/,"Computers are already 'better' than us in many aspects. Wikipedia can store more knowledge than your brain. Computers can calculate way quicker than you do. Google Maps can find the quickest route way faster than you do. 

But we, humans, certainly have our strengths. We are amazing in pattern recognition, for example. But if we can 'give' those 'last human-only skills' to computers, they will quickly become much more 'intelligent' than normal human brains. 

&gt;How could an AI surpass human abilities? Let us count the ways...

&gt;* Speed. Our axons carry signals at seventy-five meters per second or slower. A machine can pass signals along about four million times more quickly.


&gt;* Computational resources. The brain’s size and neuron count are constrained by skull size, metabolism, and other factors. AIs could be built on the scale of buildings or cities or larger. When we can make circuits no smaller, we can just add more of them.

&gt;* Introspective access/editability. We humans have almost no introspective access to our cognitive algorithms, and cannot easily edit and improve them. Machines can already do this (see EURISKO and metaheuristics). A limited hack like the method of loci greatly improves human memory; machines can do this kind of thing in spades.

&gt;* Serial depth. The human brain can’t rapidly perform any computation that requires more than one hundred sequential steps; thus, it relies on massively parallel computation.2 More is possible when both parallel and deep serial computations can be performed.

&gt;Consider how far machines have surpassed our abilities at arithmetic, or how far they will surpass our abilities at chess or driving in another twenty years. There is no reason in principle why machines could not surpass our abilities at technology design or general reasoning by a similar margin. The human level is a minor pit stop on the way to the highest level of intelligence allowed by physics, and [there is plenty of room above us.](http://intelligenceexplosion.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/scale_of_intelligence.png)

&gt;http://intelligenceexplosion.com/2011/plenty-of-room-above-us/

We humans have to study and train for years before we can enter a profession. At this moment, we cannot 'copy' the training a surgeon has received from his brain and paste it in the brain of another human. We still have to use lectures and books and internships, but these are completely inefficient compared to 'copy-paste'. 

In the past, monks had to manually write new Bibles, making Bibles very expensive and rare, just like all other books. Nowadays, we can copy-paste the Bible within a second. They are now available for free on the internet. This is some kind of 'information explosion', and I think the same will happen to intelligence. When we 'decode' intelligence by simulating one brain, we can easily copy it to other (super)computers. It will be able to combine the best traits of computers and humans and it can spread rapidly.

The reason why I am suspicious, if that's the correct word, is because my LinkedIn profile is rather plain - people have endorsed certain technical skills, and all I really have is the four most recent, relevant, job titles and timelines.

&gt;Due to the confidential nature of this technology, I can’t go into details in this email, but I can provide more information over the phone and will send descriptions and links after we chat. I can tell you that we'll be utilizing machine learning/mobile and geo location technology heavily - and with half a million merchants and 200 million customers, this has never been attempted or built by anyone at this scale. Since our beginnings 4 years ago - Groupon technology has funneled 6 billion dollars to local business, revenue solely generated to them by Groupon. This new technology should enable us to generate double if not tripple that revenue to small and local businesses, globally, truly disrupting commerce as we know it. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;This team will be in Canada the first week of June for the sole purpose of meeting with engineers interested in this opportunity. I’d love to connect this week for about 30 minutes via phone to discuss these roles, and can make myself available at a time that works for you. Please feel free to schedule a time that works for you on my calendar directly at [link taken out]. I look forward to chatting 


I was prompted for an interview time through the phone - which I did through doodle - and I took out of curiousity. I don't really use LinkedIn that much nor have I updated it that much either.

Am I right to be kind of curious and almost suspicious as to why I was selected?
If this is legitimate, how do I approach the interview tomorrow - should I mention at the start that I'm still a student? Do I assume this is like any other technical interview through the phone? If this isn't legitimate, what signs should I look for?

**tl;dr** got emailed through LinkedIn asking for a phone interview. LinkedIn profile barely has anything on it. Not sure if legitimate, and if legit, how to approach."

On top of all that, I am in my junior year of college and in an athletic training program. Early morning classes that are followed by leaving my campus and travel to other colleges to work in their athletic training rooms. Basically, I have almost no time to go out to put myself out there to meet new people because I feel tired as hell whenever I get back from my internship. 

Now let me give you a little background on what's going on now... I am really close to my cousin (He's not the one I'm in love with, don't worry) (Let’s call him Dan). Dan and I are really the best of friends and have been since we were little. Family holidays consisted of us just having a good time. Fast forward a few years and we both attend and live at the same college. Things have never been better. We ate together, we went on stupid adventures, and we played video games all night. Family holidays consisted of us just having a good time. To top it off, when I joined a fraternity, Dan was the first in line to join the following semester. 

Last semester: Dan had been dating this sorority girl (9/10) (Let’s call her Sara) for about a year and broke up with her because he didn't feel like they were meant to be. They go their separate ways and still are friendly with each other, but I remain close to her and visit her at work frequently. About 2 months later, he starts dating another girl in that same sorority. Things had a rocky beginning but have been going strong ever since. 

This semester: I was just coming off of another failed short term relationship and was feeling pretty down about it. The girl was nice but I didn't see the relationship going anywhere. About 2 month into the semester, I visited my Sara at work. We start talking about how much relationships have been going poorly for both of us and I try to make a joke by saying, ""You could've had this"" while pointing at myself. Cheesy, yes, I know. To my shock Sara replied with ""What says I can't?"" My jaw drops and was speechless, but somehow I get the words out to make plans with her to hang out that Friday night. Friday night comes we watch a movie and it leads to making out for a bit. At one point she grabs my dick over my pants and stops everything going on. She pretty much tells me she wanted sex but not that night. The very next night, she comes over and I had hands down the best sex I have ever had in my life. This happens for the next two weeks and I enjoy every minute of it. But as awesome as it was, I felt terrible because this was my cousin’s ex girlfriend. Spring break comes up and I hang out with her, take her on a simple date, and watch a movie back at my home. The date goes fantastically. Being spring break, I decided that this was a time to tell Dan that I have been seeing his Sara. He says he didn’t feel comfortable with it asks for it to end. I complied with him and had all intensions of ending it but I just couldn’t do it and since that point we haven’t seen each other as much and we aren’t as close as we used to be. 

Sara and I continued to see each other and spend the night in each other’s rooms. We would talk about everything and nothing all at the same time. I treated her the best I could and she reciprocated by treating me the best she could. Then Sara had dropped it on me that she has started to like me. At first I wasn’t ok with it but then I realized I had grown to actually like her. As much as I really enjoyed it, I knew I couldn’t continue doing this. Recently, I actually got the balls to put things on hold with her. It felt like I was breaking up with her and it hurt so bad and she was tearing up when I left her. I told her I’d always just be a text message away. The next couple days I felt like dirt and I genuinely missed her. Somehow we end up hanging out again in my room and I enjoyed every second I spent with her. 

To sum it all up, I really do think I am in love Sara, but I really don’t know what to do about it. Do I keep it inside and just eventually find someone else or go for it and ask her to be my girlfriend?"

I like my life so far *knocks on wood*

I don't have a problem with women in terms of sleeping with them. That's an issue that I solved a long time ago.

When I was 18, I met this girl and she never agreed to be my girlfriend (I don't blame her now, I fully understand why she didn't want to date me. I was a boy..mentally)

We were very good friends before we started sleeping  but fought a lot when we started sleeping together..mostly because of me. As much as I hate to admit it now, it was because of me. I was a clingy guy desperate to get her to commit to me.

I never could...it took me about 1.5 years to stop thinking about her on a daily basis (it was a rough time for me) but I eventually stopped...during the entire process, I made an effort to meet girls...I forgive the first 2-3 for sleeping with them while thinking about another girl.


Time has passed, I am older and I have seen and talked to her. I have no anger or feelings towards her anymore. It's just some girl that I used to know. Which I am very happy about. Believe me. Very happy.

It's very hard to try to live a normal life while you think of someone else that has left you.


I can't seem to date girls normally, I have this constant fear that I'll go back to feeling like that...I have certainly learned to deal with emotional stuff better and it won't take me a year and a half...but I don't want feel like someone has so much power to hurt me that way again.

 I have an issue dating girls, I can't let them get close to me at all. I am scared that they'll hurt my feelings or emotionally abuse me.


I have trust issues with girls and as soon as a girl shows/does anything similar to what this girl ever did to me that I didn't like...I just lose interest. Even if it's nothing bad.

**tl;dr** I don't trust girls at all and I have become a border line nazi when it comes to the girls that I am seeing...one little thing and I get scared and just ""fuck it"" everything and emotionally detach myself from her..really fast.

1e865t,2,2013-05-13,What am I doing - Comp Sci major to History PhD to Marketing to maybe programming again?? Need advice.,Comet7777,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1e865t/what_am_i_doing_comp_sci_major_to_history_phd_to/,"Hey everyone, 

I have a suspicion that I am not alone in being in my early to mid 20s without having a real exact idea with what I want to do for the rest of my life. I had programmed in highschool in various AP courses as well as for fun (programmed games). I went to college on a computer science scholarship thinking that would be the logical choice for me. After two years of doing computer science and becoming somewhat jaded (in retrospect it had more to do with myself than with the discipline), I wanted to challenge myself and make meaning of my life and switched over to a history and english double major. I managed to finish my degree on time even though I made a radical change. 

Things get interesting when I then was accepted to a Masters program for History. I really enjoyed what I learned and took it to a PhD program (all fully paid for by the department, with a nice yearly stipend too so it wasn't that much of a financial risk). I'm almost done with my coursework and on the verge of starting my dissertation writing process and I think I'm completely burnt out. I've come to this conclusion for a number of reasons: 1) the job market for my discipline and subfield is atrocious. If you land the coveted tenure-track job you've successfully have won the lottery. I refuse to slave away teaching 5-7 classes per semester as an adjunct to barely scrape by at maybe $30k/year since all that work guarantees you can't put time and energy into resumes and writing samples to get a better job. And 2) the idyllic professor job isn't so ideal after all. My wife is a teacher herself and she spends 10 hours at her school, comes home exhausted, and has to plan and grade all evening. It's hardly a life, and with us wanting to start a family, it doesn't make much sense for two of us to be doing the same thing. 

So, Reddit, I turn to you guys for advice. Since the job market looks awful I've decided to be proactive and engage with the private sector. I managed to snag a nice paid internship as a Market Researcher at an IT company. This is allowing me to network, gain crucial experience, and to learn what office environments are like. I've been really enjoying the whole ordeal. I recently learned that a few of us interns were brought in with the specific goal of turning us into full time employees. I would normally be suspicious of such a claim but this company was just recently acquired by an equity firm and is nearly doubling in size this year. It doesn't seem like a stretch that I could be offered a full time position contingent on my performance. Furthermore, since it is an IT company I'm working for and I have a TON of friends in the industry working as various sorts of programmers, it would seem that if I stayed in this industry I'd have a solid network already. Moreover, I've seen the career trajectories (and the stability) of programmers. It's been making me think that maybe I should refine my programming skills and follow that path. 

In conclusion, it seems that I can either 1) finish the PhD and pray pray pray that I land a tenure track job, 2) following this marketing gig since I'm actually utilizing the skillset I've developed in grad school and has a good potential for a career, or 3) since I have a foot in the door in the IT industry, maybe I can go back to programming?

Reddit - what say you?

TLDR - was a CS major but switched to history/english. Half-way through a PhD in history but got a marketing research gig and am enjoying it and am now deciding between going into marketing or programming (since I have a background of that already). I don't know what I'm doing with my life (long TLDR lol).

I'm going into my 4th year of CS and I'm pretty confident in my ability to program but only in C/C++ and Java and this summer I want to do something that I could put on my resume instead of school projects.

I've been looking at projecteuler, spoj, codeval to practice but I get so frustrated because I'm not actually creating anything to show. I've been thinking about creating a website but I only know Javascript from Codeacademy and it was not that helpful at all. Right now, I'm learning C# because I want to create a game but I have no idea what game I'm trying to make yet.

If I can't create something, there is one thing I want to do and that is create all the data structures from scratch. The reason is because I haven't been taught graphs in my data structures class and I feel like I need the practice.

I guess this is a really broad question but what can I do over the summer so that I have something to show for?"

I constantly have negative thoughts about anything and everything you could ever imagine.

Right now I'm on internship for the summer in a city far away from home. I've been here over a month and I have made no friends what so ever. I go out as much as I can to bars to try and meet people, especially girls. It always ends up with me leaving hammered having talked to very few people and not accomplishing anything.  Not to mention my job sucks and I hate going to it. I'm quiet at work because I'm miserable 90% of the time and my mind explode when people talk to me  because I have no idea how to talk to people. I feel like i'm trapped in a never end cycle of unhappiness. 

I use to have tons of friends and I was in my opinion a very funny and likeable guy. I don't know what has changed since then, but that me is gone and I feel like he is never coming back

I guess i'm on here just looking for help because I don't know where to turn anymore. I just want to be happy again and I want the old me back.

1ecfqq,5,2013-05-14,"Instead of fapping everyday, here are my new routines. What are yours?",GayNoFap,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1ecfqq/instead_of_fapping_everyday_here_are_my_new/,"Nofap has to come with other efforts to improve your life, and to do so in a realistic way by setting realistic goals.  What will you do instead of fap?  Can you keep those routines up?

For me, I've been allowing school to be an excuse for being lazy and letting fapping be my release.  I got through 11 days before finding that all the time at my desk preparing for final exams and wanting to think about anything other than final exams just led me back to PMO.  Now I plan on using the summer to develop momentum for those routines that will take me into the next school year.  Besides the 90 day challenge, I'm starting small:

**1. [The Lifehacker workout.](http://lifehacker.com/tag/the-lifehacker-workout)**  Three days a week of full body exercise.  Two days are 20 minutes of some form of running and 10-20 minutes of simple strength exercises that don't require any equipment.  One day is a deck of cards routine that is a fun randomizer.

The 20 minute running periods have a goal to run farther than I had the previous 20 minutes.  My previous attempts to get into a running routine have failed because I pushed myself too hard with various couch to 5k or run everyday sort of things.  I'm starting easy, run for a minute, walk for 90 seconds, repeat until 20 minutes is expired.  As the summer goes on I'll be increasing the continuing running periods, until I'm eventually at a single 20-minute run period.  This sets me up for success, as right now it is an aerobic workout for me to run just those 8 minutes out of 20, but as I increase my amount of running time, I'll be increasing my distance as well.

The 10 minutes of simple strength exercises are just sets of 5 push-ups, 10 crunches, and 15 body-weight squats.  The goal is to do as many as you can in 10 minutes.  Proper push-ups are hard, I could only do two sets before I got dizzy and had to stop.  But it's okay, because I feel like it worked, and I feel like I can only go up from here.  As the weeks go on, I'll increase the number of minutes.

The deck of cards routine is a different set of four exercises.  Hearts are jumping jacks or jump rope (think heart for aerobic exercise that works your heart), and the other suits are chair dips, knee-to-elbow planks, and lunges.  You can start with however many cards you like, the goal being to work your way up to a full deck.  I'm starting from a quarter deck.

At the end of it, I have a planned break which I'll use to evaluate whether I want to continue with that workout, maybe throw in an extra day of targeted workouts that the Lifehacker workout offers as an optional workout, or maybe I'll even be in the mood for something more extreme like P90X.  Planning a break also gives me an end goal.  I'm not exercising forever, I'm exercising 36 times over the next 12 weeks.  I also created an appropriate chain at chains.cc.

**2. Rise with the morning sun.**  My sleep habits turned to total shit during the school year, and only got worse during final exams.  I want to evaluate my sleep, so I downloaded a 99 cent sleep tracking app, [Sleep Cycle](http://www.sleepcycle.com/), that monitors my movements in bed to determine the quality of my sleep.  The app also monitors when I'm in my lightest sleep as the moment to determine whether to sound an alarm clock within a 30 minute window, on the theory that the lighter your sleep when woken, the more pleasant it is to wake up for the day.

I'm also getting to sleep earlier, because my window shades are not blackout shades, and my best rest will come in the darkness.  Rising with the Sun also helps me accomplish my exercise goals, since I know I'll beg off if I wait for after my summer internship work, or there will be varying after-work socializing that will go on.

**3. Shower &amp; shave EVERY DAY**  I set up another chain at chains.cc, because I realized that part of what would make me feel unproductive is that I wouldn't want to do anything until I showered and shaved, but then I wouldn't want to shower and shave until I had something to eat, and round-and-round I would go until half of Saturday or Sunday is gone.  I've had to turn down too many last minute social opportunities for want of a shower and a shave, and truth be told, a fap instead.  I tried cold showers during my first attempt, and while refreshing, the prospect of them was so daunting that I would revert to not showering at all.  Again, simple goals."

- Yes, it's hard, it's unforgiving and I love it. It's currently my most played game after SC2.
- Yes, I am a relative newbie to the game. I've only finished the game once and haven't gotten very far yet with an NG+ playthrough. In most singleplayer games that would qualify you as at least somewhat knowledgeable, but I realize DS is a bit of a different beast in that regard.
- I realize this game is/has been reddit's wet dream concerning skill-based game design in the recent past. I also realize I risk pissing off a large contingent of avid fans. However, I notice a serious lack of discussion about the game that doesn't justify any and all flaws as ""it's just hardcore like that. L2P.""

What I want to do in this thread is have that discussion: take an objective look at the game's pros and cons and try to be honest about what is unforgiving game design and what is sloppy and/or broken. In order to further the state of the gaming industry, it would be helpful to pinpoint exactly what can be learned from DS.

---

To start things off myself:

**Invasions**:

For a PvE player like myself, they're just stupid. You're merrily on your way, fighting some new kind of monster, barely hanging on and xXxR4ng3rKn1ght420xXx steps up and backstabs you, and you are now potentially out of X humanity and (in my most recent case) ~40.000 souls. Focus on the invader and the regular monsters will kill you. As any PvP player will tell you, the soul level limit does very little to keep fights balanced when players can make dedicated PvP characters and transfer high-level gear to them.

Of course, you can only get invaded when you are in human form. Same with summoning allies or NPCs. Risk vs reward type design, it makes sense, and this is usually how players justify this design. 
I would agree if it were not for this one thing: *You can't avoid being human quite regularly.* There is no way to kindle bonfires without that. 
When do you kindle bonfires? *When you've just arrived in an area and are having a hard time, almost by definition.*

The design choice to link activating/upgrading a save point and opening yourself up to PvP is a nonsensical one, IMO. It makes you vulnerable to other players with the sole intention of killing you at exactly the time when you are weakest. Gameplay-wise, the two have nothing to do with eachother. The only way to avoid it is go through the game with only 5 Estus flasks. For a game that prides itself on being skillbased, brutal and honest, being randomly assassinated by overleveled players is a bad fit.

**Weapon hits/collisions**:

Why is it that my uchi gets stuck on a wall when I slash more or less parallel to it, yet that Titanite Demon over there swings a huge axe through two solid walls and hits me? Don't get me wrong, it's not a huge issue or anything, but there are instances in the game where a fight is uncharacteristically hard because you are hindered by your surroundings while your opponents are not. This is pretty much the sole reason I stopped using greatswords - it is simply too common to get into areas where you can't even swing them properly. Getting hit by a dagger through a massive column is not good game design no matter how you spin it, and it seems more like an oversight or laziness on the developer's part than anything that can be justified as a conscious design choice.

There are other instances where the weapon hit detection is a bit dodgy. Getting hit by the slow-moving blunt rear-end of a spear, for example, and taking full stab damage. Or enemies adjusting their flight path or facing in mid-air to compensate for your movement.

If this were the first game in the series I would be understanding of these errors. However, it isn't. I never played Demon's Souls, but I'm assuming it was the same in that game? If this is a conscious decision, what could possibly justify it? I am at a loss.

**Blighttown**

This area isn't actually all that difficult combat wise. It's just bloody annoying. The level design has you walking across all kinds of rickety structures, often with strange geometry sticking out or holes in the surfaces. I think the moving bridge takes the cake: standing still at certain spots while it's moving will slide you off the side due to weird bounding boxes. Now, when you put enemies in an area like this that are capable of bumping you into a chasm even if you block their attack, you're just messing with players. You're more or less forcing a bunch of random deaths caused by unpredictable/unavoidable knockbacks (depending on player build and loadout. For a shield+sword player, or heavy armor player this is hell. Dodge-based characters will have a hard time as well, but at least it's in their own hands whether they dodge off a bridge or not.)

Then there's the fact that you *will* get poisoned going through the swamp no matter how high your poison resistance is and there is no merchant in the area. In order to get through Quelaag, I had to get back out of the Swamp, back up to Undead Burg, buy a ton of moss clumps and get back in. Complete time sink for very little (if any) gain in gameplay quality.
Also, toxic blowdarts with laser guidance.

---

So, what are your thoughts? Feel free to attack any of my points above as long as your main argument is not ""learn to play"". If I was just bothered by the game being difficult I would not be going through a second playthrough now.

**TL;DR: If you had to explain some of Dark Soul's oddities and were forbidden to use ""it's unforgiving"" as an argument, what would you say? What are some of the weakest points of the game, overlooked or not?**

---




*Edit, Two more additions. Thanks for the discussion so far!*

**The design of the primordial serpents**
I realize this one is a bit more of a subjective thing, but what the hell. Serpents with human teeth? A skull that more or less protrudes out the side of their body? I'm not sure if the intention was to make these look goofy as fuck, but that's what they managed. For a game with otherwise amazing art direction, I'm not sure which intern got tasked with designing these.

**Unreliable triggers**
In a game where experimentation and trial-and-error is encouraged so much, I feel special attention should be given to the scripting of game events and sequences. Currently, there are quite a few opportunities for players to irreversibly screw themselves by missing, glitching or otherwise triggering an event ""wrong"". 
Examples: 

- Fall down Frampt's pit before talking to him and place the Lordvessel? Both Frampt and Kaathe will now assume you picked the other one, and neither will be accessible for the rest of the game (even though the player is probably not even aware of Kaathe at this point in the game).
- Siegmeyer can get glitched and not show up in Anor Londo, even if you saved him in Sen's. You are required to go back to Sen's, redirect the boulder machine, then talk to Siegmeyer again and he will possibly be fixed. I've heard mixed reports about whether this actually works. Already beat O&amp;S? Byebye Siegmeyer storyline.
- Being able to kill Gwynevere in Anor Londo without triggering the results, simply by using a ranged weapon outside of her room. (Not sure if this one still works, but it used to.)

**Controls oddities**
You almost never use a ranged weapon when you are in lock-on range. So, you're mostly going to be using the zoomed-in mode. Why, then, do you need to explicitly exit this zoom mode before you can swap your weapon to a different one? Dodge doesn't work, running doesn't work, estus doesn't work, nothing works. Only LB1 and RB1. See an enemy coming up to attack and want to get your shield out and block? LB1, d-pad away from bow, LB1. A bit weird.

Same thing for the in-game menu. It's not particularly handy to block off your estus, run and roll buttons as long as you have the UI open. I like how it doesn't pause the game, but then you should also execute the concept fully and be able to completely control your character with the menu open. This half-way approach isn't very good."

It started right around ten years ago, when I was a junior in high school. I was a stereotypical nerd. I had thick glasses, wore clothes that didn't fit me, had a crush on a popular girl who didn't reciprocate (though we did become platonic friends), and had friends who really were only friends to use me as the butt of their jokes. By the beginning of my junior year, I had cut off all contact with pretty much everyone and spent most of my time on Ye Olde Internet, writing a lot, and making online friends in various writing communities.

Then, I met Stephanie. Stephanie was nice, pretty, had big boobs (important to a 17-year-old boy!), and liked me. She was dating someone at the time, but soon broke it off with him as we became better friends. Stephanie, her friend Mikki, my friend Harry, and I all hung out for the majority of my senior year. Stephanie and I were wary about dating because I'd be heading to college a year ahead of her, and I planned to do so about 8 hours out of state. But before that summer, we decided to give it a go.

When I first met Stephanie, her and Mikki gave me what I can only describe as a makeover. Gone were the ill-fitting clothes and in were more fashionable, trendy clothes. The glasses were replaced by contacts. The haircut was now stylish instead of ridiculous. It was like a gender-reversal She's All That. It was cool, though, because for the first time in my life I felt like someone physically desirable. 

That senior year featured more flirting than I had ever experienced before in my life. And all that writing I had been doing had adjusted my brain so I actually understood how to talk to people (and flirt back!). Still, the flirting was a little awkward, mostly because these girls knew me as that kid who didn't talk to anyone just a year ago and I felt a bit like I was putting on an act trying to be a suave guy.

Still, for someone who had been ignored for so long, the attention went to my head. My flirting going over the line to Stephanie's annoyance (and eventual hurt) would become a theme in our relationship. Tori would be the first in this regard.

Stephanie, Tori and I met because we all worked at a restaurant the summer before my freshman year at college. Tori, it must be said, was EASY. She had slept with a bunch of people, cycled through boyfriends and boytoys at an alarming rate, and fooled around with more. She wasn't stunningly attractive, just thin and not ugly and promiscuous, which to most guys is close enough. And she liked me right away and wanted to sleep with me.

And so I did. Before going to pick up Stephanie from work one evening, Tori decided she wanted to de-virginize me (Stephanie and I hadn't gone all the way yet). I let her.

NSFW BIT HERE: Stephanie and I had fooled around a bit, oral sex and hand stuff, etc. I had also sometimes ""slipped it in"", though it never went further than that. What I discovered through that, though, is that Stephanie was TIGHT. Like, ""It is realllly difficult to get more than one finger in her"" tight. Tori was THE EXACT OPPOSITE. I put on a condom, and honestly got NOWHERE even 20 minutes in.

Short, SFW version: My first time resulted in me not finishing.

Afterward, I felt stupid and sleazy and dumb. I ended my friendship with Tori and eventually Stephanie and I stated sleeping together. It was really good. And because our relationship was growing in such a way, we decided to try to make it work long-distance while I was at college.

PEOPLE OF REDDIT: THIS IS ALWAYS A DUMB DECISION. Long-distance relationships are well-meaning and emotionally fulfilling, but they are unnecessarily painful, wildly difficult to navigate, and more trouble than they're worth. Also you don't get to have sex as often as you'd like, which sounds shallow, sure, but sex is important even if we don't want to admit it! And the problem is less that you can't have it, but that you can't have the intimacy that sex provides with your partner when you're going through a rough, disconnected time. All our sex felt perfunctory while I was away at college, like it was something we had to do on the weekends she was around, not like it was a healthy part of our relationship.

That first year I was at college doomed our relationship, but we wouldn't know it for YEARS.

I didn't sleep with anyone else, I want to make that clear. But like I said, I had been a nerd for years. The opposite sex didn't look at me ""like that."" But suddenly I was at college and I could play guitar (as much as I didn't want to be THAT GUY I was admittedly sometimes THAT GUY) and I could make girls laugh and I wasn't a douchebag. My first week I made out with four girls. Throughout the rest of the year, I probably made out with at least one more a month. I hit on a lot more than that.

What I realize, looking back, is how blatantly my actions (even now) have been influenced by the DESPERATE need for attention from the opposite sex. I went 16 years being completely ignored as a sexual entity, and once I got it I became kind of addicted to it. I'm less a sex addict and more addicted to the idea of being the object of someone's infatuations. This, more than the idea that I didn't want to cheat, led to me not sleeping with the girls I made out with.

This desire also led to a weird thing: I created a blog under an alias and posted a lot of BS pseudo-intellectual/pseudo-poetic shit with the EXPRESS PURPOSE of pulling a Catfish on some girl(s). This is HORRIBLE BEHAVIOR and I am ASHAMED. But, what weirdly came out of it, was a really and GENUINELY close connection with a girl that went from posting on each other's ""walls"" to IMing to calling almost daily. I was conducting an emotional affair with this girl.

Stephanie snuck into my e-mail one day and found out.

Stephanie had trust issues, and me being so far away and going out to parties and blah blah blah, only amplified them. So she snuck into my e-mail to see what was going on and found my collaborations with this girl. To be clear, I hadn't said anything incriminating (There were no OH I LUV U BUT messages, just personal stuff exchanged), but I was hiding my relationship with a person from Stephanie and she reacted. Of course she did.

This established a pattern for the next two years. I would crush on someone else, create a friendship with them, fortify that friendship with discrete messages and flirting that could be construed as harmless but probably wasn't, Stephanie would find out, we would have an argument, I would apologize and we would be fine. It wasn't even just women I had (and still have) a habit of telling white lies to avoid conversations (example: If Stephanie would ask if I had washed the dishes, I would say I had even if I hadn't and then just make sure to do them before she got home). Sometimes I would get caught in these, and the argument/make-up cycle would begin again.

That makes our relationship sound terrible; it wasn't. We got along very well, we had similar senses of humor, aside from a few months her freshman year (she ended up coming to the same college as me), she wasn't super controlling or unreasonable, we had good sex, we helped each other through rough times. When we moved in together in early 2007, we had settled into a good pattern and I really put a curb to my flirtations.

Then I got a crush on her younger sister.

Seventeen at the time, Sarah was model-beautiful (I mean that literally, she was randomly approached to model on a consistent basis), had an amazing body, was quick as a whip and clever as a fox (two things Stephanie wasn't), and was more interested in the things I too was interested in.

Obviously, this crush was stupid and could not be acted upon, so I didn't. But the crush didn't go away. For two years, I harbored this secret and didn't tell anyone. However, attractions like that manifest themselves and Stephanie kind of sort of knew that I found her sister attractive. As someone who didn't have the greatest self-esteem, Stephanie was jealous of her younger sister, but only in an idle way as they were great friends.

Finally, I decided I had to tell Sarah. She was 19 and I was 23 at the time. It was an uncomfortable, but not hostile situation and getting it off my chest helped me to get over the feeling rather quickly.

A few months later, I moved from my college town to a big city, having received an internship at my dream job. While I was down there, Stephanie and I spoke every day, but the distance was again problematic (DON'T DO LTRS, REDDIT. IF THERE IS ANY LESSON IN ALL OF THIS, IT IS DON'T DO LTRS). She was still in school, and would be for a year, and because of that Stephanie and I decided to take a break.

It wasn't a REAL break, though. It was more ""I still love you and I want just you but I don't know I'm confused"" from Stephanie and ""I love you too, and I don't understand this but I don't want you to be miserable pining after me in this situation"" from me. And, yes, I'll admit I was excited by the idea of being single in a big city, even if just for a short while.

I didn't sleep with anyone else, but I made out with a few people and tried to score dates and not get evicted and work my dream job (they offered me a position shortly after my internship) for very little money and just in general figure things out. After a couple months, Stephanie decided that she didn't want to be on a break anymore and a month later I was fired during some downsizing and had to move out of the big city and back in with Stephanie.

A month after that, Stephanie snuck into my e-mail and found out I had had a crush on her sister.

This was devastating to her, and really was a culmination of every problem in our relationship: Her trust issues and my issues with white lies and flirtation being the most obvious. We had a long argument and discussion where we almost broke up and then didn't.

And then, everything was great. I thought, genuinely, that we were over the hump and it would be smooth sailing to careers, marriage, and kids at that point. We'd been together six years. It seemed like the logical progression. You could read into why I didn't ask her as being indicative of doubts in the relationship or whatever, but it was honestly not that. I expected that we'd get married, I just wanted to propose ""right"" with a nice ring and a unique method. I also wanted to get settled, so that the wedding would be the only thing we had to worry about. I went about all of this very practically.

We moved after she graduated and got a job in a different city. I found a ""career"" type job. One of the first people I met was Jake, a friend of Stephanie's from her new job. We went over to his house to watch the first NFL game of the season and hung out with Jake's wife and their two kids. Soon, we found a venue for getting married and we even decided, in our heads, what the date would be. We started looking at rings.

Then, kind of apropos nothing that I could tell, we started getting into fights, and Stephanie started asking questions about the reasons we were together. She started freaking out about being only with me and started talking about taking a break. I was confused, but in my mind this was the same kind of ""break"" she wanted when I was in Chicago: some time to get her head back on straight and then we'd move on.

She kept talking about it, and I went out of town to hang out with some college friends on my birthday-- Stephanie had to work. I ran into one of Stephanie's good friends from school, and a couple of her acquaintances with whom I had become friendly but she wasn't exactly friends with. I told them what was going on, mostly because I wanted pity from pretty women.

The next week, Stephanie found out. She insisted, to my confusion but supplication, that I move out. I did so, bitter about us having this argument about something so stupid, unsure with how to proceed, just sort of aimless. My work performance suffered, and I was pretty depressed. But, and I actually enjoyed this part of things, I was suddenly freed up to connect with friends of mine that I hadn't spoken to in years. Specifically, female friends with whom I had only a platonic relationship, but Stephanie was still jealous of and didn't want me hanging out with. I took these opportunities with the thought that, once back together, I would be able to re-negotiate the terms of our relationship in my favor.

But that didn't happen. We talked once in a rare while to deal with ""business"" type things: ""This is mine, I'm going to pick it up,"" ""We need to get the cable bill out of my name."" These would all end up with her crying and me waiting for her to ask for me back, her not doing it, and me being confused and too proud to do it myself.

After a few months of this, she called me over and told me that she had broken up with me to begin an affair with Jake. They had been planning it for a month before I had been kicked out and started immediately getting together. She told me because she was ending it with him and maybe wanted to get back together.

I helped her feel better (Why? I don't know. I don't like to be mean, I guess?) and told her I'd think about it and get back to her tomorrow. I talked with friends and told her we couldn't until she got the situation with Jack-- who she was still working with-- resolved. She agreed. I didn't hear back from her for a month.

When she called again she told me that she had gotten back with Jake again, but this time she was really ending it. I told her okay. We hung out maybe once because I was lonely and hadn't met anyone and wanted to feel attached to someone again. I think through all of this I was more hurt by the idea that ANYONE didn't love me most more than the idea that STEPHANIE didn't love me most, but when you're that depressed you can't make those distinctions.

A month later, her brother died. This was really messed up and difficult, of course, and I said I'd be there for the funeral, as I had gone to school with her brother and been semi-friends with him. What I didn't expect was for Jake to be there, too. But he was, and I was livid, but held it together. As much as I wanted to, I couldn't make a scene.

A week later, Stephanie called me, saying that THIS TIME FOR REAL she had broken it off with Jake. They weren't getting back together. I told her how upset I was, how messed up it was of her to do that when she knew I'd be there given our ongoing situation, how stupid she was for cheating on me. She insisted she hadn't cheated. I told her that not breaking up with someone, telling them you still want to be with them, and still sleeping with someone else was the definition of cheating. She cried, I hung up. I then proceeded to go out and sleep with someone else for the first time.

As much as all my interactions with Stephanie were difficult and heart-throbbing and upsetting, when I was able to get away from the situation, I was still me. I was still flirtatious (more so, being single) and still loved to get attention from girls. This wasn't affecting every aspect of my life because I keep things so compartmentalized. This compartmentalization is also why I've never told this story FULLY to anyone. So I went out and I slept with someone, and then I went and slept with another person. 

NSFW ASIDE: Both girls were one-night stands and with both girls I had trouble finishing. Like I said, Stephanie was ridiculously tight so having sex with other girls, while enjoyable, was not the same struggle to last more than ten minutes that having sex with Stephanie was. The first one-night stand and I have sex for about two hours (not all at once, but yeah), and with the second girl I lose my erection entirely and can't finish.

Stephanie kept contacting me, about once a week, asking to hang out. She found out about the sex and was actually kind of happy. I think that she thought of it as a sort of ""getting even"" for us and that I would get over her cheating and not have the simmering anger underneath the surface whenever I would hang out with her. She called me up late one night and wanted to come over to my house. I waffled, and then relented. We ended up having sex.

Afterward, I felt confused about the whole thing. I talked with her about it and she told me she didn't want to get back together with me. I said that seeing her and being with her sexually was difficult emotionally for me, which she insisted she couldn't understand. We fell into a pattern where she would call me after a bad day, crying or upset or anxious, and I would either come over to her house or she would come over to mine and we would have sex.

After about a month of this, I was at a bar with my friends when a beautiful girl came in and sat down alone. I decided to talk to her, we strike up a conversation, really get along, and at the end of the night we kiss. A few days later, we went out and decided we wanted to start dating, and have sex. I told her that night that I still had contact with my ex, obviously leaving out the part about still having sex. I also told Ellen, the new girl, that the primary reason I was still in contact with her was because we were still on the same cell phone plan (which was true, but not the primary reason). Ellen said she was fine with that and was glad that I was open about it.

I told Stephanie the next day that I'd met someone and that because of that we couldn't have sex anymore. Stephanie flipped. She didn't scream at more or throw anything, but simply badgered me relentlessly that I shouldn't be dating someone else exclusively, or if I was going to, that Stephanie and I should still be able to have sex. I was forceful and said that we couldn't.

Almost immediately, Ellen pulled away from me. It was a combination of finding out about the ex and just being a closed person. She was also younger (22 to my then 26) and wasn't really able to express herself in a way that would have allowed us to work through any issues. We went on a few more dates, but it was awkward, and between those dates I ended up sleeping with Stephanie once more (without telling Ellen).

Still pining after Ellen, still upset with myself about being unable to drop Stephanie, I went to a wedding as the platonic date of one of my friends. While I was there I met Hannah, who was there with a date, and also happened to be an old friend of the girl who I had come to the wedding with. Hannah and I talked, but I didn't feel like we really hit it off, merely that she was a fun person to flirt with even despite the (oblivious) boyfriend. I didn't even give her my number, not thinking that anything would come of it.

A few days latter, Hannah contacted me on Facebook and we started hanging out. I told her about the things that had happened with my ex, and that I had to get off of the cell phone contract with her, and what had happened with Jake.  Hannah and I started fooling around, then having sex, then dating. We got along extremely well, and both of us had been through near-marriage relationships that ended by being cheated on. We both fell in love incredibly quick.

Stephanie was still texting me, but I held off her advances, and finally (FINALLY) got her into the cell phone store to get off of her cell phone plane. The next day Stephanie texted me, saying something like ""I just want to end it all."" I thought this was a suicide text, and immediately called her. It wasn't, I had misinterpreted. 

That text was the last straw, I talked with Hannah and I talked with my therapist, and told them both that I felt like the best way for me to get closure would be to tell Stephanie that I was blocking her number, that she had hurt me too much, and that I had found someone who made me happy and wanted to be with just her. She sent me back some rage texts before I blocked her number, and I moved on.

It may seem fast, but within a few months I knew something that I had never felt with Stephanie: I never wanted to look at another woman aside from Hannah. Flirting with anyone else held no value for me. The addiction I had always struggled with, fighting for affection from the opposite sex, wasn't cured but its edge was certainly curbed. I proposed about three months into our relationship. A few days later, we found out-- to our joy-- that Hannah was pregnant. Hannah and I have now been married for two months, and our child is due in August.

NSFW ASIDE: Hannah prefers me to be the aggressor in bed (and I mean AGGRESSOR in all caps). She's very specific about what she wants, and isn't afraid to be vocal if she isn't enjoying something. This was new to me on all counts, and there were times when sexually we weren't on the same page and I felt inadequate. It was at these times when I would fantasize about Stephanie sexually, with whom I had established a pattern of mutual orgasm and satisfaction. Now Hannah and I are on the same page, and we have amazing sex. She loves to do it multiple times a day, and lets me do pretty much anything I want to her. Her ass, it must be added, is amazing. But she is such a DIFFERENT lover than Stephanie, that sometimes I daydream about her.

I wouldn't be thinking about Stephanie at all, though, if it weren't for what happened before my bachelor party. My best friend had come up for the event; we hadn't seen each other in years and he was going to be my best man. His wife was still friends with Stephanie and he told me, shortly before my party, that Stephanie was pregnant with Jake's kid. It took me by surprise, and it makes me more angry than I have any right to be that, by my math, she got pregnant by Jake within weeks of that ""I just want to end it all"" text. 

I think he's scummy for cheating on and leaving his wife and kids and impregnating someone almost a decade his junior. I think he's scummy for having met me and still going after my then-girlfriend. I think she's scummy for not talking to me about why she really wanted to kick me out. I think she's scummy for using me for comfort (physical and emotional) between her spats with Jake and then jumping right back to them when I reneged on that comfort.

But mostly, I'm selfish enough and addicted to female affection enough that I'm most hurt by the fact that she isn't still crying to herself that I won't talk to her anymore, and that she decided some guy who would leave his wife and kids is a better partner than me. 

It shouldn't matter, I'm absolutely in love with Hannah and I am so excited for our child to come into this world. I have good friends, I have a good job, and in general things are going well for me. But for some fucked up reason, it does matter that Stephanie isn't crumbled in a heap because of me. Sometimes I feel as though I should have been an asshole, told her family (who still don't know the details of Jake's life when he met Stephanie) the horrible details of what she did to me, plastered it onto her Facebook wall so her friends could see, and just in general burn her. Sometimes I wish I could still have sex with her. Sometimes I wish I could punch her in the face.

I can't say that I'm glad that it ended. I still sometimes feel frustrated and lost in all of it. I feel as though if Stephanie hadn't cheated and we'd had our wedding that I'd been in a similar place to where I am now, with a similar level of happiness, so I can't say this was ""for the better."" 

But I'm happy now because I've found a wonderful person who makes me happy and makes me feel in love and loved every day. I've learned from my mistakes, and I treat Hannah better in those small ways than how I treated Stephanie-- doing little things for her even when she hasn't asked for anything, putting her happiness above my own.

There are no answers here, no advice that I'm looking for (though I'll take any if you have it), no assuredness I've received from my experience or that I'm looking to receive from posting this. I just needed to get it all down on paper and look at it, to see what's happened without frills or rose-colored glasses.

Thanks for listening.

**TL;DR: After 7 years, my gf left me for a married coworker who had kids. Then left him and slept with me. Then I found my wife and felt good. Then I found out my ex got pregnant from the married coworker and felt bad.**"

Over the summer I've been working a co-op job for my university education (basically an internship, but paid well). Since the job is in the middle of nowhere (Northern Alberta oilsands), I stay in a camp; what a glorious experience it is. There is a fully equipped gym right down the hall, and as much of the type of food that a professional bodybuilder would eat as I want; food already prepared for me.

I counted it today, and on an average day I'll eat about 4000 calories (340g of protein) from egg whites, cottage cheese, tuna, greens, fruit, meat, meat, and more meat, etc. For reference, I'm 5'10"" and 190-195lbs. I also brought some creatine up here; one scoop before and one scoop after a workout. The funny thing is that I don't even work out as hard as I usually do due to exhaustion from 12-hour work days. 1 - 1.5 hour workouts max.

I thought it was pretty fucking crazy for me to gain that fast, as I've never been one to make huge gains in short times.

A little background information:

I've been out of school for almost a year now and I haven't been able to land too many interviews. I've had my resume critiqued by my professor, engineering professionals, as well as friends. I guess it's time to see what Reddit has to say. 

As of today I've submitted 170 applications to various engineering companies and organizations throughout my state. I've had a total of 3 interviews. Company A was a one and done interview, Company B had me come back for a second interview but I didn't get the job, and finally the interview with Company C was straight up bad. I've also tried to apply to as many internships as I can but a lot of companies want students.

In regards to my resume:

* I had a crappy GPA (&lt; 3.0) so that's why it's not listed.
*  I didn't have any jobs/internships/research/volunteer work while I was in school (yes I'm kicking myself for not getting an internship; I had to take summer school practically every summer)


So let me know what you think /r/resumes

However they told me right away that business casual wasn't necessarily required, but they don't want tennis shoes either. So the best I got from them was something between casual and business casual. (That's definitely what the women were wearing, some had jeans but it was still nice enough.) Any ideas on what that would be?? 

I tried looking at the other men for examples, but this company has 54 employees, 51 of which are women. Plus, the three guys were all in IT wearing jeans and tennis shoes.

Any ideas? Should I just stick with business casual? As an intern I figured it might not hurt to try and dress a little better in hopes of getting a job offer at the end."

My goal is to keep it under $1200, which seems like I have done. Ideally, I would like to be closer to $1000. I will be overclocking sometime in the future, but not ""near"" future. My question is: am I overspending on anything? Is there any price reductions I can make in without sacrificing performance too much? 

I went to Microcenter today and found that they have

Crucial Ballistix sport 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3-1600 Memory for $50. Is the $21 decrease worth it? Is this RAM terrible? 

I am also hoping to get a more portable case. I am moving in about a month for my internship, and moving (back) again in 4 months - so portability is very important. I would be willing to spend more for this. 

I also saw this: http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/thermaltake-case-vn40006w2n, a cheaper case and about 2 inches less w/l, which would be good. Any horror stories with this case?

1ebpa9,2,2013-05-14,Possible interview for an internship. Not sure how to prep?,brandnewaquarium,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ebpa9/possible_interview_for_an_internship_not_sure_how/,"Hi /r/jobs!  I am excited and nervous at the same time.

A friend has referred me for an internship with what we can call as my ""dream company"" - but I am not entirely what it entails and he said it is related to Android and Graphics..

A little background on the company:  they are a huge, world renown creator of high end computer parts and are very well respected. The only reason I am even being looked at is due to this referral - I have five years of work experience as a web developer, but well..  the internship pays equal (if not better) than what I make now and has benefits (which my job dies not).  Plus, it is this particular company on my resume with the possibility if a job there when I finish school.  I had applied for internships with them before and never made it to the interview.

So, as you can imagine, I am nervous.  I received word today that they will be bringing me in for an interview once they have a head count - I have no idea what that actually means.

Android and graphics - what should I look at for that?  And what does a ""headcount"" mean in HR terms?"

Hey all, after the success of my first post about the original 40 Champions I decided to continue the series. In this episode we'll look at the time period between launch and the end of the first competitive season, running from October 2009 to August 2011, nearly two years!

Because of the sheer amount of stuff I could talk about in that time, I'm limiting what this post covers; Nothing about bugs, champion balance or the high-end competitive scene. Removed content, such as a number of infamous items, will be covered in a separate installment.

And yes, I'm going to forget a few things. Please comment (nicely) if there's any interesting facts I left out!

----------------------
**Champions released during Pre-Season 1 and Season 1 (In order):**

(I'm not counting the original 40 champs - that post is linked at the top.)

(Pre-Season) Udyr, Nidalee, Poppy, Gragas, Pantheon, Mordekaiser, Ezreal, Shen, Kennen, Garen, Akali, Malzahar, Olaf, Kog'Maw

(Season 1) Xin Zhao, Vladimir, Galio, Urgot, Miss Fortune, Sona, Swain, Lux, LeBlanc, Irelia, Trundle, Cassiopeia, Caitlyn, Renekton, Karma, Maokai, Jarvan IV, Nocturne, Lee Sin, Brand, Rumble, Vayne, Orianna, Yorick, Leona, Wukong, Skarner, Talon


If they were organized according to their current positions in the SR metagame, it would look like this:

*Top:* Nidalee, Poppy, Pantheon, Mordekaiser, Shen, Garen, Akali, Olaf, Vladimir, Irelia, Renekton, Yorick, Wukong, Talon

*Jungle:* Udyr, Xin Zhao, Trundle, Maokai, Jarvan IV, Nocturne, Lee Sin, Skarner

*AP Mid:* Gragas, Kennen, Malzahar, Galio, Swain, Lux, LeBlanc, Cassiopeia, Karma, Brand, Orianna

*ADC:* Ezreal, Kog'Maw, Urgot, Miss Fortune, Caitlyn, Vayne

*Support:* Sona, Leona


And yes, I know certain champs like Kennen could go in other roles. Bite me.

----------------------

**Champion Pricing**

Poppy was released at the price of 1350 IP. She is the first and last champion to be released post-launch at that price point.

The vast majority of champions released during the game's first year were priced at 3150 IP. The last champion to be released at that pricepoint was Karma, at the very beginning of 2011. Since then, champions have either been released at 4800 or 6300 IP (Until recently when they became more expensive during their first week, though I would still consider them being released at 6k).

Only four champions have been released at the 4800 IP price point - Trundle, Jarvan IV, Orianna and Rumble.

----------------------

**Champion Trivia**

Nidalee is the only champion to have ever had an ability's cooldown reduction artificially throttled. Pounce (Cougar form's W) with enough CDR was deemed too powerful as it allowed her a huge amount of mobility and made her almost uncatchable. As such, Pounce was changed so that it was no longer affected by CDR. This change has since been reverted.

Ezreal's launch was... poorly received to put it mildly. He had a high learning curve and as such was perceived as being extremely weak - coupled with him being the first post-release champion priced at 6300 IP, his introduction into league caused a huge outcry from people who purchased him and felt they had wasted a huge chunk of IP/RP. This prompted Phreak (at that time an intern at Riot) to release the very first Champion Spotlight, detailing builds and strategies for Ezreal to show people what he was capable of - even scoring a kill on the mythical Jesse Perring.

Ironically, the current Ezreal is considered a strong pick, even though he's arguably weaker in almost every way to the launch Ezreal that caused so much backlash. Tier Lists FTW.

The first champion to have an auto-attack reset ability was Garen with his (Q)Decisive Strike. Before him, similar champion abilities such as Nasus' (Q)Siphoning Strike would simply apply on their next auto-attack, but Decisive Strike came out immediately once activated. It's still unclear if this aspect was intended behavior as it was removed and re-added several times in subsequent patches. The feel of Decisive Strike received a lot of positive feedback from Garen players, so Riot decided to add auto-attack resets to other similar abilities.

The first champion to be hotfixed for being overpowered was also the first champion released after launch: Udyr. After being in a rather mediocre state for a few months, Riot gave him a round of buffs but WAY overshot it. (Thanks to /u/2th for the correction!)

LeBlanc receives the dubious honors of being the first champion in the league launched in a state of such OPness that they hotfixed her a mere two days after her debut.

Lee Sin was also balanced with a hotfix within a week of launch, but for completely different reasons. Four days after he entered the League he was given a massive boost to all his AD ratios.

Another infamous character that had to be nerfed via a hotfix was... the minions. In March 2010 Riot had increased the late game power of minions in order to alleviate late game stalemates. However, when minions started taking down inhibitors unaided and even killing champions when in large numbers, Riot decided to tone them back a little.

----------------------

**Skins**

In addition to the annual Snowdown and Harrowing skins, there were a number of Olympics themed skins available in early 2010 to coincide with the Vancouver Winter Olympics. These include Vancouver Amumu, Team Spirit Anivia, Union Jack Fiddlesticks, The Mighty Jax, Festival Kassadin, Whistler Village Twitch, Curling Veigar and a legendary skin Ice Toboggan Corki.

In June of 2010 there were a several soccer/football themed skins available in honor of the FIFA World Cup, including All-Star Akali, Goalkeeper Blitzcrank, Striker Ezreal and Red Card Katarina.

The first several champions to be released after launch - Udyr,  Nidalee, Poppy, and Gragas - did not launch with skins. Nidalee would have a limited edition Snow Bunny Nidalee skin as part of the Snowdown Showdown shortly after her debut, and Poppy would have Noxus Poppy about a month after her release. The first champion to be released along with a skin was Pantheon, which was also the first champion/skin bundle for a new champion.

The first champions to have a combination champion/skin bundle were Teemo and Karthus, with their Phantom Karthus and Badger Teemo skins respectively. These combo packs were available for a very short time after launch.

The first skin to be retired from the store was Rusty Blitcrank, discontinued on January 17th 2010.

The first champion to receive unique splash art for their skins was Garen - All skin splashes before him were simply recolors of the basic splash art.

----------------------

**Maps**

Summoner's Rift originally had two different variations: The standard one and a winter themed one, which featured snow covered terrain and snowy particle effects. The winter version was further decorated for the Snowdown Showdown event to feature a host of Christmas-like decorations across the map. However a number of players reported performance drops on the Winter map, so it had mixed reception.

A Harrowing map was later added as a temporary alternate during October 2010, featuring spooky fog and orange/black brush, as well as a number of Halloween-like decorations. This map was so popular with the community that it later replaced the Winter version as the alternate version of Summoner's Rift.

Neither the Winter or Autumn maps are now available after the May 2012 graphical update.

A proposed map was revealed by Riot in September 2010: The Magma Chamber. Intended to be a new classic-style 5v5 map, Magma chamber was to be much bigger than Summoner's Rift and was supposed to emphasize spreading your team out to control the whole map rather than team fighting. The map also had an interesting aesthetic where half the map would be a cool, watery cave while the other half would be volcanic. After extensive playtesting, Riot decided to scrap the map for other ideas.

----------------------

**Lore**

Possibly the largest scale lore event that has or will ever take place was the Noxus vs Ionia Rematch. Hyped up for months by the Journal of Justice and Riot forum posts, it was fought on December 10th, 2010. A group of high-profile players were selected to represent each city state and selected their teams from a preselected pool of 10 champions corresponding to either side. The entire thing was done as a hardcore roleplaying event, with the casters even pretending to be Journal of Justice reporters - an example of this is when a player disconnected they said he ""was having problems with his summoner's orb"", and Roku (the team captain for the Noxus side) giving a post-game speech congratulation the Ionians on their hard won victory. The results of this battle were later made into a cannon part of the lore.

Demacia, despite being one of the biggest and most influential factions in the world of Runeterra, was totally unrepresented in the League until the release of Poppy in January 2010, who was an ambassador of the Yordles. The first true Demacian, Garen, was released in April of 2010.

An in-game news paper called the Journal of Justice was released periodically during Season 1, starting June 2010 and ending May 2011. It detailed the current events in the Runeterra universe, as detailed by a cast of fake media personalities. Besides providing updates on world events, it had a number of tabloid-like sections detailing the private life of League characters, interviews and Q&amp;A sessions with champions and a mailbag section where they'd answer player submitted lore questions. It was discontinued near the start of Season 2, as Riot stated they wanted to find a better way to convey the in-game lore.

Additionally, new champions released during season one had League Judgements written up about them. These detailed various champion's initiation ceremonies into the league, usually involving them reliving a pivotal moment in their life so that the viewing summoners could see their real motivations for joining the League. Judgements were released for all new champions up until the release of Graves, shortly after the end of Season 1. Since Graves, only Varus has received a League Judgement. Ryze also received a retroactive Judgement during Season 1.

----------------------

**Competitive Play**

It was originally intended that there would be a rotating pool of allowed champions for ranked play instead of having the entire cast available. The intent behind this was to reduce the number of champions a player would need to learn in order to be competitive and to adjust the champions available in case a particular strategy became too strong or popular. This idea has never been implemented however.

There was a battle of metagames between the North American and European server during the early stages of competitive League play. The NA style was more focused on late game team comps, where they'd place their AD carry in mid to farm up, AP carry top, have an aggressive initiator jungler and place whatever other champions they had bottom. This however led to a number of lost bottom lanes when facing against the EU style, as many times bot was just a ""throwaway"" lane where champions with little synergy or lane presence were put because they wanted them for late game. Ultimately the EU style of bruiser top, AP mid, AD/Support bot was adopted by the NA server as well and is still considered the standard team composition."
1ebmuz,3,2013-05-14,Going back for a master's degree in accounting. Need job advice.,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1ebmuz/going_back_for_a_masters_degree_in_accounting/,"I'll be graduating shortly with a degree in accounting from a university in the Northeastern United States. 

During my undergraduate career, I naturally applied for tons of tax internships (including Big Four stuff, plus some regional firms) and even had a few interviews, but I was a poor interviewer and nothing ever panned out properly for me. I've never gotten past the first round in most cases. Also, it didn't help that I didn't go to very many of the networking events they had on campus (my other jobs often got in the way).

Since then, I've gotten much better at interviewing and schmoozing with people, but unfortunately, these newfound skills came a bit too late in my case. 

Of course, I don't have a job related to accounting (still working a bunch of part-time retail jobs at the moment), so I decided to apply for and enroll in my university's MAcc program to get one last chance at on-campus recruiting this fall, get my thirty hours, and get a chance to sit for the CPA exam. 

Overall, my main interest is in tax, and at least for the networking events I've gone to, I've iterated this interest to a number of people. 

In the meantime, I've been applying for entry-level accounting jobs... But that hasn't been going very well, with a very low callback rate. I'm still waiting to hear back from one place (it's for an A/P position for a medium-sized software company), but I'm not very hopeful because I'm fighting at least a dozen other people for that one. 

Between now and the beginning of the fall recruiting season, what should I do? I've been thinking about reaching out to alumni from my school, setting up informational interviews with them, as my next step, in addition to applying for more entry-level jobs. How does that sound? One of my professors also recommends reaching out to recruiters as well, but I'm not sure how helpful that would be. 

**TLDR: I'm enrolling in a MAcc program in the fall, and need help figuring out my game plan towards getting a job offer in tax.**

*Addendum: If I am applying for jobs in the fall (with the Big Four et al), should I go for the winter internships, or go straight for full-time opportunities?*"
1ebmoc,1,2013-05-14,Got 700 for graduation...now what?,sexiibitch,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ebmoc/got_700_for_graduationnow_what/,"My initial thought was to put it towards bills to get them paid off faster. That way I can use the roughly 300/mth to put in a savings account to use for when I move out into an apartment in January with my SO. (Furniture, deposit, etc) 
But I'm beginning to wonder if I should just keep making my minimum monthly payments and tuck that 700 into savings now. 
For background, I have nothing in savings now because I barely make enough a month for bills and even then I scrape by sometimes needing to borrow for food and gas. Here's what I owe:
206/month for my car, I owe 1250 on it.
40/month on a closed credit card, owe 1090, this one has the highest interest.
40/month on another closed card, owe 1890 on it
Then I have my recurring bills (80/month phone, 85/month insurance, roughly 80/month gas)
My fear is that if i put it into savings now I'll start dipping into it for gas and groceries...I hate borrowing money. Then I'll be shit out of luck for when I move out.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated, if you need more specifics, don't hesitate to ask. 

Tl;dr: pay off bills now or save now? Or something else I haven't thought of?

Edit: I need to clarify that I graduated college...not high school. I have lived on my own before and made it work, but had to take a lower paying job to complete an internship. "

Would I have got that database development internship?

Would I have wanted to volunteer with that medical charity?

Would I have hated P.E. when I was back in school and would I still have been picked last all the time?

Would I have still been a chunky monkey?

Would I have told people I ""wasn't interested"" in going out with them on the weekend?

Think about it, anyone whackjob out there who goes 'hurr durr we need to cure autism cuz it's bad huehuehue'. Let's say they did... What if that autistic they just ""cured"" suddenly became public enemy #1 after you cured them? They start smashing phone-boxes, stealing, get into fights, throw their life down the toilet? Well you can't uncure them now can you?

2) I am not very interested in pharmaceutical research. What I would like to do is research brain/computer interfacing, for prosthetics etc. Or researching genetic engineering/gene therapy. (Not that I wouldn't take a pharma job, I just wouldn't want to do that permanently.) Does that count as Biotech, or Bioengineering?


3) I want to get an internship as soon as possible. Any tips on what researchers look for in applicants?

1eaxu4,1,2013-05-14,Not sure what to do,helpplzthrow,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1eaxu4/not_sure_what_to_do/,"So, for the past month I've been dealing with depression. Previous to that I was perfectly fine for about a year because shit was going up in my life. Suddenly, everything went downhill.

I wasn't getting internship. I wasn't getting jobs. I got rejected from a job I loved. I felt isolated and alone, hating my body. To top it all off, the thing that sent me down a shithole spiral from whence I had come, was my boyfriend breaking up with me.

I'm back in the depression I was in before this whole thing. It's been a month since we've been together, but now I'm just so depressed. I met a few guys, one went back to his state, another is not talking, and the last has stopped talking to me and I don't know why.

For the past three days I've been having a consistent anxiety attack so I took a Xanax. Once it wore off I was back to panicing, but now it's more intense and I'm having major mood swings. It's impossible.

I'm just so upset and defeated. I hate who I am. I'm overweight, 21 years old, and now I'm doing poorly in every aspect of my life. I don't want to be alive right now.

Are these mood swings normal? Why can't I get over this guy? Everything seems so pointless. I'll never find another man that seems to like this fat worthless piece of shit that I am. I thought we were in love, but fuck, I feel like I was the one falling and he just watched it happen.

1eaxe5,1,2013-05-14,First internship pay rate,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1eaxe5/first_internship_pay_rate/,"I just accepted my first internship at a consulting company with 300+ employees. My position title is Software Programming Intern. I was offered a pay rate of $12, which I immediately accepted because I did not have any other interesting offers (QA internship paid more, but did not sound rewarding). I've researched that the average pay for most CS majors is about $15 an hour.


I was wondering 1) was I in a position to negotiate pay rate for an internship? 2) If so, was I offered too low of a rate?


Some variables to consider: 
No previous industry experience, I was applying for my first internship.
2.97 GPA, did not include on resumes because it was just under 3.0


Any feedback would be appreciated. Thanks.

Update: The concenus seems to be that I was offered a low amount, thanks reddit. However, no one has seemed to answer my first question. Was I in a position to negotiate or just simply reject the offer and look elsewhere? Most of the feedback I've heard is that a majority of internship pay rates are non-negotiable, as you do not have much if any leverage as an intern."

I've interned for 1 year at a media/broadcast company (very well known). The way I for it was by meeting a guy a bar who is looking for a marketing MBA intern to look at TV ratings data and summarize findings/analysis. I interview and follow up. Likes me. Hires me. They like me while there. I stay another semester in market research. Then one more semester and move to brand strategy. I love it even more than insights so I decide to apply for a manager position in strategy. Have a year under belt, MBA focus in relevant field, great grades. 

Furthermore, i get along with the team real well. They always ask me to lunch and treat me like their work peer, despite being an intern. I work on strategy decks all the time and have become a ""go to guy"" for many directors in my department , bringing analytical and creative together and showing skillsets that some on my team don't have (excel and analytics). I introduce my own ideas, impress the directors and become close with then all. Come in early, leave late - never miss a day that I can work. All over the course of 12 months. All is good on my end.

6 weeks ago I intern with HR. They like me. Fast forward today. Find out I have a few more brief interviews with some members of my team and our no-bullshit VP. I feel prepared but what will they ask me in these 30-40 minutes? How can I absolutely nail it given that they now what I'm capable of and know how hard I work?

I see other candidates coming in and also interviewing and what scares me is this position prefers 5+ years experience and these people all have more than me since I'm relatively young. I only have 3 years, but 1 is at this company and I feel my MBA must count for something, right? Why am I nervous about this despite me being that typical internal hire who usually beats the outside competition? 

What can I do to absolutely nail these brief interviews? I am bringing a portfolio of my work and plan to let that do the talking and only answer what they ask me ( no digressing)

Is there any additional advice someone has to calm my nerves? This is the biggest opportunity if my life, I interview well, am friendly and very articulate - I'm just a bit freaked that so much is weighing on this because I've worked so hard over the last 12 months and am not sure about my competition. 

Anything helps Jobbit. Thanks. "
1ealq3,0,2013-05-13,For Those With Crazy Lives: You're Not Alone,OthersideGraffiti,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ealq3/for_those_with_crazy_lives_youre_not_alone/,"The last few years of my life have been rather rough. Bear with me, my story gets a little crazy.

During high school my mother cheated on my dad, and fell into a rapid downwards spiral of suicidal depression and alcoholism my senior year. After almost losing her multiple times to suicide attempts, losing a girl I cared everything about because she couldn't deal with my problems, and doing badly in school and football I became extremely depressed. I quit going to school for a month, lost a ton of weight, and wouldn't speak to hardly anyone. Eventually I just lost it, as I am a perfectionist and couldn't handle not being able to fix all of these uncontrollable things in my life. One night, I choose to crash my car into a tree I was so frustrated. At the last moment, I decided to slow down, and despite totaling my car emerged unscathed from the incident. It was the biggest mistake of my life and am something I am so ashamed of, since I am usually a strong person.That was two years ago.

My life started getting better a couple months down the line, when I found out I got into the university of my dreams. However, still somewhat depressed, I began smoking weed all the time as a way of escape. After a particularly rough summer where my mother got arrested for striking me and no longer being on speaking terms with her, I left for the university ready to begin my new life.

My first week at my university, I rushed the best frat on campus, and was offered a bid to join. Not really thinking about what I was getting into, I gladly accepted. This was the start of nearly two years of extreme drug and alcohol abuse for me. Starting with weed, I quickly moved up to hallucinogens, pills, coke, pretty much anything I could get my hands on. I would regularly drive drunk, and would black out multiple times a week. Eventually I stopped going to class, which of course resulted in me failing one of my courses. While this was all going on I forgave my mother and rekindled a relationship with her. It was probably the only good thing I had done in a couple of years.

Five months ago, I realized that if I continued to live the way I was living, I wouldn't live to 25. I'd been seeing a therapist for months for PTSD caused by my high school experience but I was ready to make the steps I needed to live. I moved out of the frat house, cut ties with all of my drug buddies, got focused on school again, and tried my best to fix my relationships with the members of my family and my old friends who I had neglected. 

Today, I sit here typing this post as almost a new person. I've been relatively sober since I started making these changes, got on anti-depressants, and am starting to feel like life is normal for me after so many years. I've gotten great grades the last couple quarters, have started making new friends, and got a great internship for the summer.

I've come so far, and I'm remarkably normal considering all of these things that have happened to me. I'm a very nice, good looking, sociable guy, who's just made some terrible mistakes and has had bad things happen to me. Most people don't even know about any of my problems, since I don't like to talk about them and I don't act like my life is so crazy. 

So today, I decided to write this post because it is something that I would never usually do. I'm the last person to talk about my problems, even to my friends I've known my whole life. But through all of these terrible experiences, I'm thankful that I've been so fortunate to turn my life around. So I guess I want to tell people my story, so they know that there's people out there who can relate and who turned their lives around and made things good again. This is the first time I've written a honest account of my experiences.

1eabqe,5,2013-05-13,Mrs. Silvir,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1eabqe/mrs_silvir/,"Being in an AP Psychology class, I've had to volunteer and interview multiple psychologists and psychiatrists in my area. These meetings usually followed up with writing a 5 page essay the night before it was due. None of it was ever interesting, the therapists I met with never had anything interesting to offer me. 
This was until I was actually offered an internship. Of course, I jumped at the chance, knowing how rare it was for a high school student to come across the opportunity of an actual internship in a field that I actually wanted to pursue. I accepted. The internship began late April. I was to go every Wednesday and Thursday afternoon.
It was a pretty small clinic for those who I can only describe as ""unable to function on their own"". I don't refer to it as an insane asylum as most of the people I'm around I find to be actually pretty normal, aside from the random bouts of anxiety or fear. Of course since I don't actually have any qualifications or degree to closely work with the patients too much, I'm usually just filing papers and running errands. But once in a while, Dr. Pinner (one of the head psychiatrists, also the one that offered the internship) allows me to sit in on a patient session.
These sessions usually consisted of me introducing myself and then sitting to the side and taking notes for a good 30 minutes to an hour. Most of the time the conversations I sat in on were uneventful, although I still enjoyed just being there. So far I’ve met with 6 patients. No need to tell you about the first five, since there’s nothing very interesting to say, but patient number six. That’s who I’m going to tell you about today in the hopes that I can find some comfort, or some advice I guess, too.
Last Thursday for the half hour before I was to leave (around 6 pm, I believe), Dr. Pinner once again invited me into his office. It’s become more frequent now, these invitations. I guess he thinks I’m doing a good job, but either way, I’m not sure I want to go back anymore. 
He told me that I’d be meeting a new patient. Mrs. Silvir. She had PTSD (although I wasn’t told what from), several phobic disorders, and severe schizophrenia. He left the room to bring the patient in, and I pulled out my phone to quickly check my texts (what can I say, I’m a teenager). As he came back into the room I jumped and shoved my phone back into my bag. When I looked up I saw Dr. Pinner holding the arm of an older woman. There was something uneasy about her, although I couldn’t really put my finger on exactly what it was. Her hair was dark and matted, but her eyes were light blue. So light blue…  almost white. It was kind of startling, in fact. Her shoulders were slightly hunched and she wore frailed, slightly dirty clothes. Her lips were thin, and dry. She glared at me with the weirdest look… I can’t even explain. Although I hesitated for a good 10 seconds, I mustered the courage to get up to shake her hand and introduce myself. “Hi Mrs. Silvir, I’m Presley. I’ll just be sitting in on this session, I hope you don’t mind. It’s really nice to meet you.” I reached out my hand and she pulled back. Her glare turned into a twisted smile. “Hi there Presley. Nice to finally meet you too.” Her voice was dry, quiet. 
Although this session was one of the most nerve wracking sessions I’ve sat in on, I’ll leave that for later. 
After the session, Dr. Pinner informed me that he just had to go consult with another nurse and that he’d be back in a minute. What he didn’t tell me was that he’d be leaving Mrs. Silvir with me. Alone.
She faced opposite from me, sitting in the couch, looking out of the office window. In an attempt to break the nervous silence, I tried to make small talk with her. Bad idea. “So I just wanted to make sure I have your name right. Mrs. Silvir, right? I’m pronouncing it correctly?” Her head turned slowly in my direction. She leaned in close to me. My skin crawled with unease. “I know who you are. You might not know me but oh, I know you sweetie.” Her voice was different. It was almost theatrical. Her words curled up into faint shrills. I didn’t know how to respond, so I just let out a nervous giggle and forced a smile. “I see you sleep at night. I see you trying to force yourself into slumber. But you can’t right? You think you see things in the dark. Such an innocent little girl. I see you turn on the lights when you think you hear shuffling in the corner. Coming closer… closer to the edge of your bed in the dark.” I was frozen in place. “I see you all the time. I saw you undressing yesterday. I saw your pretty new panties. All light pink and lacy. Even a bow to top off the pretty little girl.” She let out a giggle. “I see you everyday but you never seem to want to say hi to me. That’s not very nice.” Her voice turned deep, angry. “Oh and next week is your birthday too isn’t it. All grown up. No worries, I have a nice present for you. I’ll leave it where you can find it. I hope you like it. You better like it. It’s from me and I spent a good amount of time choosing it. Just. For. You.”
The door clicked open as Mrs. Silvir snapped back up, her face staring out the window once again, like nothing had happened. Dr. Pinner walked in and escorted her out of the office. I was shaking. I didn’t know what had just happened. I couldn’t move. Dr. Pinner walked back into the office and stopped midway. “Is everything alright? You look a bit shaken. I know that was a pretty heavy session…” “No, no. Nothing like that. I’m just tired.” I replied. “Oh, alright then. Well it’s about time anyways for you to be out, so why not just go ahead, I’ll sign you out.” “Oh… okay, thanks, Dr. Pinner.”
The rest of the night I spent going over that occurrence in my mind. I haven’t been able to fall asleep since then. And the scariest part of it all is that what she said was true… I do get scared at night. Like a kid. Probably mostly due to the massive amounts of time I spend on nosleep and creepypasta. And as privacy ridding it is to admit… I did have new panties…. Pink ones. 
I don’t know what to do. I’ve been looking over my shoulder uneasily for the past 6 days. And tomorrow is my time at the office, once again. I don’t know…. Please someone tell me what I should do.

My goal is to keep it under $1200, which seems like I have done. Ideally, I would like to be closer to $1000. I will be overclocking sometime in the future, but not ""near"" future. My question is: am I overspending on anything? Is there any price reductions I can make in without sacrificing performance too much? 

For example, I went to Microcenter today and found that they have

Crucial Ballistix sport 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3-1600 Memory for $50. Is the $21 decrease worth it? Is this RAM terrible? 

I am also hoping to get a different case, maybe something more portable. I am moving in about a month for my internship, and moving (back) again in 4 months - so portability might be good. I would be willing to spend more for this. 

I would really appreciate any feedback. I'm real nervous since it's my first time! Thanks in advance.

1ef0w4,1,2013-05-15,Should I leave my job,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ef0w4/should_i_leave_my_job/,"I'm a 23 year old college graduate (econ/international relations). After a very fulfilling few years in college internships, which gave me a great resume, I have found my first full time position in an institution of higher education.

However, the office environment/morale is extremely negative, the person who works above me is not the best manager or communicator (little training compared to the complexity of the tasks at hand), and I'm 100% sure I don't want a career in my particular department in higher education.  The problem is I started in January of this year and I'm worried it will look bad on me to leave after a few months and also that my employer would be extremely upset-even though I'm sure they think I'm a bad fit for the job. I have offered to help out colleagues in other departments to widen my skill set while I'm here. Realistically speaking, I couldn't leave any time soon but the thought of staying here another year just squashes my soul.

On top of all of that, the person above me (my unofficial boss) got into a screaming match with our head accountant because he wanted her to lie to the IRS by signing as a third party appraiser on a transaction conducted between our university and an individual making a non-monetary donation. The accountant was very alarmed, refused and told me to speak to her if this ever happened again. After that I have no idea if I can trust him even slightly, if he was willing to break the law so carelessly. How can I protect myself from becoming involved in those kind of semi-illegal situations? If I can't even trust the people I work with the most will I be able to make a significant contribution to this employer, or am I just wasting my time?"
1eev2x,1,2013-05-15,"I'm Helpless, now Hopeless....",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1eev2x/im_helpless_now_hopeless/,"I'm posting this on Reddit, this specific subreddit, because I think I'm officially giving up on life.  Bitching on the Internet has done nothing for me, but because I know there's nowhere else to go I might as well engage in this behavior.  All the pain, all the loneliness and all the nothingness has taken its toll on me.  My enemies have won, they've finally conquered me, though it took them years they ultimately won this war of attrition.

At first I thought, “Maybe Reddit can really help me, like give me exactly what I need to fix things,” but it's pathetic of me to even think of such nonsense.  And before anyone says to me, “You have to help yourself,” I personally hope your kidneys get ripped out for even uttering such words.  I'm not a superhero, nobody is, and I've helped plenty of people throughout my life...I haven't gotten the same in return.  Nobody can make it in this world alone, and those who do sacrifice too much to be considered “persons” anymore.

Maybe it's the way I look, maybe it's my aura, maybe it's just how I am, but for whatever reason people just don't want to give me that helping hand.  Not friends, not family – nobody!  I wish someone would tell me why I don't deserve this, is it because I'm unlikeable, am I unattractive, am I stupid, do I give you a bad feeling?  Now I know this is the part when somebody thinks, “Nobody deserves anything,” yes, let's think that way, so our society turns into all of us living in selfish bubbles instead of a functional, adapting community!

As a matter of fact, I'm so against the notion of our species living in self-serving, blissful bubbles that I've sacrificed things in the hope of fixing this problem.  I once had a dream that would bring me happiness, but shit happened and I'd much rather do something greater.  The only problem is my words are empty as I've got nothing to start and nobody by my side.  I know what I want to do in my extremely long-term goal of changing the world, but I don't care anymore about taking that first step.  And honestly, why should I when this journey is so soul-sucking and lonely?

My only way to cope with things is to not think about them, to ignore them – and I'm sick of doing this.  For the past few days I've been watching these TV documentaries about famous mobsters, about how cold, calculating and efficient they are, how machine-like they are – am I going to have that kind of mentality in a few years?  No, I won't commit any crimes, but will I only care about money and power while not being capable of knowing love or affection?  Due to my coping mechanism I'm already emotionally-detached, or “dead on the inside” as I like to call it...AND IT FUCKING SUCKS!

It seems the only way for me to survive is to become more machine-like, to lose all my humanity until there's nothing there, until I don't care about anyone or the world around me long as my goal is achieved.  The only reason why I'm such a failure now is because for years I've been trying to stop my soulless conversion from happening.  Some days I wish I was truly a machine so at least I would get things done, rather than being the worthless shell-of-a-human I currently am.

Everything is pretty bad for me.  I have no job and sure as hell won't get one after being unemployed for 9 months, jobs I'm qualified for won't respond, retail places never contact me, temp agencies have been no use, part-time places won't contact me, some internships won't even contact me.  Sure, I can volunteer and maybe if I'm lucky after a few months that will turn into a job, but the world runs on money and not goodwill.  Aside from that, I'm too prideful to play this stupid game and be at the mercy of employers.  Honestly, I'd rather die broke than kiss ass for that first paycheck.  You can disagree with my attitude, but if more people thought like me instead of being ready to bend-over-backwards shit wouldn't be this bad.  

Oh, but it gets worse because I'm 28 and I still live with my parents – I'm just a loser all around!  Sorry, there's no paragraph here because that one sentence says enough.

Aside from being an unemployed loser, I'm completely unfulfilled emotionally and physically.  I know women read this subreddit, and they certainly don't want to be with someone in my shoes.  They'd much rather be with someone who's got stability and structure rather than someone with nothing.  Hell, I'm sure I'm one ugly-motherfucker, because nobody has ever said I look attractive.  But don't worry ladies, when my soul is finally gone and I truly become a machine, I'll use y'all for sex than throw you away when I'm bored – it's not because I'll hate women, it'll be because I truly won't care anymore.  

Some people here might try to give me advice, but don't bother.  Unless you can actually do something real for me, something useful (and I bet you can't because people who know me in real life sure as hell can't) your words are empty.  From now on I'm only going to bitch on the Internet until I rot or until I'm no longer human.

There is no help for me, there is no hope for me...."

1eeokb,3,2013-05-15,It's only been a year... (reflective post inside),[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1eeokb/its_only_been_a_year_reflective_post_inside/,"I'm abroad for part of this summer, so on my flight over, I came to thinking a lot (and am now going to blabber because I want to share). I'm surprised - I've changed so much in so little time. In the past year as a second-year at college, I've not only found out a lot about myself as a person, but I've come to embrace who I am.  

Last year when I started school, I was overly socially aware. I thought everyone was looking at me always. I was convinced that everyone was looking at me, saying negative things about me; even if I were just getting lunch from a dining hall, I believed that classmates were thinking that I was a loser with no friends. Now, I have changed. I am less socially anxious (though I still have my insecurities, though I am working on them), I’ve learned to not care about what others think as much - not just convincing myself that I don’t care, but actually not being affected by my anxiety. I've started to embrace everything about myself. I am an introverted person. My idea of fun is to sit outside and read a really good book. I've come to understand that I don't need to change that about myself. I've always over-stressed about having friends, thinking I need to be more outgoing but honestly? Not true. I have my very close friends, intro- and extroverts alike, and they are the most amazing people I have met. They push me to be a better person, do things I otherwise might not, and accept me for myself as I am. They're honestly inspiring.

I've always assumed I was just not a passionate person and so would never be really into anything. This semester, I took an anthropology class I was close to dropping due to the high level and ridiculous workload, but decided last minute to keep it. It was life changing. Not only did I find something I LOVE, but I've gained a new respect for my capabilities as a student and writer. I've never thought of myself as good at anything or able to take on a big work load, but with the extensive amount of reading and writing required for this one class, I garnered a new appreciation for my talents. 

A few months ago, I had no idea what I would be doing over the summer. All around me, classmates were getting positions in the DC area, medical centers, other amazing research opportunities. I had been eying an internship forever, yet due to my over thinking, forgot to apply until two days late (I can be a perfectionist and thus was still working on my cover letter the day I realized the application was late). Through networking, I was able to move my application to the top of the pile. And even though I was late, I got the position at an ivy league institution. I also got asked to hold another awesome internship position. I never expected things to pan out as amazing as they did.

Today, I got an email from the studies abroad office at my school informing me that I had permission to study at my dream school next spring (which they don't usually grant since I want to study at a university that does not have the same mission as my small liberal arts school). I had submitted the application in the midst of hell week, yet was determined to do it. And it all worked out.

Though I still have a long way to grow both personally and academically, I am really ecstatic about the amount of positive change that has happened in just the last year. I know a year sounds like a long time, but it really hasn’t felt that long at all. I’m still in awe over how much I’ve developed as a person, and am really excited to see what else is in store in the future.

I know this was a long post/bit of a brag but I just wanted to share. For all those struggling right now, one thing I have learned is that things work out. Things will fit together eventually, just keep pulling through. Had anyone told me last year that all this would happen, I would have laughed. Never would I have thought that I would have such amazing opportunities as I ended up getting - nor would I have thought that I would find something that I love. I am confident that things will work for you too. "

I'm also the general office go-to guy for any problems that arise that don't cleanly fall into one department

Since coming onboard I have also streamlined the purchasing process, and implemented several features that reduce overnight, and ease departmental coordination. 

I was originally brought on at about $17k a year, but have worked my way up to about 30k, with my last raise being in August of last year, shortly before I took on the intern training position.

I'm thinking of asking for a raise, but I have no idea if that's reasonable or not. Would anyone else in a similar position care to weigh in?"
1eegd3,3,2013-05-15,Negotiating fair compensation as an early hire at a startup,programmerdood,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1eegd3/negotiating_fair_compensation_as_an_early_hire_at/,"I am just going to preface this by saying I don't completely understand the dynamics and business side of an early stage start up which leads to my question.

I am a programmer that will be finishing up my CS undergrad degree next year. I was hired as a contract programmer for a startup. Another friend of mine was also hired at around the same time as me so we are the first workers there besides the founders. The current state of the company is we have operational funds for the next 6 months already lined up, a couple potential licensing/consulting agreements we are following up on, and are in early talks with several more investors who seem to be very interested.

So far it has been a great deal for a college student with flexible hours, competitive pay even compared to good computer science internships in the area, and I have learned a lot. Lately the other programmer and I have been questioning whether our work is being valued appropriately within the company. 

The cofounders were technical founders, but after me and my friend started working the technology quickly grew beyond their abilities. I personally have come to take control of a lot of product management responsibilities and have the final say in design and development decisions.

Me and the other main programmers compensation for our work has been around $20 an hour in addition to $20 an hour in options each. Over the last year or so we each have acquired options for roughly 0.75% of the shares of the company. The founders and even advisors who only help us occasionally have significantly more.

I don't want to cause equity struggles within the company, but I want to get some idea as to whether my work is getting fairly compensated so that if the company grows I'm not tossed aside or cheated. The going rate for a developer with my particular skill set is a six-figure salary, granted I don't have the experience or credentials to command that kind of salary, but I think that I would be close and for sure more than I currently make. 

To me it looks as if my work may not be valued appropriately, but because I have no idea how people are usually compensated using equity and options I have no idea how to read my situation. Does this seem like a reasonable compensation to other redditors out there? If I was to have a discussion with the founders about the value I add to the company what should I say or ask about to help. Any advice from people who were early hires at a start up?

Sorry for the vagueness, but I would rather not post identifiable information on here for obvious reasons. Thanks for helping me out!

*TL;DR*: What is a fair share of equity/pay for an early tech-startup hire?

EDIT: clarity

I have been in and out of college for 10 years (god sounds terrible writing that).  I've held good paying and high experience qualifying jobs throughout, management, using excel etc.  About a year ago I found out about being an actuary and got into it.  I studied on my own and passed P and am sitting for FM in August.  I am also currently in a summer internship with a large insurance company.  I am still probably 2 full years away from actually getting a Bachelors in actuarial science.  I know that passing exams and getting experience are the biggest factors that people look for.  Is it possible that with multiple exams passed, an internship, and lots of other relevant experience I could get into the career without the degree or am I looking at definitely having to wait the two more years of schooling to get going?

tl:dr - Multiple exams passed, internships and experience in field but 2 years from degree, do I have to drag it out those two years before getting a job?"

The idea is to create a non profit organization in which we make dreams come true, it'll be called The Dream. We take donations and put it towards someones dream, no matter how big or small they will be somewhat randomely picked. Everytime you want to submit your dream, you would have to donate a dollar, USD, or more if you'd like. Since my dream, is to help other people fulfill their dreams, I think this would be great. However, we need a website to start off, so I was wondering if anyone would be willing to make us a website? I would try to pay you as much as possible, but since this is a charity, it would b hard. After getting off the ground, when we start getting noticed more, you would be getting paid, and it would basically be a job. So consider this an internship, I suppose. Anyone want to?

1ee9mk,1,2013-05-15,Summer Solstice + Self Love= Your Recipe for Happiness,mrisa,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ee9mk/summer_solstice_self_love_your_recipe_for/,"The celebration of the relationship between our sun and planet is around the corner. Let’s emulate how ancient cultures show appreciation for this time by honoring the love within us.

Throughout time, songs have been sung, poems have been composed, and volumes upon volumes have been written about Love.  Without a doubt, love is as critical as air and water.  

So this Summer Solstice, Beyond Body Mind Spirit (BBMS) invites you to explore and expand your world of Love into Self Love.   Try this exercise. 

Right now close your eyes for a moment. Visualize your body as a gateway opening to release the thoughts and feelings within you.  Now ask yourself, “What does happiness mean to me?”  Take a few moments.  Allow every thought and feeling to be expressed, using whatever device is at hand.

When I tried this exercise, I realized the majority of my responses were about my desire to help the other people in my life. I believe this is an admirable quality.  Perhaps you, like me, were taught,  “do onto others …”  as children.  Yet as I read through my list of answers, I realized what was missing was how I create my own happiness through my actions towards me.

And that’s what BBMS asks you to consider- all the ways to support you, care for you, make wiser decisions for you, have compassion for you, and unconditionally love you.  As my experience suggests, learning how to love yourself requires these quiet moments and a teacher to help you explore what’s inside. 

Self Love is just ONE aspect of happiness.  At BBMS, we help you “Enjoy Healthy” in its fullest sense and add yoga, meditation, and nutrition.  

Over the next few weeks, I will explore the other 3 aspects with you. 

So begin by commenting about your thoughts on happiness to keep this conversation going.  Then infuse your vision of happiness into your Summer Solstice practice and revel in your creation.

P.S. Add your comments and let’s blow the roof off our experience of Self Love. 

P.P.S. Like us on Facebook.

So I've always had a problem with the things that come out of my mouth. I tend to offend people without meaning to, and I generally come off as a mean, unfriendly bitch (with a lot of unnecessary flamboyance and drama). If you can, imagine that one person who's always loud, mean and generally obnoxious. Somehow I still have friends, but I feel they tolerate me more than truly enjoy spending time with me. 

It's also starting to affect my work. For example today, I made a remark that I feel may have offended someone and given them a bad impression of my work ethic as an intern (I was being berated for having appointments overlap by 10 minutes, to which I replied that I had to wait for X, a senior staff, to pass me his work before I could do mine). I meant to, and hopefully did, say it in a joking manner but I suppose it might have been construed as me pushing the blame on someone else, since my default facial expression is 'grumpy and always-looking-for-a-fight'.

I realise I shouldn't have made that remark in the first place, but upon further reflection, I probably do this more often than I realise. I find it difficult to recognise where the joking boundaries are, which is doubly hard for me since my jokes probably don't come across as such (ah, the pitfalls of sarcasm). 

My question: What sort of person do people like to work/hang out with and how can I become that person? Any tips for me to give people a good impression? I also want to make this change last long term, so any advice is welcome! Please, if I'm unclear in my post, ask me to clarify! "
1edtkd,6,2013-05-15,Target Date Break Even ROI for Graduate Degree,loopy212,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1edtkd/target_date_break_even_roi_for_graduate_degree/,"I've been thinking about pursuing a graduate degree and am trying to evaluate the effect of such on my personal financial situation.  Please note that the following is gross of tax.

My current income is $80k base with a variable bonus component.  For the sake of the analysis, I've estimated the bonus at $5k, which is somewhat low (received a $15k bonus last year), but I'd expect to receive at least that each year.  My career is in a bit of a weird place, so I've modeled salary growth a few different ways.  I've shown flat 2% growth indefinitely (that's probably low in the short term and high in the long term) and two stage growth with 5% growth in the short term tapering off to 2% growth long term (current career has a salary ceiling).  It's highly likely that I will switch out of my current area in the next 1-2 years taking a potential pay cut (MBA notwithstanding), which I haven't modeled.

The program I am looking into is a two year, full time program with a paid internship over the summer bridging the two years; standard full-time MBA program.  I've estimated the all-in costs to be $75k per year.  Tuition runs between $55k and $65k with housing and living expenses being a variable; I came up with $75k as a somewhat conservative estimate; every school I am looking at except Boston schools will probably be below this.

Internship expected salary is $15k.  Post-graduation, the median salary of the weakest school I am applying to is ~$115k with a median $20k signing bonus; this is the baseline for all my salary projections, but there is a big upside, if I get into H/S/W it would be more like $160k base + $30k bonus.  I'm assuming no other bonuses in the out years, but post-MBA the bonus potential is much higher than my current career.  Also looked at two different scenarios, a 5% flat post-MBA salary growth and a 5% growth for 5 years declining to 2.5% after that.

For discount rate, I'm assuming 4% (7% interest rate for student loans less 3% inflation).

Based on the above outlined terms, I am looking at between 8 and 9 years to achieve break-even ROI between getting an MBA and staying in my current career.  To me, that seems like a long time to get to break even, but I'm not sure what a ""normal"" break even period is for graduate degrees.  

I feel like there is something I am missing here because basically it doesn't seem to make much sense to get my MBA from a financial perspective.  I'm hopeful there is just something I am missing here.

TL;DR What is an acceptable break even time for professional graduate degrees?"

I don't know if this is the right place to ask, but I'm in a really bad place and I need to vent. If this post doesn't belong here then downvote or please let me know where I can ask instead.

I've known this girl for 8 years now. About a year before graduating from school and going to University we started going out, having been best friends before that. I had the best 3 and a half years of my life until she broke up with me a couple of days ago. Now I'm feeling a bit scared for the future, since she was the only person I could ever talk to.

Ever since I was a kid, I've been very closed emotionally and have never opened up to anyone. When my gf first broke up with me I felt very lost and afraid, because I needed to talk to someone about this but she was the only person I had. I've never been that close to my parents, and with my close friends I just talk about stuff that interests us. She was the first one I could actually open up to and not feel afraid or embarassed; she would offer good advice and help.

The thing is I caved in and called her afterwards and she was very eager to help me get through this, and be there for me. That is a great thing about her. The problem though is she lives in a different city, and I am currently stuck living with my mum and sister doing an internship I hate, when all of my friends are at university.

I also feel I need to get some distance from her to be able to get over this healthily. I don't want to depend on her anymore, yet I have no-one I can really turn to in this moment. I'm very depressed and I'm trying very hard to be strong and look positively to the future but I keep thinking about how much has been thrown away with this relationship and it is haunting me. All of my clothes, posters in my room, belongings are either from her or in some way relate to her. There are too many memories that I can't stop clinging on to.

The breakup was very sudden and I didn't really see it coming. Can someone offer some advice or share a similar experince? It would help me immensely.


**EDIT:** Thank you all so much for your responses, I actually feel much better and more positive in my mind! I'm gonna try and minimise contact with her for a while, and go out and be pro-active!"

I'm 23 years old, 1 year out of college. 

I've not gotten along with my mother because she didn't raise me from when I was 5-10 and is not the most verbally affectionate person, but now I realize how much she cares for me. My single mom's paid for half of my educational costs despite her hating her job.

And fast forward to me, who has been mooching off of her-- I've been fired from 1 job after 5 months, quit an internship 2 weeks in without notice after realizing I am not fitting in, and taking on a minimum wage customer service job to be a better people person. I am struggling financially.

I feel very guilty for not landing a good job after college. My mom's been taking care of my grandmother who is severely depressed (she came to the US to raise me). My Dad's not in the picture because he and decided to live with his mom to evade debt in the US when I was 12.

I'm scared that I'm turning out like my dad. Leaving commitments and I only have a few friends at a time in my life. 

I've stayed at my college town for 5 years. The school is definitely a reach school and I would not have gotten there without my Mom pushing me. 5 years of studying and almost dropping out, came out with a degree I don't care much about with a 2.9 GPA. 

No big network of friends and I think I'm pissing away my youth at my Mom's expense. I'm thinking of working at the oil fields in middle America to pay my educational debts or maybe moving back home to help my grandmother. 

TLDR; led sheltered life, can't hold down a job, burn bridges, have few friends, don't want to end up like my dad and grandma who don't have a support network. I feel like a robot that doesn't see the consequences of what I do to other people. How can I change?"

I am almost 22 year old, male, I've been in relationships before and had some flings with different girls over the years, but never felt complete. I could never find what I was looking for, and things never worked. When I went to college, it was in a terrible city and I hated everything about it. My 3rd year in, I hit a low point of partying, and mild depression. I met a girl at work, 21, and we quickly hit it off. Things literally took off. We both said to take things slow, and we did, but at the same time everything just went so fast.

We didn't have sex until about 2 months into being exclusive, despite spending almost every night together. We grew closer and closer together, and we have undoubtedly fell in love. **We've only been together for 3 months now.** In retrospect, that isn't much time at all. We've talked about it, and we both agree **it has felt like 10 months** or so. We've talked about marriage, our future together, engagement, budgeting, everything of that nature. It seems fast, logically, but it doesn't feel fast.** I love her, she loves me**, and I've never been happier. 

**I've found the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.** I'm the kind of guy to think long and hard about things. I hate commitment, and I hate the idea of being locked into something. But without a doubt, I want to marry her. She said if I proposed, she'd definitely say yes. Though she wants us to wait at least a year so her family would be more accepting to the idea.

**We spend every night together.** With an occasional 1 night apart due to exams or something. I've met her immediate family, and they all like me. I've met her cousins, whom she is close to. They like me. She's met my immediate family, same situation.


**What is the problem?**

**1.** We have events within the near future that will cause long separations. The closest one being a summer internship. I'll be moving 5 hours away, renting a room from one of her cousins in the city. **I won't get to see her all summer.** It is going to be painful physically and emotionally for both of us. She is seemingly confident of the situation, absolutely sure we'll power through it together. I've seen long distance relationships first hand, and I'm afraid she isn't fully aware of the situation and she will slip away from me. **I've talked to her directly about it, but she gets upset, she says ""I don't like that you don't have confidence in us."". I know we'll make it through the time, but I'm afraid it will damage the structure.** 

With that, there is a foreseeable problem in about a year where I'll graduate but she'll have another year, along with specialization schooling. It could cause another 1-4 years of separation depending on the circumstances. Due to the time between then, I'm mainly looking for advice in regards of the current summer separation.

**2.**
We are completely comfortable together now. The things we aren't fully comfortable with, we are slowly working on. I can notice us both getting more relaxed with things. However, **I still feel like it is the first date every time I see her.** I'm not sure if that is a good or bad thing. But basically, **I have that constant feeling of pressure that I need to always impress her**. As if I am still trying to win her over. I don't know why, but it is always there. **It is stressful.** Any ideas on why that is, what it is, how I can fix that, etc?



**TL;DR is in bold.**

My goal (which is admittedly a moving target) is to be **semi-retired by 55**.  If I am lucky, I think I would like to switch to a light teaching schedule at a local college when I reach 55 in order to provide steady income and keep my mind active.  Until then, I expect to work in industry.

---Near-Term Goal---

I would like to get married within a couple years, and **buy a house within 3-5 years**.  I have done some initial research and think I can find a home around $150,000-$200,000 for starting a family which I will be very happy with.  I will assume for the sake of planning that we will be starting a family in 5-6 years. 

---Relevant Info---

My **base salary is $99,000** with annual bonuses that **add another 8%-12%**.  Since I have no retirement savings right now, I want to be somewhat aggressive in saving for retirement.  My plan is to contribute **6% to traditional 401k*** (company matches full up to 3%) and **use the yearly bonus to max out an IRA**.

Regarding an IRA, I apologize for my ignorance on the subject, but my knowledge of investments and retirement plans are fairly lacking (I have begun reading the investment books recommended in the FAQ, though!).  I am **not sure if the 28% tax bracket is so high that I should avoid a Roth IRA**, or if I can safely assume taxes will be higher in the future.  I also know there is a ""phase-out"" range for IRA contributions when AGI&gt;$112,000.  Since my base+bonus could fall near that range, is this something I need to account for (and if so, how?)?

---Allocation of post-tax savings---

My initial thought for **IRA allocation is 80/20 stock/bond index through Vanguard, allocating 10% to an international stock index**.

I am planning to fill out the W-4 withholding 0 allowances this year.  I know I have seen here and in investment books that this isn't so smart an idea, since I am giving an interest free loan to the government, but I would much rather Uncle Sam owe me than me owe him (at least for this first year).

That said, I am **estimating my monthly take home** (before accounting for medical insurance) **to be $5,000**.  I know I can **save at least $1,850 per month**, and balance the other 63% of take home pay between Needs and Wants.  I suspect I am overestimating my needs and wants, but since I am moving to a new state (with slightly higher cost of living) and have new expenses to worry about, I am taking a conservative approach for now.

I would like to **bolster my emergency fund up to ~$18,000**.  Right now I think savings accounts' apy are too low to warrant a transfer of my emergency fund from checking, but I will revisit this plan if savings accounts improve.

After the emergency fund, I think my focus should be on saving for a house.  If my timeline is no earlier than 3 years, I think a **money market (VMMXX) with low risk** is my best bet.  After accounting for the allocation of my bonus to max my IRA, the remainder of the annual bonus plus monthly savings should allow me to **save $24,000 per year** (to be more precise: $18,000 for this first year after accounting for the emergency fund bump, and then $24,000 annually in the future).

I should therefore be able to afford a 20% down payment on a $150,000 house plus 40% for closing costs and whatnot in two years.  I am assuming closer to 3 years before buying a house since I want to have the ability to look at homes up to $200,000 while staying within my budget.

---Closing Comments---

Okay, pf, I know I just essentially tried to outline my whole life here, but for anyone that actually read through my wall of text, I sincerely appreciate your time and any criticisms or recommendations regarding my plan.  I am new to planning for my future and want to be responsible about it.

Also, please let me know what books or resources you may recommend I focus on to enhance my financial knowledge.  So far, thanks to the FAQ sidebar, I read Suze Orman's Young, Fabulous and Broke.  I am also halfway done with the Boglehead's Guide to Investing.

I'm a freshman planning to major in Biology and Computer Science. I want to get into the field of bioinformatics. I've already talked to one of my professors that works in this area, but I wanted to get some advice from you guys on how I should plan the rest of my college career. 

What courses should I be taking? I've already taken an introductory bio and CS course, and a Data Structures class, and I'm slated to take more CS courses and a Genetics course next year. 

Any programming languages that I should start learning? Any advice on getting a Masters or PhD in Bioinformatics/Computational Biology?

I'm still waiting on news from potential internships for this summer. If they fall through, how should I use my time instead?

1eh3la,1,2013-05-16,To the girl at my internship. [xpost from /r/insanityworkout],[deleted],loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1eh3la/to_the_girl_at_my_internship_xpost_from/,"To the girl at my internship. This is now the third summer we've been working together. We were pretty flirty the first time around when we first met, but I was committed to another girl. You didn't know it, but she broke my heart in the fall and ran off with who I thought was my best friend. I took it pretty hard and started eating the pain. It was only a few pounds at first, but it didn't get better.
It got worse.
What was just 10 pounds became 20. Which became 30. Which is now 40 pounds heavier. It may not seem like a lot to some, but I have a small frame with nowhere for the fat to spread out. A healthy varsity soccer player now can no longer even play a full intramural game because of the exhaustion.
Grades slipped along with confidence in myself and my abilities. The second summer came around and there we were again. Except this time, I didn't even have the courage to look you in the eyes or even talk to you. Ashamed at what has become of me.
I had a losing mentality. Illness plagued me. Body became weak. Along with a troubled household, the only thing that gave me comfort was food. Always there in the fridge. Mountain Dew became my best friend and helped me ignore the piling homework and the fighting.
And here is the third summer. Came by in a heartbeat. And here you are again, gorgeous as always. Unchanging. Just like me.
But I did change.
I wasn't always like this. And so I started insanity. I'm on my third week. I don't exactly see results, but I feel it. I feel like I'm working towards something again. Like I'm fighting back. Like the Boston Bruins, I'm coming back.
So to the girl at my internship. Thank you. I'm not doing this for you. Or for that matter, any girls like you. I'm doing this for me. To get back what I have lost. To get back into the confident, aspiring, happy person I used to be. I will dig deeper. I will prevail.
And you can too.
If you are reading my story, thank you. If you are in the same situation as me, just know you aren't alone. Keep at it. I will if you will.
To the girl at my internship, I'm going to talk to you again."
1eh2yx,1,2013-05-16,Was just told I have to get an implant. Help!,[deleted],Dentistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/1eh2yx/was_just_told_i_have_to_get_an_implant_help/,"
I was just informed that I have to get an implant and have quite a few questions and concerns.

In about 2000 I busted out my 4 front teeth, resulting after years of surgeries[root canals] to 2 veneers and 2 crowns(two front teeth) well my gums around one of my crowns started receding about a year a half ago. I went to the dentist today and they did an x-ray of the tooth and saw that I have a large cavity in that tooth. He told me that inside of if is basically turning ""soft"" because the cavity eats away at the tooth. He said I don't feel it because I received a root canal. So there's my background story.

My questions are:

My dentist had said there was nothing much i could do to prevent this cavity because it was inside so who's fault was this? Should I just maybe use more mouth wash because that's the only thing that would clean maybe inside of it?

How much will this single implant cost? They were talking about fixing my other crown as well since they came out a little shorter than preferred.

I am going to a consultation with my dentist. I have read a little but about complications with surgeries and I want the best person to do it so I don't come across problems. So is a dentist out of the question? He seems very genuine and intelligent but would a oral surgeon or something else be a better idea?

What's the chances that this doesn't work in some way? I just worry because i have perfect teeth now and I don't want to be imperfect for the rest of my life.

How long do I have to wear the fake tooth? I saw you have to wear a retainer with a fake tooth on it and I am just about to graduate college and have an internship this summer where I really need to look good and I'm scared missing this tooth and my tooth possibly popping out will just kill my confidence. So how legit do the retainer teeth look, will anyone notice?

How often will I need to get new crowns?

All in all how long until i look normal again? And will I look normal?!

Thanks in advance r/Dentistry!"

**She** - insecure, daddy issues, prone to negativity and stress

**Me** - Jealous, insecure (I think?), evaluating my ability to listen and treat others well

**The reason for the breakup** - she believed I did not show her enough affection. I believed I was showing affection through support and positivity (helped her with homework, essays, internships, resumes, ambition). This led to an imbalance where we were asking for/giving different things.

After the breakup, I tried desperately to tell her that I was willing to work on everything. I tried to tell her that I was willing to get better and change because I love her. We had several serious discussions where I laid out everything I knew I did wrong, how I wanted to fix each one, and I put away all of what I believed she could do to improve the relationships, giving away my self-value and worth. Each time I was met with responses like ""I don't want you to change to love me, I just want to be loved"" and ""we're not meant to be"".

After three weeks, in the middle of my recovery from a break up, she contacts me, asking me how I am and telling me that she cried the first day she got to Egypt (internship that I helped her get) due to loneliness. I feel like I'm being strung along... getting friend zoned by an ex. I can't provide that kind of support and not be in the relationship - it's not fair to me and I need to move on. I make a mental note that the next time she seeks support from me, I would tell her that I still want to be with her, to give her support. If not, then we have to be in No Contact. 

A few days later, she reaches out again, and I tell her that. And here's where it gets really messed up for me. I find out she got really close to a friend she met while we were dating after we broke up. They saw each other 10 times in the immediate 2 weeks. I don't know how much more ""leapfrogging"" that can get. She slept with him within two weeks and Skypes with him in Egypt. I have issues with jealousy in the past. I am not a nervous, uptight, or high-strung guy, but the jealousy that came from this was absolutely *debilitating*. I couldn't breathe and couldn't think straight for three days. It made me question everything that I believed about myself - what my personality was, what my flaws were, what my worth was...

She came back 3 days after I found out, saying ""I forgive you for everything that happened in the relationship. I realize now that the positivity you gave me in the relationship is really important to me, and I want that positivity in my life."" 

**Here's where I need you, r/rels.** I love this girl and I have a desire... I have the NEED to love her and take care of her. But I just can't seem to get past the guy she jumped to IMMEDIATELY after. Thought its technically not cheating, to me it's *effectively* cheating, as I feel the same loss of trust, respect... the same absolutely gut wrenching feeling that I'm optional/replaceable, and I feel guilty for giving away my self worth even in the process. If we had done NC, it would have been fine - she's out of my life. But am I wrong to say that this feels like infidelity if she knew she still loved me, missed me, and might want to get back together with me? Am I just being irrational? Should I let this go and give it another shot?

**tl;dr I tried many times to get back together with a girl. After finding out she banged another dude, I decided to move on. Three days later she wants to get back together... but... she banged that dude...and I can't seem to get past it.**

I graduated with a degree in math, and I decided that I would teach myself computer science to get a job as a software developer. I found out that it is pretty tough to break into the industry after I didn't even get a call back on my resume for internships.

I have a general idea of what I want to do, which includes a short QA session and a project where you help me mainly by reviewing my code. This will require a small time commitment of about 5 hours or less over 4 weeks. I got accepted to go to Texas State, but I really wanted to avoid the expensive university education especially since I already taught myself. I would not mind compensating someone for their time.

I graduated with honors with bachelors degree in mathematics, and after taking several computer science courses, I learned that I have a natural intuition for software. I took free online courses from Princeton, Stanford, and MIT, and I also used any resource I could find ranging from wikipedia, textbooks, and blog posts. My experience with coding is mostly small, simple programs and reading source code for some open source projects. I am confident that I have a solid understanding of computer science, but I lack the crediblity to create software that is up to a professional level.

I was hoping to get an internship for the summer, but I did not have much luck since most employers include a requirement for being currently enrolled at a university. On a CV, internships play the role of providing references and verification of professional experience, so after thinking about it for a while, I came up with this idea. I am really excited to take all the theoretical knowledge that I have and begin applying it to the real world.

I have been thinking about building a desktop  for a while and now that I have started my summer internship I think it may be time to start!

I would like to spend around 500$ but am willing to increase a bit for a better performance within reason.

Currently I have a ""Gaming Laptop"" with the following specs

•	Processor Intel 2nd Gen Core i7 i7-2670QM / 2.2 GHz ( 3.1 GHz ) ( Quad-Core )

•	Memory 8.0 GB / 8.0 GB (max)

•	Hard Drive750.0 GB - Serial ATA-300

•	Operating System Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit Edition

•	Display Type 16.4 in TFT active matrix

•	Max Resolution1920 x 1080 ( Full HD )

•	Graphics Processor NVIDIA GeForce GT 540M

•	Optical Drive DVD-Writer / BD-ROM - Integrated


My goal in building this Desktop would be to outperform my laptop with a decent margin. My laptop has cooling issues and tends to framedrop far too much for my liking.

Games I play include Guild Wars 2, Chivalry, CS:GO, ARMA 2 and 3, and hopefully Dayz standalone when it comes out.

I have a mortgage payment and all the other perks that come with being an adult. I have worked for the past 5 1/2 years as a social work clerk for the Department of Public Health in the state that I live in. For about 3 1/2 to 4 of those years, I've been attending a local university working toward my Bachelor's in social work. My employer has allowed me to flex my time to attend any classes that I could not take in the evenings or online. 

This being said, a coworker was allowed to do her internship here on work time for her Master's in social work a year or two ago. She was also granted Educational Leave, as was another social worker who was working on her Master's. I have always assumed, and been led to believe, that I would be given the same treatment. 

I am to go into my internship for the Fall semester, and graduate in December. I am to complete a 450 hour field placement. Wednesdays are all day in class, 9-4. When I approached my supervisor to make arrangements to do my placement here on work time, I was told they no longer do that. When I applied for Educational Leave, I was told that my classification (Administrative Support Assistant II) cannot receive Educational Leave for Social Work. I was then told I could use up my leave, then take leave without pay so that I could keep all of my benefits. After graduation, I would then continue as a clerk until a social work position opened up. (All of this was with the stipulation that I complete all of my required tasks.)

As of Tuesday, I was told I could do my placement here, but I would be cut to 1/2 time, meaning I would make only about 600-700$ a month. My insurance premium would go up to $675, I would lose my seniority, my leave accumulation would go down by 1/2, I would not get my annual longetivity payment, and I would not be guaranteed a full time position in any assignment when I graduated. I was also told that if layoffs occur before the semester starts, I will not be able to do my placement here.

If I continue as an employee here, I will have to drop my insurance, as I will not be able to afford it. In addition to all of the things I lose (which were my reasons for wanting to stay) I will be working 12 hours a day, 5 days a week and 8  hours a day 2 days a week for a total of 76 hours a week for 4 months. Like I said, I have two children, and my husband travels for work.

If I quit, I will be able to draw out almost $10,000 from my retirement. This, in addition to my left-over student loan monies would allow me to personally invest some into an IRA or CD, plus give us money to live off of until I graduate. I figure I'm going to lose my insurance anyway. If I did this, I am hoping the place I did my internship at would hire me, or at least provide a great reference for employment.

So, after giving you all the many boring details...do I stay here, lose everything that had given me reason to want to stay to begin with, and kill myself working and doing an internship for almost 80 hours a week. (which will include missing out on things for the kids.) All of this and I don't even know if I'll have a job in December. Or do I resign with the the knowledge that I will have to use some of the retirement I've saved up, and will have to start all over in a new job and agency when I graduate.

I'm turning to Reddit because my husband, mother, friends, etc. will only say do what I think is right or what I want to do. No one will just give me an unbiased opinion.

I have managed land a few interviews with small firms, but no offers.  I graduated with an average for my program GPA of 2.7 and no internship experience.  During my undergrad it was very difficult to find any type of internship in my field because of the recession. It seems that I have found myself in catch 22.  Every company wants at least a few years of experience in their entry level positions and I cannot find any company willing to allow a grad to intern.  I have been volunteering building and rehabbing homes to keep myself busy, but that’s not really relevant experience for an entry level management position.    

I have always have had interest in building and designing so becoming a civil engineer is definitely appealing to me.  The civil eng. program I am considering would take me 2.5 to 3 years to complete.  Being enrolled as student again in an undergrad program would make me eligible to intern and hopefully I’d have an edge with the CM degree.   I do have some concerns though.  I am worried that potential employers would wonder why I decided to get a second bachelor’s in such a closely related field especially if I find myself getting into the project management side of things.  I have also heard there is a pretty hard GPA 3.0 cutoff with engineering if this true I know I will have to bust my ass to bring my GPA up.

I have considered masters programs, but I think I would have a tough time getting in and have also read that in order to take the PE exam you must have a BS in engineering.

If I don’t end up going back to school I have thought about entering the trades, but I feel like that would be wasting the last 5 years of my education.

I just need some advice to help decide my future, any help would be great!

High: $23

3 reported anonymous salaries

Using math, the 3 reported salaries are 14, 20, 23.

When asked what salary I would be okay with, do I just say anywhere from 20-23? Or do I give the whole in-depth explanation that showed I have researched past salaries on Glassdoor and say 14, 20, 23 eliminating the 14 as an outlier and say I deduced my desired salary down to 20-23? In other words, would giving so much detail help my case? Or would they think ""This guy is too smart. Let's pick a different intern so we can pay the new intern less money""?"

First of all: I am an intern at a german company. I'm new to the SAP processes. The subsidiary I work in is located in asia. 

To issue SAP authorization for a new User the current process is inefficient and it takes long because it has to be done in the HQ in Germany. Some times it takes 4 weeks and not all roles / transactions are assigned to that account and we have to write many mails back and forth to control if everything needed has been assigned. 

I would like to ask you, what would be the best solution for the local IT (my colleague and me) to have view_rights on the asian coworkers' SAP authorization. Just to check if everything has been assigned correctly and what roles like CS:84S_DISPATCHER mean in detail. 
I hope you understand what I am trying to ask. Please help. Thanks in advance!! Best regards from Bangkok"

1eflqo,3,2013-05-16,19 year old confused about financial situation. How/where do I rein in the expenses?,ardeur,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1eflqo/19_year_old_confused_about_financial_situation/,"Hi, I'm having trouble analyzing my financial situation and am hoping that PF will be able to help. 


Sophomore in college. Tuition, room/board (campus housing), and a very basic cell phone are 100% paid for by scholarships and my parents.  I will graduate debt-free. I pay for all other expenses (food, textbooks, leisure activities, etc). I go to college in the city, so public transportation paid for by tuition.


**INCOME**: I've made $5-6k each summer for three years. This summer I will earn $8k+ from an internship and tutoring. I worked all throughout high school. I don't work anymore during college.  Since I've always had a lot of money to spend on frivolous things, I've developed bad spending habits. I just don't understand how much things should cost. How much do I spend on food, clothes, entertainment, travel?


According to mint, this is my total spending this year:

* Food: $1038 or $207.60/month.
* Travel: $1155 (spring break)
* Entertainment/shopping/misc: $628 or $125.60/month


So the entire sum of my spendings from January to today is $2821. Not counting spring break, I am spending $333.20 per month. Presently, I have just above $3k in my saving account. I forecast my end-of-the-year spendings to be $6500 at *most*.


 I think that I am in a very lucky financial position right now, but learning to budget would be a good skill to have by the time I graduate because I wouldn't be able to live such a frivolous lifestyle then. At the same time, I look at how much leeway I have right now and it's just so confusing to decide what to cut out. So my questions are basically:


* Can personalfinance offer any advice on how I should think or assess  my financial situation? 
* What is a normal spending plan? 
* What short-term or long-term goals should I consider? 
* What potential problems should I plan for?

Any help or advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

I still played my 360 now and then because I've had it forever and have many games on it.

Unfortunately, my 360 is in the process of dying and I'm probably going to sell it along with my 360 games.

I have a handful of ps3 games already, I'm curious if it is worth investing in more ps3 games this summer or waiting for the next generation of systems? Thanks!

Games I already own:
-Heavy Rain
-Goldeneye Reloaded
-Portal 2
-Resistance 1, 2, 3
-Little Big Planet 1

On the 360, I have games like Red Dead Redemption, GTA IV, Fallout 3 and New Vegas, the Orange box. I'm considering selling these and getting their ps3 counterparts for cheap... because I would still like to play them. Also I'm going to pick up Skyrim soon. Thanks!"

I am currently a paramedic student and our clinical rotations will be coming up. I was hoping to hear some advice and guidance from the people i will be working under soon.

1. What department do you work in and what have been your experiences with paramedic interns, good or bad?

2. What things can I do to make your life easier and your experience with a paramedic intern ""good""?

3.  What topics or skills should I spend some extra time with before starting clinicals? 

4.  I imagine this can be largely case-by-case, but what do you allow your interns to do?

I want this process to go as well as possible for both myself and my preceptor.  I want to learn as much as possible and hopefully, not be more of a burden than an extra pair of helping hands.  I want to do the ""dirty"" jobs and little things that can help the hospital staff out in anyway possible.  I would really appreciate anything you can share to aid me in this upcoming adventure.

Oh! And one more thing...  We have now done 3 live IV days in class on each other.  I am still very nervous about starting IV's even though I have always been successful.  However, that is my problem.  I am not comfortable with complication as I haven't experienced it.  So I would love some advice related to IV therapy.

I applied to 3 universities where 2 are located locally where I live and the other 1 is in my old birth town (which my family left when I was age 5). I didn’t want to apply to university in my birth town but I did for just in case. The either the 2 university I applied in my city are both my ideal and dream school.

The past 4 years of my damn high school I dedicated as much time as I can to obtaining the best grade I in order to enter the business program in either of the 2 universities here.  I don’t have the best grades around but I’m averaging between 84-86% at the moment (at the time I applied I had around 88%.  Yea I know I don’t meet up with my damn Asian stereotypes with my grades but whatever. I had an okay extracurricular profile with some volunteering and internships. The 2 local university admission average was around 83-84% where as the other one is around a low 80%.

I got rejected officially from both of these two universities for the business program (I got into Arts in to one of them). But, I did get accepted in my first choice in my birth town.  What makes me upset is that I wasn’t good enough to enter the universities of my dream. I do not want to go back to my back to birth town and study there (it is so boring and I have no friends and hardly any real family that I can there as most of my immediate family moved here).

I’m angry how you know when people apply out of their city/province/state it is for better or more prestigious program or they want it, but the thing is that I do not want it.  I can't go into Arts since it would be useless to me (and transferring internally is quite difficult/competitive and I don’t want to risk the chance what if I get rejected again from my transfer)  and have no choice but to go back the city my family left. 

Yea I admit I live in a quite competitive city of Vancouver. But, I’m frustrated, it’s not like my grades are so low that I should go to some small College here. I’m not a smart student but I studied hard to hope for the best and during that time I gave up on a lot with friendships and doing stuff I wanted try out. These rejections show that I ain’t good enough and I find it embarrassing that I have to move back to the middle of now where to next province to me, I hate it. I have no motivation to do my damn work anymore or study for my test and don’t know what to do.

* How often do the companies listed by the CS department (Amazon, Facebook, Google etc) come to hire interns?

* Do start-ups come to visit or is it just the large companies?

I started running and ran my first 5K (time of 29:51 woop woop)!

Last summer I was raped and it's been extremely hard on me and made my depression much worse (its runs in my family. my dad killed himself and so did his mom). However, I didn't cut like I used to. I have not cut once this semester. I am ok.

I ended an extremely unhealthy relationship, borderline abusive, actually. It was one of the hardest things I've ever done, but I didn't go back to him and now I see how mean and horrible he is. 

I got serious about my studies and future career. I started talking to one of my profs and she wrote me an awesome letter of recommendation and invited me to a luncheon at the state house with her and 2 other students she invited. 

I got an internship in DC for 2015.

I started volunteering at an animal shelter.

I met my uncle who I haven't seen since my dads funeral a decade ago and he learned about me and we started talking.

I got the nerve to text this amazing guy I've known for 2 years, but always thought he was out of my league. Next week if our 2 month anniversary :)

And, today, I found out I made a 4.0 this semester. All A's. Through all of this.

I am so proud of myself and I just wanted to share with you ladies. Sorry if this is irrelevant, but I feel so empowered right now and like I can take on the world. I plan to keep making a 4.0 from here on out, so that I can raise my cumulative GPA from a 3.34 to as high as I can get it. I want to volunteer more places. I want to graduate with honors and apply to law school. I also plan on staying in this healthy relationship with a guy who truly loves me and would never do anything to hurt me, emotionally or physically.

Met a great girl (20/F) in January, we hit it off really well. We started dating a week after we met and eventually decided to make it official around March. Just before we made it official, I got a job offer from a prestigious company in my field (Engineering). This position is set to last for 12 months, meaning I'll have to take next year off college. My position will be close to her hometown but around 170 miles away from college. I accepted the job and we talked about doing long distance and she agreed that she wanted to go through with it.

We started doing long distance about 3 weeks ago since I moved out to work and I feel very lonely. I'm so scared about the future because I feel like I've tried to do too many things way out of my comfort zone. This will be the first time in my life that I have legitimately lived on my own in a big city. I have no friends here and no support group and I won't have her here with me.

We are only a 2-3 hour drive away so I am grateful in that regard but I worry that she will be so busy in her Senior year studying (She's trying to become a Doctor so will be applying to Med School) and being around other people that she will forget about me.

I wake up every morning and I have this overwhelming anxiety where I think ""What the hell have I gotten myself into?"" Not only in regards to my relationship with her, but also this job and new life experience.

This is my first proper intern job at an engineering company and I realize how much of an incredible opportunity it is, but part of me just wants to quit immediately and get the fuck out of here so that I can spend another year in college with the girl I care about, rather than having to do long distance. I worry that things won't work out between us during my job and I'll come back to my finish my last year of college with her gone and just painful memories of what could have been. I don't want her to slip away. I don't know how to be strong.

I haven't talked to her about an end date to our long distance because I personally feel it's a little too early, but it would most likely be 2 years from now. I keep fantasizing about how short those 2 years are gonna be and how everything will be fine but then anxiety hits me and I fear for the worst.

[Would you recommend that I call or visit the store I applied to after I submit an application? Some people say it make you seem eager and willing, but I also do not want to seem pushy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejbqz/iama_manager_at_a_malls_store_and_im_here_to/ca0u6hm?context=5)|Yes. Chances are you'll get a stock answer when you call, mostly because the person is super busy, but we take note of your name and when going through applications remember that you were actually interested in the status of the application.
[Also, I have some experience working as a Summer School tutor at my high school. Should I include that as job experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejbqz/iama_manager_at_a_malls_store_and_im_here_to/ca0u6hm?context=5)|And that is definitely work experience.

And I feel like a lot of places don't. You probably could find work as a bagger at a grocery store, or babysitting, but all states have a LOT of laws about minors working, and generally places don't allow minors to run a register so the jobs are limited. Also be prepared for not a lot of hours since we can only give minors limited hours.

We are a really good company to work for. We care about our employees and are honestly more like a close group of friends than coworkers (At least in my store, and as far as I know it's pretty common). Go in to your local store and ask a manager if they are hiring. Generally we don't post sales associate jobs online. Have open availability and a good attitude. We mostly hire in early july and end of october. We are not allowed to keep on all of our sales associates after holiday hiring, but we keep the best. Show up on time for all shifts and pick up extras if offered to you. We might be the ""fun"" store, but we are run by corporate and expect no less from our employees than say Sears or Macy's.

[What if jeans are my nices pants.. Like I have shorts pjs and jeans... whenever I go looking/aplying for jobs I will wear my nicest pair and a button up shirt. should I buy some nicer pants?

[Climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro a few months ago and met a few guys who were CEO's and they said that it's a great thing to put on one's resume (shows determination, well-roundedness etc.\). Do you agree?

Teachers/professors, mentors, even people who were in charge of volunteer work you did are good substitutes if you have little to no work history. 
[What happens if you don't have contact with previous employers? I've only had one job before a few years ago and the store has since shut down.

[Why cargo pants? Cargo pants are the worst, second only to sweat pants.

Working and wearing jeans is one thing. You don't have to impress your boss to start your shift every day. But dressing to impress for an interview shows me that you CARE that you get this job. Which implies you will care enough about your job to do it. I don't want to fire you in two months and start the search all over because you can't be bothered to do the things I hired you for.

Nice khakis are perfect. Casual, but you put effort in. Make sure you don't walk in to places with stacks of apps in your hand. If possible, fill them out right away and hand them in so you don't have to let on you're applying everywhere and anywhere.

If you can fix it with dayquil, don't reschedule. If you are vomiting sick, call and explain and see if you can push it back a day or two. But that is a last option.

Otherwise no.  We ask different questions of everyone. Really what we're looking for are honest answers and to get a feel for your personality. If you don't fit personality-wise with our current team, doesn't matter how qualified you are we won't sacrifice our current happy employees for a new one and have everyone be miserable.

People either get so nervous searching for the perfect answer that they can't think straight OR they have rehearsed ""perfect"" answers that we know are bullshit and stop them from getting the job. Don't be so nervous, we're not trying to back you into a corner, just trying to feel out if you're a good fit for our team.

If it's close enough to commute to your parents on weekends and keep your job, then tell them you're willing to do that. If not, is it a possibility to stay closer to the college during summer? 
[I go to school in a different state, so no. I told the managers that i would be willing to take a LOA and come back and work during breaks, and that it is my last year of school.

I was going to be left alone with this person a lot and my boss was very much looking out for my well being. 
[Why would someone's personal politics be a factor?  Edit: I get it if someone is going off about ""killin' Obamer"" or something like that, but is sharing harmless pictures or statuses a big thing?

[Would you consider someone who already has a job? I work part-time (weekends only\) and they won't give me anymore shifts, so I need a second job to survive this summer.

On the surface and to most anybody on the outside, this job is something of a fantasy: I'm well paid, my shop is staffed with highly competent people, it's a fun environment with very flexible hours, I have top shelf hardware to work and play with and we get tons of benefits and perks.

There's just one really, really big problem: I'm bored to tears. I literally spend my days watching tutorial videos and dicking around with side projects. There isn't a surplus of work available and most of the guys I work with have been together for years and nobody is particularly eager to put me (a nobody college hire) on their project or accept me into their cliquey little groups. I accepted this job because it appeared to be a challenging environment with an interesting variety of projects, but instead I've just spent most of the past week watching streams from I/O.

Frankly, I don't care how much Dr. Pepper or how many organic apples they feed me--I'm a motivated person who seeks out and enjoys challenges. I came here to work hard and learn while I'm still young and eager; I had several awesome internships that pushed me to my limits and gave me something to hang my hat on. This is different, and I'd give most of this up just to have something substantial to do during the day. I'd happily accept bitch work at this point--I'm not expecting serious responsibilities as a new grad.

It's not just that I'm bored, either--I'm also concerned that I'll inevitably end up with a bad performance review all while my skills erode, leaving me stuck here or fired/marginalized. I moved clear across the country for this and committed myself to a year-long lease, too, so in some sense I'm already trapped. As I mentioned, nobody is responsible for me, so I'm responsible for myself; it's my task to find work. But despite my efforts, I can't, because there simply isn't any going around. So, after just one month, I'm already thinking about heading back out into the job market.

Question is: at what point do I begin to *really* worry, and how bad will it look if indeed I decide to bail after just 2 or 3 months?"

I just got my first internship working in a lab that is using velvet to sequence the genome of an unknown obligate parasite living in a eukaryotic cell.  I have a embarrassing question with velvet…

I'm working through a [tutorial](http://www.molecularevolution.org/resources/activities/velvetbowtie_activity) on velvet (trying to catch up before we get started), and I've been able to produce these files:  
- contigs.fa  
- Log  
- Roadmaps  
- stats.txt  
  
Dumb Question: So now what?  I would like to be able to open the velvet outputs with something like Tablet, and eventually blast some of the contigs so that i can eliminate the eukaryotic DNA, but I don't know how to uses these files.
  
  I know I need to learn a lot and this is why I'm asking all of you for some hints.

I just got back college and my current SO/hook up buddy is across the country now. I've never done the online thing because it kind of feels 'sad' and that I might be ashamed if anyone found out I had a profile. I have a few questions though.

How discrete is OKC? Are you using your real name or do you create a username? Do jobs search through your OKC profile (I'm trying to intern at some very large companies that do background checks). I really don't want someone to start saying that I used an online dating site because that's pretty damn embarassing for people my age (which is stupid because online dating only makes it easier to meet people who are mutually attracted).

I'm 19 and I'm an attractive male, do women tend to look for only older guys? I mean I've never had a problem hitting it off with women my age but I feel like OKC is only used by older females. And from my experience, females want nothing to do with guys if they're even 12 months younger. Hell, I can't even legally drink (although i'm 21 in Arizona though.. eh ;)? How does that come off?

I've been hooking up with a girl from college for the past 6 months.. is this morally wrong? In the last month or two we've pretty much settled exclusively, but the months before I was hooking up with other girls (she hooked up here or there I believe, not frequently). I don't know what's going to happen next year with her, but I'm not ready to settle in a relationship. I'm just afraid she'll find out that I used online dating in the summer and for her to get pissed.

1ejaa0,1,2013-05-17,Seeking some career advice.,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1ejaa0/seeking_some_career_advice/,"Hi r/engineering, first some background: I left my previous job in another country in December to move to the U.S. and I received my Green Card a month ago so I have only been applying to jobs for a month. I graduated in May 2011 with a Bachelor's in Aerospace Engineering from a top university in the US and have a lot of experience with UAVs, more specifically doing design work and some flight testing. I have two summer internships and 1.5 years of full time experience.


I am looking for some general career advice because I am currently struggling on deciding what to do with my life. 


I want to work in the Aerospace industry but right now almost all of the companies that I am interested in are either on a hiring freeze or don't seem to be hiring much. I am worried that the longer I wait the more obsolete I become and the less likely I am to get hired. I am also getting tired of not working and just staying at home waiting for companies to hopefully get back to me. 


My other good option right now is to go work at an Automotive company were I'll be making good money and be in a rotational program which could mean learning a lot of great skills. The other advantage is that I wouldn't have to move so my wife wouldn't have to leave her current job and we would have about twice the income than we would if we had to move. However, I don't know if I should pursue this option right now or wait because what I truly want to do is Aerospace. Also, working in Automotive makes me nervous in terms of job security for the long term. 


Part of me wants to just say ""screw it"" and work at the Automotive company right away so that I can continue my career and start making money but another part of me wants to wait so that I can land an awesome job working on things that I am truly passionate about.


**If you were in my position, how long do you think you would wait before pursuing the alternate option of applying for the job at the Automotive company?**


**How long do you think is too long to be unemployed and why do you think this?**


Any comments, feedback, and opinions are welcome. Thank you in advance."

I just had my first appointment with the OB my family doctor referred me to on Tuesday and I was just unhappy with her. I found her to be very condescending and treating me like I was dumb and honestly, I was rather offended. She also had a med intern there, which was a surprise to me. Some people might be ok with it, but I'd rather not have an intern there and feel like a case study as she pauses every 5 mins to explain things to the intern. 

Basically, there are 11 OBs who work in that group at the hospital. You only regularly see one but could potentially have any of the 11 on the day of the birth, just whoever happens to be working that day (as in, your OB will not try to come in that day if that day is not on their regular schedule). I don't like it but fine, if that's the way it has to be. Anyway, I called my family doctor and asked to be referred to a different OB in the group but apparently they can't do that because if you've seen one already, another one won't see you. 

That's absolutely ridiculous to me. I don't want two OBs. I want a different one because I had a negative experience. I saw her one time and now I can't switch? I asked if I could be at the other hospital (thankfully I live in an area that has more than one) where it's a group of OBs and you see them all so hopefully this works out. I'm actually more ok with that. At least I get to meet them all.

Either way, I didn't want an OB at all. ALL the midwiferies were full and I'm on waiting lists for all in my area. I'm just getting really frustrated because I feel like I have no choices. Not my first, which was a midwife, not my second, which would be a great OB who is actually there on the day of the birth. I'm so not liking the idea of not having the same person who provides prenatal care not being there at the birth (which is why I wanted a midwife to begin with). I understand if they had to be away on vacation, but there would only be a small chance of that... Not a 2/11 chance, depending on their schedule. 

Why do people think Canadian healthcare is something special? So very frustrated..."

I am 22 years old and about to graduate from college and I have been with the same guy (24) on and off for almost two years.  

When I first met him, I was strong and fiercely independent.  I loved life.  I was excited to go to school every morning.  I had been working out and eating healthy.  I had the internship of my dreams.  I met this guy and he was gorgeous and he seemed like he was really interested in me.  We were both talking to other people in the beginning, but we ended up being exclusive.  Whenever we went out together, if someone hit on me, he would call get angry.  He would say that they were only looking at my boobs and that I was a slut.  He hated that I had male friends.  He never had friend girls and he started getting closer to them to make me jealous.  Eventually, I stopped talking to my best friends and he just continued.

I have caught him on several occasions talking to other girls on Facebook.  Once over Christmas break and once on my birthday telling them that he wanted to see them and that he was sorry he couldn't.  He said that he would ""make it up to them"" which he always used to say to me.  He got a DUI and I ended up driving him everywhere.  

He got mad and he hit me.  We were both drunk but I remember him pulling my hair and dragging me across the house.  Then, he bagged up my things and he threw them on the porch and I ran and hid behind a bush and I cried until he found me.  He didn't apologize, he just asked, ""Are you going to tell all your friends that I am some evil guy now?  Are we never going to talk again?""  And I told him that I wouldn't mention it again.

We were supposed to take a trip to Paris, I had bought our tickets.  His parents said that he couldn't go (his parents are a little bit crazy) and we got into big fights about it because we had talked about it for so long.  We eventually broke up.  He slept with another girl the week that we were supposed to be in Paris.  He decided to go on a boys trip to Myrtle Beach instead and he invited an old fling. 

We ended up getting back together.  I blocked his number but it didn't go through AT&amp;T for some reason and he called everyday and texted and apologized saying that he would change and that he could never be happy without him.  I broke down sobbing and took him back.  

His parents are both irrational and controlling and he manipulates them the same way that he manipulates me.  My dad is absent and my mom is emotionally and was extremely physically abusive.  He has had terrible relationships where his exes have cheated on him and had abortions.  I am no saint either.  I hit him after I found out he slept with another girl.  We have physically fought several times.  

The past few months have been different.  He graduated before me and all of his friends are gone.  We have spent practically everyday together.  He just moved for a job (hundreds of miles away) and I was trying to see him.  I know that I am being impatient and he gets angry with me when I ask when I can visit because he has to run it by his parents who do not like guests.  I freaked out and called him over and over when he was visiting his cousin because I know they drink so heavily together and I got really insecure.  He got upset because he was trying to hang out with his family that he had no seen for a while so he has not spoken to me in 3 days.  He always does this when he gets upset and when I ask him if we can have a better line of communication, he dismisses me as crazy.  He says that I am too insane to deal with and he just needs to block me out when I am acting this way.  I was hospitalized twice for overdoses last summer.  I have never been a depressed person.  I was always so happy and motivated but for the past two years, I have felt absolutely defeated.  I don't know how to explain it but sometimes, it physically hurts.  Like my chest just aches from my sadness and I would do anything to make the pain go away.  It gets to the point sometimes that every minute feels like an hour.  I can barely sleep at night, I feel so anxious.  I feel like it was my fault this time.  I shouldn't have called him 5 times when he was hanging out with his cousin.  I should have just let him have his space and now he is ignoring me for days at a time...again.  I don't know who to turn to because I was such a burden last summer on my friends and they got so worried.  I have apologized just to get it over with but he is punishing me so that I don't act this way again.  I have tried leaving him before but it is so hard.  I feel even more depressed without him.

edit: I am so tired of fighting.  I am so tired of feeling sad.  I just want everything to be okay."

Kind of a long story short but I'll give you the **tl;dr** version. Went to college for Computer Technology, got an internship in the UNIX/AIX department with very little Linux experience. Through the summer I learned a lot and worked hard so they offered me a job right out of college (hell yea) so I had to take it. Now being with the company for over a year I know a lot of the basics of a UNIX/Linux, but I've felt like I've been a little cheated. How I learned was people showing me what to do, and from there I kind of had to guess why it happened and why it worked that way, think of it as reverse  learning.  Now that I've gotten more into UNIX (it's really catching on to me) I would like to go back to the ""roots""  and start over and learn the OS from the ground up. 



So from reading/hearing a lot of cool stuff that people are doing with their raspberry pi's I think it would be a great opportunity form me to tinker around with Linux and learn a little more in depth knowledge about Linux and even about programming.



Well I just found out that Micro Center sells them, I work about 5 minutes away from one. So I'm going to jump right in and get my feet wet. I was just wondering what the most basic essentials I will need to run it, and if anyone has any good recommendations. I heard that you should buy multiple SD cards so have for different projects, I think I'm just going to start off with one for now. But I have my computer monitor and TV that I plan on working on it with. I have a mechanical light-up keyboard, should I be worried about the power consumption of it? I have two 10 feet HDMI cables laying around. Might pick up a USB flash drive for more storage. I have multiple USB power cables and wall plugs from my android phones I own.  I'm just not sure if I've over looked anything.



So if you could any advice or recommendations would be great!


Oh and I forgot to add I would like to pick everything up from Micro Center, unless there is a big price difference or better technology that I can buy somewhere else. "

[How do you plan to end your channel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca07374?context=5)|With a wave and a wink.  I was much more dramatic about it in the early years but I dont even know what my life is without YouTube.  I'll always be around but its just the show wont always exist.  I feel like Im in this big worldwide stupid loving and occasionally racist family.  Don't want to lose that.
[What would you like to do after you finish up with YouTube then?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca07acd?context=5)|Travel and staring at japanese girls.
[Hey Phil. Whats been your most memorable interaction with a fan? Care to elaborate on the ""Letting a fan girl into my house, which I will NEVER do again"" story from your Draw My Life vid?? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca077x4?context=5)|Ever been scared while a girl was performing an act on you?  Thats all I'll say.
[Do you think Youtube will ever hit its peak or just continue to get bigger? If so, when?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca0782m?context=5)|I hope not.  I do get worried because I think they are going to push Google+ so hard they may alienate some users but lucky for them they are THE SOURCE of videos.  The only time I use anything else is when some artsy content producer uses Vimeo.  YOUTUBE is it!
[Some dirt on other YouTubers please?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca06vz4?context=5)|A few years ago I probably would have ripped apart a few youtubers but these days I keep out of the dramatastic YouTube and stick to the creative/businessy YouTube.
 |That being said Lee Newton and Trisha fart so much they have ruined all women for me.
[If right now you had to quit Youtube and start another career, which one would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca06z6g?context=5)|So probably the 2nd one :)
[Link to i.imgur.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca07v76?context=5)|GENIUS!!!
[Will SourceFed Nerd primarily focus on Trisha, Meg, and Steve? If so, how often will Lee, Elliot, and Joe be involved?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca078ni?context=5)|There will be a nice balance as well as the introduction of a few new faces as part timers at first.  For us NERD is where the fun happens.
[What kind of pranks do you guys ( people of Sourcefed \) play on each other?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca075f8?context=5)|Steve's idea of a prank is showing me his balls.  ITS HILARIOUS...for him.  Disgusting for me.  The rest of the hosts are too scared of me to prank me but thats probably because of the constant lashings they get for looking me in the eyes.
[What is the best piece of advice you have ever received from anyone? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca071ug?context=5)|Don't be the first when you can be the best.  
[Since you started the show it's evolved from ""The show that's not really a show but me talking to a camera for 3-4 minutes (yeah.. yeah..\)"" to a show that's now usually at least double that length. Do you see yourself going even longer than this to a show that's 15 minutes or longer every day or do you think you've struck a good balance in terms of video length?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca076jr?context=5)|I dabble with the long form now and then.  I've been playing with the idea of having guests and segments (something similar to a late night show).  We'll see.  The future is looking pretty bright right now.  I usually stay under 10 minutes because its very easy to over stay your welcome on YouTube.
[You've been in a committed relationship for a while, but at work you're surrounded by beautiful women. Does it get hard (pun intended\) to stay behind the line of appropriate behavior?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca07jsr?context=5)|No.  The girls are like family here.  Linz and I are great.  You get comfortable in a relationship where you just trust the other person.  Not that ignorant/lazy trust but that we respect each other and would never do anything to hurt the other trust.  It takes time and arguing but once you get it its so great.
[Hey Phil!  What are your thoughts on a DeFranco Does Ottawa? (And/or Toronto\) Also, of all your BAMF and douchebags of the day, who would you say is the top in each category? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca06x1v?context=5)|We've had serious talks about Toronto.  Its all been delayed because we were waiting on a sponsor who just fell through because they had their budget slashed.  We might arrange something on kickstarter for a DeFranco/SourceFed tour but it wont be for a bit.
[How do people get hired to work at Sourcefed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca0796k?context=5)|Most start as interns who apply at Internsushi.com.  The rest are robots we manufacture in house.
[Any chance you leave Youtube and host all your content on your own website?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca076ah?context=5)|Only if one day I was like I should do the worst thing I could possibly do.  Then I would totally do it.
[Hey Phil, I was just wondering how much does a famous Youtuber like you make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca079x4?context=5)|Depends on if they monetize properly.  I contractually can't speak on my numbers but the 7 figure a year YouTubers definitely exist though.
[Confirmed: Phillip Defranco is a multi-millionaire.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca08ffd?context=5)|Maybe soon.  Thats not really the goal but it IS a fantastic byproduct.

We usually go to back to Xbox's when we have a big sponsor though so I can reward those that enable the show to exist.
[How is Lindsay doing? What is she up to these days?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca0796p?context=5)|Traveling.  Making me sammiches.  Doing squats.  Fun stuff :)

When school is in session and we're rocking awesome views Im on top of the world and when finals roll around and the views take a dip I get sad but I have friends and family that keep me in check.  I don't know if I'll ever feel like I MADE IT!!!  We'll see.

How can I maximize Lee, Joe, or any of our hosts personal YouTube channels?  How can I help them with merch and their careers? I see SF and my show as launching platforms for brand new awesome talent.

1ei6f1,1,2013-05-17,Tax Season Through the Eyes of a First Year Accountant- shadowness,honeybliff70,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1ei6f1/tax_season_through_the_eyes_of_a_first_year/,"http://shadowness.com/eiffelmel/tax-season-through-the-eyes-of-a-first-year-accoun

article code 85230150609THG

This blog was written by Alexa Sibio, of North Caldwell, who is a staff accountant at Smolin Lupin who completed her first tax season this year. 
April 16 is a day that will live in infamy. People who are not in the accounting industry figure April 15 is a much more significant day, but I just completed my very first tax season at Smolin Lupin and, as an accountant, I can tell you April 16 feels as if I finally crossed the finish line.
During my studies at Montclair State University, I interned at Turner Construction Company in New York City over the course of three years. My internship was very exciting and I was able to learn a lot about the profession, however, I never worked a tax season at an accounting firm.Sure, I heard a lot about the challenges from my professors, but I never gave it too much thought. I am an extremely focused person who is unafraid of hard work, so I figured, ""How bad can it be?""Needless to say, I now realize I slightly underestimated the situation.
There is no point in trying to detail the long hours, fast-paced and intense environment of an accounting agency in tax season, because the only way to fully grasp it is to experience it for yourself.Still, if I had to describe it, it felt like I started a marathon in February and then in March I had to sprint uphill until mid-April.  Yet tax season wasn’t the monotonous grind of a marathon, there were surprises as well, such as the old adage ""communication is key."" It is critical to keep everyone who is involved with a particular engagement updated on the status of the job.However, communication with the client is just as important as communication within the firm. At Smolin, our policy is to keep the client happy and I do whatever it takes to meet that requirement. It sounds easy, but keeping everyone informed of what you’re doing, while everyone is sprinting uphill to complete a marathon is a real challenge, especially when juggling multiple tasks at once.   
They say it takes over your life. I suppose the moment I realized my life had been completely taken over by busy season was a rare weekend afternoon when I was relaxing at home. I picked up a tabloid figuring my brain could use a little fluff and started reading a piece on ""who wore it best."" Midway through the article, I caught myself calculating how much of a write off these dresses would be, what tax code would apply and what I needed to be careful of in their return.I conceded defeat, threw the magazine out and decided a bowl of ice cream was the best mental relaxation.Tax season is a really challenging experience. I learned a lot and contributed to Smolin Lupin’s clients and the firm as a whole. And dare I say I’m actually looking forward to next tax season. I’ll be working with a great group of colleagues, superb mentors and, perhaps, a recent graduate in their first tax season, uphill marathon sprint.

1ei4ih,5,2013-05-17,Did I blow my second interview? Need some insight from experienced interviewers or interviewees,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ei4ih/did_i_blow_my_second_interview_need_some_insight/,"I went in for my second interview for a summer internship with a company in the telecommunications industry. From the start the manager told me to sit at a table next to her desk, and I sat in her seat apparently (there were papers in the front of the seat I sat in, which ended up being her interview questions).


My main concern in that I did not articulate my answers correctly. Here are some of the answers I am concerned about.


Tell me about yourself? I stated basically my professional strengths.She said she wanted to know more about my personal interests. I said I like recording music and have experience in logic and pro tools.


She asked for three strengths, weaknesses, and three things I wanted to get out of the internship. I gave three solid strengths, but stumbled for a third weakness and what I would get out of the internship(said wanted a experience in the telecommunications industry,wanted experience dealing with strategic/target marketing,  and experience in a professional environment)


She also asked what my friends and work colleagues would say about me. I was completely thrown off guard(did not prepare for those questions) and started with my friends would say I am a nice guy(Probably the most honest answer, but she laughed and I followed it up with I am loyal and easy to talk to). As for work colleagues I basically re-stated my strengths (hard working, motivated, come in everyday wanting to learn).


The real worrying answer I gave was to the question, you are not a marketing major, so what marketing experience do you have(communications and Poly Sci with IT Minor). I stated I am an expert in people because of my field of study, and I have some experience in direct marketing with my previous jobs. Of course with extra words thrown.


She then said many of questions were to determine if I would be a better fit in the analysis or creative side of the marketing department based on that typically people are one or the other but very rarely both. Then asked if I had any questions, which I was well prepared for.


I nailed many of the questions that I didn't mention, but I am worried I may have come off as unprofessional or immature based on the poor ones. She told me I would hear back in two weeks(starts June 1) because they were interviewing a few other people and she would be out of town, and ""wished me luck"". She also did not ask for references. Is this me being paranoid or did I really have a poor showing."

We've been dating on and off since grade 11, and it's now the end of our 3rd year of university, for a total of 5 years.

As it currently stands I'm in Computer Engineering at one of the best Universities in Canada and she lives in the same town as me but is in Early Childhood Education at a different university. If you can't figure out by our problems - we're both totally unable to meet members of the opposite sex.

Our story goes like this: I met her back in grade 11 English class. She was the quiet short Brazilian girl that sat beside me. As I began to know her more, she revealed that she had a long distance relationship with some disabled guy who lived in England. It mostly seemed like she only dated him because she was lonely and I ended up convincing her to break up with him so that I could date her. 

We were sort of in different social groups, I was always somewhat popular and she was always hanging around with the quiet asian kids. My friends always told me that I should dump her because I'm too attractive for her, and that she's not good enough for me. I mostly just dated her because I was extremely depressed and I didn't really like any of my ""friends"", but I really liked her. I stopped talking to a lot of my friends in order to date her. She was extremely quiet and not very ambitious or intelligent - she ended up with high 60s in high school, whereas I ended up with high 80s.

Despite all that that we dated without issue for about 2 years until university.

During first year university I basically lost interest after I started to meet girls who were much more attractive and had more in common with me. I slowly began telling a close friend of mine that I lost interest in her, and that I had developed feelings for other girls. He, of course, told her immediately. She eventually sent me an email saying that we should break up - and I felt oddly relieved for some reason.

I ended up hanging out with a few of the girls I liked but nothing really came of it. I became extremely depressed like how it was in high school and we ended up getting back together in February of 1st year (2011) after a few tough months.

We dated without issue until 2nd year, where I became extremely bored of her again. I met another girl who I found interesting through a mutual friend. I hung out with this mutual friend (female, no feelings) and the other girl a while before deciding that I liked her. I ended up breaking up with my girlfriend, drunk, at a bar in order to date this other chick. We made out a couple times, but I never really felt the spark that I felt with my girlfriend. It sort of never worked out with that chick. I also ended up sleeping with a friend of mines ex-girlfriend (long story). I ended up getting back together with my girlfriend in May of that year and had no issues until 3rd year.

tl;dr of the shit I said above: We broke up twice after I met other girls I liked more, but it never worked out with them.

When we got back together it never was as good as it was the first time. She always seemed disappointed. She ended up revealing that she had also slept with someone else and that she now had elevated sexual standards. As it turns out I have premature ejection issues (self diagnosis, don't judge me, fuck you) and I could never sexually please her in the same way that that guy did.

We broke up again during January of this year and just got back together recently. The issue is, we only have sex about once a month now, whereas it was a lot more before.

She's currently stressed out about a co-op placement she has, and I have a summer internship at a well-known tech firm which pays well. I see her several times a week but I feel like it's just not the same as it was before.

Long story short, whenever we're together we're miserable, but when we're apart we're even more miserable. I'm just wondering if these things will stabilize or if I should just dump ship and put up with being depressed for an undetermined amount of time before I find someone else. I've tried online dating to no avail, and none of my friends know any Women who I find attractive.

**tl;dr** Broke up with my girlfriend 3 times. Still dating her. Can't seem to meet any other women. Extremely depressed when I'm single. Shyness issues. Not sure what I should do. Obvious answer is break up again, but that never worked before.

Other shit I should mention: Her family and friends hate me. She told them I'm an asshole after the 1st and 2nd time we broke up, and now they won't talk to me. She also told a lot of my friends, so as it currently stands, I have zero high school friends I currently talk to besides her."

I am still interviewing as I would like to land a programming/soft. eng. position; I love programming. I will accept this position which starts in about a month, as the company is reputable and I need the money (30k+ student/CC debt).

I am just seeking for general advice. I would like to work as a software engineer, and I believe I have what it takes to be successful in a Soft. engineer position. Sadly, the first half of degree I did bad academically (major health anxiety for the first 2 years, depression, immaturity), but after my first internship I realized that this was what I wanted to do with my life and my passion for programming grew and still grows (I've been part of hackathons and enjoy reading about technology). I was able to raise my GPA from 2.3 to 2.85.

1ehlj6,1,2013-05-16,I want to move back to Columbus and get my life back on track but I don't know if it's even a possibility now.,[deleted],Columbus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/1ehlj6/i_want_to_move_back_to_columbus_and_get_my_life/,"I don't know if this is something you guys care about frankly but I just want an opinion from a few of you guys who might.

Start of my story I guess. I am 20 years old. I grew up in a decent sized town called Parkersburg, WV. Every since I was in 7th grade I've battled a growing depression starting with a teacher who told me my goal of being an Aerospace Engineer was stupid and that I should look for something closer to home. I was a straight A student... until that point. I started slacking, not caring.

When I was in high school I didn't apply myself at all. I graduated with a 2.98, not because I didn't know the material, but because I had stopped caring. By that point I'd decided I wanted to be an IT because I had fallen in love with doing computer work. I took the ACT, nooked a 28, and landed a scholarship at DeVry.

After looking things over I decided I wanted to major in Computer Engineering. My aunt helped me land a job at SIS as an intern IT and I moved to Columbus. I got an apartment through DeVry with other students (they don't have housing). All was fine, I loved my job, I loved my classes.

I lived in that apartment for about 3 months. The roommates who at first seemed pretty cool turned out to be douchebags. They would just be general douchebags and then they would drink and smoke and turn into even worse douchebags. It finally got to the point where I couldn't handle it. I called the housing rep and talked to her about it and she moved me from Pickerington to Grove City to live with a different set of students.

These guys were really cool. I hung out with them a decent amount while I was at home and typically enjoyed there company. We had that one sketchy roommate that really bugged me though. He was never home when I was and just always seemed off. First I started noticing little things missing.

The night before Christmas break I got the last $50 out of my account so I could fill up my tank and go home to be with my family. I left that money under my keyboard while I went to work. When I got home from work that money was gone. The other 2 roommates had already left the weekend before that to be with their family and he was gone. I knew he had taken it. I had a friend drive all the way from the outskirts of Hilliard to give me gas so I could go back to WV to be with my family for Christmas.

Upon returning home after Christmas break I found that my laptop was gone. He had come home and taken a $1,200 laptop and ran off with it. I was furious. I packed all my shit and moved it to my cousins house over night whom I'd called as soon as I got home and found that. I called the next morning to tell the housing person that I was giving up and I was leaving their services. I spent all my extra money to break the lease and got out.

While this was happening in that apartment I was starting into programming classes. I decided that I hated programming with a passion and I wanted to just switch to an IT or Cisco program because that's what I enjoyed. Well DeVry didn't offer what I wanted so after finding out I had to ditch that apartment as well I decided that I would just find a different school to go to.

I was advised that Strayer University was a good school. I went and talked to them and everything seemed cool. I got classes scheduled and got to work taking only online classes that semester. Well I started getting calls from Strayer wanting me to pay so much money right then for this loan and what not. They continued to dick around with me and I knew I needed out before they ate all my money. I'm still getting calls from them trying to collect money that I shouldn't owe because of deferment.

At this point I gave up. I'd been living with my cousins for 6 months and had tried my hardest to find another place to live. I still had my job, which I loved and payed well. I was having no luck finding another place to live and I just finally decided I needed to move back home, go to WVUP (a branch off of WVU) and live around my old friends and family.

Bad idea. All of my good old friends are gone. The few that are still here never want to do anything anymore. My family has helped me out financially some when I need it but overall has just been driving me up the walls. They hound me constantly about not having a job. I've been applying literally everywhere. I either never get a reply or they refuse to work around a school schedule. I'm not happy. I've gotten myself into a slump where I don't have money and I can't do anything about it. I've had my phone shut off for several months and I recently shut off my internet.

I had a roommate for 2 months. She bailed on me a month ago without paying me the rent that she owed me from the month before (which her dad finally gave me a couple days ago) and without a notice. I was stuck, I only had the money planned out for half until my next set of student loans and the rest had been used doing things with my girlfriend.

I now realize that I made the worst decision in my life. I moved back home where I felt like I would feel comfortable and I let myself get to comfortable. I let my parents help me out here and there and lost all the motive that I had when I lived away and was completely fending for myself. I left a great job and all my great opportunities back in Columbus. I left the good friends that I had met and grown very fond of when I'd lived there.

At this point I realize that I should have probably just switched to OSU and stayed working at my old job. I left on very good terms and believe that I would have a high possibility of getting back on there. If not I feel as though I would be able to find something before I moved back up there because there are so many more job opportunities in the area. I need to be back to where I am forcing myself to hold a budget and I am fending for myself.

The major problem I have left is money... I have nothing. I have $15 and an empty gas tank. I have 2 months left on my lease and I owe my mother $165 for the utilities I couldn't pay this month. Even if I decided to do all this and I got a job lined up and classes scheduled I would be screwed trying to find a place to live. I don't have money for a deposit and I don't have money to pay out my lease here. 

So basically what I'm saying here is I don't know what to do. This isn't a plea for help, this isn't me begging for a couch to piggyback on, this isn't me trying to get a load off my chest (even though it kinda is helping xD). This is just me trying to get an opinion from some people who live in the area and are fairly well educated (I mean... it is Reddit) and have been through more than me.

TL:DR - I had shit luck with roommates here and there. I'm not happy with the direction I'm heading right now and I want to get back on a forward direction. I'm poor and I'm not sure if there is a way I can make this a reality. What should I do?"

1ehi1t,1,2013-05-16,What's under my seeming alcohol problem?,help___throwaway,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ehi1t/whats_under_my_seeming_alcohol_problem/,"I think I may have a problem with alcohol and other substance abuse. It's really weird too because my life seems to be going great on the surface. I'm 20 years old, going to be a junior studying abroad in Europe next fall, and have a really good programming internship for the summer. My family is really proud of me. I had been drinking heavily each weekend at college with my friends, and it seemed pretty normal but looking back it was definitely picking up towards the end. Everyone else kind of just saw me as the typical college ""bro"" drinker guy. I still got really good grades and stuff, but I always went the hardest on the weekends.

Ever since I moved in to my own apartment for the summer, I've been getting drunk every night for about two weeks. At first it just kind of felt like I was celebrating my newfound freedom, I could drink whenever I wanted to since I have a fake ID, etc.

But at this point it seems like it could be becoming a habit, and it's really worrying me. I just come home at 5, make dinner, and then drink for the rest of the night until I go to sleep. 

What the fuck is wrong with me? What is going on? I know I might have a problem with substances - I've gone through small periods of pills (opiates, amphetamines), chewing tobacco, etc. in the past, but it just seems to be whatever I can get ahold of at the time, and it would stop whenever the supply ran out.

I feel like I'm running from something. I don't know. Has anyone been in a similar situation? I don't know what to do."

I'm a 24 year old male, living in Chicago.  I've never had a job, I never went to college, I've never dated in my life or even been kissed on the cheek, and hell **I don't even know how to drive (which I'm so humiliated about, it kills me.  I lie to everyone that I have one, and I've cut off friendships for fear of them finding out).**  I'm stuck in a rut, and every day I'm more convinced that I'll never get out of it, and that my future holds nothing good.  I've been totally depressed for 10 years now, and I don't know where to even begin getting my life in order.  I've been plagued with horrible, horrible sleep problems for at least 20 years also, and I think that might be a major cause of it.

I spent several years after high school pursuing a career in Audio Engineering.  I realize now I was very half-hearted about it and didn't do ANYWHERE NEAR as much as I should have, due to depression and no motivation for the last 10 years.  But it wasn't until after about 3 years of self-studying that I started emailing audio school graduates and studios and everyone I could for advice or even an internship, that I had a big wake-up call and learned how absurdly lucky you have to be to ever have a stable job in that field nowadays, even if you're extremely talented, which I'm not.  **So I wasted a few years and am left with 100% unmarketable skills.**

I think half the reason I pursued that career in the first place is because I dread that daily question of ""So what do you do?"" to the point I get sick to my stomach.  I just wanted to live my life with something cool I could answer with, and what better than a field that combines technology with creativity, two things I've always been good with.  But now I'm to the point where I put off even getting a haircut, or cancel dentist appointments, anything I can to to avoid that god damn small talk question I get asked every time I leave my house.  I just never know what to say, aside from ""Nothing."" and it kills me.  **[[If anything, I'm hoping someone can atleast give me a little advice as to how to answer this question.  I know it sounds stupid, but it makes me feel like I've been punched in the stomach every someone asks.  And it's the first thing everyone always asks.]]**

I haven't had a social life in years.  **My last and best friend actually got me a job at a museum a few years ago, and we were going to carpool, but just before I was going to start, she was killed in a car accident.**  She'd planned to introduce me to all her friends there, but after that I just couldn't face meeting them with her gone, so I turned down the job.  I haven't really had a friend, or applied to a job since.

**I live in a disaster of a hoarder house, I don't even have my own room, I sleep on a couch now.**  My mom got a hoarding problem after she was given 2 years to live from cancer (which she made a full recovery from, though we still live in fear), and sold all her things and antique book collection only to regret it.  Now with my mom living with my grandparents (because of their failing health) and my dad always working and being a raging alcoholic when he's home, I'm trapped in this disaster of a house most people wouldn't even find livable.  I've spent the last few years just on my computer for almost every waking hour, trying to distract myself with movies, games and more recently books, in this crowded hoarder room so packed with stuff you can't even see the walls.  **I have anxiety fits when I'm trying to sleep, just over paranoia of my PC crashing one day (which i know is inevitable), and how much of a nightmare that would be to fix, as I'd have nothing left to do, and not even anywhere to sit aside from at the computer desk.**  Simply getting a single blue screen is enough to make me throw up with worry, and it takes a few days of no problems for me to relax again.

I've seen doctors, but they didn't help, at best.  **One increased my Zoloft prescription again and again, and finally told me to stop taking it entirely.**  I went through such bad withdrawal that I ended up in a hospital after a suicide attempt.  I see now he was a horrible doctor (and I've seen other bad doctors since then), and I don't even know where to begin looking for a good doctor, or even what kind of doctor to see.  A shrink, a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a sleep specialist?  I lose my health insurance in 4 months anyway though, so I suppose it doesn't matter.  I've been so depressed for so long, I feel like it's a permanent part of my personality and my way of thinking.

I'm not suicidal, but I can't help but think it's inevitable I reach that point.  This can't last forever, and I don't see light at the end of the tunnel.  Though I am plagued with awful, suicidal dreams about twice a week, that just kill me.  I've started drinking excessively the last few months, and smoking pot the last few weeks just to be able to get to sleep before sunrise, which I can rarely manage even on 48-hours awake.  **I couldn't even get myself out of bed to get my mom a mother's day card**, who I'm very close to but only see once a week at best.  She's probably more stressed and depressed than I am, having to take care of her dying parents every day, and I think she's starting to crack.

I constantly worry myself sick over so many things, that I couldn't even begin to list here.  **Even if I could find a job right now, and had a way of transportation, I don't think I could handle even part time.  And at this point, I just can't see myself ever enjoying life enough to work hard at it.**  I have no one to turn to, and I just don't know what to do.  Doctors didn't work out for me whatsoever.  My life is going so by so fast, and I can hardly stomach the idea of growing old, not to mention wasting my entire youth.  I'm taking such bad care of my health now, and part of the reason is because I really don't want to live past 60.  I don't think I could handle it.  I'm not suicidal, don't get me wrong, but I feel like my parents are the only thing I have left, and I'm just waiting for a time when even they're gone so I can end it.  

Nearly every single day, something bad happens, and I have yet another worry added to the pile.  Failing health in the family, the house falling apart.  **Electrical and cable problems, but the house is such a mess technicians can't get to the walls.**  There's so much more I wanted to mention, but I could easily triple this post, so I'm gonna stop here...  I just don't know... how to even begin making things a little better... I'm lost, and I feel like the only person in the world this pathetic. =[

**tl;dr: I'm 24, no college education, never had a job or a girlfriend, don't know how to drive, live in a hoarder house with an alcoholic father, I have no bedroom and sleep on a couch, have no friends and nowhere to go, so I spent all my waking hours on my computer in a crowded hoarder room, trying to distract myself.  Doctors and medication made me worse, I'm about to lose my insurance anyway.  I'm plagued with suicidal dreams on the rare times I can sleep.  Developing an alcohol and marijuana habit.  Family members are dying, the house is falling apart, I have no future, no plan, no hopes.**

Edit: Feel free to ask me anything.  I don't expect any replies to help, but I actually enjoy answering questions."
1elp9u,228,2013-05-18,Affirmations,Grakmarr,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1elp9u/affirmations/,"I became friends with Daniel, or Dan, in middle school. In the interest of full disclosure, Daniel was his middle name. His real first name, which he understandably hated, was Francis. Who the hell does that to their kid? Anyway, he had more working against him than just an unfortunate name. He was 5'5, 130 pounds soaking wet, wore glasses, stuttered, and was horribly awkward. I was no prize myself, six feet tall and fat as hell, man tits, second only to Dan in awkwardness. We had our share of common interests, but what really brought these two thirteen year old boys together was the realization that without each other we had no one. By staying close, we mitigated the amount of hell that could be directed toward either one of us individually. Instead of everyone ragging on me for being a landwhale or him for being a nerd, we split the attention between us. It was a mutually beneficial friendship, which lasted until shortly after we reached high school.

Before my freshman year, I joined the football team and started lifting weights. I was tired of the teasing, and willing to do whatever it took to be treated decently for a change. The end result was nothing miraculous, but between my subtle transformation and the respect of my new friends it was enough to keep me from being the target of mockery - some of the former bullies even seemed to want to make amends. My new life was going well for me, I just wish I could say the same was true for Dan.

Whereas I made changes to better my circumstances, everything seemed to be going downhill for him. He grew taller, which only made his already slim frame seem gaunt and sickly. His eyesight took a turn for the worse, and soon he was wearing thick rimmed glasses. His personal hygiene became somewhat... objectionable. I tried to remain casual friends with him out of respect for the help we had given each other over the years, but Dan became sullen and distant. Every once in a while he would call to congratulate me after our team won a game, and we would talk for a few minutes. But by and large, even perfunctory gestures like that were rare.


After high school, as it is wont to do, life happened. To wit: I got a shitty retail job, a shitty girlfriend, a shitty security job, an amazing girlfriend (fiancee, now), and a less shitty security job. I forgot all about the past, about school, about Daniel. Until a couple months ago.


I had been home from work for maybe an hour when my phone rang with a number I didn't recognize. Most folks would probably let something like that go to voicemail, but curiosity has always been a weakness of mine. When I answered, I was greeted by a confident baritone voice.


""[Grakmarr's real name]?""


I started to confirm, then asked to whom I was speaking. I don't owe money all over town or anything, but I'm reasonably sure there's a collection agency out there with my file buried in a stack somewhere.


The man on the line chuckled and answered, ""It's me, Daniel. From school.""


I replied cordially, and made all the typical long-time-no-talk greetings, but internally all I could do was wonder when that squeaky stutter of his turned into the used car salesman patter I was hearing on the line.


""I called because I was just thinking about old times,"" he continued, ""and how much of an ass I was to drift away from you like I did. I guess I was jealous that you found your place, while I was still struggling. I heard you're still in town. I was hoping we could grab some lunch and catch up. My treat.""


""Sure,"" I replied, ""Sounds great."" It didn't sound great at all; frankly I was happy to put those days behind me years ago - but again, curiosity. I had to know. We made the arrangements, and ended the call.


The next day I went to meet him for lunch at a local barbecue joint (there's one thing about the American southeast, you're never out of walking distance from a church or a pork sandwich) and started scanning the crowd for someone who looked like a decade-older version of my old friend, when a handsome stranger in a three-piece suit waved me over. As I walked toward him, the realization hit me.


""Holy shit... Daniel?""


He grinned, flashing perfectly white teeth. I made a mental note to smile with my mouth shut to hide the lifetime of nicotine and sugar damage, and plopped down in the seat across the table from him.


""Hey man,"" he said, ""You haven't changed a bit.""


I thought I caught a whiff of derision in the comment, but was willing to let it slide even if it wasn't my imagination. I *am* just an older version of what I was back then, and I was mistakenly expecting the same from him. Instead I got a young Johnny Depp in a cleaned and pressed suit that appeared to cost more than I make in a month. It's not that I expected someone nearing thirty to still have acne or anything, it's just that the characteristics by which I (and everyone else, I suppose) defined him had undergone such a radical transformation that he was wholly unrecognizable. Thick black-rimmed glasses had presumably been abandoned for contacts, lanky build now lithely coated with muscle evident even through the suit, and his quavering stutter a distant memory. It was my turn to stutter, now.


""So uh..."" I squinted, ""Wh-what's new?"" We shared the laugh of two people preparing to address the metaphorical elephant in the room. He told me everything; and enthralled, I let him go on at length. Evidently after high school he went on to earn his MBA, and became the VP of Global Sourcing (whatever that is) for a major local business. He was on the Board of Directors for a non-profit, and co-founded a scholarship program for gifted youths. When he was finally done catching me up on all of his numerous accomplishments, I asked the one question left unanswered: How?


""When I went away to college,"" he said through sips of his unsweetened tea, ""I learned about something called 'affirmations'. Basically you decide on a specific goal you want for yourself, and put it in writing multiple times throughout the course of the day."" He tapped a leather-bound notepad jutting just slightly out of his pants pocket while he spoke, ""You keep doing this every day until you've achieved your goal. It focuses your will, and doesn't let you lose sight of your objective until you've accomplished what you set out to do.""


I nodded, ""I've heard of that before, I've just never tried it. So it really worked for you?""


He grinned wider, ""It did. I think you have to really want it to, though. The more earnestly you do it, the more likely you are to succeed. Personally, it saved me. I was skeptical, it sounded really silly at first. Once I saw that it was working, I began to take it more seriously. What about you, anything new in your life?""


I told him about my boring job, and he listened politely. But when I started talking about my fiancee, his eyes lit up, and he seemed to be paying genuine attention.


""She sounds wonderful,"" he said, ""I'd love to meet her sometime.""


Now this woman is truly amazing, but she's the exact opposite of me in one regard: She is a complete social butterfly. She doesn't nag me about anything, except when it comes to my total lack of friends. And to my surprise, Daniel had turned out to be a seemingly awesome guy, so I excused myself from the table to see if she would be okay with having him over for dinner. She seemed delighted at the prospect, if a bit surprised, so I went back and made the offer to Dan.


""That would be excellent,"" he said, ""I'm looking forward to meeting the woman who could make your life so complete.""


Dan paid our bill and shook hands to part ways for the time being. As he extended his to mine, I couldn't help but notice the maze of shallow cuts along his palms and fingertips - but immediately shrugged it off. I tried to brace myself from drunkenly falling onto asphalt one time and ended up with something similar, so I know these things happen. But when he caught me studying his hands, he averted his gaze for the first time during our entire conversation, and quickly excused himself. Strange as that final exchange was, it was a pleasant nugget of schadenfreude to know that some of the old quirky kid was still left in him. We can never entirely outrun our past, after all.


I helped my fiancee with dinner as best I could, largely by staying out of her way, and got our little apartment ready for my old friend. Dan showed up right on time, clean-shaven and dressed almost as nicely as he was for lunch, and made the traditional platitudes about our humble home. I had no sooner mentioned my fiancee's whereabouts in the kitchen, when he made his way past me in a hurry to introduce himself. The two of them exchanged pleasantries, and we sat to eat.


We shared good food and good conversation, with no sign of the oddness Dan showed when we parted earlier, save for his occassional nervous petting of that same notebook  when my fiancee and I were addressing each other. I was beginning to wonder why he felt the need to bring it with him, but I supposed that's just what you do when you take a compulsion so seriously.


After dinner, my fiancee had slipped off for the night, and Daniel and I saw ourselves to the other room to have a chat and a few drinks. My hand tends to tip the whiskey bottle a bit heavier than the soda, so before long we were both more than a little inebriated. For me, this was any given Tuesday; but Dan seemed a bit less acclimated to the ways of the bottle, not to mention the six inches and god-knows-how-many-pound advantage I had on him. By the time the ice was melting on his third glass, he was stuttering like good ol' thirteen year old Francis again, and his conversation turned a little emotional. He started talking about his myriad failed attempts at romance. This was an unintended development on my part, but again: Schadenfreude. I'm not a perfect man, by any means.


""Remember the affirmations?"" He cocked his head toward me, green eyes squinted knowingly, left hand stroking his notebook, ""They do work. Just not for other people.""


""What do you mean,"" I asked, ""Other people can't use them to better themselves?""


He laughed bitterly and shook his head, ""No, anyone can do that. They don't work when you try to change other people.""


I furrowed my brow, figuring my old friend had imbibed far too much alcohol and was now intrepidly exploring gibberish territory, ""Well of course not. You can't just will someone to be different. People are who they are, there's no changing that.""


Dan jerked his head toward me, glaring, ""Everyone can change. Everyone *needs* to change. *You* changed. Someone *loves* you, now.""


There was venom punctuating his words, and little flecks of spittle as well. I really hate angry drunks, but he was my guest, so I tried my best to comfort him. ""Dan... I had to work at that too, buddy. That's not the kind of shit you just write down in some notebook and wait for it to happen. It takes patience, and an open heart. And yeah, sometimes you have to go through the wrong ones before you find the right one. I've ended up wounded plenty of times, but love is worth bleeding a little.""


He jerked up out of his chair at that, swaying back and forth slightly, stared me dead in the eyes and said, ""I've bled plenty. All I want is what you have, right here in your home. And I can't fucking make it happen.""


My mouth was trying to form words, but Dan was already headed toward my bathroom door. After it slammed shut behind him, I just sat in my chair staring at the floor. Poor guy really seemed to have issues, and I started feeling terrible for reveling in what faults of his remained.


When I finally looked up, I noticed that the notebook must have fallen from his pocket when he rose so suddenly. Curiosity engaged in a brief struggle with respect for the privacy of others, but ultimately won a decisive victory. I leaned out and snatched it up, and began to slowly leaf through the pages.


It started out much as I expected. The first dozen pages were neatly scripted in blue or black pen, repeating the same sort of sentences over and over again.


&gt;*I will pass my final exams. I will pass my final exams. I will pass my final exams.*
&gt;
&gt;*I will graduate college. I will graduate college. I will graduate college.*
&gt;
&gt;*I will stop stuttering. I will stop stuttering. I will stop stuttering.*

&gt;
&gt;*I will get my body into shape. I will get my body into shape. I will get my body into shape.*
&gt;
&gt;*I will get this promotion. I will get this promotion. I will get this promotion.*


After some more of this sort, the writing became a bit shaky. The letters grew jagged and seemingly rushed, and the margins of the paper were increasingly ignored.


&gt;*Kristen will say yes to a date. Kristen will say yes to a date. Kristen will say yes to a date.*


At this point I thought he had started using watercolors, the letters were thick and streaked with dark fingerprints.


&gt;*Rachael will go on a date with me. Rachael will go on a date with me. Rachael will go on a date with me.*
&gt;
&gt;*Elizabeth will fall in love with me. Elizabeth will fall in love with me. Elizabeth will fall in love with me.*


As I finally reached the last page with writing on it, I felt the contents of my stomach go into a spin cycle. The crimson characters hadn't had time to dry and darken like the ones on previous pages, and they streaked as my fingers brushed across them.


&gt;*I will have what HE has. I will have what HE has. I will have what HE has.*


I sat there, stunned, and became acutely aware of the bathroom and the occupant therein. I stood slowly, crept toward the threshold, and pressed my ear against the door. Silence.


""Dan?"" I whispered, ""You okay in there, buddy?"" Nothing.


I tried the knob, surprised to feel it turn in my hand. The door met resistance after opening less than a foot, and I hesitantly stuck my head in through the gap and looked around. Daniel lay there blocking the door, face down in a widening pool of his own blood, his hand extended toward the wall beside him. Choking back the pork tenderloin and whiskey threatening to make an oral exodus, I looked up to the wall - and read Daniel's final affirmation.


There was an investigation, of course. Dan was a very important man in the community, and I'm... not. But the suicide was about as cut and dry as they come; he even left a note, of sorts, on my wall. And the questions really died down after they examined his book. As far as the authorities and the media are concerned, the whole scandal is over. I wish I could say the same for me.


Often I'll dream about what I saw in the bathroom, and wake in the middle of the night. Sometimes when I have that dream, I'll try to sit up without waking my fiancee. When I do that, I swear I can see a scrawny little boy in glasses sneering at me from the corner of our bedroom; and I remember Daniel's final affirmation scrawled on that bloody wall.

&gt;*I will not leave.*
&gt;
&gt;*I will not leave.*
&gt;
&gt;*I will not*"

I wouldn't mind the job, but I've heard that software devs, getter better pay and better advancement over time.  Is this true?  Will my degree be able to get me into upper management in 10 years, or do I need to keep looking for a software company to work for?

Ideally I would receive a full time offer from Microsoft and stay in Seattle. However due to family health issues I don't know if I want to live that far from my home and family if something happens to them (I live in LA).

Anyways because of that I would like to work as close as possible to LA, but I don't want to throw away a great possible offer from MS if I can't find anything closer to home. 

So first of all is it even reasonable to think ill be able to get an offer from a company like google, FB, twitter, in the bay or LA area? I've had good internships but I'm from a mediocre state school with a mediocre GPA. Are there any networking events in LA where I could possibly make connections with googler's in the LA area?

Second if I start applying to companies closer to home when should I start? My internship ends in September. "

My only travel experiences so far have been 3 months in Italy for an internship during school, and two visits to small towns in Mexico (in Guanajuato and Puebla).

I have minimal student loans, only $8,000 left. Other expenses are rent, phone, and car ($16,000). With my budget, I've been saving $500 a month while paying off all my loans and debts.

My one and only goal is to pay everything off, save up a bit of money, and travel. I live frugally, and I don't have many possessions, and I'm even less attached to the ones I have (except musical instruments).

I want to travel, but I don't know anyone who does. Debt and loans are a CONSTANT daily thought in my mind. I don't want to go anywhere or do anything until they're paid off and I'm 100% free. Except for small trips, hiking, camping, little road trips, which I do when I can.

So I'm wondering about all of you...are you traveling with debt? Is it something you do when you have free time, then go back home and get a job? Am I going about this the right way? I want to live and experience life to the fullest, but I don't want anything weighing me down.

Translated using google translator.

An internal battle has shaken Labour and Social Services. It began with a missing handshake and ended with a written warning and damages of 30,000 kronor.

A trainee, directed by People's University, offered an internship in the integration unit. He came to visit to see the work and health of the employees.

But the visit was not developed as expected. When the female supervisor would welcome health intern, he refused to take her in hand. He referred to their religious beliefs that forbid him to take women in hand without having to wash up afterwards.

The female supervisor then announced the intern that he, in order to work at the workplace, must be able to take all the people in place. Possibility of subsequent hand washing is, so it should not be a problem, she said.

The trainee could not accept the decision and the Equality Ombudsman was connected. But before a notification could be established paid Trollhättan city paid 30 000 in damages. The female supervisor was awarded a written warning for violating the Trollhättans urban diversity.

Administration Said Niklund never hesitated before measures.

- The applicant explained that his religion forbade him to foreign women in hand. Based on the correct position, a person adversely affected by their religion entitled to damages. We made a mistake and took responsibility and the person received compensation.

Said Niklund refers to Trollhättan urban Equality and Diversity Plan, which was introduced at the beginning of the year.

- Indirect discrimination may be perceived as neutral but disadvantageous groups in practice, if one condition, he says, and points out that the trainees were disadvantaged because of their religion.

- He would get the internship provided that he takes women in hand. This was conditional internship placement.

Unable situation is solved in a different way than the warning to the supervisor and a large compensation?

- We had a dialogue with the trainee to repair the damage, for example with another internship. But the damage was already done.

One who does not think the issue is that simple is Lennart Andersson, former chairman of the Municipal Trollhättan. The last case before retiring was the missing handshake.

- I've never seen anything like it, he says and continues.

- One must ask the question of who has been wronged. In this case, it was not just the man but also the woman.

From the union's side tried to get the employer to not hand out a warning. The hearing ended in disagreement but Lennart Andersson thinking on.

- There are many questions. What is required to be available for work? Can you refuse to do certain things, and if so what?

Henrik Larsson, MWU new chairman, explains that the warning to the female supervisor does not have to mean anything.

- The employer may distribute a written warning although we are protesting. The burden of proof is not great. However, if the employer wants to proceed with other steps, then weigh the burden heavier.

The problems of integration unit now becomes the subject of a safety investigation.

- It has been created such anxiety in the working group to the senior safety has been switched on, says Henrik Larsson.

1ekvw8,0,2013-05-18,My degree pooped the bed and I want to pursue a masters while I work... what to do for a better job chance?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ekvw8/my_degree_pooped_the_bed_and_i_want_to_pursue_a/,"I graduated in December with a BA in Political Science. I had  a high GPA, glowing internship, 10 years of management experience, and numerous volunteer work experiences. This meant exactly squat in the job market. I was lucky to land a job with an investing firm totally outside my desired field that paid decent 18/hr. However, the job is caustic and the environment is unethical at best. I started April 1st and they seem to love me there, but the job and the 100-mile daily commute is killing me. I just can't work there or even in that industry forever. 

Seemingly, despite my love of political science, the degree itself has shit the bed. It applies to very little and employers take it with a grain of salt at best. If I want to truly utilize it the only sure bet seems to be a move to DC. That isn't going to happen. 

I want to get a masters.  A few fellow graduates in my major have been themselves eyeing an MBA. I just don't know that an MBA will anyone  that much. I know that anything will help more than my current incontinent degree, but I have been leaning towards a master In Computer Information Systems with a focus on computer science. I would take it at a local state college. 

My question is will this degree make me more employable in a fashion that will allow me some more choices in employment. The last time I applied for roughly 300+ jobs and had exactly one offer in something that I didn't really want but had no alternative.  

I just want to make myself more employable so I can move out of this shifty high-pressure investment field. 


Any help you can give me in diapering my wayward BA would certainly help me to recover from the shitty situation I find myself in currently.

Before I applied for that job, I applied for a (paid) internship that's also part-time. After I started working at job 1, I interviewed for that internship, and found out a few days ago that I got it. 

I need both to help with bills, but I have no idea how to ask my current manager to rearrange my schedule for a second job, especially since flexibility has been really important to me working there.

I'm supposed to start the internship Wednesday and work out my schedule then, so I can't tell my manager exactly what hours I need to work. I know it's just a shitty minimum wage job, but I really love the environment and my manager is fucking fantastic, but I don't want to miss out on an actually great opportunity.

1ek68c,1,2013-05-17,"I work in the film industry. I see people advertising all the time for unpaid ""interns"" to do GE/Electrical work. How legal is this?",OceansOnPluto,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1ek68c/i_work_in_the_film_industry_i_see_people/,"So, basically, I'm a production Assistant. I get coffee, drive pass vans, and pack up gear on reality shows (and any other miscelaneous things). On the film job boards, I see (ALL THE TIME) people advertising for PAs for free. It's usually labeled as ""Intern"" but the gist of it is you'll show up to this short film/radio event/tv show. Here's an example of an ad. 

""Exciting New Reality Show Seeks Talented Crew! (West Village)

An exciting new Reality Show, whose theme is a music producer competition, seeks a talented crew for an upcoming live taping at the legendary S.O.B.'s on Wednesday, 5/22/2013. This is a multi-camera shoot and the crew call time is at 4pm. There will also be a required, but brief, pre-production/crew meeting at S.O.B.'s on Saturday, 5/19/2013.

Production Assistant @ meal, copy and credit""

Even though I know hard it is to get gigs when you're just starting out, I have to wonder, how legal is this? In one of the comments, the guy mentioned it was for Hot 97, the music station....and if they're putting on an entire reality show, I would imagine they have some funding somewhere...

I use that example, but there are plenty of them, and lately I've been wondering how legal it is for a company to advertise for these types of things. 

I've also seen ads advertising for G&amp;E worker ""Interns"". These positions tend to be highly specialized, and usually command about 300-400 a day (It varies depending on what type of shoot you're on, but that's what I've heard GE guys I know talking about). The example below is a feature film which clearly has SOME people paid to do their jobs, but is advertising for more unpaid labor. 

""Seeking Grip interns for ULB Feature! I realize this position is unpaid, but will get you in the door for Grip &amp; Electric! Dates are 5/23, 5/28, 5/29 and 6/5. Please send resumes to kerry@**********.com

-And then below in the comments she wrote the following.

I have received several resumes from individuals that have G&amp;E experience, but not quite enough to be hired yet. It is important that these individuals have basic knowledge of G&amp;E so that they do not create more work for the dept. in the end. Get it?""

Again I don't know this whole situation, but this is what really set me off to wondering: From the ad and the comments, this seems like a FEATURE film, with SOME people getting paid, and even though they don't neccesarily have the budget for the massive crew they want, they're advertising for people with experience to work for free. But she says clearly there is a department, and you can't run a feature film with a full GE crew on nothing. 

And again, if it was a short film or a passion project where everyone was working for free, I would get it. But these don't seem to be the case. 

Lest you think it's just these two scenarios, I see this ALL THE TIME. People  on corporate jobs advertise for interns to do regular PA, AC, Camera, and Electrical work (I can't tell you how many people respond because I tend not to respond to those ads). 

I had thought I read somewhere that 1) Interns can provide no immediate benefit to the company hiring them, and 2) They must either be paid or given college credit.

That is really not the case with most of these shoots. I didn't think there was anything wrong with it until a friend gave the explanation that if someone wanted a job at a bank, it would be illegal for the bank to have them work as a teller for free for three months just to ""gain experience"". 

So basically....am I completely wrong and just don't know anything about labor law? If you have a company, need a worker, and just don't want to pay them, how legal is it to just call them an intern and not pay them?

TL;DR: Basically, can feature films and corporate jobs hire unpaid, off the books interns as free labor? In positions where they NEED a professional but don't have the money? And is that illegal?
----------------------

Edit: clarification on the TLDR."

I understand to do my own projects and put it online, but what I have done in class and what small little programs I make on my own aren't exactly comparing to the elaborate programs you look at on github or bitbucket.

And I have no work experience with programming, so would that just lead to a half empty page with the top section listing my school, GPA, and known languages, and my ""github"" link?

I know some of you must be in the same position now or have been in it and I am just asking for some direction. I do feel worthless, but I want to have some experience during college so my resume can actually look like a proper resume when I graduate.

Thanks for your time, you guys have helped me with so many other questions, and I appreciate the hospitality and helpfulness of this subreddit.

(freaked out, not crapped their pants\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0t3us?context=5)|In terms of people losing their shit, it doesn't really happen. It seems like a crazy idea at first, but if feels really familiar once you're in there. It also puts your body into a super relaxed place, so it's a really hard environment to lose your shit in.  You can see crazy visuals and hallucinations in the float tank, but there's no point where you feel like you're not in control, so it differs from a drug trip in that way.  People are really forgetful after they float though, so our lost and found is pretty impressive :)

A lot of those people have trouble quieting down that voice inside of their heads, and letting their body relax, and the float tank is amazing at helping you do that.
[How profitable is your business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0t5mf?context=5)|The business has been profitable from day one, pretty much.  We started with very little but it has been doing well.
[Have you thought about opening centers in other cities?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0t5mf?context=5)|There are about 100 centers in the US, so not enough. There should be at least one in every town.  The number is rapidly growing: attendance at the last 3 [float conferences](http://floatconference.com/) has doubled each year.
[How often do people pee in the tanks, and how would you know if they did?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0t5mf?context=5)|No one has peed in our tanks.  It would be hard to do.  We check the tanks after each person.  If they did, it would mean we would have to reschedule on a bunch of people and cost us a lot.
[Are there any long-term health effects (positive or negative\) to spending several hours a week floating in saltwater?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0t5mf?context=5)|Epsom salts have many medicinal properties.  The effects of regular deep relaxation are very positive for a number of health issues.  Right now we are working on a [fibromyalgia project](http://fibromyalgiaflotationproject.com/) because floating is insanely good for people with fibromyalgia.
[Not to dwell on this, but how would it be hard for someone to pee in a tank?  Seems like floating in water + extreme relaxation + privacy = primo time for bladder releasing.  Granted one would then be soaking in their own urine which could be enough of a deterrent...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0wcdw?context=5)|You are both very relaxed and very aware of your body.  It is hard for me to picture a situation where I could pee in the tank without noticing.  I have certainly felt the need to pee.  We have robes so folks can just go.  I bet with the amount of floats we run something will happen someday but knock on wood it doesn't.
[I can't tell if the pee thing is a joke. Nobody gets so relaxed that they just let it out? Wouldn't the salt/filters clean it out just like anything else in the water? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0wd6g?context=5)|It hasn't happened yet. I would be concerned about the smell.  You would have to will yourself to do it.
[I'm really excited about this AMA.  About answer 3: How much capital do you need to open a center in, say, California? Wine country + college town + float center = good idea.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca1lq9v?context=5)|You should definitely check out [floattanksolutions.com](http://www.floattanksolutions.com/). It's our website for answering people's questions about opening a float tank center. Feel free to give us a call as well. We're always happy to chat and help out.
[What about MS? As an MSer who refuses to use the current crop of toxic MS drugs, I'd like to know what effects Fibro patients are seeing? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0u111?context=5)|I'm not aware of any clinical studies about people with MS floating, but anecdotally, I've heard a lot about considerable pain relief from MS using float tanks.
 |The small pilot study that went on with Fibro showed pain relief from the beginning to the end of a float, and between floats. We're hoping to get some larger data with the new Fibro project that is going on internationally.
[Upvote for science!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0yave?context=5)|We're all about the science. We're all natural skeptics here at Float On, so we had to do our due diligence before accepting that these things weren't new age mumbo jumbo.
 |The nice thing is, these things have been around since the mid 50's, and spent their first 20 years exclusively in laboratories, so it was easy to find a lot of hard information on why float tanks are amazing.
[Oh heck yeah man! Where do I sign up!  &lt;--- Rhetorical question, I know I can bump over to your website and sign up, or roll in.  Alas, though, I am not in PDX.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0yrem?context=5)|There are lots of places to float around the world (relatively speaking). You might be surprised. Check out [floatationlocations.com](http://floatationlocations.com/), or just google the name of your city and ""float tank.""
[The fact that you want to see more flotation places, as you mentioned that you want to see one in every town, is frikkin awesome.  It shows that you are not a greedy corporate suit.  Upvote to you my good man. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0z5lt?context=5)|Thank you, sir. We're all about sharing knowledge and bringing floating to the people.
 |There's a whole section of our [float conference](http://floatconference.com/float-center-workshop/) specifically set up to help people get float centers up and running.
 |In fact, the whole float industry seems to be unusual in this way. Everyone is extremely cooperative and open with information. I guess floating helps you get a bit of perspective :)
[Is it allowed to go into the thant under the influence of drugs? If no, how do you make sure it doesn't happen? Are there any stories about people on drugs in the thanks? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tn1y?context=5)|I assume that you're under the influence right now, in which case let me ask: can people in the outside world tell? If you walked into a float center right now, would we be aware of your altered state?
 |If you behave yourself well enough that we can't tell, how would we know?
 |If you want some crazy tank + drug stories, look up Joe Rogan talking about tanks on youtube!
[I assume you've floated in these yourselves? What did you experience when floating in the tank? It seems like it would be really relaxing, but do you experience other things? Does your imagination kick in and trip you out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0t7of?context=5)|We love floating.  It's why we do what we do. So, yes, we have definitely floated in many different styles of tanks in several different countries.
 |It's super relaxing.  You lie in a dense solution of magnesium sulfate.  Your spine relaxes like an accordion.  Your joints decompress.
 |With no light, no sound, and no touch... your brain waves begin to slow down.  You rest in the theta state which has been known to help with creative release.  Some even experience visuals (not everyone, though).
[What tips can you provide for excellent facial hair maintenance? You obviously derive your power from your beards, and I wish to know your secrets.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0u9sd?context=5)|You've just asked the right question. It really is the secret to our success. A few of us even competed in the World Beard and Mustache Championships (when it was in Norway).
 |Not to encourage juicing, but pre-natal vitamins really promote hair growth.
[If William Hurt came in for a float, would you let him? If so, would you schedule him as the last client of the day, and/or make him pay a large up-front deposit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0ui2o?context=5)|We would just stock the float room with lots of goats and lock the door.
[Why are your float times so long? Do people really like to go for that long at a time? I feel like an hour would do me, then again, I haven't floated(yet\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0uek7?context=5)|Lots of places run hour long floats, but we really don't think it's long enough.  We get a lot of people surprised by an hour and a half, and then come out to tell us that it felt like 30-40 minutes. We also get a lot of requests for longer floats. Time really does fly by in there, and the longer you're in the better it feels :)
[Thank you so much for the answer! I'd love to stop by sometime, but unfortunately I'm on the other side of the country.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0ul39?context=5)|Hey there might be a place nearby.  Where are you located?
[Up in Northern Vermont. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0z3fk?context=5)|You might try giving [this place](http://floatationlocations.com/united-states/vermont/floating-on-brook/) a call. I'm not sure if they still exist anymore, though.
[Thank you. I'll definitely give it a try. Damn, you guys are awesome.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0zb66?context=5)|It's all the floating. We can't help it.
[I read about a discussion wether or not a integrated display inside a isolation tank might be useful at learning specific things like languages and other disciplines. In theory, deprivation of all external stimuli should aid your ability to focus. Do you think this would actually be beneficial or that other effects of isolation tanks like intense body sensations and perceptual distortions (some experience hallucinations\) might be to much of a distraction to improve cognitive learning?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0ukfk?context=5)|The most research on the first part of your question was done by the Dallas Cowboys in the 80s.  Players floated and watched videos of their performance.  According to the team, it helped immensely.  We had one person use our tanks to tune his musical ear, listing to specific notes while floating.
[How is the water in the isolation tank cleaned? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0ukfk?context=5)|The water is cleaned after each person with a cartridge filter.  Our pumps are powerful enough that the entire water in the tank goes through this filter system 3-4 times before anyone else gets in.  We also clean the water with hydrogen peroxide.  The fact that the water is so extremely salty does wonders to keep it clean.
[That's fascinating. I'm really pumped to use a tank for the first time soon.   *Most of our cleaning is dealing with the salt getting everywhere.*  I have a petty question about that. I do a lot of kickboxing and I play soccer regularly. On top of that I own a very strange cat. How worried should I be about getting in the tank with (little\) open wounds?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0uwxk?context=5)|If you are kick boxing your pain tolerance should be good enough to deal with a bit of salt stinging.  With that said we provide Vaseline to cover cuts, and the salt really helps heal said cuts up really fast if you man or woman up, hop in without covering the cuts up and let the salt do some work.
[*According to the team, it helped immensely.*  There's nothing like a good science experiment.  And that's nothing like a good science experiment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca11po1?context=5)|Look up studies on REST (Restricted Environmental Stimulation Therapy). That is the name that a lot of clinical studies on float tanks have been done. None of the studies had super large samples sizes, but they're still really interesting to look at.
[Anyone fall asleep in the tank? how do you keep them from drowning?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0wrwd?context=5)|The difference between sleep and deep meditation can be a fine line.  It is very difficult to submerge oneself because of the salt.  Also as soon as you get any near your eye, nose or mouth, you will be very aware and need to get out of the tank.
[What's the longest float you know of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0vap2?context=5)|We have had someone come in and float 24 hours straight, and there are rumors that John Lilly did a 2 week float using an IV way back in the day, but for sure a 24 hour float has happened at Float On.  The Float Tank was first created in 1954 and the first commercial tank was released in the early 70's.
[How do you regulate the temperature in the water/pod?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0vap2?context=5)|Different tanks use different methods, but the most common method is a set of water bed heaters under the liner.
[How did they feel after 24 hours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0vlij?context=5)|He said time was very silky, and had used the time to recover from a very long walk, which worked quite well.  Words and language take a bit of a backseat after that long in a tank, so not so sadly he was not a sound byte machine when emerging from a day in the tank.
[Are they impractical to have personal tanks at home?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0vlij?context=5)|You need to be really committed to have a tank in your house, for a few reasons.  Cost, space, how close to a shower you can get it, salt is going to destroy things, and you need to float a lot before you are going to save money over visiting a center and letting them deal with the rest of it.
[One more question. Excluding rent since that varies, how much would you advise a new float business to have on hand before attempting to open a float center? Say in a popular but underserved city. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0w2f7?context=5)|That is going to depend hugely on how many people are on your payroll and how many tanks you want to have.  We shoestringed and bootstrapped to make this one happen.
[Where can I find cool shades to coordinate with my outfits, Float On guys? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tf37?context=5)|At our shop!  Come to Portland! 
[Is there a prize system? Like, save five shades and trade them for a mustache ride? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0th76?context=5)|You can definitely earn a mustache ride, but it involves a very hairy punch card.
[Have you read The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown?  Did the bit about the bad guy spending time in the sensory deprivation tank bug you as much as it did me?  Do you think Dan Brown is perhaps America's worst author?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0u49b?context=5)|Yes, yes, and yes.
[How does the experience relate to a DMT trip? Is there any ""mind fuck"" ?  I feel like going in a flotation tank would be claustrophobic and kind of scary. Is it as scary as it sounds?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0v52k?context=5)|The tank is only as scary as the voice inside your head... So for me not so scary, for you...who knows.  In all honesty though claustrophobia is typically more about control than it is about space, and you are in total control of the whole thing.
[So can you open it up whenever you want?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca1gbc2?context=5)|Absolutely.  No locks or no latches on the tanks.  You are in complete control.  Of course, there is a client controlled lock on the main door to the float room... we want clients to feel comfortable (being naked and what not).
 |That's right. You just push the door and it opens. No locks or latches.
[How much does it cost to build and maintain a single tank? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0udj6?context=5)|It will probably cost you somewhere in the 2k-5k range to build your own float tank (with a decent amount of planning and handiwork).
 |The salt you'll need to fill it for the first time will be about $500. After that, they don't cost a lot to maintain. If it's just you and a couple other people floating, all you really need is about 50 pounds of salt a month, a few pool chemicals, and a tiny bit of electricity cost from running the heaters and the pump.
[As someone who wants to have his own float tank one day, which route/option would you suggest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0x13p?context=5)|Have you floated before?  I would start there, if you haven't.
[How feasible do you think it is to build on my own? I'd definitely consider it due to the cost but my biggest concern would be about making sure that the quality is up to par. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0xhuz?context=5)|You are basically making a box with a heating element.  Everything beyond that is up to you.  The cheapest tanks are usually wood with a pond liner and some water bed heaters.  Fiberglass is another common option.
[Has anyone requested music? Sure, this defeats one element of its purposes, but having something made for a meditative state like Filosofem piped in during a float sounds awesome.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0u7q6?context=5)|People can bring music in if they like.  We strongly suggest that people try a float in silence first, just to get a sense of it.  
[How does that work?  Can you bring an ipod and have it plugged in?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca176l5?context=5)|Exactamundo.
[Has anybody ever pooped in it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tkyp?context=5)|Nope!  Thank goodness!  We check the tanks after each person.  Also a filtration system cleans the water after each person.
[What would you do if somebody did poop in it?   How would you decide who gets the privilege of cleaning it up? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca19fah?context=5)|I was going to say that sounds like an intern task but I would actually make the owners do cowboy-ninja-bear to determine that one.  I'd imagine that the cleanup would depend on the nature of the feces.  We would probably have to throw out all the precious precious water.  :(
 |The water is filtered after each person so if they don't wash their butt enough your tank is still clean.
[How do you feel about people wanting to experience different types of drugs in your facility?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tgsr?context=5)|Wanting to do drugs is absolutely fine! Unfortunately, federal law frowns on actually doing them, and we have to take the same stance...
 |Legal drugs, like marijuana (with a medical card in Oregon) can be great for relaxing into the float, but a lot of people, after trying it, actually prefer doing the tank a la carte.
[Could you actually replace your bed with one of these tanks?  I guess it would help you a lot, but... will it be safe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0xpnp?context=5)|There is one person I know of that did this for an extend period of time, but she was already quite experienced with the tank, and living a crazy exhausting life style, I think it is possible, but not for too many people.  
[What are possible drawbacks you're thinking of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0ygoi?context=5)|Since the float tank promotes such a meditative state, it can be hard to actually slip into REM, which of course your body needs.
 |If you float every night for long periods of time, eventually your body will be able to easily slip into REM in there.
 |I've heard of one woman who slept in her tank every night, and then had trouble sleeping when she traveled because no bed was as comfortable as being in a float tank.
[What are your thoughts on the use of the sensory deprivation chamber on Fringe? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0yabi?context=5)|I've only seen a youtube clip, but it's a lot less spooky than that. For one thing, we don't lock you in.
[You guys need to get an Olympic sized float tank.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0y2jl?context=5)|Do I hear a kickstarter in the making?

I remember watching that episode before ever knowing about float tanks, so I guess even in my own life, the Simpsons did it first.
 |They're a lot bigger than pictured in that episode, and we only put 1/4 of our customers on the back of moving trucks.
[I have to ask - how often do people have sex in these tubs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tiig?context=5)|That would be a salty and chaffing experience.  We only run solo floats.
[Is there such a thing as double (or group\) float?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tpzg?context=5)|We don't do those at our center.  They do exist.  It's different than floating by yourself.  I find it a little distracting but to each their own!
[I want to start a float tank business in my town. It's a town of 300,000. Can I ask you questions in private? I have no idea what I'm doing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0wwcz?context=5)|Feel free to PM us.

[How do people react when their float ends and they are ""woken up""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0yrdi?context=5)|Most people are really surprised that an hour and a half actually went by. Pretty much everyone feels super relaxed, and would hop right back in if we let them :)
[Oh, well. No one saying stuff like ""I was relaxing; you woke me up. *I hate you!*""? :D.  How do you wake people up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0ywyn?context=5)|We fade music into the tank. Each tank has transducer speakers that are below the water line, so it's actually a pretty neat experience to have sensory stimulation eased in like that after suck a long time without.
[How sound absorbent are the tanks compared to anechoic chambers ? I remember reading that most people couldn't bear to be in them for more than a few minutes and would think that with the deprivation of the other senses it should be even more uncomfortable. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0wzjj?context=5)|The tanks are no -7 decibels but they are very quiet, a lot of the sound reduction comes from how you build the room, and we also have our tanks on sound isolators that keep the vibrations that come from the floor out.
[What are the age limits in the tanks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0w8sv?context=5)|There really are no age limits.
 |When it comes down to it, you're just floating in water and Epsom Salt.
[Yeah, i live up in Vancouver and I've heard a bunch about these tanks but I wasnt sure how old you need to be. Whats the youngest person thats floated at your location?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0wg2r?context=5)|At least 8 but I think his mom was in the room with him.  A 12 year old was floating on a semi regular basis a while back.
[I have OCD related to being dosed with LSD...absurd I know. Would the experience in the tank be something I could handle?  Ie no wild psychedelic experiences?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0xg15?context=5)|You might have an experience but it is more mild than wild.  You are also very in control, being able to get in and out at your own pace and take a break any time you like.
[How intense are the visuals?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0xvv7?context=5)|Anywhere from no visuals at all, too Flying across the universe, to being a crow on a lake.
[Oh man, I've always wanted to try a sensory deprivation tank. Until I went to your website I thought ""I wonder if there are any in Portland"". Well now I know!  So my question; who is your favorite lawmaker to work with? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0x1k0?context=5)|We have yet to deal too directly with any specific lawmaker, but I am a fan of a few specific politicians totally seperately from Float On. Elizabeth Warren, Dennis Kucinich, Ron Widen and Alan Grayson would be awesome to work with towards making opening float centers easier.
[Open one on the east coast? How much do you think that would cost?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0xl9l?context=5)|Depends a lot on the city, Manhattan versus some suburb of Atlanta are going to be two very different beasts.  With that said what tank style you choose, whether they are new or used, and how much work you do yourself versus hiring people are also going to be huge deciding factors regardless of where you end up opening.
[Cool. I wonder if their is anything nearby NYC.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0y2gt?context=5)|There are definitely a couple small places in NYC. Google that shit!
[I love the idea of sensory deprivation tanks but many of my friends think they would be too claustrophobic to even give it a try. Is claustrophobia a big concern of first time customers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0we1t?context=5)|It's something that everyone is concerned about being a problem that doesn't actually turn out to be a problem.  The main thing is knowing that you can get in and out.  Are they claustrophobic when they sit in a car or when they take a shower?
[Could someone bring goggles in and swim around?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0yqrj?context=5)|I routinely do laps in there as my morning exercise. With only 8 feet of length, you can get a couple thousand in before breakfast.
 |You have to be careful around the lifeguard though, he has a strict ""no splashing"" policy.
[As a supplier of sensory isolation tanks, do you know if there is still much scientific interest and activity in the consciousness experiments of Dr John C Lilly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0z2cs?context=5)|Interest - I think so. Activity - not as much, it seems. Are you thinking of something specifically? John Lilly did a lot of crazy stuff...
[I'm surprised I haven't heard of you guys before this, and I live in Tigard. Do you guys not run advertisements?

[How bad does the water taste with all the salt? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca13vty?context=5)|It's pretty intense.  It's magnesium sulfate (no sodium), so it doesn't really taste salty.
[Is it true if your placed in a sensory deprivation tank where you can't even hear yourself talk outside, that eventually you go crazy and want to commit suicide?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0yjw3?context=5)|Not that I know of, but I guess anything's possible.
 |There are some old myths about sensory deprivation and torture, but they're mostly fabricated.
 |The original studies on sensory deprivation involved people being put into dark rooms and told to lie on beds with cardboard and cotton all around them for incredibly long periods of time. It seems like most of people's anxiety and discomfort came from the laboratory settings and the fact that you're lying wrapped in cardboard for 24 hours.
 |The salt water we use nowadays is basically the most comfortable thing we've been able to come up with as humans. Once we invent anti-gravity machines, we might switch to that.
 |We now have people float for incredibly long periods of time who have amazing experiences. The record at our shop is a 24 hour float. The dude came out and said he thinks he can go for 48.
[What do they do about food/ water? Seems like you might get hungry or thirsty after a long period of time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0zm3k?context=5)|We advise people to eat 30-90 minutes before coming in, so you both don't have to listen to yourself digest, and are not getting hungry mid float.  For longer floats your body is in such a state of rest you just don't need the same amount of calories as you normally would.
[How tall and wide are the tanks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca2fa4y?context=5)|The tanks range form about 4-8 feet wide, and also 4-8 feet tall.
[Doesn't bouncing into the side of the tank cause sensation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca2fa4y?context=5)|You bounce a little at first, but if you don't push off the walls, you get centered pretty quickly, and then you're good.
[I am quite late, but do you float against the side of the tank? Doesn't it interrupt the relaxation? I want to do this so much!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca14oso?context=5)|You end up getting centered pretty quickly, and then not really hitting the sides.
[I've been interested in these Tanks for a while now. I know it relaxes you but is their any other long term effects at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca17nfs?context=5)|Absolutely. Basically curbing the effects of stress on your body consistently has incredible long term improvements. Look up research on REST (Restricted Environment Stimulation Therapy).
[Are there any at-home substitutes for those of us who aren't near a floatation center?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca10gax?context=5)|It can be hard to replicate at home, but basically just try to cut out as much sensory input as you can: dark room, no noise, a really comfortable bed, etc.
[How about doing a GroupOn for $10 USD for one hour, but that hour must be between 2 and 8 am? That way you can get lots of potential new customers, without antagonizing your user base.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca1yjyp?context=5)|We already float people between 2 and 8 am :)

[I'll be stopping in the next time I head up to Portland. Want me to bring you guys anything from the Rogue Valley?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca16vfb?context=5)|Heck yeah!  Bring yourself in for a float.
[Really want to try this. So cool.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0trun?context=5)|Come on over to Portland! Best known for float tanks, beer, and strip clubs.
 |Of course, there are also many other little float centers located around the US where you can experience the sweet awesomeness that is floating.
[My wife goes to this place occassionally and finds it to be a very positive experience. She considers herself midly claustrophobic. One of the tanks is apparently more of an open room, but it is dark. She likes that a lot.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tws8?context=5)|That's great! We get a lot of people worried about claustrophobia before they hop in the tank, but then almost no one who actually has a problem with it once they're in there. You can open the door to the tank at any time, so you're really in total control of everything. The pregnant ladies love to float. There's actually a certain position in there that takes all the weight of the the mother's stomach off of her body. We even had one woman say she really got to know her child for the first time in the tank...woah...
[Also, when she was deep into pregnancy and was uncomfortably huge, floating was a great relief.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tws8?context=5)|

I am a recent college grad (2 weeks ago! Whoo!) that has moved back home to Tulsa to attend the OSU-Tulsa campus for graduate school. 

These student loans aren't going to pay themselves back, so I am looking for a full/part time position, preferably in the metro Tulsa area. I've been using the traditional newspaper and craigslist routes, but i figured it wouldn't hurt to reddit network a little bit!

I have substantial experience in receptionist/clerical work, having done both for the past two years in work study positions at my university. I'd love to do more work in this area but I am open to other opportunities in any other areas you might be aware of.

I'm courteous, professional, and extremely technology proficient. I did well in school (graduated magna cum laude) and have done both retail sales and non-profit internships to round out my professional background. 

I can offer receptionist work, data entry, knowledge of Microsoft Office Suite, filing, multi-line phone use, and any other kind of office work that might be needed. If it's not something I know how to do already, I will be eager to learn. 

I'd be happy to supply you with my resume upon request. If you know of any opportunities I could look into, I would be very appreciative.

Have a great day!"

1enmsw,7,2013-05-19,I'm not sure if...,throwaway23446756,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1enmsw/im_not_sure_if/,"I'm 20 years old. For the last 6-7 years of my life, I can easily say that I considered suicide to be an option. An easy way out if things get too tough. As an atheist, the idea of my consciousness ceasing to exist is pretty appealing whenever I'm going through hardships in life. 

I've actually had a pretty good life so far. My parents are not too wealthy but they make a decent living... decent enough to send me abroad to US for college. My social life has never been better but it still isn't amazing. Never had a girlfriend. I always had mild-to-moderate social anxiety and still do, but I manage to be more social now. I've had girls wanting to get into a relationship but never the girls that I'm interested in or found attractive. I have a good internship waiting for me right now. I'll start in a month and live in San Francisco, making a decent amount of money.

I never had a good relationship with my father. We just can't get along. He can't get along with anyone. He can't get along with with my mother or with his sister or with his parents. My parents have a dysfunctional marriage and I've been told by both of them separately that the only reason they are together is me. I'm the only kid in the family and growing up, I would hear them fight and yell at each other every three months or so. After having some stronger fights with my dad, he told me that he will get divorced from my mom after my college education is over. He said this in the spur of the moment, no decision or anything but he says he won't support me or my mother after my graduation. This wouldn't be that easy, of course. Legal obstacles, family pressure etc. My mom also says the same thing... that she's still with my dad because he pays my tuition. He is not abusive or anything. He is just a negligent and rude asshole. Strangely enough, my mom's family is moderately wealthy too so we can afford the tuition either way but she would have to ask my grandma.

So far, not too bad, right. Well, everything is getting harder now. I'll graduate in two years and many problems recently emerged. My mom has a kidney disease called nephrotic syndrome. That's why she has been especially down and depressed lately. My dad is supportive but he's still an inconsiderate asshole. I've reason to believe that he cheated on my mom when I was younger. My mom on the other hand sincerely loves me and is a great human being. She gets angry easily and says things in the spur of the moment but I have no doubt that she has immaculate intentions all the time and I love her.

I've always been very close with my mother. As a kid, I would tell her that I loved her like every two minutes. As an anti-social kid, I spent a lot of my time at home and this brought us even closer I guess. Obviously my leaving for college was very hard on her. That's why we got a dog before I left. They get along very well and they are very dependent on each other. Two days ago, my mom had chest pains so I drove her to the hospital. As the avid smoker she is, we knew she was at risk. It's not cancer but she developed pneumothorax and had to spend the night at the hospital. I called my dad so that he comes to the hospital and spends time with her and he said he was on his way but he came in after four hours. I called him two hours in and he said he was somewhere on this way. My aunt called him and he said he was on his way but at an entirely different location, which is unacceptable. My mom had a nervous breakdown at the hospital bed because of this and stress of everything combined. They both spent the night there and I went back home. However my dad insisted on going to work the next day. We had a huge fight and I got him to spend the next day there too. He is there with her even right now. Other members of my family (grandparents, my aunt, her cousin etc) are also visiting and supporting her. She is going through a lot of pain and trying to endure it as she has some operations to drain the liquid from her lungs etc. My dad is still there, trying to be supportive but also still being an asshole even though it is to a lesser extent.

I've been taking care of our dog which I love and cherish. She misses my mom and it breaks my heart. I try to be supportive and play with her all the time but I'm not mom -- I can't do a lot of the things she can do. Today my cousin came over and he dropped one of his ""workout supplement"" pills. It is just amino acids and it shouldn't be a huge danger but it got me very worried. As a psychopharmacology-enthusiast (aka informed occasional drug abuser, will get to that later) I looked up all the amino-acids and found out that the risk profile is low. It is unlikely that she'll get any harm from it but she'll get some effects like stimulation followed by sleepiness. Even though I shouldn't be greatly worried, she took a lot for her body mass. I took her out for a run and she was very stimulated and agitated. I had to hold her back using the leash and even though I didn't hurt her or anything, it broke my heart doing that. I hate being assertive with her. It feels like I'm breaking her heart. She is so happy and full of life, smiling. It was very hard to bring her back into the house because she wasn't cooperative and this entire situation demoralized me even further. My mom will probably be in the hospital for at least 4-5 more days and I hope she gets better, and that my dog is totally fine tomorrow morning. But even the best case scenario happening, I don't see myself having an happy/ideal/comfortable future ahead of me and ceasing to exist looks like a great option. I feel lonely.

I don't know if my mental psyche has a text-book definition but I don't think I'm depressed. I'm prescribed ADHD medication and I can feel better if I decide to take them now but it doesn't feel like real happiness. It's just synthetic euphoria. I usually just use them to study or socialize. Throughout the last year, I smoked weed once daily before going to bed and it helps me immensely but I don't have access to it right now. I also experimented with psychedelics, hoping that they would make me a better person, let me discover myself, solve my inner-problems but they didn't help either. Even when high on cannabis, I still feel an emptiness inside me. I'm missing some integral part of what I want out of life. I need to change, I need to change something.

I've thought about just running away. Just getting a good amount of money, assuming a false identity and traveling across the globe... however far that money takes me. But the problem there is with that is that I'll be alive and I'll think about how sad my parents (especially mom, I don't care that much about my dad) are because I did what I did. They'll feel the same way if I kill myself but at least I won't exist to see it. I don't even know how I would kill myself. I would have to guarantee it. I would probably buy a lot of heroin, use for a long time until my tolerance is too high. Overdose and jump off of a bridge or something.

I feel empty. I feel like my future is in danger. I feel like I'll never truly be happy. If my parents stop supporting me, or if I don't have a job when I graduate, I'll have to go back to my country and I don't want to. But also not going back means my mom will miss me even more and she might need me both emotionally and physically.

I realize this is a huge wall of text but thanks for reading. For others... TL;DR: I'm thinking of ending my life.

1en8w6,2,2013-05-19,A rant/dilemma after a rough day,JCAPS766,KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1en8w6/a_rantdilemma_after_a_rough_day/,"For what it's worth, I'm 21, I haven't been to culinary school, and I've been working at pantry in an upscale bar and grill for about 2 months now.  I'm living at home while taking time off from college, and I got a job at a restaurant for the months that I'm home because I love cooking and I figured it would be something better to do than sitting on my ass all day feeling sorry for myself.  It's been a rough two months, but I think I've been getting a lot better.  

My boss has said the restaurant (a relatively new one) hasn't been doing so well lately, and everyone's hours have been getting cut.  I'm the low guy on the totem pole and probably one of the least competent, so I've gone from 35-40 hours a week to a bit over 20.  This is not a huge deal for me, since my paychecks are just going into my spending money and savings, and I'm fortunate enough to have my folks still supporting and feeding me and such.  For other people, though, I imagine the cut hours mean a lot more.

Yesterday was a crazy day at the restaurant.  One of the relatively new people got fired during the shift (he just really wasn't cutting it), and towards the end of the shift, one of the line cooks went batshit over something and flipped out/ragequitted (for the night at least, since it was at the end of the night). 

After all this, it really dawned on me that I'm carrying a good deal of responsibility on my shoulders.  I'm working alongside people whose paychecks go to actually putting food on the table, and I'm taking up a share of a limited number of man-hours which the restaurant can employ.  The thing is, I'm pretty sure I can get a job with better money doing work more often associated with people my age (being the 'intern' at an office).  I'm currently battling depression, however, and I think that sitting at a desk brooding all day wouldn't be good for me.

I don't feel like I'm a waste of man-hours, and I'm not a big detriment to the kitchen (if I was either of these things, I'm pretty sure my boss would have let me go by now).  Moreover, I'm pretty sure I'm making less than my co-workers (and rightfully so), so my hours cost the restaurant less than everyone else's.  But I feel a bit guilty about holding this job in this economy and while the other folks in the kitchen actually have their paychecks going to feeding, clothing, and housing people.


I know I don't belong in this industry long-term, and I don't intend to be here long-term.  I'm a good cook and I do my best as a worker, but I know that I won't be happy working my ass off like this for years to come.  I'm just trying to do my best until the time comes for me to go back to school.  But I'm wondering if it would make things a lot easier in the restaurant for me to go work at an internship like the rest of my friends are instead of having a job with consequence and where my co-workers' paychecks actually mean something.

Would I make things easier if I were to quit and work somewhere else?  Am I just exhaggerating things and making too big a deal out of there being poor job security in the industry?  Am I doing the wrong thing by being here in the first place when I don't intend to stick around long-term?"

I am a CS junior in university. I started a year and a half long full-time internship about 4 weeks ago. However, from the get go, I did not click with the company. The environment, I feel is not conducive for learning. I did not like the product, nor did I find people I could look up to or learn from. 

This isn't my first job, though it is my first CS job, so I'm not sure if the expectations I had were too high. My classmates who also took on internships have had a very different experience. My day-to-day routine is nothing related to software development, I can't help but feel that I may not learn even a small percentage of what I expected.

So here is my question - should I suck it up and stick it out? Since, any experience at this stage could be considered good experience. Or, should I look for something new?

I thought i'd take a couple of minutes to give you a rough idea what it's like to study engineering in germany, mainly because I find that it is quite different from studying in the U.S. from what i read here.

**General:**
I study chemE with focus on biotechnology at one of the [TU9](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TU9). I am currently in my sixth semester working on my Bachelor's thesis. I'm an active member of the students council and help other students with whatever they need to be successful in their studies.
**Edit:** In Germany it is absolutely uncommon not to get a master's degree. We had the ""Diplom"" before and as that took about 5 years, one is hardly considered a fully educated engineer without a master's degree. There are positions for bachelor's graduates tough, and also special combined programs working closely with industrial partners where you are part time at work in the company and part time at university and work full time once you got your bsc.

**Semester times:**
We have two semesters a year. Wintersemester from October through March, summersemester from april through september. Approximately half of that is filled with lectures. As a rule it should take 6 semesters to get your BSC, one of which is your thesis. Enrollment for most engineering programs only in the wintersemester.


**Lectures:**
We have approximately 6 different lectures per semester. Some of them come with extra classes where a TA shows how to solve problems and/or tutoring where you can solve problems yourself in small groups. Generally it is good advice to go to lectures and take exams in the order designed by the school. There are hardly any classes where attending is mandatory. Nearly all lectures are taught in german only. (There is a mechE program completely in english tough, and us chemE's have the same maths classes, so you could go ahead and attend those)


**Exams:**
Very unlike what I read here very often about a designated 'finals week' our exams are spread out over the entire time of the semester where there are no lectures. (I have had as little as a friday+weekend entirely free time after my second semester, most was about 4 weeks) This makes for about 2 weeks of studying time for each exam. This may seem odd to you, but from my experience, there are hardly any students that would pass the exams with significantly less time (they are frickin hard). Most exams are closed book closed notes but with formula sheets+ calculator. (Eg thermodynamics I + II closed book, closed notes, calc, formula sheet; higher mathematics i + II + III: lecturescript including notes + one published mathematical piece of literature + formula book + no calculator).


**Tuition:**
There is no tuition at most public universities. There is a relatively small administration fee (about 250€ per semester).


**Housing:**
There are dormrooms for as little as 150€ a month (9 m^2, including warm water and internet). Most people don't live in dorms, as there are not enough rooms available.


**Personal remarks:**
I am currently looking for an Internship abroad; unfortunately I want to intern during the winter. That makes it somewhat harder...


**TL;DR:**
Studying engineering in germany is quite different.

If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask!

I'm back home in Los Angeles after spending four months in a Disney internship in Florida. The program wasn't for me, but nonetheless gained some new friends, and independence that I didn't have before. I haven't been online here as much because I was so busy but I missed you all and I have missed gifting (even if as a college student my budget is small) since I wasn't making much money! 

I also gained a new relationship (blushes a lot), as I now have an incredible, kind and caring boyfriend. I met him online last October and he flew down to see me last month for a week. It was the happiest week of my life, so yeah, I'm a happy girl and I'm ready to gift because..... I'm going to England to visit him before the year is over! I've never been and am so excited, so I expect to make another contest when the date is closer asking you guys to let me know what places to visit!

Now enough of me jabbering and on to the contest! I start my job back here in two weeks, and with gas prices and car insurance and everything in between, I need some tips on how to save an ample amount of money  (per month, weekly, in general) for this trip to see him! I've checked the ""FRUGAL"" subreddit and haven't seen very good tips so I'm turning to you lovelies on here! Please link me something that is $5 (including shipping, I'm sorry I'm poor) and I will gift by MONDAY MAY 20th in the late morning/afternoon PST. I will choose the most helpful and doable/realistic tip in my opinion! Thanks in advance for your help :D

Also, have any of you been in a LD relationship? If so, has it turned out for the good? I'd love to hear some stories as I sometimes feel alone when my friends have their boyfriends here and I don't. Have a wonderful evening! xx"

I'm moving this week for a great summer internship (can provide proof) but I'm a little short on cash to cover all of my moving expenses. I'm currently waiting on some big transactions to post to my bank account that would give me the money I need, but I'm just looking to make sure I'll definitely have the money. I'm flying out on thursday, but rent on my current place is due on the first.

I have a loan I took out and paid back for the same amount last year, and I think 3 loans that I've granted to others that have been paid back as well.

I'm willing to give whatever proof necessary, there's also a fairly good chance I'll be able to pay back this loan early.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What was the worst accident youve had? Worst one in your shop that wasnt you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2ig71?context=5)|[Answered about cutting off my nose here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2iqv1)
 |The one that wasn't me, I was working on a film production and the producer showed up a week in advance in a very expensive suit and probably $2,000 shoes. He walked in my workshop as I was forging his pieces. I explained to him that it's dangerous and he shouldn't be there.
 |I put the red-hot metal over to the side of the forge. He walks over to a work bench and picks up a razor-sharp knife I made and runs it across the ball of the thumb cutting it to the bone while asking if it was sharp.
 |I take him to the first aid center, and bandage him up. He walks back to the workshop, picks uip the blocks of metal I had just forged for his production, fusing it to his hand. He shakes off the metal that's fused to the skin of his hand and immerses it into a big plastic tub of what he thinks is water.
 |It's actually a phosphoric acid pickle used for cleaning the metal. So he's cut his thumb, burned his hand and immersed it into acid.
 |Shop etiquette: when you come into the shop, assume everything is hot, sharp, poisonous, and offensively rude.
[What was your favorite build on the show? Least favorite?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hr6t?context=5)|Well the favorite build was Gimli's Axe, as I mentioned above. Pattern-welded steel.
 |My second favorite would have to be [Raphael's Sais](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-nI7xSmBHk). The bladesmithing, the forging of it required a lot of skill.
 |My least favorite would have to be [Captain America's Shield](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyFGE0Me9ug): due to time constraints it didn't come out as perfect as I like to make my work. I'd redo it correctly if given the chance. 
[How did you get into this line of work? Were you approached by film studios, or did you actively seek it out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2huks?context=5)|I started cutting gemstones and making jewelry from 7. At 13 I started cutting rocks professionally. At 15 I met the creator of the Conan swords, Jody Samson, who I pestered until he was willing to critique my work: a knife I made.
 |When I was 17 I went to a renaissance fair. Saw a guy making armor. He was using a railroad track as an anvil and modified hammers and chisels. He wanted $5,000 and a year's wait for a suit of armor. So I watched him work for a few hours, went home and replicated all his tools to make my own armor.
 |I was working as a machinist making stonecutting equipment in my early 20s. The business adjoining the shop I worked at was a prop house, and they saw the work that I created: the weapons, jewelry, leatherwork, and they commissioned me to make seven sculptures for Disney World, Epcot Center. That was in 1987. That same company referred the movie Hook, Michael Jackson's tour, and everything else.
[Of all the civilizations and styles that used pattern welding for their swords, who do you think did it best?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hqvr?context=5)|Probably the vikings. They were using pattern welded steel in the 7th and 9th century, and it created a very strong, durable sword. It's one of the better uses of pattern welded steel.
[What is the most requested weapon for the show that you might not be able to do? People say you can't do the Mastersword because it's been asked for too much or has already been done to death? Comments? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hxjv?context=5)|Master Sword will have to be done at some point, it's asked for so often.
 |When? You'll have to wait and see.
[Swords in the movies seem to be impossibly sharp. Chopping off heads like a warm knife through butter. Cutting lesser swords in half. What degree of sharpness is actually possible and what is the sharpest thing you've ever made?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2husx?context=5)|A sharp sword could definitely cut a lesser sword in half. I was interviewed for a Japanese TV show and forged a sword out of D2 steel. Shaved the hair off my arm to show how sharp it was, then cut through a piece of 4""x4"" oak beam, then took a 1"" round bar of unhardened mild steel, chopped through that, shaved off chunks of steel, then shaved my arm again. Then they realized there was no tape in the camera, and they had to do it all over again.
 |The second time, they lost battery midway. The third time went smooth and it maintained that sharpness the whole time.
 |I sharpen knives. My showroom's open to the public on saturday and I offer knife sharpening and razor sharpening while you wait.
 |My process will leave an optimal 1 molecule thick on the cutting edge of a blade. That is the sharpest it will ever be. Then it's just a matter of the type of steel whether it maintains that edge or not. I do that on the daily basis, they're all the sharpest.
 |Most of the pieces I make for film aren't ever sharpened (actors with a sharp knife?!). They're predominantly made out of aluminum for lightweight prop purposes.
[2\) Also, what style of weaponry would you say is your favorite? Things like types of swords (Katana, Rapier, Epee, Scimitar, Kilij, etc\) or daggers or polearms or the sorts.  3\) And in relation, what type of armor have you found the most interesting/appealing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hund?context=5)|1) I do take custom commissions. Right now I'm booked until about 2015. Most knives and swords cost $500-1000. I would need clean design work, and without seeing that I can't comment more on that.  2) Probably swords. They're what I make the most of.
[I live in NY, and would love to take up blacksmithing as a hobby. Whats the best way for someone with no experience to start?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hsrn?context=5)|I'm self taught, but I don't recommend that route. I would join an organization such as ABANA - the Artist's Blacksmith Association of North America. They have regional affiliates, I don't know what the affiliate is in New York, it's probably the New York Blacksmith Association. In California it's the California Blacksmith Association.
[Also, I love the Man at Arms series, and would like to thank you for doing it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hsrn?context=5)|The affiliates have meetings and you can take classes from them. They'll generally have hammer-ins (get togethers with a bunch of hairy blacksmiths and one woman.)
[It seems like all you do in your videos is make what other people want you to make. Is there anything that you'd personally really like to do a video of?  Also, loving the videos - look forward to them every week.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hup1?context=5)|Glad you love the videos! It's the end of season 2 but look forward to more videos coming.  I'd love to make a giant cauldron bubble bath to bring out in the dessert, but it's really not for a video. That's more for burning man.
[What do you do with the recreations you make on the show? any plans to sell them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hs8g?context=5)|All the recreations are displayed in my private vault at Sword and Stone in burbank. None of these pieces are for sale. These are my fan-based interpretations of other people's copyrighted products. I've probably had about a thousand requests for a damascus steel [Bat'leth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNcyzbcECbM) and 500 requests for [Finn's sword](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_HxKReSSlA).
 |Unfortunately I can't sell these things without the rights, especially with things like [Batman's Batarangs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV7Kn2J58FM) and [He-Man's sword](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G23dU1q7hmc) since I actually worked with Warner Bros and Mattel.
[What was your favourite job you did for a movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hwlg?context=5)|Probably Hook back in 1991. It was my first big commission. To see my work on billboards throughout the world was really gratifying.
 |In case you can't tell, I made the title weapon. The hook.
[I hear you mention over and over how dangerous the grinders are on Man-At-Arms. Whats the worst injury you've seen in a shop? Worst injury you yourself have sustained?  Excellent work, btw - everything you do is awesome!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hzm3?context=5)|You can see the sexy scar on my face. It's from when I cut off my nose while polishing a piece of gothic armor on the buffer. Just the left side, it took 44 stitches to sew the inner membranes and cartilage.
[What is your favorite project that you have made?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hqnb?context=5)|[Gotta be Gimli's Axe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa0FVYxbVWk).
 |I forged it from Damascus Steel, which is one of the things that makes it more exciting for me. It's actually a challenge to make the piece. It raised the bar over aluminum. It's a real weapon with folded steel.
[Tony, firstly let me say I love your show. Everything you make is so nice. But say you had to go into a medieval war, which 3 piece you've made would you take with you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2i1ej?context=5)|Well, I'd need a shield for defense. I'd go with a kite-shaped shield, I've made plenty of those.
 |A double-edged broadsword or bastard sword.
 |And a main gauche parrying dagger might be good.
 |If it was just from the show: Captain America's Shield, Raphael's Sais, and Jamie Lannister's sword.
[Tony, I love watching your series. The He-Man sword was awesome and so is everything else you're making.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2htpv?context=5)|Captain America's Shield, I was going to have the shield spun by a big spinning blade. That would have required a month and a half build time and we had three days notice. I had to use existing shop equipment that didn't match perfectly.
[Can you tell us more about the trouble you had with the Captain America Shield? It seemed the least polished of all your other entries. Was there anything you could have done to make it look closer to what it should, as if it was made from 1 block of metal.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2htpv?context=5)|If I had more time to build it, it wouldn't have had the gaps on the medal. That's the problem a lot of people had - it didn't look like one piece because we couldn't have one piece to have that anodized color that I heard Stan Lee prefers.
[Also, Any plans for the Eye of Thundera? How about more unconventional weapons? Maybe armor? Bracers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2htpv?context=5)|Lots of plans for more coming up. I'd like to do more armor, it's just the testing for armor at the end of the video is less exciting than seeing stuff smashed up. [I have an armor tutorial for the Stan Winston School you can watch.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZcoY1WEzY8)
[Is there any weapon you would love to make but don't have the skills or the means to do it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hvwi?context=5)|I don't make phasers or electronic weapons so much. Been playing around a little bit with more steam punk-y things, but incorporating air canisters and electrical charges.
[Also do you have a favorite era or style of weapons you like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hvwi?context=5)|I just like to make weapons of all eras. No favorites.
[If you didn't have blacksmithing, what do you think you would be doing instead? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2j79y?context=5)|Poledancing for sure.
[What was the weirdest thing you were asked to make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2i06i?context=5)|One of the first weird things that I was asked to make was a peg leg for a three legged dog for the movie Hook. They never used it, because the dog had gotten used to walking around without the leg.
[About how long does it take, on average, to make a video?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2i3a7?context=5)|I don't make the videos. I make hammers.
 |Production is done over a five-day build period and then the next week we do the testing phase. That's not five days for one weapon, we shoot six episodes at a time. So six weapons, five days, no sleep, lots of rockstar (if they want to send a free case address is on my website,) and then the testing the next week.
[Do you have a favorite piece that you've made specifically for yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hy22?context=5)|That question's a bit like the cobbler's shoes. His family walks around barefoot because he's making shoes for everyone else.
 |I'm too busy with everything else just to make something for myself.
[What is the biggest task/ most difficult weapon you have been asked to make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2i34n?context=5)|Gotta be the Buster sword. Have you seen how huge it is?! [Watch the episode](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xogheZdAO18)
[If you were given enough adamantine to make one thing what would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2ja2t?context=5)|I don't know the working properties of adamantium or mithril. I looked it up in the AMS metallurgical handbook but it wasn't there. I may need a more current issue.
[Same question, but with mithril.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2ja2t?context=5)|I also like working with unobtainium! But I can't get it anymore.
[Just wanted to say that the blades from Hellboy carried by Karl Ruprecht Kroenen were inspired, both sets.  Do you get to have any stylistic input in a movie like that?  Is it just ""copy the comic?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hvn7?context=5)|For Kroenen's swords I had a lot of input. They're based on a tonfa, a Japanese police baton weapon, but with edges all over. The grips were wire wrapped from my design and incorporating a black cabochon gemstone in the handle.
 |It was funny when United Cutlery got the licensing to reproduce that, Kit Rae called me trying to find the stones. The black stone that I cut the cabochon from was from a piece of obsidian I found while camping in Mammoth, CA.
[What's your favorite movie weapon that is made by another artist? Perhaps the Conan the barbarian sword? I saw a replica one in a sword factory in Spain.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hv38?context=5)|I was 16 when I met Jody Samson and he was creating Conan's sword so that was definitely an inspiration to me.
[.. Sorry for repost.. Phone said it didn't go through.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hv38?context=5)|In 1998 I created the Atlantian sword for the TV show Conan the Adventurer with Ralf Moeller. Actually, in the opening credits they showed me forging the sword as Crom!
[Have any actors commented on your builds, good or bad? Whats the best example of either?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2ir3h?context=5)|I was building an aluminum stunt weapon for James Franco for Tristan and Isolde.

1epq5z,7,2013-05-20,Too qualified for entry-level but not enough experience for anything else.,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1epq5z/too_qualified_for_entrylevel_but_not_enough/,"How do I escape this paradox and land a full-time position?

I just received my MPH and have only had internships, great internships, internships that I should be proud of: but nobody is actually giving me a chance to work for them.

My masters, according to hiring managers, makes me too qualified for entry level...

but because I've only had internships (in this field) they don't want to hire me for anything more than entry level.

My interview on Friday went like this:

- genniside, this job is called an analyst but it doesn't have any real analyst responsibilities - you don't want this
- I know someone who may have a different position for you, so you may hear from HR about it.

This has happened to me 2 times before, and the end of the story was that I was underqualified for the other positition and didn't get an offer from either.

In this particular instance (last friday) I wrote an email saying I don't know about the other job when I am really looking for entry level work. Basically telling her that she may perceive me as being over qualified for the job, I do not see it in that light.

2 questions:

Did I do the right thing by sending that email?

How do I escape this paradox and actually get an entry-level job?

Thanks, any help will ease my mental health. Seriously. So stressed over these dumb situations I get myself into."
1epq2a,1,2013-05-20,Junior Year,YourDrillSergeant,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1epq2a/junior_year/,"I just finished my junior year of college for a degree in Computer Science at a pretty tough university and I just needed to get something out there.

I've been pretty insecure of my intelligence ever since elementary school. My teacher used to call me a dunce (this was in a different country where it was acceptable for teachers to emotionally and physically punish underachieving students) and I've never had any confidence in my own abilities. Because of this, I became extremely introverted, somehow finishing high school (in the US) without ever making a single friend.

Now, I actually did fairly well in high school and got into an Ivy League school, but my insecurities stayed with me (in part because some of my high school teachers told me that I would never amount to anything) now blossoming into not just issues with my intelligence, but also with my appearance. I did poorly both socially and academically my first year at college, barely making a 2.9 GPA even though I pretty much just locked myself in the library all the time, and ending the year without any support or friends and severe social anxiety. At the time, I realized that any chance I had of getting into graduate school was probably dashed. During the first month of summer that year, I slipped into really deep depression; the suicide of a close friend nearly had me at a tipping point, and one night, while my friends were out without me, I seriously considered ending it right there and then. I made myself sleep on it, and I finally decided against it the following morning.

I began pulling through at the beginning of my sophomore year. I used to be very overweight, but I started working out that semester and shed close to 40lb to date (but more importantly, I got over the fear of going to the gym and being judged). I finally got a roommate, and we became extremely close friends; he helped me get over most of my social anxiety and make new friends, and I actually became quite happy. Without the constant anxiety, it became easy to focus on classes, and I pulled my GPA up to a 3.4. Still not great, as I couldn't even find a summer internship (I still had to use the freshman GPA when applying in the fall), but things are finally starting to look up.

Over the summer of my sophomore year, I promised myself that I would put all of my energy into getting as high a grade as possible the following year, and I'm proud to say that I have pulled through.

I have just earned a 4.3 (equivalent to an A+) on all of my classes this past semester (and about a 4.2 average for the entire year) which pulled my GPA up to a 3.75 (equivalent to an A-). Not only that, I also took the hardest courses offered here including a few graduate level courses. Two of my professors have now asked me to be their research assistant and I've been asked to TA two classes next semester. I even got several job offers and I finally have a shot at grad school! For the first time in my life, I actually feel accomplished.

Unfortunately, this did take a toll on my social life. I do feel like that I have regressed a little bit. In order to juggle between all of my classes, I pretty much studied endlessly this year and hanged out with friends less and less. I ended up losing a close friend of mine and have recently started feeling alone again, but I hope that this will change once I move into a new environment with new people and fresh faces (only a few people are still left on campus). 

One more thing that I'd like to address: I have never had much luck with girls before. I had been interested in a close friend for the first two years of college only to get shot down, which made me quite defensive around girls. I am very inexperienced, and because of this, I often don't know how to behave or what to say. I don't think I'm unattractive: I'm pretty oblivious and even then, I've picked up getting hitted on many times; unfortunately, I usually just clam up whenever this happens to me.

Anyways, thanks to anyone who had the patience to endure through this incoherrent mess. Hope things will look up for you guys too :) "

I recently completed my Masters degree in a mental health field and had an internship at a local psychiatric hospital during my advanced year. The hospital doubled as one of the only public hospitals for more than 40 miles, so we received most of the people with mental illness and/or substance abuse problems from a wide area.

Through that experience, I had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with local law enforcement. By the time I completed my internship, I knew most of the officers by name and am still friends with a few of them. It often was beneficial for both sides of the aisle to have a good working relationship, as it was a lot easier to know what to expect out of each other beforehand without having to be explicit. Different patients responded differently to our various skill sets, I suppose.

I know I shouldn't generalize, but having you guys around made it a hell of a lot easier to work with patients that were incredibly drunk or high as a kite on bath salts. In the same vein, I think the local PD appreciated us stepping in when someone was suicidal or depressed. I don't think I'd want to be a LEO, but to be fair, many police officers have told me that they wouldn't want my job either.

I hope that I can maintain a positive relationship with law enforcement throughout my career. Keep your heads up and stay safe out there."
1epmjb,1,2013-05-20,Some advice?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1epmjb/some_advice/,"First of all, English is not my native language, so please excuse me for making any mistakes.



I should probably start with a little background information. It doesn't matter how hard I try, I will still get bad grades in school. Even though I'm nearing the end of High School, I still have no idea what I want to do with my life, absolutely no idea. Now, this is not really my problem, the real problem is a little more sophisticated.

In the fourth year of the course I'm currently doing, it's mandatory to go on an internship to a country where English is the native language. For my internship I went to Maidstone in England. I stayed there for 2 weeks with a lovely family. I had an amazing time and I was very happy, everybody thought of me as a very clever guy and people only saw the ‘good’ side of me.

But when I came back home, I felt very different. My home reminded me of how bad I am in pretty much everything I do, it reminded me of every single bad characteristic I have.

This, and some other factors, have resulted in me not feeling at home anymore. My home reminds me of how miserable my life is, I feel like I have no future, and I have absolutely no motivation to do anything anymore. I would rather just stay in bed all day because I don't really care anymore.


I don’t even know what I’m supposed to do anymore, I feel like shit.  I really want to talk about it with someone, but I don’t know who. I was hoping someone here could maybe give me some advice, because I’m absolutely clueless on what I should do, I have never felt like this before.

i haven't gotten a internship offer yet for the summer. so i'm thinking of being spontaneous and just buying a one way ticket somewhere and just chill there for a bit. meet new people, experience a new town, get a low-key job (like waitressing or something, even though i've never done that before lol).

it's just...i want to do something outside of this ""master plan"" i think i have for myself. just get internships, finish school, get my degree, work and officially be thrown into the real world. 

i don't like monotony. i don't want to be stuck in the same routine.

so i figured take advantage of the time i have this summer to do something different, wild, and free, and live a little.

my question is....any suggestions of where i could go? i'm in an urban area right now, so im not thinkin of any big cities. i'd even be fine with a small town kinda place where real connections are made.

or maybe i'm just asking for too much and stuck in a silly daydream.

any help/advice/suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"

I picture being famous and important. I picture my friends looking up to me and having a steady income, attending parties with famous people and being interviewed. I’ve often written about others as well – the influential businessman, the wealthy entrepreneur. 

I picture these instances, because I know that I am capable of becoming these things, if given the chance. In the end I do not know how. 

I want fortune to smile upon me, showing me with money, praise and admiration. But it never does. 

And I walk the city streets, hoping to be discovered for my style, hoping to that chance encounter with a businessman who is impressed with my youth and ambition. But these never come. It depresses me sometimes, when  I think that I am twenty-five and jobless. And it depresses me when my roommate writes me a text message about throwing detergent into the washing machine like I am his intern or stay-at-home wife, because he thinks that I am at home doing nothing of importance and therefore can do his laundry. And it depresses me when I think of my future – which at this point is so insecure and on such a darkened path, that I cannot picture where I will and a week from now or a year from now. 

It is not that I do not want to work – it is that I do not know what to work at. In truth I want to work and I want to work hard.  I want to make money and earn respect and meet interesting people and intellectuals, but aside from drifting through expensive bars at night, hoping for these one-in-a-lifetime encounters, I do not know what to do. 

There is always the possibility of taking the entirety of the bottle of Xanax in my desk drawer, but I do not really have the balls to do that, and I would hate to think about what it would do to those around me. That is not a solution, that is giving up. It is there though. 

And so I wish and I wait and I write lists of what I want.  And the feeling in the pit of my stomach comes and goes, and the feeling of depression and hopelessness comes and goes. And I print and I write into this little book, documenting my feelings and sometime adventures, the writings getting so personal that it is really not fit for anyone but myself to read. Lamentations on life and New York City, the world and women.  The mantra, “kill myself, kill myself,” floating through my head at night or when walking down the city streets. And I do not know what to do.

I'm going to regret this.,[deleted],ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/1epc1n/im_imploding_all_my_friend_relationships_before/,"I don't know why life chose this time to make everything go down the gutter, but I guess that's luck. College is ending in a week and my friends - people I've known from freshman year and even high school - are always hanging out with each other for one last hurrah before various internships and jobs take us apart.

Problem is, everyone has a girlfriend or boyfriend and these events become ""couple"" events, except for... you guessed it! Me. I'm the one single person tagging along to the restaurants, to the parks, to the clubs, in the last few days/weeks.

""But premeddit,"" you may say. ""They're your *friends*. They don't care if you're single, go have fun with them!"" And this is probably true, but I still feel so incredibly frustrated by seeing them holding hands and cuddling and making eyes with each other that it doesn't MATTER how much of friends they are with me. All the friendship in the world couldn't make up for that total withering that happens inside me when I see such behavior which just reminds me how much of a loser I am.

Recently I've started to back out of events. When we went to a club last week downtown, I snuck out after once again being rejected by the random single girls I asked to dance. I snuck out and walked around the building for a while, my phone and texts constantly ringing from my friends asking where the hell I was.

I've asked out so many girls this year, put myself out there so much, developed so many hobbies, and nothing. Now I get to watch as the end of my college experience becomes a tapestry around me, of what could have been and what I'm missing out on.

Should I suck it up and go hang out with my friends before we all go to different parts of the country? I really want to be with them. But I don't want to feel this loneliness and frustration.

I guess this post doesn't have much of a point, just me rambling and letting this shit out. Thanks for listening."

1eom8j,64,2013-05-20,Elmo: (Possibly) The Worst Ex Boyfriend Ever,ensnarethesun,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1eom8j/elmo_possibly_the_worst_ex_boyfriend_ever/,"Pardon the length, this will be worth the read for people who have dated complete psychos. 

Some info: I'm a 20 year old girl who just happens to be an asshole magnet.

Around mid last year, after being strictly platonic with Elmo for more than a year, we decided to give the whole relationship thing a try. The relationship was wrong from the start, as Elmo was in a relationship at the time and he basically cheated on his then-current girlfriend to be with me. Yea, I was stupid but that's not the point of the story. 

Additional info: this guy got kicked out of his house after he beat the shit out of his own father, had to stay with me because he had nowhere to go. Didn't have any money at all, so obviously I was financially responsible for his fucking well-being. I gave him food, clothes, a working phone (after he smashed his phone to the wall one day when he got angry at me), and money. He literally almost never paid for a single fucking thing while he was dating/living with/leeching off me for about 10 months.

Fast forward 8 months, Elmo turned out to be a complete asshole. I found out he was cheating on me through MY WhatsApp history (Yes, he cheated on me while using my cellphone. Low sunovabitch). Also found out that he's been using MY car to meet up with random skanks, take them out, take them back to their places and sleep with them (Keep in mind that he used my car when I was sick, sleeping and/or he just borrowed it saying that he needed a car to go to his friend's house to study).

Also found out that he has been cheating on me several times from friends who has seen him in public with different girls (using MY car) and paying for them using MY money. 

Once, I also went out with Elmo and a few friends and 2 juniors of mine. I had shit to do so i didn't stay long and I had to take myself home to my parents house. Since I can't have Elmo following me around as my parents hate his guts, I suggested for Elmo to catch a ride with the others which he gladly did and ended up harassing on of my juniors/forcing her to kiss him (BTW, the junior was his best friend's little sister) .

I finally had enough of that shit and confronted him, which only ended up with him slapping me, dragging me out of the house, smothering me while I was trying to scream, banged my head against my car, picking me up and threw me to the floor. All of this happened at around 3/4 in the morning while it was raining hard so none of our neighbours had any clue of what was going on. 

(Now this was my fault) We broke up but still kept in contact and hung out together. there were no feeling left, but I guess I was just used to having him around. He had to leave to Europe for an internship so we parted. 

i ended up dating this really nice guy, Ari, who I've also been friend with for about a year. As you've figured, Elmo goes all batshit crazy. He started calling my close friends, asking them where I was, who I was with, what I did that day, etc. This went to a point where I start getting complaints from my friends, saying that Elmo was utterly annoying. One friend even had 88 missed calls from Elmo within an hour. He also started stalking all of my social media accounts, sending me texts saying something like ""You replied his tweet, why won't you reply my messages?"" or ""I know you're online"". 

He also started sending me messages saying how he doesn't have money to eat there, how he has lost so much weight since he got there, basically saying how he is just suffering in Europe. A friend of mine who is also doing an internship there and sees him every day said he was doing just fine. He also went to a point where he told my best friend that he was using drugs, and that he wanted to commit suicide. Luckily my best friend didn't really give a shit, knowing that he is well known for his over-dramatic behaviour. 

The cherry on top of the cake was when he threatened to kill my friends and my family members if I didn't want to get back together with him. So obviously, being tired of all his shit, I told my dad about this Elmo guy, who calmly said that he wouldn't mind taking this whole thing to court if Elmo won't stop harassing me.

Eventually all the crazy stopped. I have blocked him on every social media app available, but I still hear from friends that he still tweets about me sometimes. As for today, I am still happily dating my boyfriend Ari and haven't had Elmo trying to reach out to me for months. Thank God for that."

1eob7f,4,2013-05-20,Marketers of Reddit. Have I made a mistake choosing this profession? (current student),[deleted],marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1eob7f/marketers_of_reddit_have_i_made_a_mistake/,"Hello Reddit,

I wasn't sure where else I could ask, but I am looking for advice.  
I am a college student, I work full time at a decent job making $9 an hour and I also attend school 12-15 credit hours a semester, 2 nights a week right now.  Before I transferred from community college to a 4 year university I was majoring in accounting, something I wasn't really that interested in.  After speaking with a few people and some family members, I decided that Marketing would be more intriguing and more fulfilling throughout my life as it seems that there are a lot more opportunities for a Marketing major, but I may be wrong. 

I have been looking for internships on and off for the past 3-4 months and have gotten 3 phone interviews so far and have not gotten the jobs.  My interview skills need work, but they are getting progressively better I feel.  The problem was that all of my jobs going through my life until now (I got my first job when I was 14) have been acquired through friends or family.

Now that I am getting more serious with this Marketing career with my graduation date approaching in May of 2014 if all goes as planned, I am starting to second guess my decision to switch from the usual job that my family has chosen (we have 6 accountants in my family) and went with Marketing for reasons that I thought it would be better for me.

My problem that I am coming across now is that I feel that I will not be good at this.  Granted I have only taken 4 or 5 core classes toward my bachelor's in Marketing, but I feel that I may be too introverted for the jobs that will come my way.  I know these things take practice and I have made it conscious effort to become more personable with people I encounter at work and have been working on talking to people, but can somebody with these kinds of social skills be successful in Marketing?  I believe I am a smart individual.  I get good grades, am highly motivated in my work, and feel that I am a well rounded person who is quick to adapt to environments, it is just that before I am ready to make a huge jump out of my current job environment of 3 years, I want to have something where somebody will really help me learn. 

Do entry-level Marketing jobs all require sales?  Can I be a successful marketer without being a super salesman?  Sales is something that I really don't think I could do well unless it is a product that I truly believe in in an environment that people are looking for information, not looking for people to sell to who were not interested before, if that makes sense.

I am just looking for advice from someone who may have second guessed their major in college and what happened with it.  I know there are more things to do in Marketing besides sales, but do analysts, market researchers, internet marketers all fall under the same blanket ""Marketing"" degree?  

One more thing, if I want to specialize in the online side of marketing, is learning HTML, SEO, and even graphic design a must?  I feel like that would be really useful, just don't know where to start..  

I think I may be overthinking all of this. I am really looking for some insight here.

Thanks people"

My job title says ""Software Developer Intern"" yet they put me into the QA team for the system group that was hired for. The software architect stated that I would start in QA to become familiar with the system and then move on into development, but I am afraid that I may get stuck in this role for 16 months. This is because of several things:

* I came into this team with another new intern. He started in development immediately whereas I started in QA
* There are 2 old interns that are leaving in August and I'm working with them. I am afraid that I am supposed to be their replacement.
* The interns have been doing this since the beginning of the year now. So this indicates I may be QAing for quite a while at least.
* They cannot simply move me into another team. I would need to replaced. Just as I am replacing the old interns.

The next full release cycle of the product starts in July and ends in October. My ideal situation would be to experience one cycle as a QA and get out. I don't really mind being QA to get the experience of being one but I definitely do not want to be QA for 16 months.

How should I tell my manager that being QA is not what I expected and that I do not want to stay in this position indefinitely? Is there any timing that I should be aware of(like don't say it so soon since I've only been here 3 weeks)? How can I be diplomatic about this?"

Like some of you, I was quite anxious about finding a job after graduating.  I had no internships under my belt, almost no contacts save my professors, only a couple of substantial personal projects, and a resume that consisted mostly of relevant coursework.  Really, the only thing I had going for me was a very high GPA.  After interviewing with only three different companies, I landed my first programming job.  

I understand my situation may be the exception, and certainly you should not discount the advice you will find in this sub, a lot of it is really good.  But to those of you who are like I was, who are discouraged that they may not have the most competitive, ivy league, ""rockstar programmer"" credentials, just know that it *is* possible.   Also, make sure you have a good relationship with your professors.  If you're a good student, they're your guaranteed network/connections.  One of mine is actually partly responsible for me getting this job.  He gave me the name and number of one of his industry contacts and a good referral.  So, make sure you talk to them and develop a good relationship outside of the classroom.

Good luck!"
1eqzn4,3,2013-05-21,Links to best work,Soll_Id,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1eqzn4/links_to_best_work/,"When possible employers ask for links to past work, what do they generally expect?

I just finished my first year at college (Computer Engineering Major), and I'm looking for a summer internship. I figure since my major is a related field, it wouldn't be hard to get a cs/web development internship (especially since those are more common than engineering internships). I really like programming, and tend to like my cs courses better than most of my other courses. (But then again I haven't really taken a lot of engineering courses yet being a freshman).

I've applied to some positions posted on internships.com and internmatch.com, and almost every position asks for links to my best work. Because I am looking for an internship to gain experience, I don't really have that much great code lying around. Sure I have all of the simple programs that I wrote when learning a language, but I think that doesn't come anywhere near qualifying as ""best work.""

Should include schoolwork? Project Euler problems? (Maybe even something from Codecademy?)
Right now the only thing sitting in my github account is a simple HTML-basad connect four game I wrote in javascript/jQuery.

In addition do you guys have any advice on small side-projects I could do to put in my programming portfolio?"
1eqtg2,9,2013-05-21,Help.,MRN1982,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1eqtg2/help/,"I am a 30 year old man that is happily married with a beautiful, loving wife and have a 6 week old baby. I haven't been working for over 3 years. I became a firefighter when I was 21 because I like to help people. I worked hard and pursued my dream and attained it. On the advice of my retiring captain I attended paramedic school to better myself. In order to do this I would have to take one year off in order to attend classes and 800 hours of an internship. Over 1200 hours of work in total. My internship lasted 600 hours, a far greater time than is normal. My preceptor, normally a hard ass (but an amazing preceptor and paramedic) with a 60% fail rate kept me on and gave me as much extra time as he could. He saw how hard I applied myself, how hard I studied and applied what he taught, however, I still was unable to make the cut. I had folded under the pressure of a few bad calls. He told me that failing me was the hardest thing that he had ever done with any intern he had. I will always remember his kindness mixed with disappointment.  After I had failed. I tried to return back to my fire career. My old captain had retired out of the country. The captain who replaced him a deeply conservative, homophobic, and mean spirited man blocked any attempt for me to rejoin the department. He had tried to terminate a young lesbian woman who worked at our station the previous year and my testimony cast doubt upon what happened. Every other firefighter had said ""I didn't see anything."" I told the truth and her job was saved and subsequently transferred.  I also had transferred to another shift with the retiring captain. After failing paramedic school, and not being able to get back in to the job I love. I have been lost ever since. I decided to work on an ambulance and was employed for 2 1/2 years. Due to depression and a back injury I could no longer work for them. 

It has been 3 years. My muscular and athletic body has turned to fat and  I am now an embarrassing 310lbs. I am unemployed and have tried to find other careers but nothing has been able to stick. I have only a high school diploma and was never very good at school. My wife is a very successful business woman who's career has skyrocketed. She will be graduating from a top 5 university with a MBA. I am ashamed to stand beside her when we are with friends. I have seen therapists for depression. I had started experimenting with drugs for a short time behind her back. She never found out. When she got pregnant I stopped.  Now I just sit in front of the computer for an average of 12 hours a day playing video games, just happy to get lost in them. My wife's irritation and exasperation has been growing. She says I have the power to change anything I just have to put my mind to it. This makes me feel even more weak and powerless. I try to avoid looking at myself in the mirror and every day feel a mix of shame and self loathing fill my chest. I was bullied most of my time in school. I am a 30 year old man, but I feel the same familiar helplessness as I did when I was younger. I feel myself sinking, and see no ways to fix it. I feel as if I am dragging my loved ones down with me. I sometimes think that my child would be better off without having my influence in her life and that my wife could find a better man after I am gone.  These thoughts of suicide are not the first I have had. I have battled with them ever since I was a teenager. They went away when I had my dream job, I had the drive and the fire to improve myself and had become living proof that nerds to become great after school. Now I am back full circle. The shame, embarrassment, and feelings of worthlessness have come flooding back, this time however, they are much stronger. I sit in front of my computer and cry when I am home alone. When I am out running errands I fantasize about being murdered during a robbery or run over by a careless driver. Having worked in the Emergency medical field I know what happens to people who say they are a threat to themselves and others. When I started planning to jump off a bridge while her family was here to visit (so she could have support nearby) I decided to post here. 

I have been to the top. Since then I have lost so much. My career, health, faith, and soon my family if things don't change. "

1eqlqv,18,2013-05-20,My mother...,smarmodon,SRSWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/1eqlqv/my_mother/,"1) So I'm in college and  I have my first ever real-person job this summer. Okay, it's an internship, and it doesn't pay, but I'm going to be doing something I am passionate about that will help me get a paying job in my chosen field eventually... hopefully. The fact that it doesn't pay means I'd have to take a second job at like a McDonalds or something, which will suck but I gotta pay rent! So I'll be working 50-60 hours a week.

2) Also, I come from a very wealthy family, which means that during the school year I am entirely financially dependent on them. My parents pay my tuition and give me spending money. (I'd get a job but it's impossible on my campus if you're not work/study which I don't qualify for.) I totally understand that this is a really privileged position and I am very grateful for the fact that my parents support me and that I won't have to graduate with any debt.

3) Thirdly, over spring break I chose to go on a vacation with my boyfriend's family instead of staying at home with mine. I did it because I wanted to meet some of his extended family and get to know his parents better. I would not have done it if my family had plans, but they didn't because my brother didn't have a break. So I didn't spend much time at home over last break.

With all of those things in mind, here's the real issue. My parents are trying to plan a vacation this summer. We usually go somewhere really far away for at least 10 days. But I only have a week between the end of my internship and school's start date. I also have plans the weekend after my internship that can't be moved because it's for a fixed event. So I really have 5 days for a vacation. Which apparently means I can't go on any family vacation, although I tried suggesting a long weekend or short vacation just to a local beach or something. But apparently we just have to go to the Galapogos or Alaska or SE Asia or something far away and long.

My mother is guilting the crap out of me over this. ""Oh is it that you love [SO's mom] more than us? I'm really hurt that you chose to go on vacation with her but not us!"" ""We never get to see you!"" and more. She wants me to ask my boss for vacation time but I don't feel comfortable doing that, because it is only a 3 month internship and who takes a vacation on that? In addition I'd have to get time off for two jobs which means I might not be able to swing my budget for that month... it just seems very complicated.

Don't get me wrong, I'd love to go on vacation with my family, but circumstances may make it impossible for me to do so. And my mother is furious over this. She's very manipulative and can get quite nasty when she wants to. Usually when she gets mad enough at me she threatens to stop paying my tuition or giving me spending money (which I mostly use for essentials, it's not like I go skydiving with it or anything). I kind of want to tell her that her little baby is growing up and that I simply cannot swing a vacation this summer, but she would probably do that icy ""I'm not speaking to you until you give me what I want"" thing and maybe take away my spending money/freeze my checking acct which is technically under her name. She hasn't done it before but I would not put it past her if she gets mad enough.

I realize this is such a privileged little baby problem but I honestly am just so confused and I don't know who to ask about it. So my question is how do I deal with this situation and should I even bother confronting my mom? This whole ""control"" situation has been bubbling for a while now just below the surface and I have to deal with it eventually. My plan is to call my dad at work tomorrow and make sure he'd be okay with giving me spending money if I didn't go on vacation with them, and then call my mom and tell her that I can't go and sorry but I really need to focus on my future right now."

Last bit before my question, I'll have about a month before the position starts that I could devote to learning Php - however that would be well after the application deadline. 

My questions are, how important is the required versus desired qualifications?  And how can I present my willingness and desire to learn the skills beforehand?

1ev20s,6,2013-05-22,My [21F] (wannabe) boss[32M] is driving me crazy!,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ev20s/my_21f_wannabe_boss32m_is_driving_me_crazy/,"I've been volunteer interning at the Texas State Capitol for the 2013 session for the Rep that represents my hometown. It started in January 2013, but due to the suffering from horrible allergies, I didn't actually start until February 2013.

I work in a state representative's office and his chief-of-staff is driving me crazy for a few reasons. 

First, because he began to hit on me. I have a... curvaceous bottom and he's made several comments about it. I didn't really make a big deal about it at first, but I just got progressively more uncomfortable. He'd say that when I step right, it goes left. I chose to ignore it. I got a boyfriend mid-March and I've been pretty vocal about it with the other girls at the office so I know he knows. After he found out I was in a relationship, he stopped making those comments.

Second, I've been trying to lose some weight this spring. I'm nowhere near fat, but I'd like to lose about 10 pounds. He's made comments about my weight and sometimes I'll cheat on my diet and he would say, ""aren't you supposed to be eating clean?"" Just constant ridicule of my body. I'm also Facebook friends with the representative I work for and I know his chief-of-staff runs it. I'll post my meals on Instagram and link it to my Facebook and he has said things like, ""brown rice and corn isn't eating clean,"" in a really condescending way. Again, I chose to ignore it. 

Lastly, I was sick for almost two weeks last month and I had to call in for about 6 work days. I haven't had anything to do in the office since March and I don't get paid to do this job, so I figured calling in wouldn't be such a big deal. BIG MISTAKE. He's basically forced me to be the only intern in the office since after the school semester ended (I'm an undergrad student at UT Austin) without anything to do. I spend my time at the office being on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Reddit. Finally a few days ago I went to him and said, ""do you need me to do anything? I'm really bored."" His response: ""You're the only intern who took almost two weeks off from work. You claimed you were sick. We have constituents from the rep's district call everyday and can easily say 'we saw one of your staffers out and about today,' which I know is a total lie because I was NEVER out an about in the district. So basically I'm being forced to twiddle my thumbs at work.

He's always making shitty comments around me while in front of me. For instance, our legislative director and him were talking and our legislative director said, ""that means our interns have to come in this weekend, right?"" and he goes, ""well I know TG (another intern's initials) is down,"" basically saying that I won't do what's asked of me. WHAT THE HELL? I have never indicated I would not come in if needed to. I'm just so tired of being treated inappropriately and thought as of being lazy.

So r/relationship, what do I do? Session ends in a week, but I plan on putting this job on my resume and I'm so scared that a future potential employer will call him and he'll say all these horrible things about me. Advice? 

TL;DR my (wannabe) boss has made sexual comments to me, made comments about my weight and made comments about me being lazy, which is absolutely not true. Help? "
1ev013,4,2013-05-22,"Unhappy with B.S., failed a year, low GPA, did internship at Google. Should I pursue Masters?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ev013/unhappy_with_bs_failed_a_year_low_gpa_did/,"I'm studying CS at a little known university in Europe and just finishing B.S. Didn't like it very much so far - I failed a year and have really low GPA - 2.0/4.0 (US scale). However, I also did 4 software engineering internships at good companies (one of them is Google) so my resume is not that bad.

Here is how I passed most courses:

* Skipped all classes - they are a waste of time.

* Watched equivalent courses at Coursera, MIT OCW or something similar.

* Downloaded good books rather than read those written by local professors.

Really, why bother going to a university if I am learning everything on my own? Yeah, I do have friends. Yes, I am exposed many areas of CS. Yes, I can study on my own. Yes, I do a lot of programming in my free time. What am I missing here?

However, I must also say that some courses at my university are excellent. But still, just a minority. And I would go through them by myself anyway - all materials are available to me. Apart from writing a thesis, I feel there is really no point in being enrolled.

Two more years pursuing Masters doesn't sound exciting to me - I'd rather work for a year and then study on my own for a year or two. The fact that my salary might be compromised at some point in the future is worrying me. Is this my concern valid? Would it matter if I get a job in U.S.? What about Europe?

Do you believe me when I say that online courses blow equivalent courses at my university out of the water? Do I sound silly? Anyone else feeling like this?

What would you advise me to do - Masters or not?"

Thought it was nice of you to do an AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3xe2x?context=5)|First time I saw Star Wars, I made a musical connection right away.  First thing you hear is that iconic opening piece of music and all you see is text on a screen.  You know music grabs you if it can do that with no other real reference to connect it yet.  With all that in mind enjoying what your doing is also a big part of it, even when its stressful and you have deadlines.  I feel extremely fortunate that I love all that I do no matter the situation and that I've been able to evolve, adapt, and rise to the occasions all along the way to grow and improve and further my position to audio director and all other aspects of audio work aside of just composition, which of course is as much an equal passion as its ever been.  OK, that was a book!  Hope its answers your question and thank you!
[My question for you: How has your music evolved throughout your life?  Is your music influenced by things in your life, the game itself, or any outside factors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3xe2x?context=5)|Thanks for following on Facebook, and welcome!  Great question!  I predict a long answer... here goes!  In my own life, I can give some examples.  It evolved in phases.  FIrst off, my parents were musicians, so my fisrt exposure was from birth being around them playing and performing.  So as a little kid, I took it for granted that everyones parents must do that, and didn't understand when other kids were so overly wowed by it, for me it was part of daily life.  All the while I'm being introduced to new music, new artists, new styles, new soundtracks, and I would just take what affected me most and apply it to whatever I was working on at any given time.  Outside of composing full time at this point, I'm still trying to do something with bands, and what really inspired me to further myself in sheet music writing for horns was a band Home Cookin, which I later joined.  They had a horn section already but when the main guy became unavailable, I took the reigns and crash coursed learned what I need to do to make it happen.  Which of course translates to orchestra and beyond but it was a good starting point for me.  Experiences you have in life will also contribute to how creative or inspired you are and no matter what emotion you are feeling you can take advantage of it and harness it into music.  If you are composing something for a somber scene, you can draw from sad experiences in life, same with uplifting, or anger, anything.  I learned to channel it.  The game itself naturally is a big factor in style and all the various settings / levels and situations so referencing those directly is also a must of course.  From there, the art inspires me, the fun of the gameplay inspires me, and the team I'm working with does too whether they enjoy the direction its going or offer more feedback as to how to redirect.
[Thanks for making part of my childhood awesome, how has the switch from Westwood to EA and then Petroglyph come about? Do you miss the olden days of Westwood much?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3ukdd?context=5)|You're welcome!  Westwood days were great and I always look back fondly, was a great era.  When EA consolidated, I didn't make the move to California, I stayed and freelanced until Petroglyph formed up.  I miss the way the industry in general used to be in older days - it seems that it is pretty rough out there now.  Petroglyph always feels like an extension of Westwood with many people we have from there.  I'm thankful that we can continue to make fun experiences and move forward as a creative team.
[Did you work on Nox? That was one of my favorite games of all time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca4236j?context=5)|Sure did!  
[Hello Mr. Klepacki!  First of all I am HUGE fan of your music on C&amp;C games. I listen to them often while I am jogging.  I'd like to ask what does the man say at the beginning of the song Grinder? And what language is it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3v0bj?context=5)|Was told it was Russian, vaguely saying something to the effect of ""this is a Red Alert"" or ""emergency"" but I'm not entirely sure.  It was a sample from one of the games cutscenes while a major alarm was going off.
[Alright, I have to know. I'm looking to get into the music side of video gaming doing exactly what you do. How did you end up in the job you are in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3vwzq?context=5)|How I started, and how one has to start today, are two completely different scenarios.
 |•Quality has got to be there, has to sound like what's currently out there right now. Network, attend game conventions, talks on the subject of game audio, get a feel for things.
 |•Start small with indie devs or mod communities, get in some experience with working with teams, how the audio gets plugged into the game as to have a better understanding of approach to composing for it.
 |•If you pursue in-house positions, maybe start as an intern with a larger company, or junior position. if you're freelance then prepare to chase work more than doing it at first until you establish enough clients.
 |•Don't just pursue 'games’, pursue all media! Composing knows no bounds or formats.  The level of quality is all on the same playing field.  A ""game composer"" used to have the stereotype that you make a 'bleeps and blips' soundtrack.  Now its full symphonies, any everything in between.  
[Is there a game you wish you could've done music for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3uf60?context=5)|Big fan of Unreal Tournament series and Transformers war for cybertron games, would have been great fun to work on for me.
[HELL MARCH! What's your favorite music that you wrote?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3uht6?context=5)|\m/ Multiple favorites, would have to be more specific.  ;)
[Do you have a formulaic approach to composing for a game, or does it differ from project to project? Are there common traits in other soundtracks that you admire or try to steer clear of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3uh5j?context=5)|It differs project to project, but there is common ground in my approach.  As composers you can only write for one instrument at a time until you have as many layers needed for a section of music, but my approach is to start with the first instrument choice that is inspiring the new piece I'm thinking of in my head.  Whether its a French horn melody, or a bassline, or a drum beat, that's how I generally start it off, and if I'm hearing a finished section in my head, then I start with the fastest things I can load into the daw and crank it our asap before I lose the idea.
[Thanks a ton for doing this AMA, by the way.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3uh5j?context=5)|As far as what I steer clear of, I try to avoid the things that are done to death in many other soundtracks, but it's tougher these days as everything's been written and tried for the most part, so now I think the main things for me to continue to set myself apart, is unique combinations of instruments I come up with, or delve into some progressive elements to mix it up.
[Favourite Synth ? Opinion on software synths?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3w3i1?context=5)|As a composer in many genres I need a ton of sounds at my disposal so while I will say Kontakt is my central hub with which to load up with custom banks of instruments, Komplete Ultimate contains majority of what I use today, and then I will then load in third party sounds into Kontakt like libraries from Cinesamples.
 |I used to have a rack of all hardware synths and samplers back in the day and while I have an affinity for some of those signature sounds and still have some of that gear, I definitely have embraced all software synths because saving all settings and instant renders are the only way to go now.  Of course I will combine that with live instrument tracks as well.
[What bands are you listening to in your private time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3utg8?context=5)|Bands I just listened to in my car on the way to work today was Newsted, Daft Punk, Pendulum, Face The Funk.

[Also, along with most others here, a sincere thank you. The music you've done for games is just incredible. From the C&amp;C and Red Alert music to the amazing End of Nations opening theme, the music you make is (for me\) among the most iconic out there.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3ur17?context=5)|Most recent work to have come out is The Battle For Graxia Soundtrack in both mp3 and flac is on Steam right now: [Link to store.steampowered.com](http://store.steampowered.com/app/236640/)
[Mr Klepacki, thanks for everything you have made ! I have a question though, one of muy favrite songs from C&amp;C is ""Act on instinct"" and I wondered if the voices in the song were stock samples or extracts or if you have made everything up ? (but then, who talks ?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3vup4?context=5)|They were recorded at Westwood by various voice actors and processed to sound like they were sampled.
[I am a composer, mixer, producer, etc. currently about to leave graduate school.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca410ew?context=5)|Hello!
[This question is a bit personal, and I don't want you to feel uncomfortable, but maybe you can give some sort of insight. What kind of pay can someone expect when writing freelance for games? Obviously it differs per project, but a range for larger and smaller games would be helpful. Also, what is the salary like for in-house composers at both larger and smaller firms?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca410ew?context=5)|If you are freelancing you set your own rate.  The pay scale may differ depending on how demanding the job is.  It's your choice whether to charge based on how many hours you work, or by the assets you are providing.  I generally would charge by the asset: per sound effect, or per minute of completed / delivered music.  You have to take into consideration of a buyout, meaning that if the client is paying a one time buyout fee that gives them the rights to use it for the project and you collect nothing further, what is that worth too you?  The game industry generally does not want to pay royalties in this category.  So then it's upfront payment, or milestone payment, or whatever is worked out on the contract depending on the work load.
[Are you receiving royalties from freelance game projects or are they up-front payments?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca410ew?context=5)|In-house position salaries will vary on your experience level and amount of duties you take on.  Most game studios these days want sound designers more than composers in terms of in-house.  The more things you can do to be valuable and flexible will open more doors.
[What are the licensing payments like for your material that UFC uses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca410ew?context=5)|Licensing usually means you are allowing use of music for an agreed upon fee, in exchange for you retaining the rights to it.  Which traditionally would be a cheaper fee then a buyout in that case.
[Sorry if I crossed any lines here...you don't have to answer all of it. I just expect some of these opportunities will be open to me in the near future and I'd like some guidance on which will be the most worthwhile to pursue.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca410ew?context=5)|Royalties in the case of television are collected through your performance rights org like ASCAP or BMI, and they track the usage and pay you quarterly accordingly.
[Follow up - so for example in the case of the UFC music, generally one would get licensing + royalties?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca427cx?context=5)|All clients are different.  Generally in more specific cases, (if they want a specific song) there is an initial license fee and then broadcast royalties.  But if you were to submit to music libraries that shop it around for you as part of their collection, then generally you're only looking at broadcast royalties.
[What is considered to be your most famous work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3wj68?context=5)|Command &amp; Conquer Red Alert is probably the most famous, but a lot of people have also gotten to know my solo albums through Ultimate Fighting Championship tv shows.
[I absolutely loved the soundtrack to the original C&amp;C - it's really somewhat unique music - have you ever thought of releasing something new in a similar style?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3wo9m?context=5)|Why yes ;)   Have you heard my solo albums?

[ off, huge fan of your work, Mr. Klepacki!  My question: Have you ever considered doing a tour of sorts where you'd play live versions of the tracks you created for the Red Alert/C&amp;C series? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3uxna?context=5)|Thank you!  I have, and I would, given the right circumstances / offers.  
[Thanks for doing this Mr. Klepacki, just wanted to ask, what's your favorite track from the original C&amp;C?

[I hate to think I'm contributing to a downward shift of the very industry I'm trying to work my way into.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca440ik?context=5)|Network at game conventions, attend talks, check out communities like audiogang, ask questions, but you want to be meeting people like producers &amp; leads on a project to get their contact info and discuss opportunities to pitch to them.  Take genuine interest in what they're working on and ask them about it.  Most important thing to find out is what do they need ""right now?""  Back to timing.  That's where their minds are most likely at.  I often tell composers to also become sound designers, because the industry tends to look for those more often than composers - then you can pitch for sound design work too, and once that's going well, if there's ever talk of music needs after, ""oh, what did you need there?  Maybe I can help.""
[EDIT: Also, how would you compare the video game scoring industry to the film and television scoring industry? It seems that there's more stability and in-house jobs to be found in the former, do you find this to be true? Thanks again for the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca440ik?context=5)|Don't stop at games - go after ALL media, commercials, tv, film, short films, music libraries, licensing, agencies, exhaust every possible avenue.  
[I feel like your work on the Universe At War soundtrack haven't been appreciated enough. I didn't play the game a lot, but I've had the soundtrack on my ipod for years.

The Hierarchy was probably the most fun.  I loved those massive walking units which inspired the ultra decimating soundtrack style for them.

I would like to know your opinion on using HM1/2 wither a video featuring gameplay from Company of Heroes 2? Did Relic ever contact you/EA? Licensing could have been a problem, but a CoH2 teaser with HM2 would be epic!  If I made my own video, properly attributed, would that work as far as you are concerned? Think EA might get it pulled down since CoH2 is sort of a competitor to the C&amp;C series?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3y21q?context=5)|Its out of my hands, EA controls the licensing of that music so it would be up to them.
[Hey Mr. Klepacki - main thing I want to say is that I've really enjoyed your tracks for the Command &amp; Conquer series: all three Hell Marches, Just Do It Up, Grinder, Prepare for Battle are a few faves. Listened to a little of your other stuff as well which I've also enjoyed. Nice going and thanks dude!  Feel compelled to include a question - Do you end up with a lot of cut material when you put together a soundtrack? Do you often carry over cut material from one project over to another?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca40ua5?context=5)|I don't end up with a lot of cut material usually, if I do, I identify it early on as something that doesn't fit and I'll keep it on the shelf until I find a home for it.  Experimentation is key - I'll often ""sketch"" out a handful of ideas in very basic form, a single track or melody or chord change, and I only pick the strongest ones to continue forward with.  Depends.

[Frank, I must say that you are a great inspiration to me. Not simply inspiration in the musical sense (although I greatly admire your work\), but more the attitude of 'Well my music won't be heard if I work in a band. Fuckit, computer games instead!' and the success you've had in a notoriously fickle industry. Your name is well known although yourself and Koji Kondo are the only computer game musicians I can name off the top of my head.  Do you think thatre there any opportunities around now for the talented, or possibly lucky, musicians amongst us in computer game music, so we can follow in your footsteps? Are there any other unorthodox avenues that would be worth pursuing for an aspiring musician?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca44jq0?context=5)|I appreciate that, thank you!  State of mind can play a big part in determining your path, and if you run on parallel paths for a while to figure out which one is better for you, than so be it.  That's basically what I did, computer gig by day, band pursuit by night.  Funny thing is I still do that, but the difference is my state of mind.  I'm not trying to kill myself over the band thing anymore.  I know what that's all about and now I pick and choose, only do whats fun, and I have no other expectation.  Where as video games most certainly is my ""career"" so I came to accept that years ago and so that's is always my priority above all else.  I've touched on some other things in threads below of what I think are ways to investigate pursuing it today.  The industry is pretty wacky so you never no from what angle something will turn up but constantly putting yourself out there and perhaps taking on some other skills and traits that compliment the field can be helpful to subsidize what is going slower in one area.  Audio renaissance guy is what I recommend for anyone.  More options you have the better.
[Thank you for doing what you do!

The newer selections I added to that game definitely drew influence from the David Lynch Dune film, as well as extension of my previous work.
[What were your inspirations while scoring Dune2000/Emperor Battle for Dune? Also I noticed Emperor had 3 different composers, which tracks were you responsible for? Regardless, the music was fantastic across the board :\) Keep doing what you're doing!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca40urj?context=5)|In Emperor I did all the Atredies themes which picked up where Dune 2000 left off.
[Looking at my playlist, my favorites from CNC: Act on Instinct, Airstrike, Depth Charge (awesome\), Floating, Finished game, Industrial, Industrofunk, Motorized, Mud, Mutants, Running through pipes, Vector, Workmen. A long time ago I used to listen to these songs from your website and then I copied them, renamed the downloaded files to mp3 and woohoo. Now they're in my computer and my car. Thanks! I guess I should have paid for them :-D. Sorry about that. Great songs, perfect compositions. I love the way you sometimes mix in odd/atypical sounds with other typical musical sounds. The combination sounds great. Its great to see you.  I know you said you don't have any favorites but are there are other awesome songs like the CNC ones?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca42umh?context=5)|Thanks for the kind words!  You would probably enjoy my solo albums, and the Universe at War soundtrack.
[Hi Frank! I just want to say that I love all your soundtracks, and listen to them on a regular basis, especially the Command and Conquer soundtracks. My favourite song would have to be No Mercy, which samples one of my favourite movies, Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey.  When you were composing the soundtracks for Dune 2000 and Blade Runner, how did you go about getting the feel for those universes? Did you just listen to the movie soundtracks over and over?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca44osw?context=5)|Listened to em, watched em, played the game over and over, everything.

Star Wars Empire At War is what I was born to do, being a huge Star Wars fan who knows the music and sound effects and voices like the back of my hand.
 |Universe At War was just a straight up fun RTS with truly unique factions that played differently and had that sci-fi meets campy C&amp;C spirit and so it was a direct extension of that feeling of the past.
 |The End of Nations scoring I did had a lot more emotion and allowed me to make something a bit more organic.
 |Battle For Graxia was a cool fun and creative experience, much more akin to the old days of game dev with a smaller team, and more action arcade like qualities that I enjoy.

Lands of Lore 1 was probably my personal favorite of the series as it was very much along the lines of Eye of The Beholder 2 which I'd previously worked on and I loved the 3d grid style dungeon crawls.  LOL2 was very creative and inventive though, I loved scoring the videos to that one in particular.  I remember both those scenes very clearly - I was captivated by them as well.  ;)

E&amp;B had a lot of atmosphere and I was feeling that as I was creating pieces for it.  Definitely focused on giving the different races their own unique soundtracks.

Today after entering in my information for a full time job and sending it off I realized I autofilled my extraneous information for an internship, and not a full time job. I got an immediate response from HR asking about the internship information. Thankfully this was the first (and last) time it will happen. 

Judging from their quick response they were interested in me as well. Bah.

TL;DR: check, recheck, and check again to make sure the right information on the application is filled out."
1euitg,340,2013-05-22,Always Check the CD/DVD Drive!,area88guy,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1euitg/always_check_the_cddvd_drive/,"This one happened way back in the beginnings of my career. I was the System Admin for a small for-profit college campus in my home state, which meant 10% of my time was imaging machines, 10% was improving our systems and builds, and 80% was working on student laptops or desktops.

That last one always felt dubious. However, my boss stated that this was a service that we could offer to our students that would give them a bit more ""loyalty"". I didn't mind because it was usually easy work, and also because it just gave me more WoW or SoaSE time with my interns.

Enter Qiet Student. QS was a known, good person that I had seen around. She came in to ask if we could take a look at her laptop, stating that it was extremely slow and things were not working. After taking down her information and labeling the machine, she was off to morning class, and I booted her laptop up.

Of note: my office was directly across from a classroom, and I was required to leave my door open for approachability. The class across the way was also leaving their door open for late-comers.

As the machine starts to boot, I hear the CD/DVD drive spin up. It didn't concern me at the time, and I let it get into Windows. It automatically logged in, saving me that trouble. However, for some reason, the CD/DVD drive was immediately accessed and opened...

...blaring some pornography in my office at a volume level that could have summoned Godzilla. I was not prepared for this. All in the space of a few heartbeats, I had both thumbed the mute button and hit the Eject button on the CD/DVD drive. Neither immediately worked, so I *dove* over my desk, vaulting it like a parkour object, and shut my door quickly. 

I am not a small man. Luckily, I had brought my backpack that day, and it was filled to the brim with clothes. I had a work ""uniform"" that consisted of a button-down and tie, with slacks. Since I also attended the college, I would change into more casual clothing afterwards. This was in the dead of winter, so I had a t-shirt, large pullover, and jeans in the bag.

My lightning-fast reaction to the sounds had produced one flaw: my dual monitor system had become unhinged, and one monitor flew at the floor at speeds I couldn't calculate with my mental math proficiency. Thankfully, I made a critical LUK save, and the monitor landed on my clothes pack unharmed.

After closing the door, saving my monitor, and slowing my heart down, I dusted myself off and went around to check the laptop. It was still sitting there, DVD ejected, and loading up an amount of spyware and virus-spawned evil that caused me to consider an exorcism. 

There, in the tray, was an unlabeled DVD.

I knew what it had to be, and I wasn't too pleased. I was also floored; did someone really submit this machine to me and ask me to clean it, with this in the tray? I couldn't believe it, but there it was. Shaking my head, I took the DVD out of the tray and made my way back around my desk to pick up the mess of other items my vault had sent flying. As I do so, however, I hear the sound of a key in my office door. There were only two people with that key. I was one. The other was my boss. My ""not computer savvy"" boss, the one who believed that fear and job security were good enough threats for motivation.

Arrogant Bastard Boss steps in to ask why my door is closed, and I immediately cut him off with ""ABB, please close my door and allow me to explain what was delivered to me."" I used his first name. I never did that, unless it was a Big Damn Deal, and this caused him to pause, then close the door. 

ABB: This had better be worth it, 88.

88: It is. This student laptop was delivered to me, with this DVD in the drive. It began to play automatically when the laptop started up, and closing my door was just part of my attempts to prevent its sounds from being heard.

ABB: What? Give me that.

88: Sir, the contents (*the disc is now snatched out of my hands*) are not safe for work!

ABB proceeds to put the disc back into the laptop's CD/DVD drive, where it is popped back in and immediately played again. As it turned out, the volume control on the laptop itself did not work, but the door to my office was thankfully closed as the video began to play. He gave it five seconds before he paled, immediately ejecting the disc. Setting it on the desk, he came back around to me. ""You know what to do. Carry on."" ABB left my office, closing the door behind him.

QS returned four hours later, and I took her aside, asking my intern to close the door. I kept the intern inside, since I had told her the entire story, and I felt a female corroborating the story would be a bit helpful.

88: QS, a DVD was found inside of your laptop that contained pornography. This DVD was automatically activated when I started your laptop. I'm afraid that this will be the last time I will service any of your equipment.

QS: What? You're fucking lying, I don't watch porn!

88: See for yourself. The DVD is on top of your laptop.

QS boots her laptop, pops the DVD in, and gives it time to load. It does. She begins to watch the video. Thankfully, the volume was at about 1%. Her face begins to contort into an angry mien. She takes the DVD out, shuts down her laptop, and storms out. The Intern and I are left wondering.

Cut to a month later. QS comes into my office to request assistance with her phone. I quietly remind her that she is no longer entitled to support, which I hated to do, but she asked if I would reconsider if she told me what the problem had been. I agreed, since I was curious, and all she needed was one sentence to regain my amused trust: 

QS: The man you saw was my now-ex fiancee, and the woman you saw was my sister.

Trust regained, and I couldn't help but laugh."

So I've been writing part time for a software company over the past two years. My hours have fluctuated depending on what else I'm doing - use to be 30, currently is 20 hours a week. 

I write blog posts about online marketing for them, and I write website copy for their site, and help with research on larger products. I didn't go into this as an expert, but since I started, I feel that now due to my work I could be considered a semi-expert on online marketing, social media marketing, SEO techniques, etc. I've tracked some of my blog posts and generally they perform very well and drive a nice amount of traffic to the site. The company has expressed enthusiasm for my work.

Originally I started working for them as an intern for about $10/hr. A few times I asked for a $5 raise, and now I am at $25/hr. Technically I am a freelancer with them, and that's what I did my taxes as. 

Just recently I started doing research on freelance rates, and have seen that most ask for $50 - $100 an hour. Considering I am now doing fairly high-level writing with a good amount of industry experience, it would seem $25/hr is too low for me to be getting paid.

However, I don't want to burn bridges with this company as we have a nice history. Also, I know normally freelancers ask for more since their work is intermittent, but this company has always let me work 10-20 hours, no questions asked, so does that security mean I shouldn't be asking for a higher rate?

I don't really feel like I can ask to have my rate doubled suddenly...not sure what to do. Any advice would be very much appreciated!"

Thoughts?,dangle_badger,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1etgea/looking_for_a_new_car_under_30k_thoughts/,"I saw a thread that was pretty similar from a year or so ago, but there is a slightly different twist for me; I live in Wisconsin.

I have just graduated college and fortunately (awesome parents and excellent internships) don't have any loan debt to worry about. I am looking for a sporty/entry level luxury car. $30k is a little on the high end and I'm more thinking 15-25k, but I going for something not too high on mileage, not too insane on maintenance, and decent gas mileage. 

Audi TT, and Audi A4/S4 really get my blood pumping, but I worry about maintenance costs. I also really love the Infinity G35/37 coupes. 

One weekend last summer I took a day to test drive a few cars to start getting a gauge of what I'd be looking for. I test drove the Golf R and liked it a lot, but I'm not sure if I love the hatchback look enough. I didn't enjoy my test drive of a 370z (disappointed about that). I loved driving the 2005 c6 vette, but I don't want to have to keep a shit car for winter and deal with storing vehicles over seasons.

Looking for any input, thanks!  Edit: When searching for cars online... [So frustrating](http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/38067568.jpg)"
1etg0u,5,2013-05-22,After discovering this school of thought I can't take university seriously anymore. It's becoming a problem.,ti83nightedition,Anarcho_Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/1etg0u/after_discovering_this_school_of_thought_i_cant/,"I'm a freshman compsci major and have previously worked in the industry as an intern right out of high school. I got offered $60k a year to skip college but I decided against it.

Now I'm in college, and it just seems like a bunch of bullshit. I can't take it seriously. I never go to lecture. I just do the homework assignments two hours before the midnight deadline and scrape by. We're learning Assembly language (CUSP) and complex data structures and it's hard for me to take seriously because I've never had to use them in the entire 7 years I've been programming.

I've basically devoted all of my time to learning objective-c and ios development on my own. I've also taught myself a bunch of history and economics through research on the internet and I learned public/private key cryptography, the bitcoin protocol, mongodb and node.js on top of that.

I'm almost done with my first commercial iPhone app, but on the flip side, im failing a couple of my classes. 

As a side note, I very much dislike the location of the school. If I could, I would leave.

What should I do?"

[What's the weirdest scene you've been involved with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca35ooz?context=5)|I've got two, will start with an easy one.
 |Spouse abuse case. I show up and the husband is like, six feet tall, 150 pounds...black eyes, red face, busted lip. His wife, no taller than 5.5 ft, at least 300lb+, is sitting there telling the cops why she beat him up. I also have to document the entire house to ensure they are upholding a proper ""standard of living"" and find a series of dildos on their entertainment suite. When I get to that area, I look at the scene commander and ask, ""You want me to shoot the dildos?"" He said, ""Yep...and I want close ups."" !!!
 |I think this one takes the cake, though. Very beginning of my career.
 |I get a call on the ""alert phone."" It's the base police. They ask me to report to building XXX whatever. I'm asking myself why it's such a familiar number...""OH, I LIVE HERE."" (Dorm/Barracks).
 |I go outside and there's cops, fire dept., ambulance - everyone. I walk downstairs and find the on-scene commander. He tells me to follow him.
 |As we near the entrance to the dayroom (lounge area) I see a blood trail and start snapping shots. We keep walking...I am now inside. We open the door and there's feces and blood...EVERYWHERE. On the phone, on the pool table, on the TV...
 |All of a sudden I hear a cop say ""found the probe""...not words I want to hear when I see blood and poo. I turn around to see this cop holding a billiard cue with the tiny end covered in blood and poop dripping down the handle.
 |We never found the bleeder.
[Is there a particular crime scene or accident you will never be able to get out of your head? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca36fx3?context=5)|We had a report of weird smells coming from a house a few years back. It's summer and we all assume the worst. We open the door and are immediately hit with rotting human smell.
 |Doe had been dead for at least a week, maggots were coming out of his mouth, ears, etc. No visible sign of violence, he seemed to have died in his sleep. They bust out the ""glow"" light and we see vaginal fluids all over him. Best guess is that he died having sex. That's probably the best way to go.
 |Well, they can't leave any stone unturned so, as a closing act, they need to turn the body to see if there are any marks/wounds on his back. I'm on the business end of this event, camera ready to shoot as soon as they turn him.
 |As they start to pull him, his flesh tears off...like chicken skin. They get a better grip and pull him to one side. Yeah, it's terrible - every bit of liquid had been pouring from his anus for a couple of days...I still can't eat steak and broccoli with garlic because of how reminds me of that smell.
[I was really interested in reading this entire thread...opened it up and began reading this answer as I sipped back on my nutrient packed vegetable blended juice...  I cannot read no further...  Juice is going down the sink.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3gp7x?context=5)|Appropriate: [Link to i.imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/oKocbvx.gif) 
[Yep...that pretty much sums it up for me and this thread hahaha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3j7qz?context=5)|I laughed out loud when I read this.
[What was it like the first time you saw a dead body in person? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca38l2i?context=5)|If you can remember any awkward scene when you were a teenager or young adult...when you had to get in front of class or were scared but had to act...it was kind of like that. Very tingly sensation, remembering that these folks depend on me doing my job right. This was before the wars REALLY kicked off...so death was still new to me, even in the active military.
 |It's very strange to be alive next to someone who will never breath again. Realizing that their friends will never talk to them again, their family will never hug them again.
 |I had to go spend some serious quality time with friends after that...just to wash that feeling away.
 |Edit: I'd like to add that I also felt guilty to be alive...for some reason.
[How accurate are tv shows when it comes to crime scene procedure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3739v?context=5)|Haha, they're pretty terrible. First thing - I'm usually the 2nd person called to the scene. For the most part, NO ONE is allowed in without me shooting the scene first. Military defense lawyers systems pick apart crime scenes, so they rely on me and my images/testimony to uphold prosecutorial items.
[Relevant to this, which tv shows/series do it best in your opinion? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3joqm?context=5)|I really can't think of a show that gets the photography right. I don't watch too much tv - so I'm only current on the happenings of Westeros and what rick is screwing up in Georgia.
 |I'll say one thing - that ""enhance"" word needs to go from every imagery scene. No one's designed an algorithm to fill in the blanks where pixels can no longer resolve.
[Yeah, umm...that's what I was afraid of. I'm going to to have to revisit this idea in another time of my life, like maybe in 20 years. Thanks for the reply!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3az4x?context=5)|No worries, dude. I have kids myself, you can't help but make the correlation and then your day is ruined. Best of luck!
[What's the scariest thing you've ever experienced as a military photojournalist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca39fvs?context=5)|I'd honestly have to say every convoy in Afghanistan was the scariest moment of my life. You never know which rock or piece of trash has your number hidden beneath.
 |Getting shot at isn't any fun, but at least then I was busy taking photos of the guys around me - so that took my mind off it.
 |Also, nice name.
[Do you have news hair?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca39mct?context=5)|[Link to i.imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/e5hy15E.jpg)
[Do you have to take the crime scene photos so they are clear and useful for evidence, or can you take art shots? I'm asking due to your photojournalism background and an assumption on my part.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca36h25?context=5)|Clear, sufficiently composed, sharp, and properly exposed. Yes, I do take artistic shots all the time - crime scene is just one of the many aspects of the job. I've photographed sporting events for all major sports, met celebrities, flown in dozens of aircraft, etc.
[Wow it sounds incredible, has there ever been a moment on those adventures when you stopped for a moment and just said to yourself, 'Dam I can't believe I'm here right now!' ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca36ugg?context=5)|Yeah, man. Good question - just had memories pour over me.
 |I was in a valley, documenting an aircraft crash (class-a, loss of life, loss of aircraft) and stopped to take it all in. There are thousands of pieces of metal (and person) everywhere.
 |I'm climbing the side of the mountain, looking over the wreckage. At that moment my partner pops his smoke for help pickup. Out of nowhere this Blackhawk flies in like a bat out of hell and literally lands on the side of the mountain to pick me up. I'm now bugs eye, hanging out of the hurricane seat, snapping shots. Hundreds of people now look like ants, parts are still smoldering, fires being put out. I was like...damn...crazy times.
[Related question... say you were on site and took a few really beautiful , tastefully composed shots that would look really good in your portfolio (perhaps for employment after you get out\)...  what's the policy on copyright and ownership of those photos? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3u03d?context=5)|Good question. You can't make money using government equipment. You are entitled to keep any and all of your artistic imagery - as long as you don't sell them and they aren't sensitive in nature. My portfolio has many images from times when I was on scene at an accident.
 |Which brings up another thought - lots of idle time at crime scenes.
[I was one of my base's responders for a recovery team.  Thank you for making it possible for us to do our jobs, shitty as they may be.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3kcyb?context=5)|Yeah man, I worked with a recovery team once or twice. You guys do the hard part, thanks for what you do. That made me remember something pretty cool.
 |When a jet crashes, I'd take photos of the wreckage - thousands of photos. A few years before cameras had gps, the investigators started assigning a civil engineer with a gps signal recorder to take a reading when/where I took a picture.
 |The team manually attached my photos to each tag and then entered into a program that showed where each peace came from, rewinding back in time before the crash happened.
[What ^is the most disgusting thing you've ever photographed/seen? Apologies if this has been asked before! :P.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca381no?context=5)|Any number of murder/suicide scenes come to mind.  If I HAD to pick one, I'd say that it was when a drunk kid punched his hand through a window in a door. It was one of those with the wire netting.  It got caught and somehow didn't sever an artery. So I show up and they've removed the window...which is still somehow attached. It's just eviscerated...like it had been in a blender. Bone, muscle, tendons...crazy, like out of a movie. He's sitting there saying, ""I fucked up, I fucked up...""
[What is the most grisly thing that you have ever seen in you job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca36wdp?context=5)|Um...well, do you want IN YOUR FACE or mentally subdued?
[Well both I guess! You choose. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3a3e4?context=5)|I once had to take photos of a friend who had died. She was wearing a football jersey and underwear, sitting there down on the floor with her face on the toilet - alcohol poisoning. I had to kneel down next to her to and take a photo of her face before they moved her. Standard practice is to take a wide, medium, and close up shot of every single picture.
 |I kneel next to her, breathing erratically. I pull the camera up to shoot and I see her face through the viewfinder. She's dead, but her eyes are wide open. Staring at me. I still remember that...4 years later I remember the look on her face.
 |Edit: a letter.
[Wow. I'm sorry bro. That must have been awful. What do you do to try and forget things like that? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3by6i?context=5)|I actually had to go to counseling after that. I lost faith in the military support system at that point. We were being overworked, under rested, walked on and then punished for the slightest mistakes. I can compare this to a bout with depression - how does one get out of a hole that keeps getting deeper? Stop moving. Be still.
 |That very case made me come to terms with life and death. None of us are making it out of this journey alive...the sooner I figured that out the better.
[What the fuck. There wasn't another person that could have taken your position for times like this? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3okge?context=5)|Yeah, frog and wodie - this actually doesn't happen too often, only once in my career. The thing is, I didn't know it was her until I was in her face. Then it was like time stopped and I was frozen there, staring at this dead girl who now had an identity. Didn't mean to set the story up like I knew it was her from the start, because I didn't.
 |Once I was there, however, I couldn't let myself back out. I was actually training a new photographer at the time - so losing my composure wasn't an option, for me at least.
[Sorry - I think we need a follow up question. You never found the guy?! Despite blood everywhere?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3o7kh?context=5)|Yeah man, you gotta think about the surrounding area. This single barracks has 100 rooms, and there are dozens of them in the immediate area. Also, since we were stateside, he/she could have got in his car and driven to a local hospital.
[You mentioned that you have to take three types of shot per framing (close, medium, and long\) - but do you apply standard 'photo' principles to taking shots?  Or is there a special type of photography that comes with the territory of crime scene documentation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3cpjj?context=5)|Crime scene photography, for the most part, does NOT take photojournalistic principles into account. All I'm concerned with is proper lighting, focus, and overall clarity. You want to take a photo that you don't have to ""edit"" when you're done, as any editing has to be done in front of an investigator and well documented.  Our method is as follows: Walk into a room, take a picture at the entrance. Go to a corner of room one, take a wide shot (overall). Go to the other three corners and repeat. You now have a 360 view of the room.  Once you've taken your overalls, you document any and every item of interest. You take a new overall of this individual item, then a photo from about 3 feet away, then a photo as close as possible.
[What states did you work in? Did you do any work for private companies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3d23f?context=5)|Texas, Arizona, Maryland, D.C.
 |Well I've been employed by the private sector, yes, but not in the capacity of a crime scene photographer.
[You said in a earlier reply you photographed more then just crime scenes. What were some of your other favorite photographs you took?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3daw8?context=5)|I took a beautiful panorama of the western slope of the Hindu Kush covered in winters last snow. Beautiful 55x10 inch blue/grey/white image.
 |I also took a gorgeous silhouette of a defender on the flight line - looking into the distance as he held his M-4, sun setting behind him in the mountains of Arizona.
 |Hard to pic favorites in a career of tens of thousands of pictures.
 |(deleted threat it seems) Tons. My favorite was Wayne Gretzky, he bought me my first cigar! Gary Sinise, Buzz Aldrin, countless athletes and politicians and one president.

[A being in the military, what was your actual job? Did you work for PA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3jxrj?context=5)|First few years we were know as photographers. Then, fields merged and we became photojournalists. When that merge happened, we were known as PA.
[Im in the Air Force, photography is a huge hobby of mine, and if I had thought about my AFSC more, PA would have been something of interest. Hows its work with officer/enlisted and the standard PA (event planning/coordinaitng\) and deployed/action/plane photography?   ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca45f68?context=5)|PA is usually broken into these groups: Photojournalists Videographers/Broadcasters Community Relations Media Relations (sometimes just an additional duty) Command.
 |PA deploys quite often but, as I'm sure you know, the US is due to withdraw from Afghanistan next year. Deployment tempo is usually pretty high, but varies from base to base.
 |Officers usually take care of the strategic/crisis communications while the enlisted folks take care of day-to-day news and operations.
[Thanks! So as an officer, being behind the lens isnt really likely huh?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca475m3?context=5)|Depends on if you want to lead, or manage.
[Do you do photography in your spare time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3e0io?context=5)|I stopped doing side-photo jobs last year, shortly after getting out of the service. Time became much more precious - I'm married with kids, attending grad school and am writing a new novel. My speciality is portrait personality. Close-ups of faces are the best!
[If so do you have a specialty or favorite type of thing you prefer photographing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3e0io?context=5)|My military bag consisted of any of the pro bodies of the past 10 years. My glass was always a 11-14mm fisheye, a 200mm fixed, an a 24-120 @2.8.
[What's in your camera bag?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3e0io?context=5)|My personal bag carried comparable Canon glass, with the 5D Mark II.  
[Cool, what are you studying?  Using the GI Bill?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3e9sa?context=5)|Yes, the GI Bill alone makes military service worthwhile. I can honestly say that if you have no other reason to join, but don't know what to do in life, talk to a recruiter.
 |I'm getting my master's in strategic public relations. Thanks for asking!
[Ever stumble onto anything, which was deemed classified in some way, or just standard crime scenes and such?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3eju1?context=5)|Oh yeah, man. I'd say the classified to unclassified ratio would be 1-4. Of course I can't discuss them...G-14 and all.
[Can you at least say *why* certain crime scenes are classified? And what sort of clearance are we talking about? Secret? Top secret?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3emm1?context=5)|Sure bud. So...lets say you have a standard breaking and entering call. If that happens in a Secret/TS or Restricted Area, that ENTIRE scene is classified to match the level of the highest classified item.
 |Other times an actual piece of classified machinery/technology is damaged...that's now a classified photo shoot.
 |Yeah, standard clearances apply.
 |Quick thought: There was recently an uproar over how many people have TS clearance in America...it's quite large. Just so you know, just having a TS clearance doesn't give you access to ANYTHING beyond why your specific position requires the clearance. Basically, if you have a TS at your office in Alaska, and you want access to my Top Secret files about a crime in Florida - sorry. The phrase is called ""Need to know."" Even with appropriate clearance, you can't access information that you don't need to know.
[Aye. And there's an entire different field of Special Access Programs, which is a clusterfuck of its own.  Ever been called out to take photos after a little green man got stabbed or something? :P.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3f01y?context=5)|Haha, no green men - thank God I never had the hassle.
[As someone who's seen a lot of death, how do you feel about the possibility of life after death (Heaven/Hell/Reincarnation/etc\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3eftk?context=5)|Whew. My personal thoughts are that, yes, something happens when we die. I'm always thinking about what life is, where it ends. If life is just energy, does that energy just dissipate or does it transfer to something or somewhere?
 |Existence is way too intricate to cease when the human body ceases to function.
[Is it difficult to navigate a crime scene? I'm thinking that it should be, given that you might accidentally tamper with the evidence without realizing it (e.g. stepping on something that you probably shouldn't\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3clfl?context=5)|Lol, yes it can be a lesson in patience. I'm not the smallest of guys, so trying not to step in pools of blood, poo, broken glass, or other pieces of evidence was always a challenge. There are times, though, that it can't be avoided - you just take a picture before you enter the area to show how it was before you walked in.
[Was there ever a time where you were personally at risk or even a time where you (literally or figuratively\) dodged a bullet? great ama :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3ec30?context=5)|The closets call I ever had was a mortar hitting about 30 feet away or bullets flying by maybe 20 feet away. I was very lucky. Funny story - I was in the back seat of the mighty F-16 when it was WAAAY too low on fuel. I really thought we weren't going to make it back - that's funny though, not scary.
 |Hats off to the real GI Joes/Janes out there, I was only there to help tell their story.
[MOS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca37xjx?context=5)|Air Force - known as an AFSC.  I'm no longer in, and careers have merged. It's now known as ""Photojournalist"" 3N0X5.
[Wow I'm nearly getting sick reading this. Anything ever cause you to lose your lunch?  And/or How do you mentally prepare/get trained to see what you have? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca39dc9?context=5)|I never puked due to anything gross...but I've lost my lunch of a few flights...I once RAN OUT of barf bags! lol.
[What's different about a military crime scene and a normal crime scene other than military being involved?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca35l9g?context=5)|Really depends on where/what's involved. Depending on the security issue/threat. In nearly every major crime-scene, a federal level investigator is present. IMHO, the military does an absolutely amazing job of figuring out whodunit.
 |I could be more specific but you'd have to narrow the question.
[As a military photojournalist, have you ever flushed dry ice down the toilets at your workplace? (I'm conducting a study.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca39p8y?context=5)|[Link to www.quickmeme.com](http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3uiaid/) 
[Have you ever been to a crime scene where something genuinely made you laugh? Not a cynical look-how-fucked-up-this-is laugh, but an actual laugh? Sorry if it's too morbid since it is crime and all, but I'd imagine you'd see something funny from time to time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3zn6n?context=5)|Yeah. Air bases have flight lines - basically landing strips. One new years night the alert phone rang - I'm asked to report to the flight line. Before I get into this story remember two things: this is a restricted area and this involves military personnel ONLY.
 |I show up and I see that no one is in custody, no ambulances...just cops. I'm like, okay...this shouldn't be bad.
 |I walk over to the cops and step on something along the way. It's pitch black outside. I look down and see that I've stepped on some furry handcuffs. I call the cops over, they're like - ""Yep, now it all makes sense."" Start of an hilarious night.
 |In all we found three pair of womens underwear, a few bras, an entire dress, and a few broken bottles of beer. In the grass adjacent to the flight line were even more clothes, womens accessories, and an empty purse.
 |I leave the scene laughing because none of it makes any sense. Yet.

1etfim,4,2013-05-22,"I think my family hates me, and the feeling is mutual.",throwawayeddy,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1etfim/i_think_my_family_hates_me_and_the_feeling_is/,"So, I've never done this sort of thing before, but I've only told one person I know how I feel about this, I don't want to bother him by saying it all again, and I don't want to say it to anyone else. 

So, I'm the youngest of four. I just graduated college, and moved back in, looking for work. There's a lot of tension in the house, because my father thinks I'm lazy for being unemployed, but... we'll get to that.

Anyways, I always felt like the black sheep of the family. I was born with high-functioning autism, and never really connected with my siblings the way they connected with each other. They always ganged up on me, teased me, made fun of me, that sort of thing. That only got worse when they all went to the private school my father's successful business got them into. I wasn't able to go to that school, because they said they wouldn't take a kid on the spectrum. So, I went to a public school in the city instead. They got the better education and prospects, and a circle of friends they all hung out with and talked about in conversations, which further excluded me. In a way, I've never really been a part of my family. 

My parents divorced when I was in middle school. That was the worst time I life so far. My mother was abusive, and so were the authorities at school (who I won't go into right now). My father got custody, and I don't see my mother much any more. 

My father shits on everything I accomplish. I got involved in politics, advocating against the war or for labor rights or on climate divestment- he never encouraged me, even though he himself was involved in work against the Vietnam war and for divestment against apartheid. Even when I take leadership roles in groups, he just ignores it, belittles any cause I care about, and tells me to focus on my work. When I needed an internship, I went to the farmer's market in the area- a farmer's market he helped found before he withdrew because it wasn't profitable enough for him- and even though they didn't have an internship available, I offered to work one for them, created the internship, and left behind a working internship program for other students in the area. He didn't say, ""Hey, great job making your own opportunity"", or ""What a good way to benefit future students!"". Just nothing. I graduated from college, having gotten their highest scholarship, and was the first of his kids to graduate, from his own alma mater- the same school whose prep school program wouldn't take me for being on the autism spectrum. He didn't even congratulate me. I recorded and released an album of original music, gave all the proceeds to charity, and got an offer from a small record company to do a professional album, and he hasn't even listened to the copy of the album I gave him. He never praises anything I do- just makes snide comments about my weight (I'm *not* that fat!) and calls me lazy for not having a job. 

I don't think he understands the job search these days. He's built up this mythology about what a great all-American up-by-the-bootstraps hero he is, conveniently forgetting that his father-in-law and his three business partners all helped him with the start-up money to get his company going, before the business partners dropped out and conveniently left the company to him. He hasn't had to look for work or fear for his job for longer than I've been alive, and has no idea what the youth unemployment statistics are- much less the statistics for unemployment for people on the autism spectrum. Still, he feels confident telling me that if I can't find a job while living in the country with no car to get anywhere for a job interview, that I must be lazy. I've applied to dozens of jobs, but he doesn't believe me- he never believes I do any work unless he sees me do it himself, because he believes that I'm lazy. 

The other night, my father came downstairs drunk, and starting rambling on about how disappointed he was that the woman he wanted to screw hadn't come over. I didn't say anything, so he turned to me and said, ""First good night of summer, I'll drink if I want to- fuck you!"". He'd always confided his romantic and sexual frustrations in me, since the divorce, even the ones involving my mother. He hadn't started drinking in front of me until my grandmother's funeral a year or so ago- he got sauced the night of her wake and kept up half the relatives playing music. So, the other night, he comes downstairs drunk and talks for three hours about how great he is for having money, and how every woman who's rejected him must have a mental disorder or been raped as a kid and be screwed up as a result (because that's the only explanation for not liking him- he's made the same theory about my mother. He has no capacity for self-criticism). I always act as his sounding board for this stuff (as have the other kids and my grandmother before she passed away), but he never gives a damn about any of my romantic problems. So, that night, just to give it a shot, I say (quite honestly, as it's been on my mind) ""I don't think I'll ever date. It seems like it's frustrating for most people, and seeing as I have a hard time with normal interaction, I'll probably never get the hang of it"". Now, you might think a father would here recognize the signs of a growing depression and try to comfort or encourage his son- but instead he said, ""Yeah, I don't think you'll ever date"". 

I don't think he gets how to be a father to a person on the spectrum, either. He likes to pretend he empathizes with me because he had a stutter as a kid and knows what it's like. He always tells me to never use it as an excuse or be dependent on anyone, but he tried to get me to play along with him in a benefits scam to claim I was too dependent to be considered an adult after I turned 18, so he could keep getting child support. He keeps telling to apply for disability, and any time he's angry at me for being unemployed, he tells me that if I don't find a job, he'll call the state and have them put me in a group home. He doesn't understand why I'm angry at the prospect of being forced into a group home, when my previous experiences in life include being forcibly committed to a mental hospital when my mother lied and told the police I hit her, being forced to take an addictive medicine (that caused weight gain and sexual dysfunction and relieved none of my anxiety) for years (and getting off it cold-turkey), and being segregated into dehumanizing and insulting special education programs that treated me like I had an intellectual disability (I don't- my IQ is 143, I've always been a top scorer in standard tests and AP courses, and I did well at a prestigious college). 

My brothers and sisters still gang up on me. Every time my sisters come home from the Cities, I dread it, because no matter how mean they are individually, they're meaner when they're together. They all seem to think they're much better than me- which is bullshit. One of them dropped out of a community trade school, went to drive a delivery truck for our father, and is being groomed to inherit the business by virtue of being the first out of our mother. He thinks this makes him a very successful and intelligent person. The younger of my two sisters went to art school and now works as a waitress because she can't sell the bumpy, painfully abstract lumps of acrylic-abused canvass she creates. The older of my two sisters has been trying to get her Women's Studies degree for the last six or seven years and draining the family's finances. Of course, after paying for three kids to attend a private prep school and helping one son to attend and drop out of trade school, one daughter to attend art school, and one daughter to attend an expensive private college for over a half-decade, my father still complains most bitterly about the 10% or so of my education he's paid for (after the scholarship that covered half the costs and my loans that covered most of the rest).

My brother likes to side with my father and call me lazy and fat at any given opportunity. Of course, he's the one who's a 28-year-old trade school dropout who's still living in his dad's basement and relying on nepotism at his dad's company to bankroll his lifestyle. My sisters, when they come home, enjoy acting like they are very progressive, countercultural, and knowledgeable about all social issues (when I'm the one that spent the last four years studying environmental science and policy and taking a leadership role in social activism- fuck, I have to worry about having law enforcement attention for my organizing role in the local groups and my close friendship with other activists who've been targeted, and neither of them have so much as attended a protest since Obama got elected). The truth is that neither of them understand a thing about politics (the way they talk, you'd think an unmanned drone shoots rainbows and laughter when a Democrat orders it deployed). In politics and lifestyle, my brother and my sisters have nothing in common but their high school and their genetics, but they still agree on one thing- fucking with me. I'm the constant butt of their jokes and object of their ridicule, and every time I try to say anything, they just laugh at me. 

So... there you have it. I hate my family, and I'm trapped in this damned house with them until I can find a job and leave. When I do, I'm not looking back. "
1ete98,1,2013-05-22,"The things I chase don't make me happy. Or, why my job is making me miserable right now.",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1ete98/the_things_i_chase_dont_make_me_happy_or_why_my/,"I apologize in advance for the wall of text ... I'm here with my backstory to ask for career and life advice from you wise ladies (and men!) Right now, I don't really have any peers or friends to talk to about this, and I'm just feeling really lost and confused about where to go from here because, for some reason, I can't figure out how to make myself happy. 

Up until this point in my life, I've done all the ""right"" things (the things that I was always under the impression that I should do). I went to college, got good grades, completed two internships, and was offered a real, professional position before I even graduated. Great, right? On the outside, yes, but on the inside? I can't even remember the last time I wasn't miserable. 

I killed myself to get though school, working full time while going to school full time, and completing internships. At the end of the day though, I would tell myself that it would all be over soon, I would graduate, get a job, and just concentrate on work. Yeah, right. 

I stayed at my first real marketing job for 6 months. My boss would call me at all hours of the day/night to drop her new, insane ideas on my already overloaded workload, and I would have to grin and say I was right on it after my advice was scowled at (i.e. wouldn't this be better after we complete this?). I was a one-woman show for all of her hopes and dreams. I worked crazy hard, but just couldn't do it after a while, so I found a new job. 

Present day - I'm in communications at a large company. Everything started out great ... but now I'm even more miserable than I was at my other job. I'm jumping through flaming hoops on a daily basis to keep my job (layoffs and such) and I'm doing the workload of at least two of my more experienced peers - no exaggeration. I'm constantly under pressure, and I'm running on stress/adrenaline all day, yet I receive positive feedback from everyone I work with. I easily work 10+ hour days at work just to complete my work ... Then I come home and work. I end my day feeling disoriented and miserable. I'm miserable at home, I'm miserable with my SO, and I'm started to feel really down about everything, not just my job. 

The problem is that I don't see how this will change, or if I have some character flaw that makes people want to give me so much work to see if I'll break (that was a bit dramatic, but still). I can't tell if it's my jobs, my field, or the realities of being a young professional. No one talks about this kind of stuff with you in college, before you enter the real world, and I'm just feeling lost about what to do to improve my life, because right now working less and leaving work at work just aren't in the cards.

1etcu0,2,2013-05-22,Saving for grad school in two years with $50k/yr + and $25k cash&amp;ST,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1etcu0/saving_for_grad_school_in_two_years_with_50kyr/,"First off, I would like to apologize for asking a variation of one of the most common questions to come up here.

I finally landed the job that I have been working towards for a while and with my new financial situation I have set to figuring out my savings. One problem is that with my chosen career path people usually go back to school after 2-3 years before moving up in the industry, so I am working on balancing saving for that with getting a jump on my retirement savings.

Some numbers:
* My new job pays $50k plus a bonus which is usually between $10k and $20k. Since I was an intern at my company until now, I expect to make $41k total this year with a bonus around $10k.

* I currently have a little over $25k in cash that I have intentionally kept liquid because I did not know what was going to happen with this job. (This includes $12k in a 12 month CD that I could withdraw by forfeiting all of the $0.36 interest or whatever that it has accrued)

* I expect approximately $2.4k/month total expenses

* My employer does *not* match 401(k) contributions  :( 



Preliminarily, I am thinking that I max out a Roth IRA, find the best short term vehicle on a 2-3 year horizon (not many choices, are there?) to put the rest of my non-emergency-fund cash, and then probably split the ~$1k/mo in left over income between my 401(k) and my short-term grad school savings (whatever that turns out to be). It seems like the 401(k) keeps getting pushed down the priority list with no matching and this looming education expense, but I would at the very least like to contribute whatever of my income is left in the 25% tax bracket (approx $3k + whatever my bonus is) to some pre-tax savings.

This turned out a lot longer than I had expected. So I would really love any insight anyone cares to offer, but I am particularly interested in what, if any, are good ways to save money on a 2-3 year time period. Some kind of bond portfolio? Also, what are the merits of funding school with a Roth IRA? It is probably too short of an investment period for a 529 to be any good.

Another thing that I guess I should look into is exactly how much I intend to have saved going into grad school. I'd have to crunch some numbers on the opportunity cost of the savings sitting around as cash for a couple of years vs earning returns in a retirement account but having to partially debt fund school (I expect at least $100k out of school, but then again: who doesn't?). It may turn out to be the most beneficial to dump all of the extra money I make into a savings account to avoid any educational loans.

I tried to make this as focused as possible, but I apologize if it dissolved into my openly contemplating. Oops!


Thanks for your time to anyone who made it this far down. :)"
1etapo,1,2013-05-21,"Internship lied to me, thoughts to sway or reinforce me in what to do next?",intern332,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1etapo/internship_lied_to_me_thoughts_to_sway_or/,"I landed a semi-valuable, overall enjoyable and productive internship at a medium size company in my area doing technical work related to my major of study. 

Long story short, I got hired on and explicitly told how much I would be making an hour by the two people I work under and hired by. I stumbled across an email between my boss and the boss of the entire plant where my hourly rate is in question and after 50+ hours of work they might reduce my pay significantly due to a miscommunication and error on their part amongst themselves. 

I'm very put off by this and think its extremely unprofessional. My fellow classmates are making what I was supposed to be making in their respective internships and its essentially the going rate. I had other internship opportunities I turned down that I would not have knowing that they were going to pinch pennies and not pay what I feel is appropriate.

The dilemma is that I signed a summer lease of 3 months in the area that I will not be able to get out of. 

I'm looking for advice on how I should approach this when inevitably they approach me in the morning. I badly want to tell them I don't feel the compensation is appropriate and how underhanded it is to change the rate AFTER I got hired and started the job. 

Right now I think my best bet is to suck it up and finish out the summer and if a job offer is included (which is very likely) to tell them to politely shove it. It just feels wrong and distasteful. I have been highly motivated on the job these past few weeks and I know there will be a negative effect on my performance due to this shiesty behavior.  

Other option I've been thinking of the possibility of is to tell them that since we are changing my hourly I'd like my hours reduced as well. This accomplishes me  1) still getting credit hours with my university for the internship, 2) Still being able to put it on a resume, and 3) Being able to actually enjoy my summer not locked up in a place that's screwing me over.  I don't know how it would go over to tell them I want minimal hours but it's an idea im playing with.

1et4b5,1,2013-05-21,"Encouragement, Prayer and/or Advice",[deleted],Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1et4b5/encouragement_prayer_andor_advice/,"After working as a volunteer in several ministries over the past eight years or so, working as an intern for two years, serving on staff part time for about nine months and getting a Bachelor's degree in Biblical Studies, I am still having a difficult time finding a ministry position to serve in. I will be starting on my Master's degree in August (money permitting) and I am clearly called to serve in youth ministry.

The one thing that education and experience have left out is how to find a full time ministry position to serve in, outside of the church you have been attending. I check the online postings very frequently, trying to be among the first to apply for any appropriate position, but they typically fill quite quickly and I rarely get anything more than ""we are considering you for the position,"" and a day or two later ""we're sorry, the position has been filled.""

Tomorrow I will start going from church to church, looking for either available positions or youth pastors that know of available positions. I'm not willing to take a job that is clearly not a ministry to which I am called. I will not compromise with a church that promotes beliefs that I do not support. I'm not in it for the money, but if I am to serve full time, obviously I will need money to live on. The issue is not so much that I need the job for the money. The issue is that without a job that pays money, I will be left to take a non-ministry job for the money for my family to live on. This is, in fact, the reason I left the part time position I was paid for. It was very little pay, and I was happy to serve in the ministry, but the job I took required me to work nights to a degree that I was unable to continue serving.

I was never interested in youth ministry, but I ended up working in it a few years ago and came to realize that was where God was putting me. I am not interested in getting a job as a stepping stone to a ""better"" position. I am looking for a church to plug into. I expect to join a church as a youth pastor and watch my kids grow up in this church. I am more concerned about how well my wife, my children and myself will integrate into the church than I am about how much I will be paid. I want to join a ministry to serve and until I am serving in a ministry as I should be, I feel as though I am loafing about, not doing what God wants me to be doing.

I know that God has a plan. I know that the troubles we go through serve a purpose, in sculpting us for the ministry we will serve in. Obviously, I am not going to be able to lay out every detail that could pertain to these subjects in such a small post. Mostly, as stated in the title, I guess I am looking for encouragement and advice from other pastors who were looking for their first positions out of college. Otherwise, prayer has accomplished amazing things, but God loves to answer prayers that give Him the most glory. Such a large number of people praying would surely give Him glory when the prayer is answered. I'll try to remember to check back for advice and questions at least once a day, so do not get mad at me if I don't no life the post to catch every response immediately. It is almost 9:30pm and it will not be long before I leave for work.

If you have reached this point in the post, I appreciate the time you have put into reading it, the advice you provide and the prayers that are offered up."

I am a current junior going into my senior year and have had several interviews over the past month or so for internships. I have not gotten a single call back. I have no relevant experience as of now.

During the tech interview section I usually do extremely well, with several of the tech interviews having follow up questions that go beyond what is expected. During the 'behavioral' portion I also feel I do well, and am generally enthusiastic and try to make sure my passion for compsci shows.

I have felt all of the interviews have gone well (except for one), but have not gotten a single call back. What could I be doing wrong? When asked for feedback I either get no response or some canned HR drivel (""We felt you were a strong candidate but decided to go with someone else""...etc...). 

I am well groomed, no B/O or other such problems, show up early to interviews, and am well dressed. I am also decently sociable and by the end of a few tech interviews we are very friendly with each other talking some random CS topic or another (once the 'tech' questions are out of the way of course). 

When asked if I have any questions I of course do ask several, and I do some research about each company prior to be able to ask relevant questions.

Any advice is appreciated, thank you."

I (23 f) had been dating this guy (22) for 7 months.I was his first everything; kiss, sex, etc. During those months, I really enjoyed his company, he paid lots of attention to me, we never fought, all good traits of a healthy relationship. The only thing that concerned me was his lack of drive for his career. When we met, he was in his senior year of undergrad, hoping to become a detective. I started noticing how he would procrastinate with his school assignments; submitting them 2 minutes before an online deadline. He kept putting off his application for the local police academy. It really concerned me. 

I guess I should back up. I'm a junior, as of this fall, and I am a very determined person, so much to the point I will start working on a project the day it's assigned, even if it's not due for a month. You can see why this would irritate me.

I broke up with him under the terms that I wanted to focus on school (true), and that I wanted him to not have to wait for me or follow me around the world, as I want to work a few years internationally before settling down (Also true). Obviously, I still loved him, but it wasn't fair. Anyways, 3 weeks later (one week ago), we start talking again, because guys, he's my best friend. We eventually agreed on being friends with benefits. 

A few days ago, he told me he was going on a date. I tried to express a sort of happiness for him, but by the end of the conversation, I told him I was scared. Scared that I wouldn't be able to hang out with him again. Especially not with her, I have major jealousy problems. Major. Like some may even label me ""bat-shit crazy"". 

Fast forward to yesterday. He had the date, a girl he met on okcupid. He even showed me her picture. SHE LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE ME; same hair cut/ color, makeup style, and I swear I owned 2/3 outfits she had in her pictures. I'd never seen a more convincing doppleganger. It really hurt me. I felt like I was completely replaced.

I was supposed to go to a house party with him after their date. I told him I wasn't feeling well, and that he probably didn't want to hear what I had to say. No reply. A few hours later, I ask for all my stuff back. No reply. Delete him on facebook and my phone. I end up crying myself to sleep after two hours. Woke up at 5 am, from a dream about him. Cry. No reply. Decide to get all of his things together and put them on his porch. Text him at 5:45am telling him his stuff was there and to do the same with mine. No reply. 

I'm at a loss of what to do. I love him so much. Not to sound cliche, but I haven't been able to eat since 2 days ago. I've tried everything to keep my mind off him, and nothing seems to work. The worst part about it is, it's summer and all my friends have left town for internships, study abroad, or just to go home. It's literally just him and I, as far as our friends go.

I love writing code but I'm kind of limited in what I can do thanks to not paying any attention in class for all those years. I have shown the ""projects"" that I have finished by myself to CS professors/TAs, who have told me (nicely) that they are not really going to impress anyone.

However, the company spends anywhere between a few hours to a week creating websites for their business. This often means copying HTML/CSS code, mimicking other sites designs VERY closely. 

They also don't seem to have structure in regards to licensing fonts/graphics,etc. Often our instructions are to ""copy this site.""

My question whether I should work my computer lab job(20-39 hours / week) and focus on open source projects/side projects during those hours, or write a resume(however lackluster it may be) and hope for a small internship job without certainty that I will get one. I might add, I consider myself able to learn and adapt quickly to any language/environment. And my honest skills in languages right now is moderate-high in java, low to moderate in C++.

After writing this, I see my own bias towards taking the summer computer lab job that allows me hours to work on things of my own.

1ew7ed,33,2013-05-23,Two Sorcerers -,AFunnyThing-,gametales,https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1ew7ed/two_sorcerers/,"A long time ago,
when all of those men who live today's fathers were not even sperm in the sacs of their fathers, there was an orphaned elf by the name of Aza Alarin.
The orphaned elf was an apprentice for an apothecary in Greendale, and spent most of his days cleaning up, begging for change, and taking care of an easily-angered old drunkard by the name of Thaadius Winsor. In exchange for a place to stay and food in his belly, he would play the part of housekeeper and glorified slave in the unbridled hopes of one day learning a trade he really had no interest in (but beggars can't be choosers, now can they?).

One fateful morning, Thaadius Winsor sent delivery to the Elvish City Fort Lheao in the providence of the Seanchanni in the Southern Wood. The delivery, he marked, was ""of extreme importance"" with promises of lashing the payment out of him if he were to lose it... But promises of recognition if he were to deliver it.
It was a potion meant for a Lord there. A rare, experimental potion that was to cure any wound or ailment no matter how severe.

As it so happened, while travelling through those thickened woods, the youngling elf's ears picked up on sounds from the distance and an uneasy feeling vibrated down his body (the kind which he used to get when his father would cast spells). Curious, Aza diverted from the well-worn path to investigate. There, in the Southern Wood, is when Aza laid eyes upon a most beautiful High Elf, bloodied and surrounded by a pack of dead Dire Wolves.

Then, from nowhere, Aza was drawn on by others whom had heard the noises. Realizing he was just a youngling and the other High Elf was near death, demanded his money, his package, or his life. Deciding that none of those were rather pleasant options, Aza decided to make a third option - using a spell his father taught him to use in dire emergencies, he blanketed the area in a thick fog and dragged the High Elf to safety in the chaos.

Despite warnings, and no repercussions to be had for his inaction, Aza Alarin cracked open the salve and applied it to the wounds on the female. But she did not awaken. For a day and a half he gathered berries and hunted using the little spells he knew, and fed her as best he could. Upon the third day, she would regain consciousness and inquire about the events past. That High Elf would introduce herself as Shival Hakor, married to the Elven King Matrim Hakor.

Aza Alarin introduced himself as the son of Tucker Alarin and explained the events of the last few days.

Shival, being taken aback by the use of magic of a Youngling and the outright generosity he showed for someone he knew nothing of, went with the Young Elf's help to Fort Lheao and sent word for Aza's internship to be released from Mr. Winsor. She, out of her influence as Queen, provided him comfort and a home to live in. After indulging him in the depths of Elvish society once more, she began observing the youngling from a distance to see his actions via magic.

Every night, Aza would sneak out of his room, cast Featherfall to land quietly, and climb up the side of one of the taller buildings to count the stars and weave spells... Seemingly out of the blue with no words nor materials.
He would then return to the bottom of the window, cast a spell to throw himself up again, and pull himself into the window and sleep the next day.

One night, Shival Hakor invited the young Aza to her observatory to view the stars and to cast magic. When she inquired about his skill, he remarked that his dad and his family had always been able to use magic. And, when remarked about the stars, he said:

*""My mother always told me that the Stars were those we loved watching out for us from the afterlife. Every man and woman is a star. And, as they gaze upon us, we should gaze upon them.""*

Finally understanding the plight that the boy faced, and inspired by the child-like innocence when it came to magic, she sent to her husband that she would return with the Youngling for a period of time to the Ignis Faatus, the Magical Guild that sat upon the tower at the top of the Laboo Wilderness. After a weeks' ride, they became known at the magical guild and she settled him in with the finest instructors known in the realms, then resumed her position as a sitting adviser to the then-head of the Ignis, River Delphinius.

And from there, time and time again, wars would be fought and won - or lost - and evil would rise and fall. As Aza grew up and as Shival Hakor eventually resumed her name as Shival Felwind, he slowly became attached to the woman whom had changed his life.

Nothing came to fruition until the second time Aza Alarin would save Shival Felwind's life: The day the Abyss was nearly opened and those beings that haunt the chaos of Xel nearly slipped out and infected the world with Chaos.

During the fight with the Unholy Order of Xel (a cult dedicated to opening a gate to Xel and releasing Chaos unto the world) Shival Felwind became surrounded by the chaotic energies, herself defenseless since she was maintaining a spell to keep the gate sealed. Aza, the once-youngling now younger elf, waded through the corrupting energies and cast a ward about them both. The energies would eat at the muscles on his legs, making him eventually fall from his feet but maintaining the spell all the while.

After the battle was over, and the Chaos dispelled, Aza collapsed. This time, he was the one awakening later and asking about what time had been lost.

Shival Felwind was not there, for it would be inappropriate of a High Wlf of her position to show bend toward any common elf, but one of the Healers at the Ignis said that she had spent every night at his bedside - but not to tell her that because he was content with keeping his eyes open and working late (for whatever reason, Aza didn't ask nor did he care). But, as Aza tried to rise, he noticed that his legs failed him and that he could not walk on his left one.

He was told that the corruption permanently disfigured him, and that there was nothing that could be done. He would never use that leg again.

After hours, when a hushed silence would fall upon the infirmary and darkness would veil the eyes of sleeping mages, he would close his eyes and listen with his Elvish ears. Each night, a familiar shuffling of feet would resound and sit beside his bedside. And, each morning, they would leave. He had no doubt in his mind it was Shival, but he would never confront her about it.

One day, Aza Alarin would awaken to an unusual site. Someone had left him a specific object at the base of his bed: an animated rag-doll in his likeness. Aza smiled, knowing of only one enchantress who could weave life like that magic into fabric in imitation of life.

When he confronted her later on, Shival called him a fool and asked him:

*""Do you want to be a star so badly that you'd kill yourself for it?""*

To which Aza replied:

*""I find life much more bearable being the star looking down upon you than you the star looking down on me.""*

And that was the moment when Aza looked out into the stars for a moment, contemplating life and its meaning, when he first received a loving embrace and a gentle kiss from Shival Felwind.

From then on, no matter what the situation arose, she and he would hold that moment in time as pivotal moments in their lives. Aza would fall in love abroad and bare children, Shival would marry multiple times - both would fight wars and destroy evil that threatened the world... But, they would always share that moment and several others like it. Hidden from the world and in secret:

An Elf and a High Elf. Two Sorcerers."

1evrmz,0,2013-05-22,Going back for associates (for multiple reasons). Stupid idea?,gyrrdo,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1evrmz/going_back_for_associates_for_multiple_reasons/,"Here's the deal..

**How I f-cked up:**

* Graduated with my bachelor's in advertising, but opted to pursue a career in my hobby: graphic design.

**My situation now:**

* 2.5 years of experience as a 'graphic designer', multiple paid internships and freelance work.

* Severly underemployed. Hell, I might as well be unemployed. 

* Can't even get a retail job or work at Starbucks to save my life. The last time I landed a retail job, it was only part time for $10/hr which covered nothing but my travel expenses TO that job.

* Drowning in debt. $65k student loans/medical bills ($34k of which are private loans. They are killing me as they cannot be deferred like the federal ones.) I've exhausted my savings and used up all my forbearance time on them, except the federal loans.

**Why am I going back?**

* My portfolio sucks. All of my internship experience has been in production roles, churning out templates and correcting horrible existing designs. After doing this for so long, I feel my creativity has been killed. I hardly create anything good these days.

* While I am able to get small jobs from local businesses, my ability to work full-time at a great agency or get better paying clients is limited by my current skill level (and horrible portfolio)

* I need to get my private lenders off my back for a little bit.

**Two ideas:**

* Go back for a A.S. degree in graphic design - Only because I already have the experience, but need solid training and work to fill my portfolio. The CC I'm applying to has a required co-op program that places students in corporations during their studies. Considering I already have my bachelor's, I would only be in for about a year. I figure this route would get me closer to landing a stable job to pay my bills.

-or-

* Go back for a A.S. degree in computer science - I'm interested in web development, but I'm wary of throwing away my design experience. However, there are many corporations around here that have large IT departments. There is also a co-op program for this degree as well.

**Which of the two seems more practical? Or are they both foolish?**

Thanks, Reddit!

Reddit, what are your biggest pros and cons when it comes to adult life?",acrophobicapatosaur,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1evghg/just_started_working_74_and_my_quick_dose_of/,"It is a summer internship, and it has only been my first week, so I know it will get better, but regardless, the concept of being at work for 9 hours every day is freaking me out a bit. I feel like I have drastically less free time, especially since waking up early means I have to go to bed early, meaning I cant make up for ""lost"" time by staying up late.

This makes me worried because it has left me with the idea that as an adult I will not have as much time to do the fun things I currently do in my typical 20-year-old college student life, and as a result, will become unhappy. I fear that my life will turn into one giant routine and that I will end up feeling like the cliched corporate slave (think when Mr Incredible works at his day job). I try to find comfort in telling myself that once I grow up, all of my friends will be doing the same thing, so even if I could keep up my current lifestyle I would just become bored since I would have no one to hang out with. Then I tell myself that if Im going to be bored, I might as well be making money while Im bored. I understand that I have not gotten used to this lifestyle yet since I have only been a part of it for 3 days, but I am still very worried and would really appreciate some insight from you guys.



**What I mainly want to know are three things:**

1. What is the best part about being an adult?

2. What is the worst part about being an adult?

3. What do you do in your day-to-day life to combat #2?"
1evg5n,14,2013-05-22,"Proposing/Introducing a centralized and transparent bitcoin ""bank"" tentatively called ""minisats""",minisat_maker,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1evg5n/proposingintroducing_a_centralized_and/,"**Introduction and Overview:**

I am beginning a project I would like to dedicate my time to. It will be open-source, welcoming both forking and contribution. I believe it will serve an unimaginable number of uses. This might be a bit of a wall of text, but I'd rather be clear than catchy. I'm looking for any criticism, comments, questions, and contributions. **There's a TL;DR at the end.** Here's the idea:

At the most basic level, I'd like to create an open-source, totally-transparent, provably secure and trustworthy anonymous bitcoin bank. As awesome as it is to have the first peer-to-peer success of Bitcoin's magnitude, there are SOME innate perks to a centralized system that we can harness. I believe that if we built a centralized system that was *provably* open and just wrapped it as closely to the Bitcoin ideals as we could, we could get something pretty cool.

A user goes to the site. They request a new account, and two things happen. First, it generates a deposit address for them to send bitcoins to; second, it asks for an address they own. In order to do anything with the bank, they have to send both the command and the *signed* command to the bank. In this way, the user can control their account without ever revealing their private key to anyone, even the bank. The process may seem a little awkward, but this is designed to be securely handled by a trusted client-side program.

**Tips:**

Once the account has funds, you can send a tip to any other user. You can also send to any Bitcoin address, which will create an account for that address and just hold the funds until someone with the corresponding private key does something with them. A tip is instantaneous and irreversible. A tip consists of:

- An amount of bitcoins, with more precision than a satoshi. A transaction can deal with millisatoshis, microsatoshis, etc. I'm using the umbrella-term ""minisats"" for the sub-satoshi denominations.

- A memo, which would support an html-like markup language, capable of referencing other tips, other accounts, or just a general link. It will support small messages or links to larger media.

- (further on in development) ""custom tip behavior"", which will be modeled after [bitcoin contracts](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts). Contracts are currently dormant in the Bitcoin protocol, but offer some really interesting tools.

Each tip will cost a **very** small amount of minisats: something more comparable to a coin's ridges rubbing off after use than a credit card's transaction fees. This will be targetted to exactly pay off the server cost of managing the new information. It's hard to articulate the scale I'm talking here, but you'd have to be sending an insane number of tips for this to affect you in any significant way, and will be far, far less than the transaction fee associated with using the Bitcoin network directly. At the same time, it will basically prevent a ddos attack or spam from being ""worth it"" from the spammer's perspective.

**Data Analysis:**

There will be an exposed interface for viewing the tip history database, possibly just as simple as exposing part of an sql SELECT statement to the user. This will also be designed as a backend for other open-source tools built to access it. To run queries, a user must use an account with some small balance; queries will require some small amount of minisats again targetted to exactly pay off the rough cost of the query in terms of server processing time. This will encourage optimized queries over data-combing; a programmer with a bit of time should always find it affordable to run simple queries even if monolithic entities are running huge data-combing operations. The price will scale along with server demand, so we are always at peak perfromance without crashing. (I'm also considering publicly logging all data searching; what do you guys think about this?)

The culture surrounding this data availability will be like Facebook or Myspace, in that all of the information you could find has been uploaded with the understanding that it was public. This will, by the way, be an excellent way of demonstrating to new cryptocurrency users exactly what ""public yet anonymous"" means, and show them the ins and outs of this new set of rules and consequences.

**Example applications of data analysis:**

Consider the following algorithm that a client could perform:

Given an account id, it will find its biggest sent tips, return the info (from id, to id, amount, memo), limiting by saying something like ""activity last week"". Then take that pool of accounts, and repeat the process with their combined tips matching similar criteria. Continue for some small number of loops.

Now fill in the blanks with some examples. The account was your neighbor Joe's public account. Oh, he donated to that space program. Oh, he sent a few millisats to some other dude with the memo ""for homegrown carrots. tasted great, thanks!"". When the loop iterates again, you'll be reading about your acquaintances' biggest public expenditures. No matter how many loops you iterate through, you're always guaranteed a real person, not a spammer, because you're only getting to people who have done something to receive a tip from someone you trust, at least vicariously. Imagine knowing in an instant every restaurant review your friends have ever had in an instant by only searching the memo field for ""restaurant"", ""food"", or ""delicious"", and specifying only 2 or 3 degrees of separation. Imagine searching instead for the keywords ""amazing"" ""vacation"", and ""travel"", and letting it iterate through a few degrees of separation. Great travel ideas, just like that, pre-sorted in terms of how much your friends vicariously valued the comment. It will be like a subreddit for your life.

I'm sitting at home, up late becuase I can't sleep, and bored. My stoner friend calls me up and says he REALLY needs some pizza but he can't DRIVE and he has some BITCOINS that could be mine. I'm bored anyway, and I could use some more money, so I accept. When I get back home, I see he's tipped me with the memo ""that pizza was awesome. thanks for the delivery man"". A day or so later, I see I've received a tip (maybe with no money, maybe with a few microsats, maybe more) with the memo ""I see you delivered pizza last night super late. Would you mind delivering to my address for XX bitcoins/satoshis?"" He explains that he knows my stoner friend's friend, and he came across the first tip when searching for ""pizza delivery"". If the price is right, I agree. If not, I ignore it or make a counter-offer. And suddenly, with no effort on my part, I have the opportunity to begin delivering pizzas for profit.

Find yourself often killing time in town? Start taxiing your friends around for bitcoins, and soon their friends will be calling you up for rides. No money to pay for food tonight? I bet you could find someone who'd pay you to mow their lawn or shovel their driveway. Start with your friends, and branching out will be easy, with almost any line of work. If you do what you're good at people will pay you to do it again, and specialization will become as natural as breathing.

And beyond things that are just convenient for you to do, consider all the things that you *like* to do. Let's say that you like working with small [quadrotos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrotor), so you get one and start messing with it. One day you are able to program it to do something cool, so you make a video and post it somewhere associated with your account. If your friends think it's cool, they'll tip you for it, which both funds you *and* makes *their* friends more likely to hear about it. The cooler your video is, the more money you get from it, first from friends and then from strangers--and one day you could find that you have an ongoing crowdsourced fundraiser, moving enough money to you to buy a few more quadrotors and start working on [something like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp89tTDxXuI). The sky is the limit with this kind of growth, and the better you are at it the better this will work. And besides the money you'd get, you can browse the tips with any number of algorithms, finding the most constructive criticism quickly in the same way you can do so on Reddit.

This kind of thinking applies to *anything*. I believe that one day, with Bitcoin, restaraunts will fall to the people who just like to cook; specialty book stores will fall to people who like weird books; schools will fall to tutors and apprenticeships. I think this tool is the next step toward that. Why go to college for an engineering degree when you could instead just find and pay an engineer to let you shadow him for a day/week/month? Why take an internship when you could just impress that guy with your knowledge? If you pay attention and you're a smart kid, one day you'll find that he's willing to pay you to show up to work and tell him what you think. Why would an engineering firm hire a graduate when they've seen that your mentor (their associate through some degrees of separation) tipped you a significant portion of a payment for catching an important detail? All you have to do is do what you love as long as it's worth your time, and you'll find your place in the world.

I could go on and on about the amazing things this system could do, but if you're still reading this then you probably get the basic idea by now. I'm mainly posting here because I could use some help, and I'm hoping that this idea is exciting to someone else who can contribue to parts of the project that I'm less able to.

I can immediately start on the database manipulation and bitcoin handling, and when that's done I'm going to start on a basic AJAX interface, assuming no one has already begun making better interface tools. If anyone else is interested in contributing their skills, we'll need:

*At least one cryptology expert

*People willing to work on interface tools; on one hand the database searching, and on the other hand the tip/account management. I'd also like to see a basic tool that handles them both.

It would really help to have:

* Some well-known community member(s) getting involved to more easily prove project honesty/openness.

* Other people setting up their own servers with variants to see which systems and settings work better

* More ideas on how to make this *provably* honest and open. It will be trivial to prove the server *has* been honest, but I haven't yet figured out to prove that it *will* be honest.

* Users, ideally with friends to bring in to start building networks and dialogues.

* Finally, if you love this idea but can't help with ability or time, bitcoins are of course always welcome. I can coast for a while and dedicate my time to this project, but one day bills will come to take me away from this. You can bitcointip me, or my bitcoin address is 17BrEsAs2TY5PkgcyPWyNt2AyenBNTPcJr; depending on the activity of this project, tips will either go toward hiring more talent, tipping good contributions, or paying for my next batch of top ramen and internet bills. Keep in mind that if you'd rather not depend on my honesty, you can always find some other contributor to donate to. Once the ball gets rolling a bit more, I'm sure we'll set up a general donation address.

Alright guys. Sorry for the wall of text. I hope some of you get as excited about this as I am. I'm going to be watching this and responding when I can, and unless the feedback is such that the idea changes rapidly, I'm going to start on the project either today or tomorrow.

**TL;DR: Minisats will be a centralized but 100% transparent online bitcoin bank capable of regular-sized or incredibly small micropayments with memos called ""tips"", and the tips database will be searchable to an extent that will allow an incredible range of uses and, I truly believe, usher in a new era of social interaction like we can't imagine.**"

the first thing was i was getting eye pain... the next day it was eye pain + headaches. i used to get headaches as a chile, but i have not had any (other than the infrequents) for around 9 or 10 years. i have had a running headache for the past 4 or 5 days now, which comes and goes in waves... it will let up for an hour and then come back even stronger. yesterday, i had very bad stomach pains as well. so bad i had to leave my job early, come home, take 500 mg of naproxen sodium and go to bed at around 3:30 pm. for the past 3 days, my urine has been a very dark color. yesterday being the worst. looked like someone left a family sized tea bag in the toilet for a good while...

now, i HAVE been drinking slightly less water (as im not biking down here), the first day i had a headache i ignored it, but as soon as i saw my urine slightly darker, i upped the water 2 fold. (i would still say i was drinking more water than the average person though).

it did not help.... the stomache pains came the following day from me drinking more water.

the first week i was here, i was drinking bottled drinks, which makes me think its something to do with the water im drinking. im about to drive to walmart and get a few gallon jugs of water... my room mate never uses the refrigerator water filter, and when i did start drinking form it it tasted a bit funny. i let it run a bit and it cleaned up fairly well. 

so, my question to you guys: do you think the drinking water was the issue? or should i be worried about some illness? also, if it was the water, will switching to bottled fix that? or do you think i caught some pathogen that was lingering in the stagnent water in the fridges piping?"

1ezoye,24,2013-05-24,Talkeetna,Chalqk,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ezoye/talkeetna/,"Each passing minute felt like a pendulum passing slowly back and forth over my body. The air was icy and thick with snow. My heart still is racing just thinking about it. Emptiness. Everything is empty. But let me take you back to where it all made sense still.

December 17th, I've got a one way ticket to Alaska. Looking back I didn't know what I expected to look at more than snow. I hate the snow. I hated it then too but a job was a job, and I needed the money more than ever. A couple months back I had been offered a paid internship to work in Alaska at a hotel and work the front desk. Everything was paid for so I thought, ""What the hell."" and jumped on board the idea.

The plane ride there wasn't anything amazing. Minor turbulence here and there, but nothing too exciting.  Although I did have my doubts as soon as I got on that plane. We landed some time after midnight and the snow was six feet high; I didn't have an easy time finding the hotel. 

Now the hotel itself was privately owned and located just about 40 minutes north of Talkeetna. Now By the time my cab was in Talkeetna, I was beging to doze off but an eeriness crept on me like a poison. As I looked around, i saw nothing but darkness enveloping snow. The only word to describe this place was empty.

I arrived at the hotel around 4:00 am. I walked to the front desk with all my bags to only be greeted again by the feeling of emptiness. Everything was silent. Everything was also dark except for a single light over the front desk. There was no difference between here and outside. The cold was the same. 

After what seemed like two hours I began to snoop looking for someone only to find a man asleep in a manager's booth. It was the manager; his name-tag read, ""Randoll-Manager"". He looked something of about 50 years old, and pale as the snow. I knocked on the door but he did not stir. I opened the door, quietly calling his name but he did not awake. Finally I shook him lightly and he seemed to be coming to. Once I woke him up, he just stared at me with this revolted expression that made him look angrily concerned. 

""I'm the intern. I was told I'd be greeted and taken to my employee room in the last e-mail I got from here."" I spoke softly. His face slowly was beging to calm but his silence was giving me chills. 

""Fine, fine. Yes, come with me."" He seemed to be at a loss of words. He escorted me to my room; the room i would stay in for the next several months but he remained silent for the remainder of the trip. Finally i got into my room and Randoll just disappeared. I thought nothing of it and went right to bed.

The next morning was as cold as the night but the light was comforting. Now this hotel was beautiful, like an actual ski lodge, but much bigger. The views were breath-taking but in the first couple days there was a snowstorm. We didn't get a lot of service the first couple weeks because of the continuous snowstorm, but I was still being paid so I was content. Randoll hardly ever appeared around the hotel and it seemed like it was only him and I on staff. Occasionally people would leave their rooms for the day and come back later that night, or a service man would show up for an hour or two. But other than that this hotel was dead.  

It was in the last week of my first month (January 20th) that things started to change. People checked out, but they never came back. The service men stopped coming and i started seeing less and less of anyone at all. It was just Randoll and I. Alone. Now I got the weekends off but there was really nothing to do with a snow storm around. The food was all packaged for the employees for times like this so we were fine. I wasn't worried at all about the people not coming anymore, it just left me bored with nothing to do at the front desk. 

What started to worry me was that i stopped seeing Randoll as often and he and I never talked. I would just get a check under my door every two weeks. When i stopped getting my checks and Randoll stopped showing up anywhere at all, I was concerned. 

I began to look around again for anyone, or anything like a phone I could use. Even when I found one i didn't know who to call. I kept working, but always looking. About another two weeks went by and there were no signs of anyone in the hotel at all. I had practically memorized this hotel. 

Slowly, things started to seem a little colder and a little darker each day. Once I had missed two paychecks in a row, I decided that I would stop working and find Randoll. I looked EVERYWHERE for that man, but he seemed to always evade me, if he was even there at all. 

I did start to find things though. Subtle, odd things that barely caught my attention like a bike randomly in the lodge. But no this bike was covered in ice. It made no sense, but it gave me hope of finding Randoll after all. The snowstorm began to intensify and there was a low whistle everywhere in the hotel from the wind outside. 

Even once i could have sworn I saw Randoll walking at the other end of the hall then turning into another hall. But when I turned the other hall, there was nothing but an ice born draft on me. That cold draft never left me that day. 

Another couple days passed until I could literally stand it no more. I was going to pack my bags and leave before I got snowed in. It was around 8:00 pm so the sun was still up. Walking to my room I noticed something strange. A door was open. And I heard riffling. I began to approach the open door with caution. It wasn't the smartest idea, but I began to call out. 

""Hey, is anyone there?"" The riffling stopped. ""Hey!"" I began to run to the open door. Without warning a high pitched whine began to sound. I covered my ears and stopped in my tracks. What I saw emerge from the door ever so calmly was a tall (maybe 7 feet) albino human looking creature hunching over another human body. The creature's eyes pierced my mind and snared me. I vomited from the stench and the sheer terror of the beast and began to feel weak and ill. As I began to step slowly backwards. So too did the monster com forwards. 

The light passed over the creature in segments at a time. I had the nerve to run as fast as I could but not the will power. I caught another glimpse of the body the creature was dragging along. Randoll no doubt. I didn't know where else to go but in my room. I vomited again this time being more stomach acid than food. I began packing everything I had brought, while trying to think of a way to leave without crossing paths with it again. I could hear it inching forward a short ways down the hall. 

Every time I thought of it's image I gagged. Once I had everything ready to go in a makeshift packing effort I stood silent to listen. I could hear the creature no more. I waited then for about an hour before I mustered the courage to open my door. My hands were sweaty and shaky and my head was pounding from a headache. I opened my door so silently I even shocked myself. Not long after I poked my head out to check down the hall. Nothing, as usual. The blood on the floor carried on down the hall. It must have been from Randoll. 

I began making my slow and steady escape from this horrific hotel. Once I was out of the hall and into the main entry I felt better. Although I did see the manager room door open. In my better judgement I wouldn't have checked, but a small part of me BEGGED to know why.

I walked over to the manager's room where I showed my flashlight. It made me jump when I saw it, but i immediately felt sorrow. Randoll's lifeless body stared down to the floor. Right. Into. My. Soul. I didn't know him well, or at all for that matter, but he was just a confused old man after all. He still had that stare he always had.

I left and never went back. I don't think I'll ever go back to any places with snow now. They all feel empty."

I can probably secure housing after that, but there's a chance I may have to be homeless for a little while. I will not have a vehicle, which would make it considerably easier. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for homeless living in a large city like DC? What services can I take advantage of, what areas are safe, what 24-hr places are there?

I graduated 2 years ago with a BA in economics. I had a job for approx 6 months as an accounting clerk, even though it was at a bookkeeper level it still gave me a small taste of accounting and between work and the financial accounting classes I recently have taken I enjoyed it and knew this was the career path for me.

My only concern though is that I didn't take advantage of the my previous university's career services while I was going for my econ degree. In addition, my current university which I'm enrolled under their accounting certificate program, doesn't have the largest network/career services for the big 4. How do I make my self noticeable to them?

Finally, since my workload is fairly light right now(wasn't able to get as many classes as I wanted), would it be a smart thing to start studying for the CPA exam so I can take it as soon as I have enough credits to sit for it, even though I haven't taken the necessary classes.

Also when would be the best time to start looking for the big 4? Would they consider me as an intern candidate with only 4 accounting classes under my belt, or would I be better off looking for an intern once I begin sitting/passing my cpa exams?

thank you for the guidance"

I make it less than two months and I start getting a burning in my stomach, go to an urgent care just to hear it could be gerd or ulcers. I wasn't happy but they gave me medicine I FELT HORRIBLE got nauseated had a nurse tells me if that happens go to ER (this is visit number 1). Sit there for hours get some magic nausea pill and I'm feeling alright and they give me some mix of crap that kills the pain for my stomach great! They give me another medicine to try and I'm on my way 6 hours later at 3 in the morning.   
  
Next day I'm so nauseated its worse than before in so much pain I finally fall asleep from exhaustion clutching my stomach. LOW AND BEHOLD its the medicine I deduce and after a second episode of nausea and It hits me a third time and I head to the ER (visit number 2) mind you I am new to my area and I am using the ER and urgent cares because I can't see a Dr. for 2 weeks I am playing a waiting game because no Dr. seems to think its important enough to see me despite how horrible I am feeling. I GET EVEN MORE NEW MEDICINE.

Here is where it gets mildly better the DR we though we had told us the wrong date and if we waited I have to take another week and a half of horrible nauseated nights. We call around find 1 DR that said ""You have been in the ER twice? Can you come in this Thursday?"" hell yes I can and I think everything will be better. Finally see that doc and he does a physical and evaluates me mentions a slight spine curve nothing serious but just adds on the pile said it is probably what causes my back tension. While he does that I keep thinking man my joints have been hurting a lot lately and he says it could be the medicine so get off of it for a few days and lets see. Few nights of nausea and pain and yup its the medicine yet another switch. I get a new one it gives me more problems related to gerd which at this point we thought it wasn't necessarily, like really it caused problems?  
  
Do H-pylori test hoping for an easy answer but noooo can't be that simple for me no luck. At this point I've also had headaches and the Dr is a little concerned which made me really concerned the guy hardly listened to me some times it seems but he was helpful and got me a neruo referral and a gastro.  
  
Well gastro calls to schedule 4 fucking months away I am still waiting till July for this. Neuro schedules but hey doc my face muscles feel tight and so does my right side of body kinda Dr says go to ER to be evaluated ASAP. I do get brain scan no doesn't seem like your dying but its probably tension headaches.  
  
Mind you while all of this is going on so is school I went from not missing a single lecture or anything in an entire year which I was proud of and I'm missing two lectures a week at least. So I have to go out even more and try and catch up in between all of my lab classes and work.  
  
Well back to the DR. between all of that and he throws me on Nexium and if you don't know its the big boy stuff for these kind of problems and its $150 bucks a month which is like a fortune for me between paying rent and other expenses. 

Hurray all the Nexium at least makes me mobile again not more clench over, or may be I'm healing and it is bad ulcers the doc doesn't know and I won't know for months.   
  
In the mean time I am now off to Physical therapy for tension headaches and it kinda pulls the tension to other places and that gives me head aches when I wake up now. I ran out of sample Nexium the doc gave me and I am on day 2 with out it and my insurance didn't authorize it. So I had to wait even longer and literally as I wrote this I got a call that it will be there hallelujah something descent is happening.  
  
To put icing on the cake my fuckin girlfriend the best person in the whole fucking world took care of me with all my sickness and bitchyness that I am sure was there and then she had to leave for an internship for 6 months leaving me in the apartment by myself which with out being sick wouldn't be as bad but has left all but depressed and lonely since friends have gone for the summer and she works a really tight 16 hr schedule at her internship daily where she barely gets service so can't text me often.  
  
And grades came through I should have had all A's but ended up with B's in a couple classes which isn't bad but when the reason is you missed a few points on the final for my calculator fucking up mid test, and the other teacher changed the question HE SAID WAS FOR SURE ON THERE to something else.  
  
Here is to hoping I'm slowly not rotting from the inside out with something horrible as the Drs play the waiting game with me and that 2013 some how turns up (which wouldn't be hard at this point).  
  
And to every god damn person that doesn't get the care they need and have it a million times fuckin worse that I do. I am sorry and I wish every goddamn person the best because I know I am stressed out, and tired, and just wanna be able to walk around with out thinking ""why does this part hurt now?"""
1ez6yg,12,2013-05-24,Should I change my major to CS or do a Professional Masters in CS?,NextTopNerd,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ez6yg/should_i_change_my_major_to_cs_or_do_a/,"So I am currently pursuing a BS Accountancy &amp; BS IS/IT with a minor in CS. My original plan was basically get my BS Accy/IT in 2014 and do MS Accountancy for my CPA and ultimately graduate in 2015.

However, all my plans have been thrown to the whirlwind the past couple of years as I have slowly discovered that I love CS and don't really like Accounting (even though I'd say I'm good at it.) So right now, my options are to change my degree altogether, abandon Accounting and stay an extra year to get only BS in CS by 2015 or I could get that Accounting and IS/IT degree, and pursue a professional masters degree in CS and graduate in 2015. 

I have taken the requisite of CS and Math courses to get into the M.C.S program at my university, so I should be fine in that respect. I am also currently doing a CS internship this summer. I am just really confused which option to go by - especially because I know I want a career in CS (either software engineering or databases/data mining), and I don't know if my business background will hold me back from other candidates if I do decide to go with Masters.

Cost wise and time wise, there is not much difference as I was always planning to stay till 2015. I'm just confused about which option would be the best career-wise. Any advice... is there any other alternative that I haven't considered?"

So I am in college and got a raise at my internship so I figured I would celebrate with a little upgrade in the price range of $150-200.  

I was thinking about one of the following:

* adding a second monitor
* adding a second GPU
* downsizing because I am back and forth from college and my case is massive.  I only really move it during winter break and for the summers though so it isn't a huge deal.  

And suggestions on what to upgrade even if it isn't on that short list?  Thanks"
1eyxul,2,2013-05-24,Undergrad with questions about admissions/undergrad school,dayne-sword,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1eyxul/undergrad_with_questions_about/,"Hi, I'm a college freshman finishing up my year at a large state flagship. I wanted to know how important an undergrad institution is in grad school admissions. I'm at my current school primarily due to finances; when I applied, my family wasn't doing too hot. Academically, I'm doing great (4.0), double majoring in Math/CS with a minor in Econ.

-I came in with AP credit, got to some mid-upper level courses, and am involved in research with a professor as well (CS prof).  I've done lab internships since HS, and I'm very sure I'd like to go to gradschool and become a researcher.

- Overall, I don't feel satisfied with my school beyond doing 'well' there. I'm happy with my grades, work, etc. but the overall educational expereince isn't what I wanted. I'm not too fond of the atmosphere or size either. Due to this, I've thought of transferring to an overall better school (my school has a strong CS dept, ok math dept, and very weak econ dept). The schools I want to transfer to will have equal CS department strength, and better math/econ departments.

- If I transfer, which would be as a junior, and leave my current instituion- I'd have to ultimately find a new prof to work with. Does having breaks/working with different people matter? I have an REU for this summer, and I'll probably try one for the next. Is research experience in general more important than whatever specific projects you have worked on (as long as they're fairly relevant).

- I'm split on whether I want to go to grad school for Econ or CS. I enjoy both subjects. At my current school, there's research going in CS that I like, but the Econ department isn't doing work in the areas I'm interested in. If I transfer, I could work in areas of Econ I enjoy, and even I end up not enjoying Econ work, I could still continue work in CS areas I'm interested in (which is at all the schools I'm interested in transferring too).

- Ultimately, down the road I may regret not transferring. I have this feeling at the back of my head that I could've gone to a better undergrad. I don't know if this will be bad for grad admissions since I'd sort of have to start over at a new school, though by then I'd have almost 4 years of lab/intern research experience in total. In either case, transfer or not, I'll still focus on gaining skills.

-Thanks!

1eys0a,6,2013-05-24,[Hiring] VouchedFor - London based tech Startup is looking for a couple of crack interns to kick our growth into overdrive!,VouchedFor,london_forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/london_forhire/comments/1eys0a/hiring_vouchedfor_london_based_tech_startup_is/,"Job Title: Graduate Intern

About us: VouchedFor is a disruptive Start-up in the financial services sector. We like to think of ourselves as the TripAdvisor of independent financial advice. In other words, we let people find, rate and review Independent Financial Advisers and have plans to do a whole lot more.

We’ve already secured partnerships with major industry players, received great press coverage and have the backing of an awesome group of investors with successes like Betfair, Zoopla and Gumtree under their belts.

We’re based in SW London and are currently recruiting two Graduate Interns to join our growing team.

Description: There are two roles up for grabs

Social Media and Communications Intern

Raising awareness of our brand is key to making us grow quickly. Working with our Communications &amp; Marketing Manager you’d be instrumental in devising and implementing campaigns to ensure that VouchedFor becomes synonymous with personal finance. Regular tasks will include:

Social: Write unique engaging blog content; Engage our audiences through social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn); Manage our blogger outreach programme
PR: Develop insightful reports, analyses and infographics; Draft press releases, surveys and pitch stories to trade and consumer journalists
SEO: Develop and manage a link build programme; identify opportunities for on-site optimisation

Business Development Intern

Generating and fostering new relationships as well as building on existing ones within in the industry are key to driving our business forward. Working with our Business Development Manager you will be at the forefront of our B2B efforts, making VouchedFor a must have for every IFA. Regular tasks will include:

Account Management: You’ll be in charge of nurturing relationships with IFA’s and developing new systems to ensure that our growing database runs without a hitch
Onboarding (Just our fancy word for getting advisers up to speed on the site!): VouchedFor is always evolving which means new options and packages for our IFAs. This role involves keeping the IFAs up-to-date with current changes and ensuring they’re on the best package for their needs
SEO: We’ve developed a successful link building programme (you’ll have the keys to the car to make it even better!); identify opportunities for on-site optimisation
B2B Marketing: It’s all about getting our name out there in the industry so you’ll be involved in generating new business through your weird and wonderful marketing ideas.

Above all don’t forget we’re a Start-up so no 2 days will ever be the same. It’s about diving in, coming up with ideas, trying them, figuring out what works, and doing more of it. We’re always open to fresh insights and there is plenty of scope for the roles to evolve. We are all the time.

Salary: Initially we’ll be looking to pay National Minimum Wage but for the right candidate we’d hope to turn this into a permanent salaried role. However, if you’re set on joining a blue chip and using us as a stepping stone we’ll be happy to have helped you on your way.

About you: You’ll have graduated from a good University and be dedicated, full of ideas, happy to get involved and give things a go. We’re looking for analytical minds, so you’ll be adept at identifying issues and solutions and spotting opportunities, and how best to maximise them. Both of these roles have huge potential to grow, and the right people will be instrumental in helping to shape our business. An interest in personal finance and/or relevant work experience would be a bonus but not essential as we’ll be here to get you up to speed.

Most importantly... How to apply?

We’d like to see your CV, but just as importantly we’d like to know why you’d like to work with us. So ditch your usual blurb and let us know in one sentence, maybe two, why you’d like to join the team… Bonus points for originality!

You must have full entitlement to live and work in the UK.

1eyrh3,19,2013-05-24,[Intro] Hey everyone! I found this subreddit recently and thought it was a great idea.,Kafke,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/1eyrh3/intro_hey_everyone_i_found_this_subreddit/,"I gotta say. Seeing subreddits like this and others similar is pretty amazing. I never thought I'd see people online gifting to complete strangers. I've done some gifting myself (through twitter, /r/playitforward, and other various sites), and found that it's actually pretty fun to see others reactions.

So... A little about me: I'm a 20 Y.O. college student who's close to graduating. I'm a computer science major and spend a lot of my time making and playing video games. I'm more of a Nintendo fanboy, and I like their consoles/games over the compeition. I'm currently playing through Kingdom Hearts DDD on my 3DS (I love that little console).

I'm also a fan of anime. I frequent /r/anime and I keep track of everything through [my anime list](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Kafke). I like a wide range of shows from action stuff like Death Note and Baccano! to more light hearted shows like K-On! (yes, I'm one of those people).

I don't know how much I'll be able to gift right now, seeing as most of my money is going toward living costs and school costs. But I'm working on getting an internship over the summer and will hopefully be able to gift some people.

So... Any one else here like games and anime? Is anyone into computers and programming? General interests?

And finally... Did I do my flair/wishlist right? I'm somewhat new to Amazon and hadn't really messed with the wishlist system much. Hopefully I did it right."
1eypp2,11,2013-05-24,My First Mania,BigBallinGPR,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1eypp2/my_first_mania/,"This is the story of my first bout into mania.  I just want to share to see if anyone has had any similar experiences.
It’s been five days since the music festival and I still can’t sleep.  I’ve already purchased my tickets to go see Bassnectar perform again a few months and 600 miles from now.  I’ve been continuing to go to work at the semiconductor company where I’m an engineering intern and I can’t stop coming up with amazing ideas to pursue in regards to production control fixes.  This upcoming weekend is a four day weekend due to the fourth of July and I can’t wait for it to come.  I get off work after another amazing day at the office and proceed to head home as usual.  I am so excited to go cliff jumping tomorrow that I can’t contain my excitement.  I start jamming out to the music I’m listening to at the light and proceed to get weird looks from the car next to me.  I laugh and continue jamming, really, really hard.  
I make it home and proceed to head to my office where I’ve spent the past few days and nights watching videos on youtube and reaching out to the people who’ve created them, offering my opinions on their material as well as commending their dedication to their videos.  I spend the next few hours doing the same and eventually realize that I need to eat dinner.  I start cooking spaghetti and realize that there’s a ladybug on the ceiling.  I feel as though this is a sign for the upcoming fun tomorrow and pay close attention to what the ladybug is doing.  It starts walking on the light fixture above me and I start to count how many squares it’s traveled on the plastic covering of the light.  14.  I make sure to remember this number as it’s sure to help me in my adventure the following day.  I finish cooking and eat my well-made spaghetti, it’s delicious.
After cleaning up the dishes, I go back to the office and make the stark realization that chairs are evil and that I shouldn’t be using one.  Chairs promote a sedentary lifestyle that I can’t even imagine living at the moment and it bothers me to be in the same room as one.  It goes out into the living room.  The ladybug has followed me into this room, I take this as another sign that the number 14 is going to be vastly important.  I start to listen to music on soundcloud and play a song by NitGrit called “The Awakening”.  I remember that there’s a video someone made to it and proceed to watch it:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Wcv5sfiuQU
Its super trippy and I somehow feel connected to it, that the ladybug who is on the ceiling is somehow trying to tell me about life lessons.  After it finishes, I start to scribble everything that comes to mind down on my dry erase calendar on the wall.  To me, everything is interconnected and makes perfect sense.  I draw one line from a realization to another, thinking of the ways these things interconnect and are meant to be.  I’m a genius.  The rest of the night continues on, with me listening to more music on soundcloud and writing the artists, telling them how I want to start a music label and that they should hit me back if they’re interested.  
The morning comes and my friends arrive for our trip out to the waterfall where we’ll be cliffjumping and swimming.  I still haven’t slept.  I show them all of the amazing connections on my calendar and proclaim how excited I am about life.  One friend seems to get what I’m saying and comments on a few of the connections and how it’s an interesting take on the relationship.  I agree and am stoked that someone else shares my new view on life.  We pack our things into the car and proceed to get ready to head out.  My neighbors are outside, a young couple in their late twenties doing some yard work.  I strike up a conversation about the weather since it was nice out and proceed to fill them in on our entire trip planned for the day.  They seem curious about cliffjumping since they’ve never done it before so I tell them that it’s about the best natural rush you can possibly get.  I’m having the best day ever I think to myself.  
	We finish packing and head down to the local REI.  Me and a friend are going to buy some Vibram five fingers for the trip.  In our opinion, these are going to be the best shoes ever to go cliff jumping with, and I willing drop $90 on a brand new pair.  I buy a year-long membership to REI while I’m there because hell, why not.  We pick up parking passes for the place that we’re heading to and embark on the short trek out there.  On the way, I’m starting to feel how the music we’re listening to is affecting our immediate moods.  It’s also interesting to me to note when we drive through shady spots as opposed to light spots.   I’m convinced that something about the shade brings out more negative conversation than that of when we’re in the light.  I keep telling my passenger to make notes of the some of the things that we’re thinking up on the way out there.  “Wandering thought train of love” is what I feel we are while in my car and am stoked on it.  Rolling down the windows completely changes the dynamic of the ride and each billow is affecting my mood.  I’m amazed that I hadn’t noticed how light and sound affected me previously and make sure to tell my friend to jot down (364) because it represents the light spectrum from a computer’s standpoint.  
	We arrive at the exit and no joke, its number 41.  I take this immediately as a good omen because of the number 14 that the ladybug had told me the previous night.  I get utterly excited and know that I am meant to be here at this place with all of these specific people.  We make the 2-mile hike in to the waterfall and setup shop at its base.  There are tons of people that I know here who I wouldn’t normally expect to see and I start to feel as though I’m the reason that they’re here.  People from my high school, people from work, and people from my college all in the same spot enjoying what I feel to be the most beautiful day ever.  I start talking to one of my friends from college, saying how I’m never smoking or drinking or doing drugs ever again because I’m so high on life.  He questions me on it and I argue that there is no better high than being completely sober because it allows you to experience all of your senses to the max.  He shurgs, agrees, and walks off with beer in hand.  
	The day progresses and I meet an Indian fellow taking pictures of the waterfall.  I ask whether or not he’s from Gao as I would love to visit there someday.  I’ve heard about headphone parties they have there where there are 3 DJs spinning and you can select which one to listen to on your headphone frequency selector.  I take his contact info down in my phone because I really want to go to India.  Cliffjumping concludes and I depart from my group to head the complete opposite direction where my parents live.  I realize I haven’t packed anything for the 3 day weekend but I could care less.  All I have on is a shirt, shorts and my vibrams.  
	On the drive out, I stop at a local convenience store/ gas station to pick up some gas and grub.  I feel as though I’m meant to stop here.  I start talking to these teens who have the same hat as one of my friends that I was at the musical festival with.  I ask if they know her and it turns out that they do.  I’m not surprised by this because I’m at the point where I’m feeling all powerful and that everything is happening for a reason.  I text my friend saying that I met Lucas, one of her friends from the ski camp where these teens were staying.  I get a huge question mark in return.  I proceed to the checkout and the cashier looks at me, and says that he was at the same music festival.  He tells me that he just went and was able to get in completely free.  I am now convinced that something divine is happening to me even though I’m not a religious person at all.

1eyhzv,0,2013-05-24,"I feel like this is something that bothers me, but I don't think many people will see it as a problem. Or at least, not yet.",mykelmontes815,ainbow,https://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/1eyhzv/i_feel_like_this_is_something_that_bothers_me_but/,"I understand we're currently in an era in which a majority of society view gay rights as a necessary value, while at the same time, we are struggling with legalizing same-sex marriage everywhere since there are still people intolerant of homosexuality. So, I feel like there is an issue that needs to be acknowledged, but will most likely be ignored since we already have the main problem.

Still, I'd like to ask about the issue of today's teens that come out and try to define themselves with their orientation. Most teens want to be noticed, and will do so by finding something to be recognized by, and many will use sexual orientation. I think that this has resulted in some teens lying to themselves about their own orientation after seeing how interesting gay culture is. I've noticed it with a friend I knew in middle school who temporarily considered himself bisexual.

I'm not saying that teens that come out as gay/bisexual today are lying, but I believe that some are.

My sister has this friend who is openly gay. Before he came out, I believe he did have a crush on my sister. I'm not sure. But when he came out, my sister said that his attitudes and behavior changed. He would speak loudly and with feminine tone with many friends, but would speak completely calmly and naturally with my sister. He also made his straight friends uncomfortable by hitting on them, to the point where the straight friends had to tell him to stop.

I also know of another gay young man who is very trendy and fashionable (his Facebook profile said he was an intern at Vogue) who was in a group of friends I saw at Starbucks. Two of my friends talked with them, and when the group of friends left, the gay young man called to my friend and said ""See you when you turn 18"". I've also seen a picture on Facebook of a student with a substitute teacher, and the young man commented on it saying ""This sub looks very fuckable.""

I think that it is fairly annoying when straight people bring up their sexual desires when it is unwelcome and I believe it is equally annoying when people of another orientation do the same. It would be hard for one to speak out about it because that person would risk being viewed as homophobic. I truly believe that sexual orientation should not define a full person. I understand that this was a good thing to do when people needed to rebel in order to defend homosexuality, but these days, I think homosexuality should be blended in so that sexual orientation becomes only a normal human characteristic, along with ethnicity, height, weight, hair color, eye color, etc.

I feel like the type of teenagers that I complain about only make it harder for intolerant folks to learn to accept homosexuality in society, and also contradict the idea that sexual orientation is a natural gene that humans are born with. I think this is something that needs to be addressed so that orientation can be accepted by everybody without appearing abnormal.

Hopefully, I worded this well and didn't come across as offensive, and if I did come across as offensive, I apologize. But I am curious to know what others think."

I'm a 3rd year computer engineering student from Canada. I've taken a year off (to work as an intern) and I'm really interested in contributing to an open source project on the side. Cloud computing seems perfect for me because I love Infrastructure/Operating Systems while preferring a higher level language like Python. I do not have too much experience working with large codebases and I have little to no experience contributing to an open source project. Do you think it's a little over-ambitious as a first project? Should I focus on something easier? And if I do decide on OpenStack, where exactly do I start? There seems to be a sea of documentation that leaves me confused. I found the Nova compute platform relatively interesting.

I decided to move back to my parent's home, borrow money from them, and use it to get a CS degree (and hopefully a programming job). Unfortunately, my work history is utter shit: throughout high school and college, I only worked a couple of unimpressive jobs, and only a few months at each. I did not find a job after the B.A, and moved home just a few months later.

 While I would prefer to spend all of my waking hours outside of school programming, in the hopes of building a good portfolio and impressing internship recruiters (and because it's FUN!), I wonder if I'm just setting myself up for disaster by not working. I worry that I am becoming (or already am) unemployable.

But I decided to take it because I'm guessing one of the most important things hurting me was a lack of experience (had no prior internship experience specifically in my career field). Anyways, I go in first day this Monday and they just throw everything at me. They expect me to know the whole process and system right away. My boss explains the whole process in 20 minutes in general terms and he expects me to know all the details. There literally is only a 30 minute training session on the software when I come in the first day and that's it. My boss keeps on making remarks on why I don't get stuff, but he never fully explains what I'm supposed to do. I could tell he is also stressed because the entire department is so behind on everything and they are missing deadlines. So they are shoving stuff into me without explaining stuff and expect it to get done. They are so unorganized in their process. Lastly, you can tell the department is low on morale. None of the employees in my department seem to care about each other. They work, they go home. No small talk, nothing. Their pay is as low as mine, and one of my co-workers just quit literally the 2nd day I came in. Never showed up again. Didn't even call them. The supervisor called her and asked her and she just said that she quit. I'm really not exactly sure what I should do r/jobs. I have to keep the job for the experience, but I'm already looking for ways out. When can I start applying for new jobs? Is it way too soon? Will employers look bad upon that? If I leave in like 3 months, will my supervisor give me a horrible recommendation, thus making this job experience essentially useless?"

Still, I've been having it rough lately, so I need to spit it out.

Last year I started dating a friend's sister. Everything was great for the first three months, we were really into each other... until she told her parents I have Asperger's. She didn't tell me she was going to do it, nor she did ask for my permission. I was devastated because it was a really hard topic for me at the time, especially without my consent, and fell into a depression that only got diagnosed recently.

I was deathly afraid of how they would react because I've been discriminated against and bullied because of my syndrome in the past; I thought ""What if they don't approve of me now? What if my girlfriend changes her mind about me?"". One would think that it should change nothing... but things *did* change. She became progressively more distant and cold, and whenever I asked if anything was wrong she would say she just was tired. She stopped inviting me over to her house and having lunch with me, and whenever I complained we were spending too little time together she said she was too busy with her internship. That didn't stop her from spending time with me before, but I decided to trust her and do my best to cope with my insecurity.

Two months went by this way, with her becoming more and more distant but denying anything was wrong, and me feeling more insecure and unwanted. In the end, we were spending maybe an hour per week together. I blew up and told her I couldn't take it, that I felt she was not interested in our relationship anymore. She called me selfish and said I could not expect her to spend more time on me. We had an argument and decided to take a break to think things through. She didn't talk to me for a whole week, and whenever I tried to talk to her she would push me away. In the end, I had to ask her brothers what was wrong... they both said she didn't want to be with me anymore.

The next day she talked to me, and broke up with me using lame excuses and even lying to me to make me feel guilty. This devastated me. I mean, she never even voiced a complaint about me and now she's so desperate to get away from me as to not even give me a proper breakup? I was dumbfounded for a month, but then I became incredibly angry. I didn't do anything to her to deserve that treatment. I made the mistake of venting out on Facebook... of course she heard about it. She called me and told me she wanted to talk to clear things out. I said no, because I still was too hurt and needed more time to heal. So she proceeded to write me an email with everything she wanted to say. I didn't want to read it, but I forced myself to because I felt that at least I could learn something. I was wrong: it was all even lamer excuses and childish banter. I couldn't believe it, *this* was her way of clearing things up? In the end, I just gave her what her wanted: I told her I understood what happened better now, then I told her that I loved her for real, that not having her with me hurt too much so I needed her to stay away from me. We haven't talked or seen each other since then.

It's been about seven months since she broke up with me. During that time, I've been going to therapy to try and overcome my fear of being discriminated, as well as trying to understand what went wrong with our relationship. It took us a lot of effort because many of the things she said and did were so contradictory, but in the end we had to accept it was because I have Asperger's... literally *nothing* else happened that could have driven her away the way it did and make her leave without any explanation at all. It's very probable her parents stopped approving of me, and their approval was way too important for her. My therapist says I need to understand she's way too immature for her age (she's 24). I have a hard time understanding it, tho, it's just too alien to me. It hurts a lot to think about it, even now.

In the meantime, lots of other things have happened: I severed contact my ex's brothers (both were really good friends, even after their sister broke up with me) and I distanced myself from our group of friends because I didn't know how to deal with the situation and they were making too many questions; I realized I can't really use the rest of my friends to vent out or as support because they know my ex or her family too; my family is too far away to give me any real support, and those who are closer don't understand anything about my condition or my past traumas; my depression and self-questioning have caused me to realize I took a wrong turn in my choice of career studies, which I still don't know how to deal with since this is my last semester before graduating. To top it off, right now I feel like I'm going to stay alone forever, with my circle of friends shrinking and little to no free time to meet new people because of college. My therapist and psychiatrist have helped a lot, I have to admit... but there's times I still feel overwhelmed by all of this.

I am writing to inquire about possible internships in the HVAC field at COMPANY; my résumé is enclosed for your consideration. COMPANY philosophy that engineers should never stop learning and be on the cutting edge of technology appeal to me as a learning mechanical engineer.

Currently I am pursuing a bachelors of Science degree in mechanical engineering from COLLEGE. During my senior year I took a HVAC design course. The class required heating and cooling load calculation to be performed and from these calculations the hydronic and duct system were developed and implemented. The HVAC project introduced me to certain aspects of engineering, such as the economical aspect, efficiency, and the feasibility of the design.

In the course of my three years at COLLEGE, I have demonstrated my motivation, energy, and passion for engineering. In addition, I have learned to work efficiently under tremendous stress and, with limited resources, to accomplish goals. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute these abilities to COMPANY. I am available for an interview at your convenience. If you would like to call me rather than email me back, you can reach me at PHONE NUMBER. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

I've been trying to find jobs (mostly on Indeed and company websites). So far I have had absolutely no success; not even a phone call.

My problem, I think, is that I was not able to land an internship in college and I wouldn't say I am exceptionally gifted in any IT field; I'm pretty equivalent with most college grads, probably. 

I am getting a little depressed doing this and am wondering what options I may realistically have.

Any advice for a recent college grad with no experience? Is there anything I should be doing besides just handing in random job apps?"

Since day three of my freshmen year, I've been dating my girlfriend. We actually got together out of a hook-up; I was being an adventureous college male and stumbled into a 4 year relationship.

Since the beginning, we've had a lot of problems: she's pretty clingy, she's jealous time I don't spend with her, the list goes on. Half way through our freshmen year, she had a mental breakdown due to depression. I spent my entire second semester taking care of here, as she had made no friends except me. During this time, due to forced counseling I made her receive, she was diagnosed as bi-polar.

Near the end of that year, she had to take a medical leave from school to avoid failing her semester. Against my better judgement, I helped her lobby my mother to allow her to move in with me at my family's apartment during the summer. She did, and after I finished school, we spent the first part of the summer together. As that summer went on, I began to doubt us, and grow resentful of here; I worked all day and would want to see friends at night, but she just wanted to sit in her room and watch television from dawn to dusk. 

At about July of that summer, I asked her to go home a few times abortively, but chickened out and asked her to stay after I saw her reaction. It was about this time she began to say suicidal things over the possibility of me leaving her. Eventually, my mother had enough and bascially forced her to go home; though I acted hurt in front of her, I was secretly incredibly grateful to my mom. I moved her back to her home in another state and spent the rest of the summer apart, though still together long distance.

Start of Sophmore year. Both of us return to school, different dorms and all. The time we spent together only increased, and not by my choice, but I continued to go along stupidly. She remained very clingy, and she also completed neglected her schoolwork, while hiding the failure from her parents. Mid-way through this year, she began pushing the marriage question, and being weak, I gave in and start looking at engagement rings with her just to make my life easier.

After failing her whole year almost, summer came again. This time, I tried putting my foot down and told her I was through with it. We were apart for a few days, but after about a week, she turned up back in my city having found a job and a family friend to live with for the summer. I tried ignoring her, but..I gave in again and starting seeing her again. It's probably good to note at this point that my family hated her, and vice versa. So...ashamedly, I started lying to both parties over dating her.

Junior year. Much as the same as the last two years: she failing all her classes to remain with me, while I continued on blindly because I was too weak to break it off. I felt drained and beaten every day, and I continue to today, even long distance. At the end of this year, I got an extremely important internship that required me to travel across the country. Lying to her about the job requiring me to live where they told me, I left for a blissful free summer away from her.

Finally, to my final senior year, this year. Due to her family being unable to continue to pay for her to attend school and fail every class, she has lived at home three hours away the entire year. The freedom has been wonderful, especially since I finally had time to be a college kid with my friends and roommates. But almost weekly trips up to see her, as well as her taste in dining out and shopping, have drained me financially, put me in debt and left me destroyed.

And now..I'm a week away from graduation and I can't do it anymore. I've lied to her so much; part of me blames her, but part of me feels like I'm culpable for leading her on for so many ears. I really don't want or am able to have her see me graduate, and I just can't continue. I have a job lined up across the country, and I don't want to bring her or be with here anymore. 

But whenever I try to break it off face to face, whether at a neutral place like a mall in between us, or at either of our homes, I find myself clawing in to escape the pain, the heartbreak, the crying and her hysteria. She knows exactly what to do to sink me back in, the exact words and all. I know she's the type that will continue even if I break it off; I'm paranoid she will show up at my graduation with my family and start trouble.

 I'm a defeated and weak man. I don't know how I can do it; over the phone, a text message, Skype, and then just stop talking to her? She know's where I live, she has a million excuses to rope me in. I have stuff of hers, she has stuff of mine. She has five million guilt trips to keep me and I feel absolutely powerless to be free. I can't take this anymore Reddit! I know I've contributed by being a lying asshole, but I can't figure out how to make this right for everyone involved.

(and other inquiries regarding admissions in grad school),Zenai,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1exunq/how_feasible_is_a_phd_program_in_computer_science/,"I'm an undergraduate in Computer Science currently going into my junior year. I would really like to acquire a PhD in my quest to delve deeper into quantum computing research. I don't really want to get my hopes up in going to graduate school if I won't even be able to afford it. 

I go to a state university and plan to graduate with above a 3.5 GPA (hopefully more like 3.9, but there are some hard classes my senior year that I'm nervous about), and I'll have a couple of big name ~~scholarships~~ **internships** in gas and oil under my belt (I live outside of Houston). I know this would appear great on my resume to a potential employer however, I have no idea how a university would view it, or if I'm even competitive in that arena. 

Another thing is I would really like to attend a good school for my field such as Cal Tech, MIT, etc. Someone told me that since Computer Science PhD student's are relatively rare I might have a chance of getting in. How much truth is there to this, if any?

*edit* - Definitely wrote scholarships instead of internships, and posted in the wrong subreddit. Sorry guys, and thank you for all the great replies despite my ignorance/exhaustion when I made this post!

1exudo,1,2013-05-23,Undergrad with questions about admissions/undergrad school,dayne-sword,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1exudo/undergrad_with_questions_about/,"
Hi, I'm a college freshman finishing up my year at a large state flagship. I wanted to know how important an undergrad institution is in grad school admissions. I'm at my current school primarily due to finances; when I applied, my family wasn't doing too hot. Academically, I'm doing great (4.0), double majoring in Math/CS with a minor in Econ. 

- I came in with AP credit, got to some mid-upper level courses, and am involved in research with a professor as well (CS prof). I've done lab internships since HS, and I'm very sure I'd like to go to gradschool and become a researcher. 

- Overall, I don't feel satisfied with my school beyond doing 'well' there. I'm happy with my grades, work, etc. but the overall educational expereince isn't what I wanted. I'm not too fond of the atmosphere or size either. Due to this, I've thought of transferring to an overall better school (my school has a strong CS dept, ok math dept, and very weak econ dept). The schools I want to transfer to will have equal CS department strength, and better math/econ departments.

- If I transfer, which would be as a junior, and leave my current instituion- I'd have to ultimately find a new prof to work with. Does having breaks/working with different people matter? I have an REU for this summer, and I'll probably try one for the next. Is research experience in general more important than whatever specific projects you have worked on (as long as they're fairly relevant).

- I'm split on whether I want to go to grad school for Econ or CS. I enjoy both subjects. At my current school, there's research going in CS that I like, but the Econ department isn't doing work in the areas I'm interested in. If I transfer, I could work in areas of Econ I enjoy, and even I end up not enjoying Econ work, I could still continue work in CS areas I'm interested in (which is at all the schools I'm interested in transferring too). 

- Ultimately, down the road I may regret not transferring. I have this feeling at the back of my head that I could've gone to a better undergrad. I don't know if this will be bad for grad admissions since I'd sort of have to start over at a new school, though by then I'd have almost 4 years of lab/intern research experience in total. In either case, transfer or not, I'll still focus on gaining skills. 

-Thanks!"

He also mentioned they have the brand name.

My question is, am I basically forced to change the name? I really like the name and would like to keep it, but I don't want to be a dick and make a big situation about it.

I had great friends, with whom i had a great time both in and outside of school. I felt awesome back then.

Second year started, still great, still awesome, when suddenly my best friend ever quit his studies without letting anyone know, including me. By this time, i was running behind on my studies, and got into more and more classes with people i didn't know and who had formed friend groups of their own. I was waiting for my best friend to come back, thinking he was just sick and needed some rest. half a year passed, and i decided to contact him anyway. Which is when i discovered he quit.

So then the next year started. I was alone by now, all my friends had gained on me and i ran behind even more. I had no idea how to get accepted into other friend groups, and got more and more lonely. My social life stopped existing.

3 years later, i decided to quit the studies. I was feeling very lonely, and my internship at a high school wasn't going as planned. My coach saw that i didn't feel at home and asked me why i hadn't quit earlier. It was all because i told myself this was what i wanted to do all my life.

Since my best friend left, my social development stopped. I'm 24 now, started a new study to become a lab assistant, and i've felt like i've made some friends, but i feel like it's not really friendship. It feels empty, and fake. It feels like I'm not giving everything to be friends, and I think i'm doing this because i'm afraid to lose another friend. I never ask anyone to go out, because i want others to ask me, which hasn't happened so far. I'm afraid of people. I'm afraid of making friends because they'll leave me anyway(which is probably not true at all, i know. But i need proof to believe that again...)

the only people i consider real friends are people i've met online, and chat with online on a regular basis. We meet up about 2 or 3 times a year, which makes me feel loved and cherished.

At school I feel like i'm being watched all the time. When i try to be funny, it fails. When i try to make friends with the people who have more friends, it fails. They look at me like i'm some sort of nerd who's trying to be popular. I'm just a normal person, but i don't know how to make friends without losing them. I do have some people i sit with, play games with and talk with at break time, but it just doesn't feel like

i still live with my parents. I should have moved out a long time ago, but that wasn't possible because of money and failing studies. I imagine my life will be a lot better when it comes to a social life when i move out (which is going to be soon), because then i'll be living nearer people my age.

Anyway, i feel lonely and needed to vent some of this. I know what i need to do, but i just don't have the courage to do it...

I started taking UCB classes and meeting people and basically begging to intern at places. I interned at HuffPo, Late Night W/ Jimmy Fallon, and The Onion. The Onion hired me, which was nice of them. Then they moved the company to chicago and I was out of a job so I made [a web series](http://www.youtube.com/user/untitledwebseries). That web series got me agents and a manager. Through them I submitted packets to a bunch of different shows and this one finally stuck. My advice: make the things. I worked on the tv periphery for a long time and no one thought of me as a creative until I made a thing.

 |I made two short films which kind of got the UCB scene here in NY to think of me as a director. I started getting emails to direct web series' for people and I did a lot of that. I did an episode of ""Broad City"" and got hooked up with those girls (who are amazing people) and they recommended I meet with their manager. I did, and her and I hit it off really well. I had scripts and stuff ready to go in the event I was ever going to be contacted so I had a quick turnaround in terms of my writing samples. After my web series came out, my manager was contacted by agents who wanted to meet me. I went to LA to meet with people and see who was a good fit agent-wise. I'm really happy with my reps. The thing is, it sometimes seems really futile and hard to get noticed by these guys, but if you're generating a lot of content people seem to connect with and like, it will get seen. I can't really emphasize that enough. These agencies have whole departments dedicated to watching YouTube videos and stuff. They sign dogs for christsake! Just keep plugging along, say yes to every opportunity, make stuff you're proud of, and promote the shit out of it. It will get seen. Can't emphasize that enough. I was just a guy who made a web series that someone at ICM saw.
 |Another important thing to remember is to have stuff. Like, if you wanna be a writer, have your specs written. Have a feature written that's in a really good place. If you get a meeting with an agency or studio because you made a killer web video they're going to want to know you can do other stuff and are prepared. You gotta have stuff to give them.

I was wondering if you guys experienced similar feelings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eza9p/iama_two_comedy_writers_from_vh1s_best_week_ever/ca5c1ce?context=5)|I mean- It's not like you're telling people you want to blow dogs for a living, you know? If people don't support you, you know, fuck 'em. There's no room for that. You should be surrounding yourself with people who believe in you and think you're capable of anything. Whether it's comedy writing or whatever. I think if you surround yourself with supportive, like minded people you'll feel less insecure about saying ""I want to be a comedy writer."" It's not ridiculous you want to do this. There's a lot of rejection but if you really want it and you're willing to do anything to make it happen you'll figure it out.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a full year. We go to the same college on the East Coast, but we are working in different countries over the summer so we are ""long-distance"" for 4 months. This has been hard, but we've been doing okay so far.


Here's where it gets a little hinky. **Once we get back from summer, we will be spending our last semester together.** This is because my boyfriend, Nate, is graduating and moving back to his home city (City 1) in Asia, and if his job this summer goes well, will be working full-time in City 2 (also in Asia). So City 1 and City 2 are going to be his main homes after school, and he doesn't plan on ever coming back to the United States again (due to a mixture of reasons, cultural and career-related).  After he graduates, I still have one semester left to finish college.


*Note: sorry for the vagueness of the locations; I am super paranoid and feel that the combination of cities and the situation is unique and there's a 1-in-1000 chance my boyfriend will chance upon this thread (he's a redditor).*


We have, at this point, realized that due to 1) my being primarily based in the States, all of my job opportunities will likely be in the States in the future, as well as my friends and my life, really and 2) his life is back in Asia, where he has friends and family, in addition to him not liking the culture in the States, that we should not pursue our relationship together after he graduates. **We will break up once he leaves the States.**


This decision has nothing to do with how much we love each other, or how compatible we are. It is purely because realistically, our paths are never going to cross after he leaves. It will be too hard, and even unfair, for one of us to uproot ourselves and sacrifice our familiar lives, job opportunities, and a lot of other things to move across the world to be with the other. I think it is a mature understanding, and we intend to make the best of the time we have left together. 


Unfortunately, it has also been breaking my heart since we've reached the decision, and as a result, I've been foolishly looking for ways to make this work. I just can't wrap my head around the fact that I'm supposed to give up on the one guy I've come to love because of something out of our control. We share the same heritage (both Asian, but he grew up in Asia whereas I grew up in the States), same sense of humor, sense of financial responsibilities, and most political and philosophical issues. Damn me that I've always been the type who can never just let it go. 






**Here's the catch:**


I am interning for a very large and well-known company based in NYC (where I will be this summer) that has headquarters all around the world, including one in City 2. What coincidence, then, that City 2 has been my dream work city ever since junior year of high school when I was lucky enough to vacation there. I fell in love with the city, the people, and the culture almost immediately (this goes way back before our relationship, and has nothing to do with Nate). 


I know it's a long shot. But I somehow convinced myself that at the end of my internship, if I can score a full-time job with this company (reasonable) and somehow magically be able to transfer to the City 2 location in a different department (not as realistic)...I can't help but wonder if we would be able to reconsider our ""planned breakup"" (super duper really not realistic, like seriously in trouble here). 


Reddit, I've been a long-time lurker and admirer of the sound advice that you've given to people here. Can you help me figure this out? Please knock some sense into me, no kid gloves needed, honest opinions appreciated. Heck, at this point, the fact that you've read this far is appreciated. :)


**TL;DR** I've been beating myself up for allowing myself to hope for a chance to simultaneously land a job in my dream city and continue my relationship with my boyfriend. I can't tell if I'm grasping at straws and need to wake the fuck up or if this is actually a glimmer of hope that I can work towards this summer. 

**edit**: I added some bolding/formatting because I pressed ""submit"" and the wall of text even scared me! So sorry for writing a novel. Let me know if the bolding helps or annoys you. "
1f0ihi,11,2013-05-25,I stole a bottle of liquor while at a work party,hey_hey_throaway,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1f0ihi/i_stole_a_bottle_of_liquor_while_at_a_work_party/,"I know comparatively this must seem minor, but it's something that's been eating away at me. Last night I was at a bar with the company where I intern, I had had a few drinks at this point and had somehow, in the search for a restroom, wandered into the downstairs cellar area where they keep all the liquor. I remember looking at all of it, mostly admiring it, and then, as if possessed by someone else, I grabbed a bottle and put it in my bag. I went back upstairs and the suspicious doorman asked me how I even got down there in the first place (I came up a different way than I had gone down). I really have no idea how I got down there. Later in the night the doorman approached me again, asking how I got down there, acting (rightfully so) very suspicious of me, and out of fear and embarrassment  I left very shortly after that. 

I've never stolen anything in my life before this. I have no idea why I did what I did. I dont even like the type of liquor I stole (I threw it away this morning without even opening it). The fact that I was at a work related event makes it so much worse. I have this immense fear that they caught me on camera and they put the cost of the bottle on the companies tab, ultimately allowing me to lose my internship. Or that they caught me and told my boss, and on Monday when I go in I will face an awkward sit down and, once again, termination. Me being an intern I am obviously at the bottom of the totem pole, so them firing me and me losing a reference would really be nothing to them.

I needed to confess this because I feel awful, and I fear that someone who works at that bar could be blamed for that missing bottle. I fear that the wonderful people I work with know, and feel betrayed. I fear I will lose my job over one stupid drunken impulse decision."

We were together for 4 years, from the time I was 18 until I was 22. Two years into our relationship, he moved about 6 hours away to go to law school, but we maintained a  long distance relationship for two years, and it didn't diminish the significance of our relationship. 

I'd known him since I was six years old. He was my next-door neighbor for about a year; he and my younger brother were buddies. I have a lot of funny memories from that time, after-school Power Rangers, building forts with blankets and going to the moon, that sort of thing. Eventually, he moved away, as did my family. I saw him again when I was 14; he worked at a movie theater nearby. The chubby kid who was possessive with his ""magic rocks"" morphed into a skinny, industrial-music loving teenager with hair down to his ass. It was always kind of funny going to the theater and seeing him; he had no idea who I was but I remembered. When I began working at that same theater a few years later, it didn't take long for us to reconnect. We began dating a month before I graduated high school, and by June, I had my first boyfriend.

The first two years we were together, I was a mess, but looking back on it, I've never really had it together. High school, well, I did really well, but I spent some time with the wrong crowd. He was strictly against substance abuse, so I quit smoking pot and cigarettes (the cigarettes made their way back into my life though...it was an issue). When I moved out to go to college, I was extremely homesick. He transferred to the same university; I ended up living with him. At this point we had been together 3-4 months. Enter madness.

My mother began her rendez-vous with crack-cocaine that summer, and that little appointment ended up being a three-year marriage. She was a full-blown addict; a panhandler, lived in ""crackhouses"", sold her body. She lived the lifestyle. We wouldn't see her for months, she would show up so, so thin wearing the clothes I wore in middle school. She would leech off of my grandparents and then disappear. Eventually, she went to jail; she has been clean for 3 years. 

Meanwhile, at college, I was spent most of my time playing World of Warcraft, and doing well enough in school to keep my scholarships. Those years...it's funny to laugh about how insecure you are in your late-teens/early-twenties, but for a lot of people, that insecurity manifests itself in other ways. Food made me anxious, people made me anxious, he made my anxious. I was mean. MEAN, MEAN, MEAN. To him. And jealous...so jealous. And for what? What good does it do to be insecure when you significant other has female friends? It just pushes them away. And being that unhappy with your body that you would toss up your meals. I was a mess. My roommate, whom I love dearly, is at that age. I am 25 now. I tell her that it gets easier to love yourself. To understand who you are, what your strengths and shortcomings are, what you look like; the cellulite, the unibrow, the naivete, the cankles. She doesn't believe me. Insecurity doesn't completely go away for anyone, ever. But it diminishes as time goes on. I wish I had understood this when we were together or never understood it at all so I could never realize how awful I was. And he put up with me. To this day, I feel terrible; I am ashamed of a lot of things I did and said.

Naturally, after two years together with some pretty big issues, you decide whether or not you are going to part ways. He was pressing me to find my own place my junior year of college. He was getting ready to go off to law school somewhere. It was a good point in our relationship to break it off. We talked about it, we were both upset, but I insisted that I would change. 

*I can change, I can change, I can change. If it helps you fall in love.*

Heh. He was unconvinced, but things got better. And then he found out he got into a really school law school and would be an idiot to stay here in lieu of attending that school. Fuck it, I wasn't going to end it over him moving 6 hours away. I loved him. And as he said the evening before he left, if it doesn't work, it wouldn't be because of the distance. It just wasn't meant to be. And it wasn't.

For two years, we saw each other twice a month. I would drive up once a month for a weekend, and he would drive down two weeks later. We alternated holidays and breaks for the most part. We made it work. The first year of long distance, I lived in a dorm. I spent my days studying, working out, working in lab. I got my first scientific publication, decided I wanted to get my Ph.D in the biological sciences, so I worked at it. The second year we did long distance, I got my own apartment, and I made friends. I started to go out, to do my own thing, and that works when you have a significant other who lives 6 hours away. But when they're around, you feel obligated to stay home when you don't want to, and he wasn't the type to hang out with me and my friends. He didn't drink, and we were at different places in our lives. And when he came home to do a summer internship, I wasn't ready to settle back into the life I was living two years ago. After four years, it was over.

I know. I'm selfish. And I spent the summer numbing how I felt about the past four years, how much they meant to me, and how terribly it ended. I was a cunt. People tell you that you shouldn't feel bad for leaving something that wasn't working. But it was how I left it. There was no grace there. He deserved more than that. And I'm happy he found someone who deserves him. 

Three months after we broke up, I met a person who would spend the next year depleting a lot of things from me. He was a terrible person, but I it opened my eyes to a lot of things. It changed the way I treat people. And made me realize how terrible I was in my previous relationship. 

I wish I could write him up and apologize. For yelling at him over a parking pass, waking him at at 4 am and accusing him of cheating, for not going to Lego Land with him for his birthday, that I realize I was terrible, I know that. And I'm sorry. I would thank him for always telling me I was beautiful, and smart, and could do better than the mediocrity I immersed myself in. I'm happy he has found someone...and he should *never change, never change, never change.*

But I won't. We don't speak anymore.

*Edit* I guess I've painted a pretty sorry picture of myself. I broke up with said person 3 years ago. I do not have any residual romantic interest in this person; they were dead before it ended. I do not want to reconnect and ruin this person's relationship with someone. When I say I am happy for someone that does not mean I want to destroy the relationship they are currently in. When I say someone ""depleted a lot of things from me"", I mean they smothered me, hit me, called me any name under the sun, abused my cats, never let me be alone. They took away my ability to be elusive. I endured it because I thought I deserved it. I am the advice-giver to my friends, I have been single for a while, and the one boyfriend I did have told me I was ""a good catch, but he just couldn't see it."" He was ""never going to care about me as much as I cared about him"". I got something off my chest. I never had bad intentions. I just wanted to know that someone understood how I felt.

Sometimes people have problems, and sometimes people need a little help.

I live by those words.

I stayed in the company for 3 years, in that period I was positioned in the IT department, little by little, from system testing to developing simple tools to web based applications development.

Now, in that company, I’m the main person responsible in updating the company’s website along with supporting intranet instances of WordPress which I have created and support for about 2 years.

I’m working on my resume and wanted help in writing my accomplishments as I don’t know how to phrase them properly.

Also, in the resume, should I state that I have been an intern for 3 years?"
1f3h7m,0,2013-05-26,My chances of getting into NYU Stern AND a question on applying...,chenathan,nyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/1f3h7m/my_chances_of_getting_into_nyu_stern_and_a/,"I'm a junior right now, meaning next year I'll be a senior...

My friend who's going to NYU Stern next year told me that on the application, you can check off NYU Stern and ALSO check off ""I would also like to be considered for CAS"" just in case you dont get into Stern, you can still go to CAS. Is this true?

Also here are my stats... what I'm worried about is my GPA...

GPA: 3.6 UW/4.5, 3.8 weighted out of 4.5, which IF I'M DOING PROPORTIONS....3.6 weighted out of 4.0.

SAT I: 1950, 2120 on 2nd try (a large improvement)
SAT II: anticipating a low 700 for Math II and high 600 for US History lol

APs: anticipating 4/5 on APUSH, Micro/Macro economics, 5 on AB Calculus

senior year Im taking 4 more APs

I have a LOT of actually solid ECs: president of FBLA, state assembly representative of JSA, boy scouts for 7 years (won't make eagle scout though), lots of clubs/leadership in the clubs, played at Carnegie Hal 2x for piano, won a lot of piano competitions.... 

also I'm gonna get 2 very good teacher recs AND a rec from a NYU professor at Steinhardt (which isn't NYU Stern but still) so that might help me out :D **edit: I'm getting the rec because Im doing an internship for him/her this summer. also Im doing that internship and maybe getting another job over the summer in fashion.**

tbh NYU fits me like a glove, I cant see myself going anywhere else. also I come off as an intelligent/anti-society person so like a hipster........ businessman, i dont fucking know

can I get into Stern or should I try my luck at CAS? or can I do the above listed application method still......."

I am staying at UCF over the summer in the Nike housing area for an internship and the housing office gave me login information for the guest wifi only. This connection drops me every 30 minutes and its really annoying when trying to do anything for a long period of time on my laptop. According to the Internet/tech support people there is nothing they can do to fix this.  I know this is kind of a big favor to ask, but would anyone be willing to give me their login information for the regular UCF internet? I totally understand if nobody wants to or wants to even meet me in person before hand. Just please send me a PM if you are willing to help out. It would mean alot. Thanks UCF community!"

Generally I'll be okay, but sometimes I slip into a crazy mood swing and start snapping at people. Just earlier I snapped again and began verbally attacking my boyfriend for something that wasn't even his fault. I feel so terrible about it now but I don't even know why I reacted the way I did.

It's my third year in college and I'm very stressed out on getting an internship or summer job, neither is working out. I've also lost a lot of motivation for what I'm doing, and my grades are slipping. I still have a very high GPA but I feel like complete shit at what I'm doing now. Most of the times now I feel so worthless and tired, but I can't seem to get any motivation. I'd try to go for counselling but even that is falling out because school is ending and their almost fully booked. What are some things that I can do and how can I manage this properly?

1f38ku,50,2013-05-26,"TIFU and broke my arm while arm-wrestling, paralyzing my wrist and fingers in the process.",The_Seldom_Seen_Kid,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1f38ku/tifu_and_broke_my_arm_while_armwrestling/,"I have to start off by saying that this didn’t happen today. Not yesterday, not last week even, but on this day precisely one year ago. However, I can still feel (or rather *not* feel) the consequences of it today, so I feel this post is somewhat justified.


To provide a little background: I had been on an internship in Paris for the past three months and everything was going absolutely swell. I made some great friends, professionally things couldn’t be better and overall I had a blast spending time abroad alone for the first time in my life. Being in Paris just added to that experience. To quote my man Ernest: 
“If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.” Anyway, I digress. 


The residence I stayed at had its own little gym so I had been working out religiously during my time there. I was really getting into shape and becoming stronger. Of course, with added power comes added cockiness so when a friend challenged me to a game of arm-wrestling one lovely Saturday night I immediately accepted, gloating about his incumbent demise.


*I got this.*


Turns out, I didn’t. We had been going at it for a good 30 seconds and I was at a small advantage but this dude was still not giving in. Apparently, slightly inebriated Germans are rather strong. Me being extremely sober thought that I could maybe wear him out enough so that he would just give up. This didn’t seem to work and I tried to give it one last push with all my measly strength.


Then it happened. CRACK. THUD. ARGH.  My arm loudly banged against the table, in the opposite direction mind you. I didn’t realize what just had happened but my body sure as hell did. I couldn’t control myself and started yelling incoherent sounds, all the while breathing very loudly. The pain was very intense but started numbing down quickly when I sat down again. Whenever I tried moving my arm, it started twitching. Honestly I just thought I had torn a muscle or something.


An ambulance was called in and I was soon rushed to hospital. I was checked in and told to wait. Overall I had to wait for 4 hours in the ER which wasn’t the most pleasant of experiences. (During that time I saw a guy with a beret strapped to a stretcher trying to fight two nurses because they called him monsieur while he’d rather be called madame. Aah, Paris, comme je vous adore)


Anyway, when someone finally came to see what kind of dire straits I had gotten myself into, they just started berating me. I was a blithering idiot for arm-wrestling, I had been the third guy that month with the same injuries (didn’t even know you could break your arm while arm-wrestling, let alone that this wasn’t a very rare freak accident). In the meantime, my arm had swollen to Schwarzenegger proportions and the guy examining me asked if I was on steroids. No thanks, I wasn’t. He told me I had broken my humerus and that I needed surgery asap. Great.


The next morning I had surgery and the surgeon came to me afterwards and said everything had gone over smoothly and that I should be as good as new in a few weeks. However, I still couldn’t move my arm after two weeks and the doctors concluded that they probably had severed a nerve. (Maybe the surgeon can post a TIFU from his perspective)


Long story short, my wrist and fingers were paralyzed for 7 months and only in the last few months have I been making progress. I still have a pretty bad-ass scar and a few insensitive spots on my arm to make me remember my fuck up.

**TL;DR: don’t arm-wrestle guys, it’s not worth it.**

1f37yj,12,2013-05-26,"I (M 24) love cheating. Or rather, I love the thrill of the chase and bedding a new girl.",[deleted],confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1f37yj/i_m_24_love_cheating_or_rather_i_love_the_thrill/,"Basically what the title says, but I've got quite a wall of text to expand on my situation. Bear with me.

I don't know if it's that I love cheating so much as I love the thrill of the chase. That feeling of finding a girl, getting to know her, flirting, exchanging texts at all hours of the day, and finally hooking up... I love it. It's my drug of choice. Then after we've had our fun a couple of times, it's on to the next girl. Most of the time it's mutual, other times I'm a complete piece of shit and crush the girl.

It started with my first girlfriend. We started dating when we were both 16, until we were 18. During the last 3-4 months of our relationship, we both started to realize it wasn't going to work. We were graduating in a few weeks, going to different colleges, pursuing different life goals. We stuck it out as long as we could because we didn't know any better.

With the fact that we were doomed no matter what looming over me, my mind started to wander. One of my older friends took me to see one of my favorite bands as a graduation gift. (Queens of the Stone Age, front row, amazing show) Anyway, at the concert, I met this really cute girl that was standing behind me during the show. Before the opening act, we started to flirt and make small talk. Between sets, it kept going, and I let her get in front of me for Queens because I'm pretty tall. The show got loud and crazy, and our bodies were close the entire show. I put my arms around her waist at one point because of the insane moshing behind us, and she held them there. It was the first time I'd had any type of romantic contact with a girl other than my girlfriend in like 2 years. Just having my arms around her waist just blew me away. We ended up holding hands through the rest of the show, on and off.

After it was all over, we exchanged numbers, and immediately started texting while my friend and I were driving home. It started innocently enough, getting to know each other and whatnot. Found out she was my age, about to graduate, single, all kinds of stuff that attracted me to her. We began texting and talking on the phone almost non-stop. I, of course, never mentioned my girlfriend. There was no motive for this. I honestly greatly enjoyed talking to her, and it was clear she had a crush on me. The chances of us never talking again were too high to tell her.

A week or two passed, and we wanted to see each other. Problem was, she lived an hour and a half away. She didn't have a car, and I didn't have the most reliable vehicle in the world. One night, I threw caution to the wind and drove up to see her. She lived with her mom, who was out of the state seeing an ill family member, or something. We had the house, and weekend to ourselves. I knew what this meant. I KNEW what would happen if I went up there. I told my parents that some friends and I were spending the weekend at a friend's place, not doing a damn thing but play video games, order pizza, and act like hooligans. We did this a couple weekends a month, so they bit. On the other hand, I told my girlfriend that me and the friend who took me to the concert were going on a little road trip. She believed me, and even packed me a sweet little care package to have on the trip. A cute gesture that I gave zero fucks about...

Anyway, I get to the girl's house, and it's awesome. We didn't do anything but hug at first. We hung out, talked, went on a midnight snack run, and spent most of the night and early morning watching movies, flirting, and all that good stuff. We finally start getting serious, and the first kiss happened. It was heaven. I loved it. I loved everything about it. The fact that she was hot, a good kisser, and the fact that I was getting some on the side.

Now I guess I should mention that I had a healthy sex life with my girlfriend. It wasn't mind-blowing by any means, but it was good. I wasn't starved for sex.

Eventually kissing turned into making out, which turned in to going to her bed, which turned into getting naked. You see where this is going. We didn't have a condom, so it ended with the both of us getting each other off orally. She wasn't BETTER than my girlfriend, just different. And I loved it. She swallowed, which is no big deal to me, but it wasn't something my girlfriend did. She came multiple times when I went down on her. Again, something my girlfriend didn't do. It was insanely hot. We spent the weekend together, got condoms for the next night, had crazy sex, barely slept a wink. We spent almost the whole weekend naked and doing some kind of sexual activity.

This post is getting pretty goddamn long, so I'll wrap it up soon, I swear.

This carried on for a while. It came to an end when she couldn't deal with me being far away, and on the verge of being further when I left for college. I essentially had two girlfriends. Long story short, both of them ended and I went off to college.

Freshman year, I met an astoundingly beautiful girl and we started dating. We fell in love, and it was the happiest I had ever been. Freshman year, sophomore year, junior year... it was all perfect. She was the prettiest girl I'd ever met, perfect in a million ways, the girl I knew I was going to marry. And yet the entire time we were together, my mind wandered. When we weren't hanging out, I actively thought of what it'd be like to hook up with other girls. I never pursued it, or rather, never got the chance to. But I look back on it and don't doubt for a second that I would gotten down with the first girl that came my way that wanted it.

As great as our relationship was, it came to a screeching halt before my senior year. She'd just graduated, and came clean that she couldn't see herself marrying my with my career path. I was majoring in theatre arts, and constantly in plays/musicals. I had a paid internship with a local theater that was going to become my real job upon graduation. She couldn't deal with my hectic lifestyle. The travelling, the late nights, etc. We broke up. I was utterly devastated, and severely depressed. I was madly in love with her and she broke my heart. I took to easy bar girls, dating sites, and girls I'd been wanting to bone for years to relieve myself. At any given time I was ""dating"" 2-3 girls at once, and hooking up with some rando from a bar every night of the weekend. Every time, it was the fact that it was a new girl that got me off. The chase, the thrill of new experiences. 75% of the time the sex was bad, but I didn't care.

Fast-forward.

I graduate, get into the professional world, get over my breakup, meet a real girl, fall in love, we move in together.

Present Day: We've been together for 2 years, lived together for almost a year. We're in love, happy, comfortable... it's all good. We have an amazing dog, she's a fellow actress, and we both run a theater and theatre-troupe in my city. Living the dream.
But I still can't go a day without wanting to jump the bones of the first girl that gives me a real shot. In my profession, it's not hard to find that. I've done the right thing and said ""no"" on two separate occasions since we've been together. I get cast in plays typically as the guy with a love interest. It's my type. Fitting... right...?

So occasionally that actress will come along who takes our stage relationship too far, and develops a crush. I, admittedly, develop it too, but restrain myself because I love my girlfriend. It's a struggle. A ridiculously hard struggle. The fact that I have to kiss other women all the time in plays doesn't help. Sometimes during the rehearsal process, those kisses become a little bit more real than just stage kisses. It would take only a word for me to take that kiss further sometimes.
I'm terrified that I'm going to ruin the best relationship of my life by giving in to a 'fetish' I've had since I was a kid. I love my life, my apartment, my job, my girlfriend, my dog... and I'd love just about all of it if I cheated. And sometimes, I don't care. That terrifies me. How could I be so willing to throw what I have away just to experience that rush? Is it sex addiction? Am I just a horrible person?

**TL;DR I cheated on my first real girlfriend, and have since been plagued with the desire to cheat in all of my relationships, current girlfriend included. It effects my daily life in that it's something I think about way too often, and I'm scared that I'll end up throwing everything away by giving into a problem I developed during my teen years.**"

[What's a typical must-have in high-end real estate? For example in the suburbs it's a fenced yard for the kids, or a basement for tools, entertainment room, things like that.  What's the strangest must-have requirement you've encountered?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6c7ul?context=5)|Views. Views, views, views. Central Park, if you're particular. That can make the value 150% of the same apartment that doesnt face the park.
[What's the nicest place you've been inside, and why was it nice?  What I'm thinking of is a place like in the movie *A Perfect Murder*, huge kitchen and a balcony, or *The Thomas Crown Affair* with the gorgeous foyer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6c7ul?context=5)|A couple of penthouses in Tribeca are the most notable as of late. The penthouses at the Laureate on 75th and Broadway are amazing.
[On the flip side have you ever been inside a richly renovated place and just facepalmed at the owner's sense of architecture?  What was that like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6c7ul?context=5)|YES. Sometimes the renovations are for the current owners and the current owners only, so much that even in mint condition, it's a gut job. It runs the gamut...
[Given the nature of NYC real estate, does it obey any market law?   It's chaos when you're dealing with that kind of money, no? Like, how much do you want something, as opposed to what is the intrinsic worth.  How can you even begin to price anything?  Are comps all over the place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6c7ul?context=5)|Au contraire. The stock-ticker like nature of the market, and the number of trades make it much easier to establish a value, spot trends, analyze them and apply all sorts of other metrics (check THIS out: [Link to www.millersamuel.com](http://www.millersamuel.com/browse-all-charts))
[What's another international city on par with or outstripping NYC in terms of stratospheric real estate price?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6c7ul?context=5)|New York is by no means the record-setter worldwide. Hong Kong is nearly 3x NYC, Tokyo 2x, London and Paris are almost peers, but London is setting some records at present.
[I glance at some NYC real estate reality TV sometimes (just glance at, I swear!\)  Those characters come off as horrible, shallow, pretentious, but very beautiful people.  Is that anything close to real life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6c7ul?context=5)|Sometimes. It's all about how you present. I consider ""the look"" giving the least number of reasons to object to you. I don't wear cologne, because I'd rather have no smell than one that someone finds unpleasant. I always wear a suit, because no one will really judge you for wearing a suit, but jeans and a blazer, you may be underdressed. You have to look like you're put together enough to handle millions of someone's dollars. If you can't brush your teeth and comb your hair...but then, there is a contingent of showiness.
[Most important: How abundant and glossy are your tresses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6c7ul?context=5)|Most importantly, more glossy than abundant lately...to the chagrin of my Propecia regimen.
[Given the exorbitant price of NYC real estate, and the type of people and the professions that can afford it, do you think eventually the ""normal"" people and professions would be priced completely out of the market there, creating what will be an essentially a segregated Huxleyan society?  Do you think that's bad or not impactful?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6c7ul?context=5)|A reasonable point, and it is happening. That's why we're seeing the gentrification of Harlem, the building boom in Long Island City, Brooklyn (Park Slope and Williamsburg ESPECIALLY), and even these places are trading at very near Manhattan prices. While it's not the healthiest for society (IMHO), I'm not sure what else can be done to control it. There are incentives for developers to include affordable housing contingents and the like, but that can be counterproductive for the developer. There are proposals by Christine Quinn to add large amounts of affordable housing, but I'm not enough of an economist to consider the long term effects of either.
[What do you see as the main differences between this and being a more normal financial range realtor? And for the clients? Do you see any changes with increased online services (either as competition, or as enhancements that you use/offer your clients\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6a7zy?context=5)|I actually started have worked very successfully in both markets.
 |The biggest difference is the role that you play, where in the ""typical"" market, you are more of a ""friend"", invited over for dinner, housewarming parties, and the hokey balloons on the yard sign open house works. Also, without implying that people are not smart, in the typical market, your clients are more blue-collar and look to you for ALL types of business advice. In the market where you're dealing with people who are plunking down $10-20 million in cash, you're merely a service provider/assistant, and generally to amass that kind of money (trust fund kids aside), the client is much smarter than I am.
 |Functioning in the multi-million dollar range, you are at once a concierge, investment adviser, marketer, negotiator, personal assistant. It takes a level of humility to be simultaneously very successful and simultaneously give firm opinions while remaining somewhat subservient. It's takes finesse to balance it all with 20,000 competitors fighting for under 10,000 sales per year.
 |There has been a HUGE change in the role you play in light of the availability of information. New York real estate trades like a stock. The world's eyes are on it, and if there's a good buy, there's an ask, and from somewhere in the world, there will be a bid. The values fluctuate (e.g. up +/-26% since January) so much that you have to talk people out of considering what someone paid for an apartment 3 years ago. The price of AAPL today is completely independent of the price 3 years ago, and NYC real estate is the same. The inventory is finite, as it's a relatively small rock, so it's very supply and demand driven.
 |Suburban markets are much different, as there aren't organized bus trips to, say, Tacoma, Washington, for wealthy BRIC country investors to go property shopping. New York is one of very few markets that operate completely outside of a vacuum.
[Well written.  Just curious, what made you use Tacoma, WA as an example?  That's where I'm from and I was just wondering.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6mw9m?context=5)|Completely and utterly pulled out of thin air.
[I don't follow the appeal of NYC to the international set. Obviously a place to do business. And cultural institutions in Manhattan. Do those who buy high end apartments ever leave Manhattan? Where do they go other than JFK? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6aig5?context=5)|The international set is what drives the New York market to the values they're at, consider that the area of a sheet of paper laid on the floor of a middle high-end building is valued at about $1,000.
 |New York is arguably the business and fashion capital of the world, moving up in the tech sector, still active in entertainment, although secondary to LA.
 |It's a place to park hard assets in a relatively safe and historically appreciating market, but most importantly is inventory. Manhattan is a rock, and there is practically no undeveloped land south of 96th Street (""Prime"" Manhattan), so to add inventory you've got to remove inventory (commercial or residential). The market will never be saturated with inventory in such a way that the supply far exceeds the demand...in theory. It's also a well branded commodity.
 |And, then, of course, sometimes it just feels cool for a Japanese businessman to say he has an apartment Trump ___ amongst his friends.
[I wouldn't say arguably. For all intents and purposes, it is the capital of the western world.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6b05j?context=5)|I'd agree 100%. I just didn't want to start a war.
[My fiance and I are looking to move into the city, do you have any tips for people looking at NYC apartments for the first time? (Definitely not in the high-end budget, but general suggestions would be greatly appreciated!\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6c7uj?context=5)|Didn't think I'd actually get business here, but feel free to shoot a message. I'm lucky enough to deal in the high end, but the ""low end"" is my day-to-day for sure.
 |But, general suggestions for the good of the gander, do have a broker. You can sometimes negotiate directly with the listing broker, but the relationship the listing broker has with their clients transcends yours, and you'll never actually know if the discount you got was a break in the brokerage fee.
 |Decide whether light and views are more important than space, as these are the two things that will focus your search, and what you're actually paying for.
 |The price you pay to live in Manhattan, in my opinion, is for convenience, so if you're moving for work, move fairly close to work. I can't fathom being an owner of an apartment in NYC and still having a 45-minute commute.
 |Get pre-qualified for a mortgage in advance. Have a letter indicating that. The market is so fast right now from the sell off at the end of 2012 that you've got to be prepared to look and decide quick. If you love the first one you see, make an offer. Negotiate. Immediately look at 5 more apartments to ensure you're comfortable. If you still feel the same way about the first, go to town. If not, keep going.
[Do you think anyone will buy the Pierre Hotel penthouse for $125 million?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6b3ll?context=5)|No.
 |These mega-listings were all precipitated by the $88 million sale at 15 Central Park West.
 |If the penthouse is worth $125 million, what's the floor below it worth? $100 million? and the floor below, and so on.
 |If it does, it will likely be an overseas buyer, and it will be a purchase that has nothing to do with value (there is nothing functionally that you couldn't get for $5-10 million in another building), but mostly ego.

 |There is a significant Jewish population (hasidic, orthodox, reformed etc), and, yes a lot of the players in real estate are Jewish, but it's become much more diverse, much in the way that Italians aren't predominant in the construction field and the Irish aren't predominant in the police and fire fields.
 |I'd say that ""the Jews own it"" part has likely carried the most staying power, though.

 |If you're going to do it, do it now, and do it with a 30-year fixed mortgage. Money will never be this cheap, but the rent you command will continue to go up.

1f368x,0,2013-05-26,"I (M24) love cheating. Or I just love the thrill of the chase, and bedding a new girl.",[deleted],confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1f368x/i_m24_love_cheating_or_i_just_love_the_thrill_of/,"Basically what the title says, but I've got quite a wall of text to expand on my situation. Bear with me.

I don't know if it's that I love cheating so much as I love the thrill of the chase. That feeling of finding a girl, getting to know her, flirting, exchanging texts at all hours of the day, and finally hooking up... I love it. It's my drug of choice. Then after we've had our fun a couple of times, it's on to the next girl. Most of the time it's mutual, other times I'm a complete piece of shit and crush the girl.

It started with my first girlfriend. We started dating when we were both 16, until we were 18. During the last 3-4 months of our relationship, we both started to realize it wasn't going to work. We were graduating in a few weeks, going to different colleges, pursuing different life goals. We stuck it out as long as we could because we didn't know any better.

With the fact that we were doomed no matter what looming over me, my mind started to wander. One of my older friends took me to see one of my favorite bands as a graduation gift. (Queens of the Stone Age, front row, amazing show) Anyway, at the concert, I met this really cute girl that was standing behind me during the show. Before the opening act, we started to flirt and make small talk. Between sets, it kept going, and I let her get in front of me for Queens because I'm pretty tall. The show got loud and crazy, and our bodies were close the entire show. I put my arms around her waist at one point because of the insane moshing behind us, and she held them there. It was the first time I'd had any type of romantic contact with a girl other than my girlfriend in like 2 years. Just having my arms around her waist just blew me away. We ended up holding hands through the rest of the show, on and off.

After it was all over, we exchanged numbers, and immediately started texting while my friend and I were driving home. It started innocently enough, getting to know each other and whatnot. Found out she was my age, about to graduate, single, all kinds of stuff that attracted me to her. We began texting and talking on the phone almost non-stop. I, of course, never mentioned my girlfriend. There was no motive for this. I honestly greatly enjoyed talking to her, and it was clear she had a crush on me. The chances of us never talking again were too high to tell her. 

A week or two passed, and we wanted to see each other. Problem was, she lived an hour and a half away. She didn't have a car, and I didn't have the most reliable vehicle in the world. One night, I threw caution to the wind and drove up to see her. She lived with her mom, who was out of the state seeing an ill family member, or something. We had the house, and weekend to ourselves. I knew what this meant. I KNEW what would happen if I went up there. I told my parents that some friends and I were spending the weekend at a friend's place, not doing a damn thing but play video games, order pizza, and act like hooligans. We did this a couple weekends a month, so they bit. On the other hand, I told my girlfriend that me and the friend who took me to the concert were going on a little roadtrip. She believed me, and even packed me a sweet little care package to have on the trip. A cute gesture that I gave zero fucks about...

Anyway, I get to the girl's house, and it's awesome. We didn't do anything but hug at first. We hung out, talked, went on a midnight snack run, and spent most of the night and early morning watching movies, flirting, and all that good stuff. We finally start getting serious, and the first kiss happened. It was heaven. I loved it. I loved everything about it. The fact that she was hot, a good kisser, and the fact that I was getting some on the side. 

Now I guess I should mention that I had a healthy sex life with my girlfriend. It wasn't mind-blowing by any means, but it was good. I wasn't starved for sex.

Eventually kissing turned into making out, which turned in to going to her bed, which turned into getting naked. You see where this is going. We didn't have a condom, so it ended with the both of us getting each other off orally. She wasn't BETTER than my girlfriend, just different. And I loved it. She swallowed, which is no big deal to me, but it wasn't something my girlfriend did. She came multiple times when I went down on her. Again, something my girlfriend didn't do. It was insanely hot. We spent the weekend together, got condoms for the next night, had crazy sex, barely slept a wink. We spent almost the whole weekend naked and doing some kind of sexual activity. 

This post is getting pretty goddamn long, so I'll wrap it up soon, I swear.

This carried on for a while. It came to an end when she couldn't deal with me being far away, and on the verge of being further when I left for college. I essentially had two girlfriends. Long story short, both of them ended and I went of to college.

Freshman year, I met an astoundingly beautiful girl and we started dating. We fell in love, and it was the happiest I had ever been. Freshman year, sophomore year, junior year... it was all perfect. She was the prettiest girl I'd ever met, perfect in a million ways, the girl I knew I was going to marry. And yet the entire time we were together, my mind wandered. When we weren't hanging out, I actively thought of what it'd be like to hook up with other girls. I never pursued it, or rather, never got the chance to. But I look back on it and don't doubt for a second that I would gotten down with the first girl that came my way that wanted it. 

As great as our relationship was, it came to a screeching halt before my senior year. She'd just graduated, and came clean that she couldn't see herself marrying my with my career path. I was majoring in theatre arts, and constantly in plays/musicals. I had a paid internship with a local theatre that was going to become my real job upon graduation. She couldn't deal with my hectic lifestyle. The travelling, the late nights, etc. We broke up. I was utterly devastated, and severely depressed. I was madly in love with her and she broke my heart. I took to easy bar girls, dating sites, and girls I'd been wanting to bone for years to relieve myself. At any given time I was ""dating"" 2-3 girls at once, and hooking up with some rando from a bar every night of the weekend. Every time, it was the fact that it was a new girl that got me off. The chase, the thrill of new experiences. 75% of the time the sex was bad, but I didn't care. 

Fast-forward.

I graduate, get into the professional world, get over my breakup, meet a real girl, fall in love, we move in together.

Present Day: We've been together for 2 years, lived together for almost a year. We're in love, happy, comfortable... it's all good. We have an amazing dog, she's a fellow actress, and we both run a theater and theatre-troupe in my city. Living the dream.

But I still can't go a day without wanting to jump the bones of the first girl that gives me a real shot. In my profession, it's not hard to find that. I've done the right thing and said ""no"" on two separate occasions since we've been together. I get cast in plays typically as the guy with a love interest. It's my type. Fitting... right...?

So occasionally that actress will come along who takes out stage relationship too far, and develops a crush. I, admittedly, develop it too, but restrain myself because I love my girlfriend. It's a struggle. A ridiculously hard struggle. The fact that I have to kiss other women all the time in plays doesn't help. Sometimes during the rehearsal process, those kisses become a little bit more real than just stage kisses. It would take only a word for me to take that kiss further sometimes.

I'm terrified that I'm going to ruin the best relationship of my life by giving in to a 'fetish' I've had since I was a kid. I love my life, my apartment, my job, my girlfriend, my dog... and I'd love just about all of it if I cheated. And sometimes, I don't care. That terrifies me. How could I be so willing to throw what I have away just to experience that rush? Is it sex addiction? Am I just a horrible person?

**TL;DR** 
**I cheated on my first real girlfriend, and have since been plagued with the desire to cheat in all of my relationships, current girlfriend included. It effects my daily life in that it's something I think about way too often, and I'm scared that I'll end up throwing everything away by giving into a problem I developed during my teen years.**"

In the event that I get an offer, I'm considering taking a leave of absence from my school for 1-3 years to begin working full-time immediately. I only have a year left, but I'm growing really tired of college and I feel like I would be learning a lot more working at Microsoft (about programming and about life) than I would be learning in school. I also feel like all that real experience will help me get a lot more out of my classes when I return to school. And although I realize the inclusion of this fact muddies the waters a lot, I have to say it, because it's a huge part of my motivation: I'm having a lot of trouble getting over an anxiety disorder that is a big issue at school but won't be an issue at work. It has an enormously deleterious effect on my productivity and well-being, and I need more time to sort it out (I'm talking to a therapist, and I'll continue to talk to him on Skype).

My question is, could this decision come back to bite me in any way? How will a prospective future employer react to the fact that I left school with only a year left in order to work for a while? Those years of experience won't be in any sense negated by the act of returning to school, will they? "

First of all, I will be honest. I am good at math and other sciences, but I am far from a genius at either. So, my most likely scenarios are:

UVA: Excellent school. I walk out with around a 3.0 or a bit lower. Probably wouldn't have gotten an internship due to competition. Maybe a bit of research experience. But the reputation of the school looks really good.

2. Research opportunity for ""students interested in wearable computing"" (Google Glass, Nike Fuel Band, etc.) that lasts 9 months followed by a 3 month summer internship

Both have about the same hours and the pay is similar (within $5/hour of each other).

Pros for #1:

* Great for networking even though I do not plan on going into academia
* Good rep in the department for future research opportunities

Pros for #2:

* 3 month internship at the end of the 2013-14 school year - this is not a big factor to me as I have internships for next summer covered if I do not choose this program. I haven't been told where the internship is at, but my money is on Texas Instruments because they are funding the research project.
* 9 months of part time work on my resume

I am leaning towards option #1 since I like the head of the department, but #2 sounds like a more fun and interesting experience if the internship at the end of it was optional. Any ideas for what might look better on a resume?

I'm a 20 yr. old male in college. I am 5'5"" or so, skinny, and white. Money is, fortunately, not an issue, but I feel quite uncomfortable sporting attires that have big names and logos covering them. I'm a quaint, down-to-earth person who's just looking for a little change - nothing to wow or dazzle here.

**Advice Needed:**

I'm going to be doing an internship this summer, and I'm looking to perhaps step away from what has been my persistent t-shirt and jeans combo with the occasional sweatshirt on colder days. I don't intend to never wear them again, but I'd like a slight change.

The internship is in a research lab in New England, but I will be in a control room-type setting dealing entirely with computers/programming and math, so I don't have to worry about spilled chemicals or anything. 

While I'm sure many scientists don't give a damn how they look and don't care how I look either, I'd like to wear something casual but not quite as ""grungy"" as a t-shirt and jeans. At the same time, I don't want to suit up, as there's no dress code, and that would seem out of place in a lab setting that I believe dresses fairly casual as a whole. I'm fine with wearing (dark) colored jeans unless I find other suggestions I prefer, but my main issue is I'm not really sure what to wear shirt-wise.

I smoke marijuana pretty regularly (~2-3 times a week, if I have nothing going on), and I know that I would test positive if I were to submit to a drug test. I do not consider myself to be addicted, I feel that I can stop as soon as I hear a firm ""yes, we do test for drug use in the industry"". In other words, I am more than willing to cease any/all drug use if it turns out that I need to. I really do care about this job, it's in a field that I am interested in and it would be incredibly foolish to miss this opportunity due to something other than my ability as a software engineer.

​Have you ever taken a walk outside during an exceptionally beautiful, sunny Seattle day?  Have you taken time to notice the beautiful green of the trees or the bright color of the many varieties of flowers that blossom in the spring?  Or have you ever driven over the 520 bridge towards Bellevue on a crisp, clear evening and been awed by the wonderful reds and oranges in the clouds during a sun set, while looking towards Mt. Ranier in all her glory?  Only recently have I personally taken note of the wonder of God’s creation.  As a kid, I traveled a lot; many times going back and forth across the country.  I have seen many amazing things, but I had taken for granted their intricacy and beauty.  
​Now as a young man, and one who has an established and loving relationship with the Lord, I am beginning to see His wisdom, genius, brilliance and even His love expressed in His creation.  David declares, “The earth is the LORD’s and all its fullness…” (Psalm 24:1 NKJV).  God crafted His planet Earth for His glory, that it would bring Him praise and honor.  This applies to humanity as well.  God’s original and coming purpose for man is to live perfected with Him in a perfect paradise.  But Adam’s sin postponed the fulfillment of this intention; however, God’s plan of redemption will ultimately bring the Earth and humanity back into His perfect will.  Our responsibility should reflect God’s original intention for us in the Earth.
​The Book of Genesis recounts man’s creation and his tasking, by God, to be stewards over the Earth.  In verse 27 of the first chapter, God, “created man in His own image; in the image of God he created him, male and female He created them.  Then God blessed them, and God said to them, ‘Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.’…”  This is man’s original purpose with relation to the Earth: steward it, lead it and rule it.
​When Adam and Eve sinned, God cursed the creation saying:
Cursed is the ground for your sake; in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life.  Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you…in the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; For dust you are, and to dust you shall return. Genesis 3:17-19
Mankind would no longer be allowed to enjoy the Earth but be forced to endure it because of his sin.  Solomon alludes to this in ‘Ecclesiastes’ when he says, “For what has man for all his labor, and for the striving of his heart with which he has toiled under the sun?  For all his days are sorrowful, and his work burdensome; even in the night his heart takes no rest.  This also is vanity.” (Ecclesiastes 2:22-23)  
​God’s plan of redemption through Jesus Christ is to bring us back into relationship with God and to ultimately have our corrupted, natural bodies redeemed, just as Christ’s resurrected body was redeemed.  As the Holy Spirit sanctifies us unto that day, with which Paul says that we hope for, the creation too looks forward to its redemption.  Paul, writing to the believers in Rome, says, “For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God.  For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected in hope; because the creation itself will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.” (Romans 8:19-21 NKJV).  Our sin brought a curse and corruption over God’s creation here on Earth.
​Grace, through Jesus, has brought redemption to our souls and eventually will be consummated in the redemption of our bodies.  Likewise, redemption will be brought to the creation, even as it now looks forward to that day with the same hope that we have.  The Apostle John writes in his ‘Revelation’ on the island of Patmos, while exiled by the Roman Emperor Nero, “Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away.  Also there was no more sea.” (Revelation 21:1) and God proclaims, “Behold, I make all things new.” (Revelation 21:5)  This new heaven and new earth, with the return of Jesus, ushers in a new era where man dwells with his God in paradise.  Thus, this is the fulfillment of God’s intended purpose for His creation.  
The prophet Isaiah describes the future glory of Zion, an image of heaven and paradise in the 35th chapter.  “The wilderness and the wasteland shall be glad for them, and the desert shall rejoince and blossom as the rose…the parched ground shall become a pool, abd the thirsty land springs of water; in the habitation of jackals, where each lay, there shall be grass with reeds and rushes.”  Finally, Isaiah forsees “But the redeemed shall walk there, and the ransomed of the LORD shall return and come to Zion with singing, with everlasting joy on their heads, they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.” (Isaiah 35:1-2, 7, 10)  
​Our heart toward the Earth should reflect God’s and we should realize our intended purpose as rulers and stewards of it.  Humanity has been given this wonderful gift of Earth, with all of her trees, animals, mountains and seas as an inheritance and blessing.  He created it for us to enjoy and where we could worship and glorify Him.  Thus, we should do our best to be good stewards, not intentionally destroying and polluting it.  But rather doing, to the best our abilities, to preserve the environment and practice healthy habits for sustaining ourselves and the planet.  
​
We know that we have been saved by grace, that we have relationship with God and that in the future we will be completely restored to perfection, even as Paul says that we now, “beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord.” (2 Corinthians 3:18)  We even know that God will redeem the Earth when he returns.  But in the same way we are encouraged to live our lives with wisdom and with Godliness, we should treat the Earth in the same way; instead of being negligent, knowing what God will perform in it, we should treat it with care.
​However, we must beware that we don’t put so much of our emphasis on the Earth instead of God.  Paul says in the beginning of epistle to the Romans, that those who sin and worship themselves, “exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator…” (Romans 1:25 NKJV)  The Apostle John writes that the elders who sit before God’s throne in heaven declare, “And that You should reward Your servants the prophets and the saints, and to those who fear Your name, small and great, and should destroy those who destroy the earth.” (Revelation 11:18)
​We know what God will do in the future, but that does not give us free reign in continuing to harm the Earth intentionally.  We should be inclined, not given, to the Earth’s preservation as a means of worshiping and honoring God.

I know for undergrad gpa is important for your first job and for internships and getting into Grad school. 

What about grad school gpa though? Just too graduate I need a 3.0 and that's pretty much what I'm on.  I doubt I'll get much higher than 3.0-3.2

I've had internships through undergrad and grad school as well so I at least have that going for me when I finish. 

Part of me wants to think that if I have my masters, companies shouldn't be caring what my gpa is. "

[What are some of the worst/weirdest situations you were involved in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6u4gn?context=5)|I have had people working at the Ministry of Education ask me for bribes. I have seen ministers embezzle funds. My life has been threatened twice. The first organisation I had worked with had asked me to allocate certain funds designated to the purchase of ringers lactate (necessary for cholera treatment) to a supplier that was across the globe instead of in the US because the transportation costs would have been higher and we could say more money was spent that way.
 |The weirdest situation I ever found myself was probably when being invited to a meeting at a restaurant at night. The restaurant was bursting with music, imported steaks, tons of alcohol. Meanwhile, across the street from the restaurant was an IDP camp. This was during cholera too, so as you left the restaurant you could actually hear the moans of people who were being treated at the cholera treatment centre nearby. It was surreal.
[ of all, thank you for your work. You have clearly affected many lives in a positive way. How has it affected your life being down there for so long and witnessing so many things?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6ufql?context=5)|Thank you for your kind remarks.
 |It is depressing work. For a long time I would drink myself to sleep. For a month or two I was punching the wall next to my bed in my sleep as well. It is crazy, I think many people see those who are in my line of work not as human beings. There are always negative comments about how aid workers whore, drink, and do drugs. How they have loud parties while people are starving/dying/suffering and how they go on wonderful holidays and generally seem to be having a good time. I would have to say that we are all human beings. Doing some of these things is in some cases the only way to cope. One cannot be in constant despair, and in fact, that is exactly one of the reasons we choose to do this work, to get people out of constant despair. We cannot do good work if we are constantly thinking of horror. So what happens? We become desensitised, we drink a lot, we smoke a lot, we may become belligerent, whatever.
 |With me, I lost my girlfriend after a few months of being here. I had trouble following conversations. I could not sleep unless I had a drink in me. I hated this place for a long time, and maybe I still do. But things are better with me now. In part I have gotten used to it (desensitised it enough), and in part I have changed my surroundings.
 |I do, however, think that seeing a therapist after I leave here will probably do me a world of good.
[I understand the whole avoiding despair, but as someone that has had many friends in deployed locations, there's more you can do just coping with one another than drink, smoke, and party. I am afraid to visit most other countries because of the bad reputation people have given of english-speaking people. Do we need to send out a humanitarian effort for the humanitarian effort now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6v5ut?context=5)|Hahaha,
 |That's a funny thought. I agree there are other ways to cope. Drink, smoke and party are usually cheaper, easier, and less time-consuming. 
[What's your perspective on the long-term aid work going on there? Lots of teams went down short-term, but it's interesting that you stayed. How, if at all, has your perspective pertaining to Haiti's needs changed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6u2wj?context=5)|There were tons of organisations coming in in 2010. At one point the Ministry of Interior was saying that about 4000 different organisations (NGOs, church groups, international businesses, etc.) were working in the country. The immediate response was therefore very hectic. There was very little organisation. The UN held (and still holds) what they called ""cluster meetings"". These thematic meetings tried to coordinate the various activities of all the different actors (so there'd be an education cluster, a shelter cluster, a WASH cluster, etc). Unfortunately many of the smaller NGOs would not participate, making true coordination efforts impossible. You would have large NGOs such as Samaritan's Purse or Save the Children trying to build schools with the coordination and ""assistance"" of the Ministry of Education, but then some church group from Kansas would come in and would build a school in the areas where the large organisations were meaning to work, thus ruining projects that would probably have had a larger impact and would be managed better.
 |Tons of money was thrown away in this way. There was also lots of corruption and profiteering. Port-au-Prince, for example, became one of the most expensive cities in the world. Materials for construction, medication, essentially anything that was needed to carry out projects was so expensive that the money allocated for certain activities was barely enough to achieve what had initially been planned out. The opposite thing would also happen, some organisations were unlucky enough to receive far more money than they could spend, and so tried to get rid of it in any way they could, consciously making bad investments, making little effort to protect their warehouses and doing anything when things were stolen, thus forcing them to spend more money buying the material that was stolen. That sort of thing.
 |There are all sorts of beautiful, wonderful strategies for development in Haiti. They have been drafted using money from all sorts of organisations and countries and they make for nice meeting platforms. They are essentially useless, though. Very little effort has been taken to make coordinated moves towards developments. Most of the action from government, NGOs, UN, and the other different actors has been uncoordinated and disorderly. You can think of it as a school children. They will all acts as ""friends"" make wonderful plans to work together, publish amazing reports with distorted figures about the achievements that have been done, while at the same time stabbing each other's backs and wanting to take as much credit as possible for the small positive outcomes. Thus the government claims that the building of 200 new schools in 6 months was their achievement, the UN will say that these same 200 schools could not have been built without the aid of the MINUSTAH (Mission des Nations Unis pour la Stabilisation d'Haiti - peacekeepers), the European Union will say that they put in the money and have therefore contributed to Haiti's education, and meanwhile there are no desks or chairs at the school or, as I've seen it, the owners of the land where the school has been built have decided to make some changes to the building and turn it into a private residence.
 |The chaos was evident since I arrived, but I had hope that it would get better. It seemed for a while that true coordination efforts were under way to actually come up with a central plan to develop Haiti. In fact, I believe the government had even created an organisation to do this. With time, though, especially around election time in 2010 (November, December and then again in beginning of 2011), we all lost focus. The chaos became the status quo, it was accepted, this is Haiti, there was really nothing that could be done about it. Apathy in one person or in a group of people happens all the time and is easily overcome, but apathy in a government and all its supporting branches and external structures is really a depressing thing that is almost impossible to overcome.
 |I am not sure if that answered your question, but there you have it.
[So, would you say that the Haitians would actually be better off if they were left to their own devices?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6ulv1?context=5)|That is an extreme viewpoint. I do not believe that Haitians would be better off alone. Besides some interventions and invasions, Haitians have been alone since their independence. It is a country with an extensive history of abuse of power, factionalism and stupendous brinkmanship. I believe that the earthquake of 2010 was a fantastic opportunity for Haiti to take advantage of the aid, the global support and sympathy it had, and to move forward. Part of my disappointment with this issue comes from how quickly all of this was forgotten here. I believe that if Haiti is to develop, it should come from within Haiti, yes, but this will not be possible without the financial aid of the international community. The mechanism through which the aid is sent to Haiti should be changed, though. Maybe this is a bit of a hazy answer...
[1 What lessons have you learned about organizing short-term, first on the scene response team strategies &amp; execution?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6uqbf?context=5)|I am not entirely sure if it is actually possible to do coordinated first responses. The nature of the emergency itself means that there will be little organisation and a lot of disorder, however I do believe that smaller organisations (even a group of missionaries coming in for a week) should do their homework and ask themselves if the activities they plan to do are in harmony with what is already being done. They should ask themselves if there is anyone else working in the area, if their practices will create inequality or dependency, etc. The Sphere Standards are a good start.
[2 Long-term development strategies seem to be lacking vision, yet have some resources to accomplish something. What do you see as the future for Haiti? Will they rebuild back to its previously decrepit, poverty - stricken standard, or will they rebuild into something greater? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6uqbf?context=5)|I believe it is important for governments to make emergency plans for the sorts of emergencies they are prone to. Haiti did not have an earthquake plan, unfortunately.  Haiti is currently looking into improving its tourism industry. It is laughable to some, but a very daring feat. I believe that the future of Haiti does lie in the service industry. Manufacturing, mining, tourism, etc.  The poverty-stricken standard is what is currently in place at the moment. I believe that this is the accepted status quo. It is not accepted by those outside of Port-au-Prince, of course, but it is accepted by the political elite, the business owners, even, I dare say, some NGOs who wouldn't exist if it wasn't for this standard.
[The ""Haitian people"" would not be left to their own devices anyway, someone like Papa Doc would probably grab power.  Anarchy is unstable.  (Right?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6vicn?context=5)|But that's what I mean as being left to their own devices. Maybe I don't understand your comment. Someone like papa doc or aristide or baby doc is exactly what has happened when they have been left to their own devices.
[Hey I am Tourism student, studying in UK. Next year I will be required to take a placement in industry as part of degree, I was looking into internship work in Africa's Nature Reserves. But after checking your AMA, I'm interested about possibilities in Haiti. After some googling i found most of the issues with it, but wanted to hear your opinion on tourism in Haiti, its expansion. Also do you think there are any opportunities for internship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6wxqs?context=5)|You could try and contact some of the hotels directly to see if they'd be willing to take you on. My main problem with tourism in Haiti is that Haiti does not sound, in my opinion, like an ideal Caribbean holiday. I find it difficult to think of a tourist who would want to come here for a month or two in the summer. Also, I believe the Dominican Republic is the biggest tourist destination in the Caribbean. It will be difficult to compete with such a large business. In spite of this, there ARE tourists who come here, and the Ministry of Tourism is doing a hell of a lot to try and help. I have not studied tourism so my views are completely superficial, but who knows, maybe there is a future in tourism here. You might also want to try contacting the Ministry of Tourism directly, it wouldn't hurt, at the very least they could forward you on to someone who could help you. Good luck!
[Could you elaborate a bit more about the waste of money happening in Haiti?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6uyjn?context=5)|Could you elaborate a bit more about the waste of money happening in Haiti?
[What do you think happened with the bulk of aid money that was committed to Haiti in 2010 immediately following the earthquake?  Why do you think it is so hard for Haiti to recover from the earthquake?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6uyjn?context=5)|What do you think happened with the bulk of aid money that was committed to Haiti in 2010 immediately following the earthquake? -This is hard to say. Most of the answers above cover this quite well with the addition that in 2010 most of the activities were for emergency response, therefore short-term goals (distribution water or food) and therefore have not left a tangible mark that can be seen today.  Why do you think it is so hard for Haiti to recover from the earthquake? - The earthquake destroyed Port-au-Prince, the largest city and commercial base of the country. It's as if New York City were suddenly obliterated. Recovery from something like that would be slow and painful. If on top of that you take into account lack of coordination, corruption, and personal interests then you will end up with something like Haiti today.
[How do you feel about the current government in Haiti?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6uyjn?context=5)|How do you feel about the current government in Haiti?
[Why did you choose to go to Haiti? How long do you plan on staying?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6u0r0?context=5)|I chose to go to Haiti because I needed work. I got an interview through a friend of mine for an NGO and was sent over very shortly after the earthquake of 2010 (in January). I did it because at the time it was the highest paying job I could find, and because it was vaguely related to what I wanted to do career-wise. I never intended to stay as long as I have. One month turned into three more, which turned into six, and next thing I know I've been here for years. For a while I tried convincing myself that I came to help people and to respond to the disaster, and I suppose that made my job easier, but with time I realised that it is really a dirty and disgusting business (yes, a business). I plan to leave in December of this year.
[Do you know the best way to become involved in NGOs? I have wanted to volunteer for a very long time now but since it seems that whenever I try to ask about volunteering or working I am given the same response, no. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6vwyd?context=5)|Yes,
 |Try contacting NGOs in usually uninteresting countries at first. I made the suggestion to someone else of Samaritan's Purse in Bolivia (again, I don't work for samaritan's purse and don't know if they actually work in Bolivia). If you write directly to the country director (whose name you could probably find by googling it) you will have higher chances of getting a positive response. 
[Will you work in a similar capacity elsewhere? I assume this kind of work looks good in general, right? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6y262?context=5)|I am thinking about possibly continuing work in Asia, but at the moment am in a bit of an existential limbo. Who knows!
[*I did it because at the time it was the highest paying job I could find.*  Nosy question, but how much does it pay?  Edit: If you ignore this, I don't blame you at all.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6yqus?context=5)|I answered this somewhere else. The first job I had here paid around USD$4,500.00 a month including housing and transportation with R&amp;R every two months (plane ticket was included for the RR)
[What's the best way to donate to Haiti relief? I hear that so little of the donated money actually reaches the island, it sounds like it would be more effective to just put cash in an envelope and mail it to a random name in the Haiti white pages.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6v0je?context=5)|Let me tell you first what the worst way to donate is: donations in kind. Sending clothes, water, food, whatever. That is amazingly annoying and mostly unnecessary. Most of the donations in kind will sit at warehouses for weeks and months and will cost much more to store and transport than if it was bought separately.
 |The easiest way to donate to Haiti would be to give money to a reputable, maybe non-religious organisation. It is true that a lot of the money does not reach the projects themselves, but that is unavoidable. You have to see your money not as equalling a brick in a school, but as something that helps that brick being put there. NGO offices, the cost of guards, even having coffee for a meeting, these all come from donations (mostly) and are in some way necessary to making it possible to put a brick in a school. Still, I understand your frustration with this.
[What do you think of this Earthship project?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6x343?context=5)|I'd never heard of it before. I'll take a look at the video later. Thanks for the link!
[On to the question.  If you could change one thing in Haiti (politically, culturally, etc\) to aid in its advancement, what would it be?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6uonk?context=5)|If I could change one thing in Haiti it would be the attitude of the beneficiaries. Over the past two years there has been a great and partly justified anti-NGO sentiment. They are suspicious of works being done and believe that we are just a business (which I believe we are in part). This obviously cuases massive problems with the work we are trying to achieve. Ironically this anti-NGO movement demands that we do more work and take over some of the activities that are the legal responsibilites of the state. So basically, they don't trust us, but they want us to do more.
[Why should anyone care about Haiti anymore? We provided money and support since the quake, and after the major coup d'etat, and after their last national disaster. Why shouldn't I just say, ""13 strikes and you're out?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6w6zd?context=5)|I'm not here to change your opinion. I think those are excellent questions and they have crossed my mind more than once as well.
[What is a humanitarian worker?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6u3k3?context=5)|This is a great question. It's funny, I don't actually know what is probably a generally accepted definition of this. Maybe I should explain to you what I have done?
 |In 2010 I came in as part of an emergency team, trying to deal with fast response to the earthquake emergency. This meant the immediate alleviation of the needs of those affected. Thus, distribution of food and water, clothes, medication, emergency medical services, tents and tarpaulin for shelter, etc.
 |Since then I have moved to development. This means that the emergency is over and now we are focusing on long-term goals. So we have built schools, fixed roads, built hospitals, trained nurses, etc.
[I study International Development at Uni and this is pretty much what I want to spend my life doing. How'd you get into it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6whp4?context=5)|I'm sorry for this short answer, if you look around there are a couple of other people who asked the same question. My answers are there.

[I was just in Port au Prince! I got back on Tuesday from a ten day trip there. My father works in a high position for Digicel down there, I'd rather not say what exactly. I met some girls at Wahoo Bay that were working for Hope for Haiti, so this post piqued my curiosity.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6vpzh?context=5)|I think in part it's just the way it is. They're used to it. I'm used to it too at this point. Secondly, there are very few pick-up spots for refuse. Thirdly, many people choose to throw it in the canals because it is easier than burning it themselves.
[My question to you is when I was down there, the amount of trash on the mountain sides, in the street, etc. was astonishing to me. Coming from the states, it was shocking to me that there was no regard for cleanup as we have here. Why do you think that is? Do you think that the Haitians don't care, or is there more to it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6vpzh?context=5)|Every once in a while there will be efforts to clean up, but because of how Port-au-Prince is built, rain tends to wash a lot of it up on the streets.
[How much is the pay? and are many of the prisoners that escaped still out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6w1s9?context=5)|For project management positions it is anywhere between EUR 1000.00 and EUR 6000.00 a month depending on the organisation. In the first organisation I worked with my boss, the country director was making around USD 120,000.00 a year. It really depends on the size of the organisation.
[What would you say to someone to convince him/her to become a humanitarian worker in Haiti like you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6uzzc?context=5)|I'm not sure I would try to convince anyone to do this. It is hard, it is uncomfortable, and it will eventually break you. I believe it was more difficult for me because it wasn't an actual calling. I did it for convenience, and though at the beginning I did believe that I was doing good work and that I wanted to help, this faded. It is sad. Had I had other opitons, I think I would have left much earlier. This makes me incredibly sad about myself, but it is true. If you want to do aid work, you should know it and be sure of it without asking other's opinions, I think. Think of it like joining a seminary.
[Say I wanted to leave for this type of work immediately. How does one jump right in? I've been wanting to do some kind of work like this temporarily, and eventually permanently. Are you actually a volunteer and have to pay for all travel, food, and living expenses or are you a paid contractor of some type?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6v0ac?context=5)|Strangely, it is harder than one would expect. I got lucky. Organisations are usually looking for educated individuals, and usually people educated in either the field of humanitarian affairs or whatever specific field they will be working in (e.g. WASH - Water, Sanitation and Hygiene experts).
 |Some organisations might look for volunteers but they are also very competitive. Take a look at reliefweb.com . Job descriptions there might give you an idea of what it is they're looking for.
[Do they need people with IT skills?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6y9bu?context=5)|Yes. People with IT skills are always needed. As in any office or work environment, things will crash and people need, no, DEMAND someone to blame.
[A close friend of mine was working for some private security firm over there. She said there was a big problem with the Haitians raping women over there. Apparently she wasn't allowed to go out after dark for fear of people raping her. At some point a group of people got fed up with all the women being raped, rounded up a group of like, 12 people who had tried to rape their female counter-parts, and murdered them all on the roof of a building. Is rape a serious problem over there? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6wkes?context=5)|Rape is a massive problem. I remember reading that rape did not actually become illegal until the beginning of this century, though I'm not sure if that's true. I receive a daily digest of security issues in Port-au-Prince from the UN and I'd say about 80% of these are related to rapes. Also, vigilantism is massive. Lots of lynchings.
[If you had to do it over, would you have gone and done this? Whats the biggest problem with Haiti / the people ? That country seems to not be able to lift itself out of poverty vs dominican republic.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6wjd8?context=5)|If I had to do it over again I don't think I would have stayed longer than a year.
 |In a nutshell the Dominican Republic has the advantage that it speaks Spanish and can therefore form active part of its surrounding community, it has made an active effort to improve its political culture since its dictatorship, and it was able to take advantage of the tourist industry starting from the 1970s. Haiti at one point was a bigger tourism destination than the Dominican Republic (in the 70s I believe). Since then political problems have, in my opinion, managed to detract from this sort of development.
[Can any real change be taken in Haiti while the government is corrupt?

I have been incredibly angry at the people here, I have hated all of it, but I have also realised that classifying a people as one entity, giving them one label and one name, is an exercise in futility. You will find all sorts of kind people and all sorts of spiteful people, and though it sounds very trite, you might as well focus on the good ones because the others will have you wallowing in despair.

Schools have been built, cholera has been responded to in an amazing way, local associations have been set up and are able to effectively manage and represent their communities. I believe that achievements have been made but nothing near what was expected, and this isn't from lack of trying. I think that expectations were far too high and unrealistic.

If you want to do microcredits, do some economics, try to get an internship with a local microcredit organisation (you can even find them in large US cities!), if you want to do WASH then do an internship as a plumber's assistant (seriously!). Development alone won't get you very far.

For example, look up the Samaritan's Purse office in Bolivia (that's just an example, I have no connection to Samaritan's Purse, I don't even know if they work there) and simply write and say that you'd be interested in doing an internship. You'll be more likely to get one that way than by going through the usual competitive routes.

But then I realise I've gotten used to not walking around in Port-au-Prince, gotten used to having armed guards at the door of my house, knowing exit routes BY HEART. Some friends of mine have been robbed, one them was almost kidnapped (his colleagues were kidnapped, he was out of the house at the time). There was a Swiss woman who was killed for HTG2,000.00 in Cap Haitien I believe. It can be dangerous.

[I don't know if this will get seen, but will give it a shot. My parents are Canadian, but I grew up in Haiti. They moved there to help out in the 80s but not as part of any NGO or company, just on their own. When my mom first moved there she lived in a tiny little room rented from a house with no furniture and barely enough to live on. My parents were very determined that I grow up as a Haitian culturally, I went to Haitian schools (most ex-pats would go to Americanized schools\) I spent time in my neighbourhood with the kids there, not going to special ex-pat hangout spots or summer camps. I am culturally a Haitian and associate with Haiti more than any other culture. My mother has worked since with many aid organizations and now runs her own small scale, grass-roots, Haitian NGO focused on teacher training. I've seen everything there is to see with NGO's and their workers. From this perspective I've felt it's a shame that aid workers and ex-pats don't get enough exposure to Haitians. They see the worst because they interact with people who are in dire situations or deal with corrupt officials. Whereas there is so much joy and beauty there, and growing up there I don't have any familiarity with most of the situations OP has talked about (not that he's been bad mouthing Haiti or that these things don't exist, just that there's a dark side in any country, I'm sure aid/social workers in the US/Canada might have many similar stories, though probably not as publicly visible as in Haiti\). So a question to OP is, do you think it would be beneficial to be more exposed to Haitian community life? Would it help with the depression and shock that many of you feel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca703a3?context=5)|Yes. I think that more exposure would help with depression and so on. I'm not sure if it would have helped much in 2010 when things were so out of control, but it would certainly help now. And let me say, there are many expats who have given themselves to Haiti completely. They have made families here, have become completely entwined with the country. Many of those who left have very fond memories of Haiti.
[TL;DR; Grew up in Haiti as Haitian, parents involved in NGOs. I feel it would benefit NGO workers to be more involved in Haitian life, than just helping in the emergencies. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca703a3?context=5)|It was never my intention to bad-mouth the country, and I'm sorry if it might have even seemed that way. I am only one voice and one opinion, and I only mean to share what I have seen and felt.

I'm a 3rd year computer engineering student from Canada. I've taken a year off (to work as an intern) and I'm really interested in contributing to an open source project on the side. Cloud computing seems perfect for me because I love Infrastructure/Operating Systems while preferring a higher level language like Python. I do not have too much experience working with large codebases and I have little to no experience contributing to an open source project. Do you think it's a little over-ambitious as a first project? Should I focus on something easier? And if I do decide on OpenStack, where exactly do I start? There seems to be a sea of documentation that leaves me confused. I found the Nova compute platform relatively interesting.

1f4s6x,1,2013-05-27,Today at work,[deleted],TalesFromThePharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePharmacy/comments/1f4s6x/today_at_work/,"So I don't usually work weekdays, but the pharmacist in charge asked me to fill in and tech today since we were short, and I needed the extra money.  I felt like coming on here and posting some stories from the day.  

First up I took in a prescription for Actonel for an older lady.  She handed me the Medicare/DVA copy of her (already dispensed, because it had a PBS sticker on it) script, with nothing attached, and asked 'Can I still use this?' 

*I'm posting from Australia - Aussie prescriptions always have a duplicate copy, which is attached to all repeats and is kept by the pharmacy after the person gets their final repeat filled, as well as a Medicare/DVA copy, which is the one that goes to government insurance (i.e. Medicare) with the PBS sticker attached to it after dispensing so that the pharmacy gets paid.  You need to have both copies otherwise the pharmacy can't dispense the script.*

I politely explained to the lady that the person who gave her out the script last time must have made a mistake to have given this back to her, as we needed to keep it to send to the government to get paid for the Actonel, and took instead the proper prescription with both copies that she (fortunately) had on her.  She then said to me, as I was writing out a ticket for her to pick up her script, 'Usually I only want to get one or two medications at a time, and when I pick up my scripts from here all the paper gets stapled together.  I wish they wouldn't do that.  I have to pull them apart and bring them in.  I've got so many loose pieces of paper like this at home.'

I wasn't really sure what to say at this point.  We have a lot of customers that take a lot of meds and only want certain ones filled - most pharmacies do staple all the repeats together for customers like this so nothing gets lost, and the customer usually just tells us what they want filled at the dropoff and we write it down.  I couldn't understand why she would think she needed to pull the paper apart.  
The pharmacist came over at this point to talk to her about bringing in the DVA copies with the stickers on them, so that we could get paid for dispensing her meds, and I went away to serve another customer.  Later I found out that the lady's husband had called in and said that he had dropped off the stickered copies to the competitor pharmacy across the road.  None of us had any clue why he would have done this - the pharmacist called the competitor and was told that the couple hadn't filled there for a couple of years.  So it looks like we aren't getting any money back for that Actonel - I hope she wasn't on anything else expensive.  

Anyway...

The next thing that happened today was much more standard fare.  A lady who spoke very little English informed us that she wanted three refills on each of her meds and that she wanted specific brands.  We ended up having to borrow a box of her simvastatin brand from the other pharmacy in our chain nearby because we didn't have enough.  All up there were 12 prescriptions that I needed to dispense and the pharmacist needed to check.  She decided to wait for them (of course) and the whole time she was there, asked every single staff member in the dispensary multiple times if it was ready yet.  The intern pharmacist was about ready to strangle her.  We were all very relieved when she paid for her meds and left the store.  

The retail manager is continuing to display blatant favouritism.  From the two years I have been working there, it's been common knowledge that those put on as supervisors with the ability to do refunds and count cash and such are very strongly preferred to be over eighteen due to the fact that they're often handling a lot of money.  The weekday floor supervisor that's been put on recently is sixteen.  She's also the retail manager's granddaughter.  The retail manager has this habit of playing favourites even with people who aren't her family members.  Her current one, a girl who is rude and condescending to the other staff but bends over backwards to fawn over the retail manager and the store owner, doesn't get given any cleaning jobs to do on the weekend, while the other girls had to do double the work.  Ugh.  

Anyway...that was my day at work today.  Just moderately crappy.  I would kind of like to read about other people's workdays in the comments (assuming I get any) but that's just me.  TL;DR: I was having a bit of a bitch about my job.  "

Thanks in advance for the consideration.

I had a fairly normal childhood. One older brother, parents divorced when I was 8. I was nerdy growing up and never really fit in. I got teased a bit, but nothing too serious. I never really had any interests, hobbies, or the like and even until today my mother always questioned/s ""Why don't you do __ like the other boys?"" ""Oh honey, normal boys don't like that stuff."" ..and the like. Both my parents always meant well and I was fortunate to be raised in a fairly affluent area and be well-traveled around the US. I was really studious, got good grades, steered way clear of trouble and did everything 'right'. Because I never really had a group of friends until senior year of high school, and because I was never really close to my family, I opted to go to college clear across to the other side of the country. I saw this as an opportunity to get a fresh start and to find my way.

Freshman year of college ('10 - '11) was great. I made an awesome group of friends, I earned good grades, and I landed an internship for the summer. In October 2010 I had the confidence to come out to one of my high school friends via snail mail. I slowly came out to other friends (college friends in January 2011) and could not ask for a better reaction - everyone has absolutely no problem with it and has treated me no differently.

I'd say I've felt depressed for as long as I can remember, but to put a fixed time on it I could definitively say 7th grade ('04 - '05). Last year ('11 - '12) is when my depression became so overwhelming that daily activities were exhausting. I talked with my roommate about it in the fall. He was understanding, as he had also dealt with depression. I was suicidal then, too. I recognized I needed help and turned to friends for support. I told them my entire background so they knew where I was coming from, and made them aware that I was depressed and suicidal. I did this individually with 5 or 6. At my most dramatic moments, I wrote out 3 page long bulletins that I mass-emailed to a dozen or so outlining my depression and asking for them to be understanding and supportive.

I think turning to my friends made the depression even worse. Instead of being able to talk to them about it, I found that it was (and still is) difficult to articulate my feelings. I'd feel like they wanted to hear and help, but then when I tried sitting down with them and explaining things that they were dismissive or disinterested in helping. My roommate referred me to his mental health counselor here at school, saying that she really helped him. I went to her two or three times and after taking the PHQ-9 was diagnosed with severe depression, as well as moderate anxiety. I tried antidepressants for a month or so and went to counseling two or three times but neither felt right, or like they were helping so I stopped both. I had 4 or 5 instances where I've been really intoxicated with alcohol and sent to the hospital, with friends present. Most of those times I was also suicidal so I was on watch during the night at the hospital. All of this was ongoing from October 2011 - August 2012. I tried to keep a happy front, but even with my depression in full-blown view in front of them, my friends never asked or seemed to genuinely care about my wellbeing.

I traveled for a bit and studied abroad from August - December 2012. Travel has always been my one and only true interest in life. I used all my savings and nearly wiped out my account to make this possible, and to try my best to reinvigorate myself. Perhaps I was overly optimistic, but I thought that after coming back I would feel refreshed, be able to get a full-time job for after graduation, and maybe even date.

Since returning from study abroad, my depression is not as bad as it was a year ago, but I'm afraid it's slowly creeping back to that point. I've submitted over 200 applications and interviewed more than 3 dozen times, with no job offers. Fortunately, I did earn an internship for this summer with plans for it to transition to full-time. The work is just okay in terms of where I'd like to be, but the pay is abyssmal - lower than what I made at my first internship. I tried a dating site or two (and more than once), and I went on dates with a dozen or so guys. Either I wasn't interested in them, or they weren't interested in me, so I've given up on dating. I've had more hookups than I'd like to share (this was after trying to find dates.)

At this point, I'm just trying to do all I can to keep from reverting back to how bad my depression was before. I really don't feel like I'll ever be 'not depressed' though. From most people's point of view my life should look great so I feel guilty feeling depressed. I was able to go to college out of state and have parents help support me, I will be graduating a year early, I am well traveled, I am happily out to friends. What I see, and what perpetuates my depression, is that: I am not out to my family, I worked hard in school but don't have a full-time job, my savings are almost out, I feel uncomfortable turning to friends for support, I don't think I'll ever be in a relationship.

Again, sorry for the long read, and I'm sorry if it's too scatterbrained. I'd be happy to clarify anything so you have a better understanding of my situation. I'm looking for objective advice from an outside perspective, or to hear from anyone who has been in a similar situation. Thanks."

Whether its when I'm with my freinds and someone they know and I do not comes over, or if its after going out to lunch saying bye. In general I feel awkwardad I would like to feel less awkward.

I also sometimes feel awkward at my internship.

I started an internship a few months ago at a local startup company. Sometimes I feel alittle awkward there as everyone who is there graduated from Stanford and seem to be really brilliant. I sometimes feel alittle uncomfortable as I am only attending UCSD, which I think I will love, but is nowhere near the caliber of Stanford.  They seem to like me and act really cool, but I still fill a little out of place. 

I worry sometimes I am not meeting their expectations on what I should do, they haven't said anything negative, but then again, they never really have said anything even slightly negative. They are always just really positive. 

When they had some buddies over from Stanford they said I was their best intern and I would be getting an amazing letter of reccomendation, we all went out to lunch and it was a really fun time. I've also gone to block parties that were held nearby. I feel like they do like me, but I also feel I'm just tagging along for the ride and if I wasn't there it wouldn't really matter or be any different. One of the founder's brother's owns a company and allows me access to his machine shop.

I feel a little insecure. While based on what they have said an how they act it feels like I should be grounded and confident in my position, I can't help feeling that they would be this nice to anyone.

I feel in general I don't make much of an impact and what I do doesn't really matter.

http://news.yahoo.com/high-tech-industry-big-immigration-bill-winner-122335675.html

I work as a dev lead in a fortune 500 company. There are a lot of people from other countries on my team - Chinese, Indian, African. Most of them are great people. I feel really lucky to work with such a diverse group, but honestly I am uncomfortable with the number developers coming from other countries and how cheaply they are willing to work. I realize this is an age old issue: Immigrants filling a skill void and causing local animosity. But for several reasons, I can't help feeling like we are making a mistake. 

The main culprit in my opinion is that it is relatively difficult and costly for US students to get a decent technical education and succeed in the high-tech industry, compared to India and China. It's definitely not because China and India turn out such awesome programmers; they just have a system that can produce more technical degrees at a lower cost.

I would also submit that from a business standpoint one could argue that on-shoring makes financial sense, but like so many business trade offs, it doesn't necessarily make sense for the economy or society. 

I value the diversity, but the system appears to reward workers that come here, send their money home, and return after several years. These employees in general do not invest in their community, do not lay down roots, and are less likely to take ownership in local politics and societal issues. If they were truly immigrants I may feel differently (perhaps not better though).

Conclusion - I think we are losing the education investment game. I think we are taking the easy way out by giving away visa's for high tech jobs that most Americans would kill for. And I think companies are selling their communities short by not training new grads and bringing up interns. 

Thoughts anyone?"

Most newer games I will play on PS3 or PS4 when it releases.  I will run a few virtual emulators on here, such as a virtual gameboy advance and PS2.  Other than that, I'll be doing general web browsing, MS Office work, and very light Photoshop work. 

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

I will have to get peripherals too, so I'd rather keep everything under a $2000 budget as much as possible.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

I cannot do this build for a while, probably for another month since that's when my internship starts.  I wanted to start planning now though so I could get an idea of what I'm looking at getting.  I've done some builds with friends, but thought it couldn't hurt to get Reddit's opinion too.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

This build will be nearly completely from scratch.  I think at best the only thing I could contribute to it is an Intel 330 series solid state drive.  Oh, and an okay 2.1 speaker set (I'm not a huge audiophile). This would make my laptop completely useless though, although admittedly the system board on it is going.  Other than that, I would need the monitors, keyboard, mouse, tower components, and most of the cables.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

I'd prefer to get most of these parts at Microcenter, as I have one that's close by in PA. I wouldn't mind getting some at Tiger Direct or Newegg if it's going to be a decent increase in specs for around the same price.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

As I said, I think I'd only be reusing a SSD I have in my laptop.  

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

I would rather not get into overclocking, as I'd rather not get into water cooling or overclocking itself for this rig.  This is for CPU, RAM and GPU.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

Two 2TB HDDs in RAID 1...I've had one too many HDDs fail on me due to a combo of misuse and bad luck, so I'd rather not have to keep rebuilding multimedia again.

USB 3.0 on the front would be amazing.

If the case could come with built in blue LED fans, that would be great...

Blue backlit keyboard would be awesome too

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

Pretty much what I already said above...having a window to view in would be really nice.  However if there are blue LED fans that can be seen from the outside of the case, I wouldn't mind no window or a mesh like covering for it.  Low noise would be awesome, but isn't super necessary.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

Uh...good question.  My MSDN license is still good until mid July.  I should be good until then, if not I'll get one separately.

&gt;Extra info or specifics:

I will be using a triple monitor setup for this rig, something I've been set on for a while.  I'd prefer the monitors to match, have a 5ms response time or less, support 1080p + and have HDMI and DVI compatibility.

&gt;Other notes:

I'll update this as I think of anything else, but I believe that I got everything.  This will be my first build and I'm tech savy to a degree but not on par with some of you guys.  This helps me out a lot. Thanks again for your help in advance everyone!  "

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How come these things won't visit US ports? Just no West Coast port big enough to handle them? And if not, why not?  I understand these ships are pretty brutal to the environment. Do you see any technology or practices on the horizon that might make them a little less harmful?  Is this size of ship going to be the new standard to stay competitive on those routes now?   A lot of Europe-Asia air traffic is being flown through Middle Eastern airports (or Istanbul\), a vast change from even a decade ago. Is there the same shift in sea cargo?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7qozw?context=5)|The real problem is not the size of the ports it's that the ports use outdated technology. Ports in China and Europe are highly automated and they can move containers at and amazing rate. American ports are slow because the unions fear that automation will cost their members jobs and because union rules support policies that lead to slower load rates (the longer it takes, the more hours union members rack up. One expert told me that this ship could be offloaded in Europe in 2-3 days but it would take the port of Los Angeles over a week to offload her... And Maersk can not afford to leave an expensive ship like this one tied to the dock for that long.  These ships are brutal on the environment on a per ship basis but on a per container basis they are much more efficient than any other form of transport (e.g. Trains, trucks, etc). So the environment would benefit significantly if containers were moved across this CPU try (through the canal) then aboard trucks and trains. This is called ""short sea shipping"" and is how European cargo gets moved... But it's something lobbyists have fought for years.
 |Yes, expert believe this will be the new standard in 10 years but... Only time will tell.
[*blasphemy, how dare you insult the sanctity of the union maritime worker!* ~sincerely, NY tugboat operator tired of his useless union. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca81k6a?context=5)|Well the Sandy Hook pilots are just across the bay and they are non-union, right... maybe they have a few openings ;)
 |(Yes, I'm joking)
[Do you think that by trying to avoid automation to save union jobs and provide more union hours, these ports might be bringing about their own demise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7v1qi?context=5)|They can't do more harm to themselves then they already have, so no, I don't think they will demise but they are preventing their own growth.
 |If we adopted Europe's methods then we would move containers onto smaller ships to more efficiently get the containers closer to their destinations... That would mean two more loads per container for every crane operator which translates to lots more jobs. Of course, it would mean less jobs for truck drivers but this will happen anyway as new ports are currently being built in Mexico.
[As a member of the shipping industry in the US now pursuing a degree in logistics, this comment infuriates me to no end. It seems every inefficiency on our side comes back to Unions, and its usually true, having witnessed it first hand. Between local government interference and union hustling it sometimes amazes me anyone is willing to do business here.  That said, I find this industry absolutely fascinating and look forward getting more involved in it after college. Your blog looks like a great resource. Working for Maersk is one of my goals. Did you enjoy your time with the company? Though I hope to work port-side in some sort of intermodal capacity, any chance of getting some time at sea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca82oaz?context=5)|Well if the unions infuriate you then you're in for a treat... Just look up e work ""MARAD"" in the index of your text book and you'll learn about one organization that makes the unions look like time travelers from the future.
[How many bags of heroin does your boat hold?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7n27v?context=5)|What, didn't you see Mark Wahlberg's film ""Contraband""? There are a thousand places to hide heroin, weapons and people on a ship like this. 
[I was going to ask what it's like to have Mark Wahlberg smuggle stuff on your ship.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7nifp?context=5)|Mark's a nice guy but got an attitude when I said the only thing worse than New Kids is a Funky Bunch album ;)
[But seriously, did you ever have crew that would try that stuff?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7nifp?context=5)|I've certainly heard rumors and had reason to suspect they were true but... no, I've never caught anyone in the act. Like I said, it's a big ship with thousands of hiding spaces... the only way to be caught is to either be really dumb or get stopped on your way on and off the ship. 
[SO HOW MANY BAGS OP?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7nmi7?context=5)|Thousands of kilos. Hiding vast quantities of anything is easy, you just open the hatch to a void space and drop the stuff in, the only limit is your ability to get the stuff on and off the ship.
[Ahh, the ol' Han Solo technique.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7vjse?context=5)|""I use them for smuggling kid. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous!""
[How many Zapp Brannigan quotes were you able to use?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7mkw0?context=5)|Only one: ""She's a beautiful ship alright. Shapely. Seductive. I'm gonna Fly Her Brains Out!""
 |My favorite quotes as a captain was Steve Zissou's classic line ""Hey intern, go plug this in and make me a Latte.""  (a captain has to have his coffee!)
[What kind of crew does a ship like that need? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7m22q?context=5)|The  minimum crew required by law is only 14 people but Maersk plans on crewing her with at least 20. Shocking considering that a Nimitz class carrier holds more than 5000 people ( Ship's Company: 3,000-3,200, air wing: 1,500, other: 500) and is 67.2 meters (220 feet) shorter in length!
[How does that break down? (i.e. 3 bridge crew + 3 engineers x 3 shifts?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7metf?context=5)|Top of the food chain are the Captain (in charge of everything) and the Chief Engineer (in charge of the enige room and anything mechanical)
 |Bridge team: 3 officers (Chief mate, 2nd mate, 3rd mate) 3 lookouts (Able Bodied or Ordinary Seaman)
 |Engine team 3 officers (1st Assistant Engineer, 2nd AE, 3rd A/E) 3 oilers.
 |Steward's department (in charge of food, laundry, etc) 1 Steward (In charge of ordering food and cooks the breakfast) 1 Cook 1 Assistant.
 |3 DEU's (junior crewmembers who are pulled by any department that needs them)
[Out of curiosity, what do the stewards get paid? (I cook for a living\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7rz5l?context=5)|The non-union stewards get paid peanuts and usually have less vacation time than the rest of the crew. I don't know exact numbers but union stewards get decent pay plus can get significant amounts of overtime if the captain approves it (which he usually does if the food is good).
[Considering boat crews are often international, I'm assuming the English is the lingua Franca on these type of ships?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7tfg8?context=5)|Yes, that is correct. 
[A ship that large almost seem impractical.  How many ports are large enough to hold such a big ship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7mgp7?context=5)|Not many... She only plans on calling on 13 ports all in Asia and Europe. She won't be coming to the united states. 
[Is making a single large ship more efficient than making a number of smaller ones?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7pztl?context=5)|Yes, but that's only half the equation... It's also that transporting 18,000 containers at once is more efficient than making two 9,000 container trips.
[Does it take the same time to load/unload though on per container basis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca80ceq?context=5)|Good question but I'm not  sure of the answer.
[How is it to handle a big ship like that? How much do you have to plan everything  before, to make your ship react at the right time? How long does it take to make a full stop?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7mnd8?context=5)|Yes everything has to be very well planned. We won't know exactly how long it takes this ship to make a full ""crash astern"" stop but 15 ship lengths is fairly typical of a large ships so... 6000 meters or 20,000 feet.
 |But the ocean is wide open, so very little maneuvering is needed once the ship reaches open ocean. The difficult part is maneuvering in port but stopping distance is not much of an issue for two reasons: 1) Ships move slowly in port 2) They are escorted by powerful tugs which can stop them quickly and help them turn ""on a dime"".
[I took a cruise recently from Tampa to Grand Cayman, then Mexico and back to Tampa.  I spent a good amount of time staring over the side hoping to glimpse fish, dolphins, whales, anything.  Other than 2 flying fish, I saw nothing. Nothing at all.  Is there a trick to seeing stuff, like a certain time, or in front or behind the ship?  Ever see any cool fish or anything like that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7n9i2?context=5)|In my experience their are only two factors to seeing those things: luck and location.
 |The key is to ask the crew were are the spots they most often see marine life... then ask them what time the ship will pass those locations. If they won't tell you then you best bet is to watch during times you are in sight of (but no too close to) land.
 |My favorite are the sea turtles!  You can be over a 1000 nautical miles from the closest point of land and see a turtle slowly paddling alone. They are really slow... and it boggles my mind how (even with favorable currents) they can travel so far on their own.
[What was the most exhilarating experience you had as captain?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7ltka?context=5)|Probably the rogue wave which, luckily, I only witness first hand on one occasion. It was in 2002 and the water was dead calm and we had jsut rounded the southern tip of Africa when I caught the thing from the corner of my eye. I don't know how big it was but I was about 40 feet above the waterline on a 500 foot ship and, just before we hit it, I was looking up at the thing. Scary as hell.
 |The good news is that we only hit it due to my relative inexperience at the time and incompetence as a navigator because the location of these things is well charted, known among scientists and easily avoided... so I don't plan on running into one again. 
[Er.. the location of rogue waves are well charted???](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7miv8?context=5)|Yes they are fairly well charted on the latest versions of the charts... but it's only been in the last 10-15 years that we have known anything about them.
 |Now there are 2 basic types of Rogue Waves, those that form in the middle of giant storms and the Freak type that seem to come out of nowhere.
 |A book called The Wave by Susan Casey is a great read if you're interested in learning more.
[As much as you are allowed to discuss, what was your company's standard procedure for dealing with pirates, and did you have weapons or other ways of deterring them? Do some companies hire private security firms, like Blackwater? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7m21v?context=5)|Well the last time I sailed as Captain was 3 years ago and many ships still were not allowed to carry any weapons or hire any private security firms. Most companies still discourage the crew from bringing aboard their own weapons but do allow the use of private security firms.
[Not allowed, this is really surprising!  Considering the dollar amount of the cargo on the ships, it's shocking that security firms are not allowed.  Not allowed by whom, I wonder?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7pb5h?context=5)|I ment to say that, yes, today security teams are allowed on ships.
[So as recently as three years ago, multi-billion dollar cargo ships had less security than Disneyland?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7pb5h?context=5)|Yes, three years ago, most didn't have more than a set of handcuffs and a batton... Much less then Disney!
[Could you use the boat to ram the pirates' dinghy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7rplc?context=5)|Yes but only if the dinghy holds it's course...
[Do pirates usually have the ability to forcibly board a ship that large?  It seems like you could just ignore them and steam on.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7v4gr?context=5)|Pirates would have a very difficult time boarding a ship this big and fast.
 |Most ships that have been taken have had either a low freeboard (distance from the water to the deck) or a low top speed. 
[Im a former pirate hunter in the Gulf of Aden @ HDMS Absalon...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7xu2e?context=5)|The task force is dong an excellent job, especially in the gulf of Aden, but they have remained mostly ineffective off Somalia's east coast simply due to the fact of the ocean, and the distance these pirates are willing to travel, is so large.
[How do you guys view the efforts by the taskforce stationed in the middleeastern and asian seas, and what improvments could be made?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7xu2e?context=5)|Private security teams aboard the ships and simple precautions like straining razor wire around the gunwales is proving to be the most effective deterrent. 
[How much is the ship worth? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7n43i?context=5)|This ship is costing Maersk $190 million to build but they signed the contract before the economy tanked. Today you could commission a yard to build this ship for around $150 million.
[I'm fascinated with ships like this and how they operate.  You said in another question the minimum crew on one of these ships is at least 14, what does everyone do all day?  How much of the day is structured with actual duties and how much downtime do you get?  Are there any recreation options other than playing cards or reading?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7r53g?context=5)|The captain works 8 hours (mostly behind a desk) but is on call 24/7.
 |The rest of the crew typically work three 4 hour shifts. Two of those shifts are standing watch (on the bridge, engine room or in the kitchen).. The third shift is doing routine maintenance and inspections.
 |Lots and lots of time for card playing, reading or watching the months worth of stuff you downloaded via pirate bay.. 
[So some could call you...a pirate.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7ukou?context=5)|The MPAA certainly would ;)
[Thanks for the reply, appreciate it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7rttf?context=5)|I have found stowaways before but we caught them before we left port.
[Ever had anyone sneak onboard for a free ride?  If it happens and they are discovered what is the protocol?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7rttf?context=5)|The protocol for finding one after you leave port depends on your company policy and the laws of the port you are heading to. At a minimum you must give hem a bed and food then notify immigration prior to arriving at your destination. From there you must follow the orders of the immigration officer who will usually fine the ship and launch an investigation. 
[Do your engineers not just do day work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7yzm9?context=5)|It depends on if the ship has an automated engine room or not but, You're right, on this ship they do. 
[I think I could get used to being a captain. Many hours to read, the sea, what's not to like.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca81rrw?context=5)|That totally depends on how good your cook is and how much money the company gives him to buy groceries. Usually the food is very good but heavy (mostly comfort food).
[So making them walk the plank isn't an option?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca81sbl?context=5)|No but I hear rumors that it still happens since there is a lot you ""could"" get away with if the closest police station was 1000 miles away, you had a week to clean up the evidence and if you were floating directly above a 15,000 foot deep trash can filled with man eating sharks...
[If the ship gets fined what is the motivation to notify immigration?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca8244y?context=5)|A bigger fine and/or imprisonment if you don't notify immigration.
[What ship(s\) did you Captain? Merchant Marine? If so do you have a son and if so did you name him Nathaniel like every other Captain in the Merchant Marine? You seem a bit young for that gig.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7m7ob?context=5)|I am a bit young for the gig but there has been a massive shortage of qualified mariners int he last 5-10 years as the economies of china and india have expanded. When I first joined it was rare to find a captain under the age of 45... today many are in their early 30's.
 |Nathaniel is a strong name but my wife vetoed anything too nautical so we named him Jack.
[Is this the biggest machine a single man can ""drive""? How does it feel to be behind the wheels?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7n4mf?context=5)|Sure is... unless you find a time machine that can travel a long time ago to a galaxy far away.
 |It feels awesome, like having a super power, the only downer is that the ship's wheel is rather small and puny. 
[Is most of the driving done by computer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca82j8r?context=5)|Yes, the ship has autopilot which is controlled by an ""integrated bridge system"" (a windows based computer)
[I've been a long time follower of your site, and I'm glad to see you doing something like this.  My question is: when do you think the other carriers will debut ships of equal size?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7p0tk?context=5)|Jus last month China Shipping put in an order for five ships of this size and e others are likely to follow. The only thing that's holding them back is the fact that shipping rates are currently at a historic low... but this will change as (let's hope!)  the economy continues to improve.
[With more ships of this size being built and only ever increasing cargo shipping, do you think the Suez and Panama canals will be widened to accommodate the extra width?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7p602?context=5)|The Panama Canal is, right now, being widened.. But it still won't be large enough to accept a ship of this size.  The Suez Canal, however, is already plenty wide (and deep!) enough for this ship.
[Have you seen the Great Pacific Garbage Patch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7p602?context=5)|No... Most of my time has been in the Atlantic and Indian oceans but I have seen plenty of trash. It's still rare to see a large patch of it but is certainly depressing when you do!
[Any close calls with pirates?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7mafa?context=5)|Their are two basic types of pirates... those who steal stuff and run (found around the world but most prevalent in the Strait of Malacca). These ones typically only steal stuff you have left exposed on deck  (they love brass firehose fittings and thick hawsers).
 |The other, more dangerous, type of pirate are those in Somalia who take over and ransom the entire ship.
 |Personally I have seen a few of the former pirates but none of the latter but I have friends who've seen both. The closest I've come to the dangerous type of pirates was as a blogger... I called the bridge of the Maersk Alabama (via skype!) to verify the story of her capture before it broke in the news.
[How would a pirate board a ship as tall as yours? Sorry if this is a dumb question. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7xshc?context=5)|Grappling hooks and rope ladders but the pirates prefer to board slower ships with lower freeboard (the distance deform the water to the ship's deck)
[Do you guys use scooters to get around the ship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7mc9q?context=5)|No but scooters are the preferred method of transport in most of the large shipyards where the ships are built. On ships larger than 1000; feet you will often find a couple of bicycles on deck for getting to/from the bow.
[As a captain, how much of your time awake is actually spent doing something ship related? I can't imagine there being too much needing to be taken care of if you're on a month long run from Asia to Europe.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7ouqm?context=5)|A decade ago you would be correct, there isn't too much that needs to get done during a month long run but, the invention of satellite Internet means that today's captain has access to the Internet, Skype and email. While this sounds good (and mostly it is) it also comes with the problem of micromanagement... The shoreside managers love to fill any free time with paperwork. So, in short, today's captain stays rather busy.
[How did you get your start? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7n62f?context=5)|I went to SUNY Maritime College in the bronx... a state university that gives you a college degree and a license to drive really big ships. 
[Seriously, can the chef legally kill pirates if the ship is attacked? A 30% raise and a reasonable risk to my life would be interesting, if not awesome.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7yuj0?context=5)|Yes you can certainly defend yourself if they attack... but, depending on the company policy and the laws of the flag state, you may have to use your kitchen knives to do it.
[What goes through an average captain's mind in really rough seas?  Is it like, ""I'm a badass captain, and if I keep my cool, I've got this,"" or ""Oh shit, I really hope I make it out of this one?""  Videos like this are what prompt my question: Link to www.youtube.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7se2w?context=5)|Well, you have to instill confidence in the crew so outwardly you say ""I'm a badass captain, and if I keep my cool, I've got this,"" But, as long as everything's well secured and there are no signs of structural failure, then all that's really going through your mind is ""F me, I wish I was home surfing Reddit!"".
[Ever played hide and seek with the crew???](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7r5o9?context=5)|No but I played ""hide from my boss"" plenty of times when I first started out ;)
[As someone from a family of shipbuilders, I can indeed confirm that you have a very impressive boat. :\)  I also have friends who operate on ships like these in the South Pacific. They have plenty of great tales. Who knows, maybe I'll end up on one one of these days.  So yeah, question time: what's the fastest the boat can go when fully loaded? And how long does a round trip take? Say from Singapore to Rotterdam?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7sxw2?context=5)|Her top speed is 23knots (26 mph) but Maersk plans on sailing her at 20. The first voyage will begin in Shanghai, and she will sail from China to Spain in 20 days... so round trip would be 40 plus 3 days to offload her.
[How much does a ship that big Bend and twist, on a calm day also stormy day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7uul5?context=5)|Ships are solid in calm weather but you can often feel vibrations from the engine room (even if it's on the other end of the ship).
 |They bend a lot in heavy weather. The first major storm I was in was aboard a 1000 foot tanker and I watched as the bow twisted one way, and the stern twisted another, as she hit a wave. I called the captain up to the bridge and he said ""Twisting's a good thing, it means that the steel isn't brittle. But if she stops twisting then grab a lifejacket and run to the lifeboat.""
[This is completely off topic. If the world entered into a war on the scale of WWI and WWII, do you think it would still be effective to employ the convoy tactics of prior wars or what strategies would merchant navies have to adopt?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7pwva?context=5)|Good question and, to be honest, I don't know the answer because most of us commercial mariners are civilian and the navy admirals don't like sharing classified information (or war studies) with us.
 |But if I had to guess I would think that convoys would be dangerous because a large mass of ships is easier to spot on satellite images and easier to pick up on a submarine's sonar. 
[I know that some cargo ships rent out cabins to paying passengers. Have you had any experience traveling with passengers? What's it like having a passenger on a working ship? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7u939?context=5)|No, I haven't been on a ship that accepts passengers and this ship, the Maersk Triple-e, doesn't have any accommodations for passengers but... the second largest containership does!
 |From the CMA website: ""The CMA CGM MARCO POLO includes 5 double modern cabins of 20m2 each, a lounge with TV equipment, a library, a fitness room and even a swimming pool.""
 |You won't be traveling in luxury but I'd still highly recommend it... booking passage on the Marco Polo would be an experience that you'd never forget.

But my website, gCaptain, does have a sailor on staff. His name is rob and his contact info is in the ""Team"" section of the site (lineked to in the footer).
 |I will say that you are a braver man than I am Gunga Din! The worst storm I've seen was when I navigated a 1000 foot oil taker from valdez alaska... and I wished I was on a larger boat! I don't know how the guys from the Deadliest Catch do it.
[I've heard the value of the cargo a ship like that can hold is in the billions, true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7qi3v?context=5)|I am not sure of the exact figures and Maersk wouldn't tell me (much of the information about what is in the containers is kept secret by Maersk for the privacy of their customers) but they did say that, if a Triple-e class ship with 18,000 containers were lost, then it would be the largest marine insurance claim ever.
[Can I take her for a spin?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7my7w?context=5)|Sure but you'll have to get on line after me... unfortunately Maersk didn't offer me the Captain's job during the tour and, after they read this, it's unlikely that they will ;)
[This is probably a rookie question but what are the economics of a ship this sized being nuclear powered? Short term I assume it would be a bit more expensive but wouldn't it be cheaper in the long term?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7x1g9?context=5)|Yes, the economics work out in the long run but construction and decommissioning are both very expensive. Then you have unexpected problems like labor disputes (what i the proper pay considering the danger) and port calls (some countries, like New Zeeland, ban all nuclear ship).
 |But if you want to learn more about this, I suggest you pic up a book about the ""n/s savannah"", the only nuclear powered commercial ship ever built in the US.
[You quit being a sea captain to be a blogger?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7y6qa?context=5)|I launched my blog, gCaptain.com, while I was still working at sea and for the frist three years I did both jobs. Then the BP Oil Spill happened and I signed a deal with Harper Collins to write the book on that tragic event. By that time the blog was doing very well and, combined with the book advance, I was able to quit my ""day job"" as captain.  Today, 6 years after the blog was launched, my salary is still below what I was making as a captain but I love to write, especially about ships, and enjoy being home every day for my kids.
[How long are you out at sea for a typical run? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7n3ut?context=5)|I'm not sure of Maersk's policy but American sailors (and most sailors from the western world) typically work 3 or 4 months per ""hitch"" then have the same amount of vacation time (3/4 months). But most of the ships are run by Russians, Filipino's and Chinese sailors who typically work 6-9 months per hitch.

(bulk carrier\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7opl6?context=5)|My best advice is to work on many different types of ships during the first few years of your career. Too many people get pigeoned holed on one type of vessel and get bored after decades at sea... it's better (and easier) to discover what type of ship fits you best before you get stuck in one career track.

[On the environmental and running costs on these behemoths: they're costing upwards $150 million, why not deck them out with solar panels that would cover the topmost layer of containers?

This sounds simple to do but on a vessel this size, the panels would be massive and difficult to move.

So I'm a rising sophomore looking to study MatSci next year, and I made a huge mistake this summer. I was planning on working full time over the summer at my school's climbing facility while I take a class in the mornings. Unfortunately, between a mix of a ridiculous amount of new hires (to fill students who left for the summer) and some budget cuts, my hours are way less than I expected.

As a result of this, I completely missed out on applying to be a research assistant (I've already gotten in touch with all my prof's), my morning class and lack of car keeps me from getting an internship (if I don't take this class now I fall a year behind), and now a lot of the small shops around campus have already made their summer schedules and aren't really hiring.  

I'm determined to get something out of this summer, and I feel like teaching myself a language like Python or something along those lines would be a great resume booster. I've already taken an intro C++ class, and I've had experience with MATLAB, but I wonder if there are any additional (free) resources out there for those 2, or if anyone knows any good resources or languages to check out? My school has a ton of free online books available to students, so chances are if anyone recommends a book I can get access to it. "

The majority of stuff I have left are math classes. The problem is that the logistics of getting to the math classes is a pain. The campus I attend only has a few of the classes and I'd need to put in about a 90+ min commute to get to the other campus to take the math classes throughout fall (maybe summer) and probably next spring to graduate.

I liked the early math classes (calc, stats) stuff I've taken already and really want to do this but I'm worried that 12 months of this kind of commute will just kill me and really make it hard to take an internship on the side if I'm commuting so much to class.

I'm not sure exactly what I want to do with the degree, consulting, actuary, real estate are a few of the things I'm thinking of.

I'm really interested in being smart at Math. I love tech (I've taken coding and data classes on the side at Coursera and other places), and just think that it's a thing I'd like to know. I'm not sure exactly how it would make me a better canidate for a job, but I'm afraid that economics alone isn't enough.

The ""real"" jobs are very difficult to get unless you have years of expertise in their special topic, no matter how much education you have. Everything else is part-time or contractor work. And the job listings are soul-crushing.

More often than finding a position I'd like to apply for, I find myself wanting to send angry e-mails to job listers chastising them for their impudence. They want a bachelor's degree and want you to know every style available and only want to pay you $10 an hour (if they're even willing to pay). Or better yet, they want to pay you $10/hour to write four or five 500-word articles a day to fulfill their content-mill needs. If you could even accomplish that, the quality would be so low and the burn-out so high that no one would last more than two weeks. 

At some point, it seems that ""writer"" became synonymous with ""personal assistant"" and ""graphic designer."" It's this uncomfortable catch-all for which no one actually wants to pay. You should be an expert at data-entry, customer service, blogging, social media, PR, articles, reports, graphic design, advertising, SEO, web design, programming, travel arrangements, and finances (oh- and if it's a home office for a small business, expect to walk the dog and pick up groceries). You'll get bumped up to $11-12 an hour if you're really good. If it's part-time, you must be absolutely loyal and work ridiculous hours that make it impossible to hold down multiple jobs. If it's full-time, you should be willing to ""pay your dues"" for a few years and be grateful for your intern wage after a 40-minute commute.

Don't forget that research and ""thinking"" are frowned upon as wasting time. They only want to pay for the finished product.

The easy solution is to just not apply for these jobs. But I know that someone else is just desperate enough to put themselves through it, and I feel defensive on their behalf. These employers have no idea what they want or how much they're squandering what they find. With any luck, they're only able to hire people who don't care.

End rant.

TL;DR  Job searches are frustrating. Low demand, high chance of being taken advantage of. No one cares. Stop whining."

I've already got two monitors and other peripherals so all I need is the tower. As far as I can tell, everything will fit together in the case. Any suggestions? I'm pretty dead set on this but if there's something crucial that needs to be changed let me know. I want to get the PSU before 6/3 while it's still on sale."

She asked me to keep in touch and that if I was open to internships - I told her yes.

How should I keep in touch with the team I interviewed with? Ideally, I'd like to email them maybe once every month or two, and ask if I could add them on LinkedIn. I'm just not sure what the emails should say when I touch base with them."

I graduated a year ago and have since been dragging my feet through college in the medical field because my mom was so adamant in me being a nurse she's asian and is a nurse herself. I just have been spending the whole year searching my soul not knowing what to do. I had a rough 4 years in high school and just fucked around with my classes. My family had a struggling business and I had to put in alot of work into and we just had to close it down about 4 months ago. Now after being pressured for so long and just feeling worthless in general and watching people and peers from high school I know I am way smarter than just pass me by as sit in slow motion not doing anything with my life. I think I have found what I want to do. I want to work in the video game industry and be a developer of some sorts. I always see people complain about games and not do anything about it I want to actually go out there make games and be a diffrence maker in the industry. I enjoy games and have felt like I would love to work in the industry. This is something I want to put the time and effort into. I am not super gifted like alot of people who made flash games I can't do any of that but am willing to learn. Finnaly I feel like I am sure at what I want to do with my life. I also would loved to get flamed on twitter when I make a god awful game hah. I know this sounds like I am crying but I am fully aware that most of this is my fault. But I would love to hear from you guys some general tips and where to start at to be a game developer and what classes to start with. If there are any internships that will teach me how to do any of those things. I live in seattle there are many game studios here. 343, bungie, valve, and microsoft, nintendo. Any suggestions would help guys. Thank you for your time and remember the person who says they cant and you can if usually right.

1f7iz6,0,2013-05-28,"2 and a half years later, I [23/m] still love her(21/f)...",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1f7iz6/2_and_a_half_years_later_i_23m_still_love_her21f/,"Alright relationship gurus. I'm warning you now, this is going to be a long one. I'm going to have to do a good background in order to make the current advice question make perfect sense.

I'll start at my junior year of high school: There's a girl in my pre-calculus class with blue hair and the most adorable smile I've ever seen in my life. For privacy sake, we'll call her... Kat. I rarely get a chance to talk to Kat, not out of nervousness, I'm not a shy person, never have been, there just isn't enough time in the day while in school, but I do make conversation every once in a while and we seem to get along. One day, a mutual friend (Vicky) brings Kat into the room that my friends and I hang around in before and after school to say hi to everyone. It begins.
Kat is in an ending relationship, she's not happy and comes to me one day for a shoulder to cry on. Of course I oblige, though I know it's not my place to give advice or whatever so I keep my mouth shut. Fast forward a couple of weeks and she's single, so I ask her on a date. She agrees and things go very well, from here on out, we are inseparable. When I say inseparable, I mean my sheer definition of perfect. This girl is everything I could ever ask for out of a girl and more, I have never known happiness like this in my life (even to this day). Our relation ship goes on like this for a year, we do not fight or argue a single time. We have a few short talks of engagement, and other lovey dovey ""we'll be together forever"" stuff. 

We hit late spring of 2008, the end of my senior year of high school and her junior year. Her father (who we are both extremely close to) is diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and passes away. Here begins all of the problems. Of course she is absolutely distraught, and I am too, but she looks to me to be her rock so I do my best to be what she needs. The problem is she begins to look at me as a replacement for her father, often making excuses for things like ""daddy would have done it with me"". I cannot be a replacement for a father, and begin to get slightly frustrated. By September/October of 2008, things are shaky, but we seem stable. I'm holding on knowing that daddy issues aren't going to be something that just goes away over the course of a couple of months. I'm still in love with her and always do my best to be everything she needs from me. She gets a job at a supermarket and things get weird. She begins to vocalize her suspicions of me cheating.... which are completely wrong and have absolutely no evidence or support. 

January of 2009: one of her co-workers messages me on Facebook out of the blue, saying that he's glad that Kat and I are ""back together again"" and he hopes there's no hard feelings. Now, this was a shock to me, as I was not aware the Kat and I were ever not together. We have a long conversation and both find out to our dismay that she's been playing both sides. She told him that she had broken up with me for him, and told me that he was just a friend from work. This had been going on for a month and a half. I call her, give her once chance to confess, which she doesn't, and break up with her. We are apart for until the end of July the same year.

Late July 2009: She gets back from a mission trip type thing to Costa Rica and asks me to meet in a park. She wants to talk. I agree (why I don't know). I realize I miss her and we get back together. Things are good for a while. I'm still in community college in the same town, and she's about to move to a university, a two hour drive away. Not too bad I think, we can visit often, it's not far. At this point I'm still blindly in love with her. We work with the long distance for a while. Here's where dates and things get muddy. 

Sometime during winter of 2009: Our relationship starts going sour for multiple reasons. Being away from each other and I still haven't completely forgiven her for cheating the previous year. Things happen and we both end up cheating. I have a one night stand with a co-worker after she gets snowed in at my apartment and we both get drunk. She goes on to have another similar second relationship for a month or two, except this time the guy is completely aware of her being with me. I find out about it and flip my shit. 

Skip forward to September 2010: I move to the same university as her (believe it or not, she had absolutely nothing to do with my decision of that school, it was one of 3 in the state that offered my Major and happened to be the cheapest and closest to home. We're still together at this point, but our relationship is hollow and broken. Neither one of us is happy, neither one of us trusts the other, we're together simply out of jealous lust and an obsession with something that no longer exists. Even though we live only a mile and a half from one another, we never get to see each other. She's an RA on her dorm, and I work 35 hours a week at a restaurant plus school. We spend Christmas back in our home town, and the day after Christmas day she suggests we break up. I'm tired of the relationship and so I agree. We part ways 2 days later. I try my best to get over her by not talking to her, finding other girls to sleep with and generally just trying to push her out of my mind. None of it is working. 

April 2010: She drops out of university. I find out and am upset, but try to laugh it off like I don't care. At this point she's in a relationship with another guy again. I focus all of my energy on school and work as much as I can. Come summer time, I have an internship at a factory for some extra cash and random job experience back in our home town. She calls me one day, our conversation isn't exactly nice, and she ends our talk with this, and this is an exact quote. ""I'm going to go now, but I hope you can be happy for me, I'm going to be engaged soon"". This slams me harder than I've ever felt anything before in my life. I am broken. I have no idea what to do, what to say to anyone or how to go about my life. I spent the next 5 months in a deep depression, finally deciding that the only way to get over her was to hate her. When ever she tried to talk to me from here on our, I swore at her, told her I hate her, and that I never want to talk to her again. She says that she's sorry things worked out this way, but I'll hear nothing of it. She finally gives up. 

I'm going to skip straight ahead to this past weekend now, present time. Her engagement failed early this year and they are no longer together. I have since graduated from university and got a really good career going in another city which just happens to be only 2 hours in the other direction from our home town. I tried to have a relationship with someone else a couple of months ago for the first time since Kat and I broke up, but it was unfulfilled and I broke it off. I have gone 2 and a half years now trying every method I can think of to get over her, and nothing has worked. A friend told me to talk to her over facebook and maybe I'll get some kind of closure. I decided to try it, and she found out that I was going to be in town for the weekend to visit my parents and some other friends. She asked if I would meet her for dinner, to which I said that I was unsure about, but eventually I agreed. 

Saturday: We went to dinner at 7:30, as soon as she pulled up in her car my heart stopped. We spent a good 2 hours at the restaurant talking a lot. We went for a drive up the blue ridge parkway to one of our old favorite spots and ended up sitting in the car and talking in the car until 3am. During the time in the car talking, we held hands almost the whole time, I cried for the first time in 3 years when I told her about how it felt to hear about her getting engaged, we hugged (kinda cuddled a bit I guess) and kissed a few times. It's obvious we haven't got over each other at all. I miss her so much. She has been through some pretty serious shit the last year or so, she got raped, found god and religion and some other stuff too. But most of all, she's grown up and I can tell that she's actually had some life experience now, as opposed to a few years ago. She seems to have dealt with her daddy issues and I honestly believe that she is back to the girl that I remember. The things we shared before were all there in those 12 or so hours that we spent together this weekend. 

Sunday: She asks me when I'm leaving to go home, I say later tonight. She wanted to see me again before I did so I took her to the movies and for dinner again. Once again, we held hands the whole time, did some cuddles and kisses. Her current situation is where some HUGE problems arise. She's going to college there in town for at least another year, as well as working in a store full time. In the last couple months she's signed a lease for the next year with her new best friend, who happens to be in love with her. She tells me that she cares about him, but that she doesn't love him.
So now we're in a strange situation. We have both confessed we miss each other tremendously, and still are in love. I'm uneasy about her living with him, and she's uneasy about telling him that it's going no where because she's with me for the possible awkwardness between them and the distance between us again. 

Reddit... I've never asked for relationship advice before, especially not from the internet. But what should I do. I'm STILL desperately in love with this girl, but our situation seems impossible. I'm lost. 

TL;DR

The love of my life and I broke each others hearts 2 and a half years ago. Met up again this weekend and it's all come flooding back, but in a crazy impossible situation. What on earth should I do. 
I know this thing is a freaking book, but I wouldn't have taken the time to write it all out and put 5 years of my life on the internet if I wasn't in some real trouble here. Please help"

You used to be a good reason to get up in the morning.
You used to be my first true love.
You used to be my biggest source of happiness.

But now look at you. To me, you aren't worth a fucking penny.

You left me almost 7 months ago now. I'm sure you thought I would break down and become a complete wreck. For your information, I DID break down and become a complete wreck, but this time around it was different. I picked up all the valuable pieces left after that destruction of our relationship and I fucking rebuilt. You know what I did in that 7 month time frame, you fucking bitch. 

I got my way into two different internships that could potentially lead to careers. Let alone they leave me with phenomenal recommendations. I am on the verge of getting promoted at work. I am finishing up school. 

One of the biggest accomplishments is that you HATED having sex with me because I was so fucking fat. Well, guess what. I've lost almost 60lbs of that fat you hated so much and ON top of that I am finally on the road to get that athletic body I've always wanted INCLUDING THAT SIX PACK YOU SAID I COULD NEVER GET.

But above all else, I am a fucking happy man. I have never been SO happy in my life, and I hope you and your douchebag of a boyfriend enjoy your mediocre lives together because I WILL GO FAR.

You always knew I was smart and capable. 
I am going to go places.
I am going to accomplish my dreams. 
I am going to help people to the best of my ability be better people. 
I am going to go on and travel. 
I am going to see the world. I am most importantly going to find somebody who doesn't hold me down like you. 
I am going to find somebody that will increase my happiness, productivity, lifestyle, and world. 


I am going to be alright without you.

You know what you are now?

You are a pitiful excuse for a lady.
You are a hindrance to yourself and everyone around you.
You are a stupid decision maker.




You are nothing to me now."
1f79ch,23,2013-05-28,I've been outed! Need advice on how to handle a complicated family situation. This is long :P,[deleted],exmuslim,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1f79ch/ive_been_outed_need_advice_on_how_to_handle_a/,"**TL;DR** I'm supposed to give a talk in Sydney about atheism in Malaysia. My whole extended family back in Malaysia now knows about it and about my atheism. My parents are probably furious and will want me, among other things, not to give the talk. They may even force me to return to Malaysia permanently by refusing to pay for my studies. What do I do????  
  



So, further to my post on [bringing shame to my family](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1f69jb/have_you_brought_shame_on_your_family_lately/), there have been some new developments and I need some considered advice on how to handle the situation.

**A bit of background:** I am 31, female, from a muslim family and a muslim country (Malaysia). I've been an atheist for over 10 years. *My parents have known about my lack of belief in god for about 1.5-2 years.* My parents used to be your typical 'relaxed' muslims (fast during ramadan, avoid pork and alcohol, but do not read the quran or pray). However, the past 7 years or so have seen a dramatic 'islamisation' of their way of life, for various reasons. Then 3 years ago, when my paternal grandmother died, their islamism reached new heights. They've been working hard to 'set me straight' but I keep telling them that, whatever i do or don't believe, I am still a good person with principles and integrity and I don't want our relationship to be ruined by constant friction. 


**One year ago**: Last year I decided I could not stand to live in a muslim country anymore and wanted to move away permanently. I informed my parents of this and they, of course, freaked out for various reasons. After a massive quarrel or epic proportions, I came to Sydney, Australia for 3 months on a tourist visa, using my own savings from 5 years of work, hoping to find a full-time job with an employer that would sponsor a working visa for me for at least 3-4 years. However, my job hunt was not successful because employers in Australia generally prefer to hire people who already have visas or permanent residency.


**6 months ago**: I decided that I couldn't give up and applied to take up a Masters course at a university in Sydney. My plan was to network and do internships or part time jobs while I studied so that I could prove myself to potential employers who would then have a more solid reason to hire me and sponsor my visa to stay on in Sydney. I was prepared to use up what was left of my meager savings (Sydney is a m&amp;$^#*#@$g expensive place) to pay for the first semester of tuition and then work my ass off in part time jobs to pay the rest of the tuition fee and cover my living expenses. However, my father took pity on me and offered to pay for my tuition and even cover some of my living expenses. I was incredibly grateful and accepted his offer, with the idea that I would pay him back once I started working full time in Sydney (IF i ever did).

**Present day**: A few weeks back I received an invitation from the Sydney Atheist Society to give a small, 15-minute talk about what life is like for atheists in Malaysia. I accepted. In ways which I shall not go into here, my cousins found out about this. Prior to this, my cousins were NOT aware that I am an atheist and have been for the past 10 years. 

This morning, I received a long, angry, incoherent message from a 20-something male cousin of mine telling me off about bringing shame to the family, etc. I replied politely and firmly, basically telling him to sod off in the nicest way possible.

This evening, I received a text message from my mother saying that my father 'wants to have a talk' with me. No doubt my cousins and aunties and uncles have contacted my parents about my evil ways (of which my parents were already aware anyway) and now my parents are forced to take action against me for the sake of saving face with the family.

You can imagine that I'm not quite sure what to do. Abandon the idea of giving the talk out of respect to my father's wishes (he is, after all, paying for me to be here studying in Sydney)? Maybe. But then what will that accomplish? I would still be a decade-long atheist. 

I could try to be open with my parents about the talk (the talk is not about bashing islam, but is about the social and political structures which affect the daily lives of atheists in Malaysia), but at this stage, with his 'public shaming' among the family for having a sinful atheist daughter, he probably won't listen.

And what if he refuses to fund my education any further? I'd have to start selling my body if I wanted to raise the funds to finish my Masters degree.

Also, I swear I will frikkin kill my bullshit meddling cousins. I would like suggestions on how to go about this. This is very important to me.

Thank you very much.

Its good because they can be healed by medivacs making them very good to mix into Bio centric comps such as MMM and bio-mine.

But it has some bad points about it aswell.

Because they can be healed, hellbat drops are extremely strong and potent.

Because they are biological, Archons do more damage to them, which intern is a nerf to mech play.

There is seemly more negative side effects from making hellbats biological, and the only postive is for Bio based plays.

1f6k7s,7,2013-05-28,Dumped yesterday by the first girl I've ever loved,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1f6k7s/dumped_yesterday_by_the_first_girl_ive_ever_loved/,"I [21m] was just blindsided by my (now ex) girlfriend [21f]. We had been dating for 1.5 years and I thought everything was perfect. We lived about an hour away from each other, but we would alternate making the trip every single weekend to see each other. We talked about how we ""knew"" that we had found ""the one"" with each other. I was her first time. Both of our lives were going great, I had an internship set up and she had been accepted to med school, all in the same city.

This summer was supposed to be our first time living in the same city while dating.
Then the past few weeks she had been avoiding me, saying she was busy with all of her friends who were graduating. She's been super sick, and had such a bad cough that she dislocated a rib. I figured she needed some time to rest.

Yesterday, she finally asked if I had a few minutes to see her. At least I had some sort of hint it was coming. We drove to a park. She started crying before she said a word. She told me she thinks we should break up. She told me that it didn't feel right. I have no idea what that means and I just keep wondering what I did wrong.

This is the worst feeling I've ever had in my life. It's been over 24 hours now since she broke up with me, and I haven't eaten, haven't been able to sleep. I keep telling myself that she just hasn't been feeling well, that she doesn't know what she was doing. Maybe she just wants to meet a doctor at med school instead. I guess it doesn't really matter now.
I was supposed to get to see her every day this summer. She was moving in 5 minutes away from where I'm living. Now I won't see her at all. It's taken all of my will power to not text her and ask if there's someone else. I don't think I could handle it if she said yes anyways.
And I can't even be mad at her. She's always been honest with me, any time we had an argument we were always respectful of each other and never said anything we'd regret or use mean words. I just want to be mad at her but I can't, I'm just so fucking sad. 

As if I wasn't tormented enough, at the end of it she said ""Maybe we can see where we're at at the end of the summer."" What the hell does that mean? If she's done with me, I need to stay completely clear of her to begin the healing process. But if there's any hope then I would do anything. 

She starts med school tomorrow and knowing that I won't be able to ask her how her first day went makes me sick. 



EDIT 6/2/13: I've decided to add an update to this post at the end of each week, until I feel like I don't need it anymore. My phase of not being able to eat or sleep only lasted two days, and my appetite has slowly been returning ever since. I started lifting again for the first time in two years which I think has helped a lot with both my physical and mental health. 

It feels like there's no rhyme or reason to how I feel each day. Some days I feel fine, and am thankful to be busy at work which keeps me distracted. Some days I won't be able to get anything done because all I do is think about what I would say if I saw her and just feel too sad to do anything. I was able to go out with my friends the past two nights. I'd be lost if I didn't have some of the most supportive friends I could ask for. They've been trying to get me to talk to new girls at the bars, but it honestly just feels like I'm being disloyal to my ex. Which I know doesn't make any sense, I was dumped, but I can't help it.

On Wednesday, I stumbled on the Christmas card she wrote me from last year. I shouldn't have read it, but I did. I think that may have been the lowest point I've hit since this whole thing happened. We were both so happy. In her card, she thanked me for being so supportive of her while she was applying to med school. She said she wouldn't have been able to do it without me. Now that she's in, it feels like I just wasn't needed anymore. She wants to start a new phase of her life and doesn't want me to be a part of it. 

Tomorrow night, one of my best friends and roommate is having a shared 21st birthday party with one of my ex's best friends. I'm terrified of seeing her there. Sometimes I get excited at  thinking about getting to talk to her. Then I feel like I shouldn't say anything at all. I've been successful at no contact so far but I don't know what's going to happen if she's there tomorrow. All I know is that I'm not going to miss my friend's 21st because of her. "
1f6c4o,1,2013-05-27,It's the end of the school year and I've set myself up for failure.,thrownaway0-,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1f6c4o/its_the_end_of_the_school_year_and_ive_set_myself/,"I'm 16, a rising senior in high school, and as the school year comes to a close the downward spiral I've gotten caught in is starting to really get to me. This is pretty much the end and there's nothing I can do about it. I've been fully aware of my descent into a state that I never would have expected I'd find myself in. 

From an outside perspective, I would be tempted to say that it's just the stress of final exams that's getting to me and making me react this melodramatically. But it's not. I truly have let myself become become lazy, avoidant, and defeatist, and it makes me incredibly ashamed of myself because there's no excuse.

So, let's see... 
Despite some struggles, I've always been able to maintain good grades, i.e., an A/B average. I have two Fs and two low Cs this quarter and and they're not exactly on track to improve in the next week and a half. Last quarter I was doing comparatively better but not phenomenally. 

I have a final essay due in under two hours that I haven't started on. I have a project due tomorrow that I have no more than glanced at.
I have a different (group) project due tomorrow that I haven't contributed to yet, and my group members have been reminding me of it all weekend. I haven't responded. 

I'm not entirely confident that I will complete any of the three tonight.

The thing is, this isn't new. I have allowed myself to neglect studying for an in-class assessment or skip out on turning in an assignment multiple times in the past weeks, which isn't characteristic of me at all. 
I have so much less motivation to do these things but I still feel just as guilty about it. 

After sticking with a group of friends that I connect with for way too long because I didn't have the confidence or know-how to find anyone else, but finally I broke away from them (naïvely believing I'd be able to find someone else.. nope). That was a while ago, and I've noticed that as I inconspicuously drew away, I became increasingly apathetic. Now they decide to include me in this summer trip they're taking right after school ends and I accept their offer because even though it's going to be awkward due to the fact that I'm no longer a part of their social group, I have nothing else to do. Maybe I'll learn something from it.

It really bothers me that I can't make friends. 

I deleted my Facebook. I sit alone at lunch. I've established myself as an absolute nobody. I waste the majority of my time worrying about stuff but never doing anything about it. I don't have a good relationship with my parents - they ask what's wrong with me and leave it at that. I won't venture any further into my past because by this point I'm sure you're tired of reading this. 

May I touch upon one more topic before we're through? 

I'm so worried about this summer. To preface this, another mannerism I've developed is the tendency to let things accumulate, like books I want to read and movies and music and ideas for my art and thoughts I want to expand upon in writing and and subjects I want to learn about and places I want to explore. My OneTab Google Chrome extension is a pretty accurate metaphor for what happens after the initial discovery and decision to pursue something at a later date: 133 other pages waiting for me, and there's very little chance that I'll do anything about any of them. 
I've passed up [all of the] countless opportunities to apply for an internship or some sort of work over the summer that would provide some degree of additional help getting into college that I'll so desperately need. I let them accumulate and told myself I'd look at them later and it's way too late now. I have something in mind that I'm already passionate about but I don't deserve to be a part of something so important. Regardless, it's too late. 

I could have gotten into governor's school, for example, but it's too late. 

I now do terrible, self-destructive things like habitually overeat and pick at my face everyday in a vain attempt to 'deal' with my acne which probably wouldn't even exist if it weren't for this disgusting development of mine. 

I don't want to turn seventeen, ever. I don't want to bother anyone around me by expressing all of this. Nothing is acceptable about what I'm letting myself do, especially because I've convinced myself that I'm capable of much better, but here I am. And finally, I'm willing to pay you five dollars in exchange for a hug. Mostly serious.

Sorry about the novel. 

**TL;DR**, For some reason I've consciously allowed myself to become a useless human being and the internalization that this is going to affect me in the future is hitting me hard. Feeling sorry for myself is stupid and makes me feel even worse but I don't know what else to do at this point. "

I was raised my a single Mom and my grandma came to another country to raise me.

I got a liberal arts degree and I have to pay $200/mo in debt for the next 5 years. I am unemployed at the moment. I didn't like my major and didn't have many internships, got a job out of school for online marketing and was fired. 

I'm sitting here regretting the last 5 years of my life. My friends are on track for grad school in their fields and I am looking at moving back home next month. My Mom says she doesn't really care that much about what I do anymore. She makes about $58k a year and she has to pay off her house and she's working in a career she hates. 

My grandma is going crazy because she left her home country to be with me where she doesn't have a support network. She was just in a hospital 2 days ago. 

I feel like a monster. I have disappointed my family and I'm not seeing a way out. 

Did I fuck up my entire life? 

EDIT: I am the only child and my single mother's been raising me for half my life. She is an immigrant and I came to this country when I was 10. In a way I feel she is justified in how she feels about me. If I don't have her I don't know who I would have to turn to. "

I'll just give you a brief intro so that you know what you're dealing with.  I'm a 22 year old guy, english is my third language pardon me if I can't express myself sometimes -- i'm a complete beginner to the whole tech side of computers.  Even though all i've been doing the past 10 years is gaming on the PC, whenever I had technical trouble with like bluescreens or viruses/malware that kind of thing(when I was younger) my brother fixed it for me.  He works at a PC repair shop(also selling pc's and accessories and that) since like a decade and had always been there for me when I was having problems with my computer, upgrading and stuff too, so I really never felt the need to educate myself on the topic or try something myself. After I finally finished highschool back when I was 18, which was a horrible time since I was very antisocial because I had been going through an extremely rough time at home(my grandparents and dad died in the same year).  I had absolutely no motivation to carry on with studying, unlike everybody else who was very hyped to go to university or work.  I dabbled around in law school for a year, then I spent a year at home, then I tried tourism studies, nothing was really for me.  I was/am very lazy and would make up excuses to just sit here at the PC so that I can play games or watch movies.  Now at 22, I finally decided to get my act together and go look for a job, without luck(bad situation in my country).  Then today, my brother came back from work with a very happy expression on his face -- I could get an internship at his work for 3 months (he's not just a bottom employee, above him is only one more boss).  My brother and I never really connected much and we hardly ever spoke despite him living in the same house all this time (he's 40 now, suffering from periods of depression), yet this was really great news.  

Now finally to my question, do you think it's possible for me to learn sufficient information about the whole PC tech world in 2 weeks so that I don't make a complete fool of myself when I start my internship there? I'm quite clumsy and awkward at times so it'll be weird anyway but i'd absolutely LOVE to atleast have a little basic knowledge on this subject beforehand.  I just wanted to ask here first before I start googling books etc. because I don't want to end up with outdated information or beginning at the wrong place etc. Basically i'd really like to learn the basics of how to build a PC, i've been looking at videos such as these from thenewboston http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7uBoOA11Pw&amp;fmt=18, and considered downloading one of those ""for dummies"" books about building computers.

Could somebody please help me out? Where should I start and how? What are the most important things I need to learn properly? It would mean the world to me, I feel like I can finally turn my life around and do something. "

I am a software engineer for my primary business but I am also starting a project on the side. I am looking for interns who want to learn programming or bring their programming skills to the next level this summer. The assignments I can provide can have a wide range in difficulty so this posting applies to anyone who has completed at least freshman year in computer science.

**What you can learn**

* C# / ASP.NET MVC
* Javascript
* AngularJS
* MongoDb
* Neo4j
* Solr
* Twitter Bootstrap UI Framework
* Git / Github

The internship is, however, unpaid. But I have laid out a plan to be in accordance with all points on the sidebar.

* Work from home / remotely
* Work as many or as little hours as you choose. This is your own education after all.
* We will have regular, live Skype code reviews and training sessions
* Over the course of the summer, you will be given a series of assignments that will get progressively more difficult and challenging as you get more familiar with the technology that you are working with.

For example, your first assignment will be to watch a tutorial on angularjs. Next assignment is to write a little application in angular and c# / asp.net mvc. Next assignment is to hook it up to a database, etc, etc...

I hold no expectations as to the quality of the work. I understand you are an intern and I will likely scrap all of your code anyway. All I ask is that you are intrinsically motivated and sincerely care about learning. The more you work and put in, the more I will help and teach you. At the end of the summer, I will write you a letter of recommendation and serve as a reference for you. And you can put everything you've done down on your resume.

If you are interested, please PM me with:

1) What school you are attending / major

2) How much school you have completed

3) Programming languages you are familiar with

4) One sentence on why you are interested in this internship. 
 

Cheers."

- *June 2012* Left for Peace Corps 2 year assignment with intention of grad school / job afterwards
- *October 2012* Sent home for surgery on my ankle due to injury in Africa
- *November 2012 - March 2013* Worked a series of part time low wage jobs while trying to find work that would be flexible with my surgery in April and my inability to carry objects / walk long distance. No luck.
- *April 2013* Had ankle surgery finally. Started a $13/hour internship (ugh) at a regional planning non-profit, enrolled in graduate school this fall (environmental engineering)

I am basically just trying to get by. My resume is great - I have ample experience, several internships under my belt, and I am a very resiliant guy. I was in Peace Corps Liberia eating dirt and pooping in a hole. I have a chemical engineering degree and I am a smart guy.

So that's the background: Here's the question.

I am hoping to find a full-time job with big-boy pay still. I won't be able to walk without crutches until July. But! I found an opening at an environmental consulting group which has hired people with far less experience than me (one of them being my friend). I enthusiasticly applied on their website, on my college's alumni job board, cold-emailed some HR folks... no response. 

My friend forwarded my resume, chatted with me online, and said

&gt;Hi FriendlyTrashMan, it turns out ____ office will interview candidates on June 4th. My manager mentioned they will try to schedule you interview on the same day if possible. Just want to give you a heads up. Best of luck!

I haven't heard anything back yet - June 4th is less than a week away. I really want to talk to someone there and ask about it.

Do I call them? Email someone from their website? Just wait by my phone impatiently? I would drop my internship (which pays less and is not in my area of interest - but is 100% better than no job or a call center, as far as my resume is concerned) and take evening classes at grad school if I could. Job in my field + 2X pay &gt; what I am doing. I really want this job. It feels within reach. If I can get that interview, I am confident I can get that job.

Any advice on where to go from here? Should I just keep waiting - I have only been at my new job for not-even two months. I put it on my resume so that it didn't look like I was slacking for 8 months. 

The lack of contact after reaching out to them in 5 different ways is killing me!"

I was hoping to receive advice on how to not completely screw over my future, specifically in paying off my student debts and being able to transition to an independent lifestyle.

I'm attending a private institution thanks to a generous scholarship, and I estimate that I will have about $24k in loans by the end of four years. I'm comfortable taking out this amount because the student debt I would incur at the alternative, my state's flagship university, is around the same amount. 

Although my parents will assist in paying off my loans, I wanted to contribute, and I've started saving my money to put a dent in those loans. I currently have $1,150 in savings for that purpose. 

My plan is to work on-campus throughout college and continually put most of my income toward those savings, using summers either to take more classes, work full-time, or (most importantly) internships. 

Does /r/personalfinance have any advice on how else I can work toward paying off those loans quickly, or making it through college in general? I've thought of investing some of those savings as I don't plan on touching it at all for four years; is P2P lending such as Prosper a viable option? Should I wait until I accumulate more money then lock it up in a CD?

Edit for additional information: Once I have a steady source of income, through an on-campus job or whatever else, I planned on getting my credit union's Young Adult credit card so I could start building credit as well. "

I kind of felt like this girl was into me, but I also assumed she moved out of town for her summer internship, so I stopped thinking about it. 

Well, the other night at the bar, I see her come in with a dude. It was so perfect, as I was chilling at the bar with another HB 8.5-9 and her HB 6.5-7 friend. I go up and talk to the girl &amp; the dude, introduce myself to the dude, and kino once on her arm to let her know the deal. Then, I eventually left with the girls I was with. 

The next morning, I was kicking myself for not hitting on this girl/getting her number, so I said fuck it--I'm going to go for a fucking gay ass facebook number close. It's all I knew to do, because there's no telling where I'd see this girl again. So I messaged her something short and sweet telling her that ""we should hang"" out asking her number, telling her I'd call her (KEY = CALL GIRLS, and tell them your going to call them). I immediately regretted it &amp; assumed she would think I was a fucking chump. BUT, she messaged me back telling me ""we should definitely hang out!"", she gave me her number, BUT, that she was moving cities for the summer the very next morning. BAD FUCKING TIMING YO!! I called her the next day telling her to holla at me if she's in my city &amp; I'd holler at her if I was in her's--basically I just wanted to make contact outside of facebook and I wanted her to know my number.

Also, thoughts on this situation?? I think this girl is interested in me. We go to a small school together, so I know we'll see each other in two months again. But I'm wondering whether I should try to communicate with her throughout the summer, or whether I should just leave it alone until school starts back, then, game her from there? I'm thinking just waiting to game her in person is the way to go? Thoughts?"

1fa171,2,2013-05-29,Statistical Study of Most Effective 6v6 Team Class Arrangements,[deleted],truetf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/1fa171/statistical_study_of_most_effective_6v6_team/,"Oi,

I'm a High-School aged kid who has a profound interest in the applied science of Statistics.  And, no shit, I love TF2 as well, since I'm here right now.  I've taken a large interest in amateur and professional 6v6 gaming in competitive TF2 -- there's a lot more class-based strategy when there aren't one-per-class limits.  I.e, you could have:

* Aggressive Scout

* Frontline Medic

* Primary Pocket Heavy

* Secondary Pocket Demo

* Tertiary Pocket Soldier

* Spy

For an overall aggressive team.  On the other hand:

* Backline Engineer

* Support Medic

* Sniper

* Backline Support Engineer

* Roaming Pyro

* Demoman

For a staunchly defensive tactic.

Of course, these are two extremes.

There are millions of combinations -- especially when strategies are considered.  A ""frontline pocket soldier"" and a ""frontline pocket demo"" share more attributes in terms of strategy and game flow with each other than a ""frontline pocket soldier"" and a ""backline roaming solider"", even though the latter comparison is between two of the same class.  Those ""backline"", ""frontline"", ""pocket"", etc. adjectives are essentially as important an implication strategy as the class itself, as you all most likely know from experience, whether you've played 6v6 or not.  In 6v6 however, a single weak link in the strategy can ruin a whole set of rounds.  Some example class adjectives:

* Frontline -- Player will play at the front line of action

* Pocket -- Player will be healed and Uber'd by a Medic

* Support -- For engineers, they help another engineer build their buildings before building their own -- good for pregame.  For medics, it means a medic that doesn't have a single pocket, but goes around and heals/Ubers more randomly based on situation without obligation to a single player.  

&gt; So, what's the point of all of this?

I'm going to do a study (of sorts) using statistically sound methods to determine what types of class arrangements are best suited to fight against other arrangements.  

&gt; How is this useful to anyone?

You tell me.  It's somewhat obvious, no?  

&gt; How are you going to get the data?

Hopefully with the help of you guys.  I don't have a method of collecting data yet, but I suspect I will have to make a spreadsheet online and ""hire"" some respected redditors here to help me record the results of professional 6v6 games and the classes used (and some defining characteristics of the game, like time spent, kills per team, kills per player, connection problems causing delays, etc.)  The ""payoff"" of being ""hired"" would be that you would get free access to the result when finished, being that you get knowledge that competitive teams would want.  Want, as in, would possibly pay in-game currency like refined for.  

&gt; But how are you going to get a statistically-significant sample size?

A mixture of the above, and some self-made simulation based on the results of the above.  Basically, I'm collected a few thousand data points in the first round above, then making a simulation based on it that will help me pound out billions of data points.  As the first-round collection increases in sample size, the simulation becomes more accurate.  

&gt; Will the results of simulation be open to the public to learn from?

Depends on how useful the /r/tf2 and related communities are in helping me collect data.  

&gt; Are you a le fuckign F2P player?

Yes, but with two years of good experience.  Soon to upgrade to Premium when I buy everyone in a 6-member team we have some Mann-up tickets and surplus vouchers later this week.  I'm a good player but not (yet) at the professional level -- another 500 hours will probably give that.

Because we all know someone is going to ask it in the comments section.  

&gt; What statistical knowledge do you have?

1f9z1o,1,2013-05-29,Statistical Study of Most Effective 6v6 Team Class Arrangements,[deleted],tf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1f9z1o/statistical_study_of_most_effective_6v6_team/,"Oi,

I'm a High-School aged kid who has a profound interest in the applied science of Statistics.  And, no shit, I love TF2 as well, since I'm here right now.  I've taken a large interest in amateur and professional 6v6 gaming in competitive TF2 -- there's a lot more class-based strategy when there aren't one-per-class limits.  I.e, you could have:

* Aggressive Scout

* Frontline Medic

* Primary Pocket Heavy

* Secondary Pocket Demo

* Tertiary Pocket Soldier

* Spy

For an overall aggressive team.  On the other hand:

* Backline Engineer

* Support Medic

* Sniper

* Backline Support Engineer

* Roaming Pyro

* Demoman

For a staunchly defensive tactic.

Of course, these are two extremes.

There are millions of combinations -- especially when strategies are considered.  A ""frontline pocket soldier"" and a ""frontline pocket demo"" share more attributes in terms of strategy and game flow with each other than a ""frontline pocket soldier"" and a ""backline roaming solider"", even though the latter comparison is between two of the same class.  Those ""backline"", ""frontline"", ""pocket"", etc. adjectives are essentially as important an implication strategy as the class itself, as you all most likely know from experience, whether you've played 6v6 or not.  In 6v6 however, a single weak link in the strategy can ruin a whole set of rounds.  Some example class adjectives:

* Frontline -- Player will play at the front line of action

* Pocket -- Player will be healed and Uber'd by a Medic

* Support -- For engineers, they help another engineer build their buildings before building their own -- good for pregame.  For medics, it means a medic that doesn't have a single pocket, but goes around and heals/Ubers more randomly based on situation without obligation to a single player.  

&gt; So, what's the point of all of this?

I'm going to do a study (of sorts) using statistically sound methods to determine what types of class arrangements are best suited to fight against other arrangements.  

&gt; How is this useful to anyone?

You tell me.  It's somewhat obvious, no?  

&gt; How are you going to get the data?

Hopefully with the help of you guys.  I don't have a method of collecting data yet, but I suspect I will have to make a spreadsheet online and ""hire"" some respected redditors here to help me record the results of professional 6v6 games and the classes used (and some defining characteristics of the game, like time spent, kills per team, kills per player, connection problems causing delays, etc.)  The ""payoff"" of being ""hired"" would be that you would get free access to the result when finished, being that you get knowledge that competitive teams would want.  Want, as in, would possibly pay in-game currency like refined for.  

&gt; But how are you going to get a statistically-significant sample size?

A mixture of the above, and some self-made simulation based on the results of the above.  Basically, I'm collected a few thousand data points in the first round above, then making a simulation based on it that will help me pound out billions of data points.  As the first-round collection increases in sample size, the simulation becomes more accurate.  

&gt; Will the results of simulation be open to the public to learn from?

Depends on how useful the /r/tf2 and related communities are in helping me collect data.  

&gt; Are you a le fuckign F2P player?

Yes, but with two years of good experience.  Soon to upgrade to Premium when I buy everyone in a 6-member team we have some Mann-up tickets and surplus vouchers later this week.  I'm a good player but not (yet) at the professional level -- another 500 hours will probably give that.

Because we all know someone is going to ask it in the comments section.  

&gt; What statistical knowledge do you have?

A 5/5 on the AP Statistics AP Exam, some outside self-driven knowledge, the ability to model simulations.  So I'm not like a doctorate in Statistics, but I'm knowledgeable to complete something like this.  

&gt; What knowledge do you have on modeling simulations?

1f9xk3,17,2013-05-29,Been lurking on /r/aves for a while from across the ocean. Couple of questions for you guys...,itchymuller,aves,https://www.reddit.com/r/aves/comments/1f9xk3/been_lurking_on_raves_for_a_while_from_across_the/,"So I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while now. I'm flying to the states (Boston, MA) in a week for an internship and will stay for 6 months. I'm utterly surprised at the huge difference of style at what is popular here and what is popular in Europe(Netherlands). 
First and foremost: A lot of popular DJ's in the States have already lost their superstar-status here and are considered mainstream and/or bygones. Let's see: Tiesto, Armin van Buuren, Afrojack, Sunnery James/Ryan Marciano, Sydney Samson. Those guys were hot, like 5 years ago maybe. (Not being judgemental here, I danced to that music at that time as well).

Now we saw a big shift here in the past years from house/progressive house/trance to more of a techno/techhouse/deephouse/nu-disco music. DJs like Joris Voorn, The Magician, Marco Carola, Stimming, Solomon, Karmon (Diynamic label in it's entirety), Innvervisions label... you name it. Those are really the reining music bosses here.

I was wondering: How is the techno/techhouse scene in the USA? Are there any nu-disco/indie house DJs that I should know of? Any deephouse festivals this summers near Boston? 

Thanks!"
1f9whn,0,2013-05-29,[20M] Wondering if others have been in this very strange situation. [20F] [21F],[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1f9whn/20m_wondering_if_others_have_been_in_this_very/,"I cheated. No doubt about that.

I've been with [21F] about 3.5 years and she's not only the person I've been in love with since freshman year but also my best friend. At the start of the fall semester we will be moving in to a 2 bedroom apartment with a friend. It's a 12 month lease and neither of us could afford the place if we were not splitting the price.

Right now she's back in our hometown and has a job. I'm in our college town taking classes and also have a job. This means we can only see each other on Saturday and Sunday (its an hour drive) and I stay at her parents house with her when I visit. She straight up doesn't want  to drive down and visit me. This, in turn, means our sex life has diminished and she doesn't seem to care very much about that.

Meanwhile, I started talking to [20F], a friend I made earlier in the school year because she was in a relationship with my roommate and we also were both raised in the same religion and both left it. We always got along well but i hadn't really seen her for awhile because their breakup was less than clean.

Apparently she smoked together/hooked up with my roommate again just before he left for a summer internship, and it drove her emotions pretty high. She turned to me to talk to about it and we both expressed how lonely we were stuck in town without many friends. This led to us deciding to smoke together and hang out. (both smoking weed and me hanging out with other girls are something [21F] would vehemently disagree with, so I have kept it all secret)

[20F] came over and we watched some movies/shows together while I worked on some homework. We had pretty much agreed to just do our own thing, and really liked the idea of having someone else nearby while doing so. She didn't have a piece so we didn't smoke, but when it got late she decided to stay the night. Both of us longed for some physical contact and neither of us meant for cuddling to turn into sex, but it did.

Cut to the morning and we parted ways. I was actually headed off for a trip with [21F] and her parents for memorial weekend. We continued to text (in secret via google voice) and both agreed that it was a one-time mistake and that we would work to not let it happen again. She still had feelings for my roommate and felt bad both because of that and because I had a SO. I really didn't feel as bad as I should have. I didn't so much see that as cheating and saying it was a one-time mistake made it easier to write it off.

The trip was great and there was no weirdness between me and [21F]. We even got a rare chance to fool around alone in the hotel room. I don't feel any less in love with her.

Cut to Monday. I got back home to college town and [20F] came over again. This time she had a piece but didnt feel like smoking, so it was more of watching netflix and doing homework. This time we went to sleep with me on the futon and her on the bed. 

Here's where I become a horrible person. I knew she was laying there in only underwear and a tshirt, and I made a conscious choice to switch to the bed. The futon was very uncomfortable and I used that as an excuse, but I probably could have toughed it out. She immediately expressed an desire to have sex and I went right along with it. The sex we had was phenomenal. I'm much less experienced than she is, but we both felt very satisfied with it. 

After we were done, she told me she loves cuddling but that would feel too wrong when I have a gf. I was disappointed but knew she was right, and we fell asleep. The next morning I again left for school but this time I had to give her my key as I wouldn't be back until late in the evening and she did not have to work that day. She did some errands and then came back to my place before i got home and just chilled there.

Have I mentioned how much I trust [20F]? I've told her almost everything about my life and she's confided similarly in me, more than she ever has in someone. I don't think I would want to be in a real relationship with her but I adore her as a person. She likewise does not have romantic attachment to me, and would absolutely not tell anyone about what we did or try to use it against me. She is leaving for a different college at the end of the summer, so this is quite literally something that will not be found out by anyone unless I directly tell them. 

Anyways, during our texting after the second time we had sex, we both agreed that doing it twice was much worse morally. Again we resolved to either sleep separately or with clothes on and without touching. Last night we finally smoked together and I fell asleep earlier than usual on the bed. I thought she was going to join me later but when I awoke this morning I found that she had slept on the futon. Though I felt bad that she had slept there without a very good blanket, I'm glad that we did not fuck again.

And then I wrote this. Part of me just wanted to get this all out there somewhere. I know what I did was wrong, but I think it would be too harmful to my life to tell [21F] about it. It would probably end or ruin our relationship, and in the process it would mangle our housing plans and lose me my best friend. [20F] is leaving at the end of the summer and that will be the end of any infidelity on my part. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Cheated in such a way that there's no risk of someone finding out? How do you feel about it and how did it all turn out for you?

**tldr: I cheated with a friend and won't get caught. I'm still hanging out with said friend. I don't want to tell my SO about it and almost definitely will not. I am without doubt a bad person for all of this, but feel free to reassure me of that.**

- *May 2012* Graduated with BS Chemical Engineering
- *June 2012* Left for Peace Corps 2 year assignment with intention of grad school / job afterwards
- *October 2012* Sent home for surgery on my ankle due to injury in Africa
- *November 2012 - March 2013* Worked a series of part time low wage jobs while trying to find work that would be flexible with my surgery in April and my inability to carry objects / walk long distance. No luck.
- *April 2013* Had ankle surgery finally. Started a $13/hour internship (ugh) at a regional planning non-profit, enrolled in graduate school this fall (environmental engineering)

I am basically just trying to get by. My resume is great - I have ample experience, several internships under my belt, and I am a very resiliant guy. I was in Peace Corps Liberia eating dirt and pooping in a hole. I have a chemical engineering degree and I am a smart guy.

So that's the background: Here's the question.

I am hoping to find a full-time job with big-boy pay still. I won't be able to walk without crutches until July. But! I found an opening at an environmental consulting group which has hired people with far less experience than me (one of them being my friend). I enthusiasticly applied on their website, on my college's alumni job board, cold-emailed some HR folks... no response. 

My friend forwarded my resume, chatted with me online, and said

&gt;Hi Friendly_Trash_Man, it turns out ____ office will interview candidates on June 4th. My manager mentioned they will try to schedule you interview on the same day if possible. Just want to give you a heads up. Best of luck!

I haven't heard anything back yet - June 4th is less than a week away. I really want to talk to someone there and ask about it.

Do I call them? Email someone from their website? Just wait by my phone impatiently? I would drop my internship (which pays less and is not in my area of interest - but is 100% better than no job or a call center, as far as my resume is concerned) and take evening classes at grad school if I could. Job in my field + 2X pay &gt; what I am doing. I really want this job. It feels within reach. If I can get that interview, I am confident I can get that job.

Any advice on where to go from here? Should I just keep waiting - I have only been at my new job for not-even two months. I put it on my resume so that it didn't look like I was slacking for 8 months. 

The lack of contact after reaching out to them in 5 different ways is killing me!"
1f9vwv,0,2013-05-29,"A ""what if"" question: all undergraduate education is online for free",Helen___Keller,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1f9vwv/a_what_if_question_all_undergraduate_education_is/,"TL;DR: What would be the economic and social ramifications if all undergraduate education was replaced with online education, nearly freely available? 


Okay, so here are the assumptions I'm making in this what-if question:

1. Let's suppose online education has been improved steadily over the course of the years. Revolutions in understanding the learning process let us tailor specific education programs for any undergraduate major. Studies show that it is as effective as, or more effective than, a traditional education.

2. Through some method, online education is also reliable in that you can't just have your engineer best friend take tests for you and claim an engineering degree.

3. Universities still exist, but primarily for academic research and graduate level education. Basically, suppose that all traditional undergraduate education ceases to exist. Many dorms have been replaced by research labs or whatever. There may still be some 'boarding colleges' for undergraduate education, but there are few, and mostly for the wealthy.

4. With the advent of online education, a 'standard' education works like this:
Up through high school is the same, except rather than worrying about college applications, students worry about which online program to invest their time in. Advanced students start early.
Then, online education, nearly for free, for either a traditional field (psychology, chemistry, engineering ...) or for any craft (electrician, plumbing, ...). During this process, work part time / get internships if possible.
Then, Those particularly interested in a traditional field apply and go for graduate school as in the real world.

5. These online education programs are not directly analogous to current undergraduate degrees. Whether or not you get a 'general education' is your choice. Writers need not take college algebra, engineers need not take english classes. In any case, what you do learn is reflected by the 'certificate(s)' you have. An employer will know whether or not you took english comp I and II or whatever.


Returning to the TLDR, my question is what social and economic ramifications would result from this?
Things that occur to me:

1. Without undergraduates as a source of cash, would research universities lack funding?


2. The ability to learn part-time for nearly free would reduce barriers to entry to many fields for those willing to put in the time to learn engineering, or whatever. Would workers in high-demand fields see decreased overall salary if more people had access to this education? Is this a good thing or a bad thing, then?


3. Stereotypically, college is a time when young adults explore in many ways, include socially. Do you consider this necessary to a 'complete' education? Would there be a way to make up for it if undergraduate was all online?


4. Degrees are often used in the real world as indicators of competency. A job applicant may be outright rejected for not having a degree, where the same applicant would be interviewed if they had an entirely irrelevant degree. Would it be the same in this what-if? Given that degrees are broken up (you don't need the general education to get the engineering degree, for example), would employers still want the 'whole' undergraduate degree (including gen-eds, college algebra, etc) to signify competency?"

My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a full year. We go to the same college in the States, but we are working in different countries over the summer so we are ""long-distance"" for 4 months. This has been hard, but we've been doing okay so far.


Here's where it gets a little hinky. Once we get back from summer, we'll be spending our last semester together. This is because my boyfriend, Nate, is graduating and moving back to his home city (City 1) in Asia, and if his job this summer goes well, will be working full-time in City 2 (also in Asia). So City 1 and City 2 are going to be his main homes after school, and he doesn't plan on ever coming back to the United States again (due to a mixture of reasons, cultural and career-related). After he graduates, I still have one semester left to finish college.


*Note: sorry for the vagueness of the locations; I am super paranoid and feel that the combination of cities and the situation is unique and there's a 1-in-1000 chance he will chance upon this thread.*


We have, at this point, realized that due to 1) my being primarily based in the States, all of my job opportunities will likely be in the States in the future, as well as my friends and my life, really and 2) his life is back in Asia, where he has friends and family, in addition to him not liking the culture in the States and not wanting to live here, that we should not pursue our relationship together after he graduates. **We will break up once he leaves the States.**


This decision, I believe, has nothing to do with how much we love each other, or how compatible we are. It is purely because realistically, our paths are never going to cross after he leaves. It will be too hard, and even unfair for one of us to uproot ourselves and sacrifice our familiar lives, job opportunities, and a lot of other things to move across the world to be with the other. We intend to make the best of the time we have left. 

Unfortunately, it has also been breaking my heart since we've reached the decision, and as a result, I've been foolishly looking for ways to make this work.I just can't wrap my head around the fact that I'm supposed to give up on the one guy I've come to love because of something out of our control. We share the same heritage, same sense of humor, sense of financial responsibilities, and most political and philosophical issues, so all location challenges aside, we are pretty compatible. Damn me that I've always been the type who can never just let it go.

**Here's the catch, or what made me start having these stupid hopes:**
I am interning for a very large and well-known company based in NYC (where I will be this summer) that has headquarters all around the world, including one in City 2. What coincidence, then, that City 2 has been my dream work city ever since junior year of high school when I was lucky enough to vacation there. I fell in love with the city, the people, and the culture almost immediately (this goes way back before our relationship, and has nothing to do with Nate).
I know it's a long shot. But I somehow convinced myself that at the end of my internship, if I can score a full-time job with this company (reasonable) and somehow magically be able to transfer to the City 2 location in a different department (not as realistic)...I can't help but wonder if we would be able to reconsider our ""planned breakup"" (super really not realistic, at this point I don't even know if this is healthy for my dignity).


Reddit, I've been a long-time lurker and admirer of the sound advice that you've given to people here. Can you help me figure this out? Please slap some sense into me, no kid gloves needed, honest opinions appreciated. Heck, at this point, the fact that you've read this far is appreciated. :) Also go ahead if you have questions, I'm sure I should have clarified something or other better. Thank you.


**TL;DR** I've been beating myself up for allowing myself to hope for a chance to simultaneously land a job in my dream city and continue my relationship with my boyfriend. I can't tell if I'm grasping at straws and need to wake the fuck up or if this is actually a glimmer of hope that I can work towards this summer.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years--we're both in our late 20s/early 30s, talked about marriage, etc.

We've had an open relationship since the beginning, and, minus a few bumps, it's gone pretty well. HOWEVER. The only reason we opened our relationship up was because I have a significantly higher sex drive than he does (I like sex daily, whereas he'd be happy with once a month.)

He and I met online, and when we met, he was VERY good at seduction. Teased me, was a bit dominant (which I like), etc. However, after I moved to live closer to him, I discovered that while he can talk a great game, he does in fact have a low libido and severe anxiety issues, and so the pressure of having a serious partner (I was his first EVERYTHING) killed any desire he had to do anything sexual with me.

We've been really happy these past five years--our relationship just keeps getting better and stronger--except for sex. Other than that, he's pretty much the perfect partner.

So anyway. About two years into our relationship, I went to borrow his phone to make a call, and accidentally saw a new email he'd left open. Because of the content one email I saw, I kept reading, and it turned out that he'd been having a steamy online fling with a woman on a message board we were both members of.

I was devastated. Yes, we had an open relationship. But (1) he never told me about her, and (2) he was giving her sexual attention that he wasn't giving me.

I confronted him about it, he broke things off with her, and I told him that he was welcome to have ""things"" with other women, online or otherwise, but (A) he had to tell me, and (B) I didn't feel it was fair that he gave someone else something I wasn't getting. He agreed.

I will freely admit to snooping off and on in his email, and he flirted a little with various women, but nothing I'd consider intense or crossing a line, so I never told him about it. Our sex life never improved, but, whatever.

The following year, we actually saw a counselor together, to try to resolve some of our frustrations in the sex department. That actually really helped--our sex life didn't get better, but I was able to better understand why he wasn't sexually into me. Sex is an inherently fraught thing for him, for reasons he wasn't able to fully explain, but as such, it's much easier for him to get into when he knows he doesn't have any commitments to the woman.

Two years later, same thing happened. I hadn't snooped for several months, but when I noticed him hiding his phone from me again, I went and snooped, and sure enough, he had a thing going on with TWO other women. But before I could figure out how to confront him about it, things blew up--they both were friends, and didn't know that he was flirting with both of them, one of them fell in love with him, and told a mutual friend of ours that she was devastated that he wouldn't break up with me and move to be with her, since I was clearly a horrible person and she was the right person for him. The mutual friend told me, and I confronted my boyfriend. 

This time I wasn't devastated--I was very straightforward, and told him that he had been lying to me, and I didn't appreciate it, and while I understood why he wanted to be sexual with another woman (or two!) and was fine with it, what I was NOT ok with was that he didn't tell me about it. He apologized, broke things off with both of them, and that was that. They were pissed off at him, and rightfully so!! He was always VERY clear that he was happy to stay in our relationship and wasn't planning on leaving, but they still both wanted monogamy, and it was pretty obvious from their emails.

So anyway. I've occasionally (every few months) snooped over the past couple of years, and haven't found anything other than mild flirting. But, yet again, about a month ago, he started the familiar pattern of hiding his phone, so I went and snooped, and sure enough, he has a very hot D/S online relationship going on with another woman.

I'm bothered by this for two reasons.

1) She's married, and it doesn't appear that her husband knows about this. Although they don't have any plans to meet, and I STRONGLY doubt he would do so knowing his anxiety issues, so, maybe it doesn't matter? It still bothers me that he doesn't know, though.

2) HE HASN'T TOLD ME. HE KNOWS HE'S SUPPOSED TO TELL ME. I've always been 100% upfront about my other partners (and currently I've only had one other partner for the past about 18 months. No surprises there.)

And to be honest, there's also the part of me that's a bit jealous that she gets that from him and I don't... but really, it's mainly the second point--the fact that HE'S NOT TELLING ME ABOUT THIS despite the fact that THAT'S WHAT WE AGREED ON. And, because of this, it's hard to not feel cheated on.

So I don't know what I'm asking, here. I don't want to leave him. Honestly, other than the sex thing, he's an absolutely amazing partner--loving, respectful, and a partner in the true sense of the word--we work amazingly together as a team. Am I stupid to hope that I can somehow get him comfortable telling me that he's at least having an online thing with anoher woman? I don't even want details--I just want to know, dammit.

**TL;DR: Open relationship for 5 years. Boyfriend doesn't have any other physical partners, just online relationships. Despite agreeing to tell me about any online relationships he's having, he has repeatedly lied by omission and not told me. How can I make him more comfortable with telling me that he's involved with someone online? Or should I just be happy he's happy?**

**EDIT:** I sat down with him last night and didn't bring up the ""other woman,"" but I did tell him that he's talked about dealing with his anxiety many times before, and he needs to take the next step with that. (Last year, after four years of me pushing him, he FINALLY went on antidepressants, and they did help a lot, but now he needs therapy!) I actually watched him as he emailed Kaiser (his health insurer) and asked them what the process was for getting a referral for counseling. I don't know if he'll go through with it, but I'm going to keep pushing him. I don't know that I'm going to bring up his online relationship just yet. He's finally in the process of finding an internship to finish his master's degree, something he's been putting off for the past YEAR, so I think doing that and doing his own counseling are two good first steps. 

Then, if he's doing both of those things and still talking with the woman in another 2-3 months, I'll figure out how to address it at that point in time. I just wish I could get him to understand that I'm FINE with him having the relationship--I just need to know about it. Honestly, I really, REALLY hate snooping. I don't want to do that--I don't think it's fair to him. But neither is him hiding something major like that."

I'm currently an ECE student going into my ""4th year"" in the fall (quotes explained shortly) at a top 20 university in Canada.

The reason I say ""4th year"" is because I've been at school for 6 years, going into my 7th year of my bachelor's in the fall. I have screwed up a lot - having failed a bunch of courses in 1st, 2nd and 3rd year. As a result I only have a cGPA of 2.2 (which made my self-efficacy take a hit and make me question myself) and am worried about job prospects after graduation in May of 2014.

I initially entered the computer engineering stream because out of high school I really only had an interest in software and computer hardware. However after spending a number of years in engineering school, I became more interested in sustainable design and building construction having worked for an electrical &amp; mechanical consulting firm for three summers (I was really fortunate and was able to get this job through a connection). It's for this reason that I have started taking more electrical courses and am planning on taking fundamental courses in electrical power such as switch-mode energy conversion, distributed generation etc. this fall (most students take these core courses in 3rd year). However, last summer I did not work at this firm due to personal reasons and was not really employed (I'm worried about this gap in my employment history as well). This summer I tried applying to about 15-20 internships but was unable to get an engineering-related job and so I currently do data entry full-time.

I guess what I'm asking is... how screwed am I? I would like to try and improve my situation. Some ideas I have include taking the LEED Green Associate exam this summer because it is something that interests me (although I'm not sure how much employers would care) and joining an extra-curricular Solar House design team this summer.

I'm also doing some mobile app development for a course I'm taking this fall/spring so if things go south with the electrical job hunt, I can perhaps have a contingency plan and go into software.

Another thing is that I still live at home with my parents - I wanted to move out for the longest time but it just never ended up happening due to various reasons and it is one of the biggest things I regret. I feel like this would make me jumpy when job hunting after I graduate, looking for that first job that would let me get up on my financial feet, and not necessarily looking for the right job. Or is this not a valid concern because I should probably just pick the first semi-relevant engineering job due to my poor grades?

I know a lot of my thoughts are disjointed and that there is a lot of stuff here but I guess what I'm really asking is: am I in trouble for post-grad life in terms of jobs and if so, what can I do to remedy the situation? Any general advice for someone in my situation / what would you do?

Thank you for reading.

So I know that you probably read the title and may have already written this off. But I promise no wall of text, just the facts. 


So I was in a great relationship with a girl who I met in college. She had moved near me after graduation (got an internship coincidentally near me), and I had 3.5 great years. Dates, dancing, hanging out with friends (both together and separate), flowers, romance, etc.; it was great overall. It was one of those relationships that I was moving towards proposing towards her. Then came this shady fella that she worked with. I wasn't jealous really of him, but I did suspect that he was up to no good. 


The thing that started getting me suspicious was that he asked her to go with him ""as friends"" to a wedding, and she asked me if it was okay that she went with him. I told her I wasn't really comfortable with it, but I thought that it would be a way for her to get out and meet new friends (she didn't have a whole lot besides me and college friends locally.) She told me at that point that ""well, it didn't matter what you said, I was going to go anyways."" That was about 6 months before she broke up with me. 


Towards the end, she told me that ""something was wrong"" but really couldn't quantify what it was. I sat down with her and talked through it, asking her if it was something that I did, or what she felt. She felt that I didn't value her (I lived for the last 8 months about 200 miles away, talked frequently, did Facetime as well as visited home every other weekend. I brought her flowers, danced with her, kept asking her what she wanted to do every time in addition to making a decision together for both of us, etc. So I'm not sure what more I could have done much more. 


She became distant, really talked this other guy up with all my family and friends, and then decided that, as I was out shopping for a ring to call me, argue with me and then upon asking me say ""we're done."" I wanted to work through things with her, but she decided that she had had enough (really it felt like I wanted to fix things and she didn't) 


I should say that I really opened myself up for her here, and valued her in every way I knew how to. It's been 6 months since we talked, and I want to call her and talk to her (we haven't talked, and I saw her once at a mutual friend's wedding since then). I want to find out the truth, and possibly trying to get back with her and start anew. Really, I'd like to hear your advice on what I should do, whatever it is. Thanks in advance. 

UPDATE: So I decided to call her, not to beg for her to come back, but to see how she was. She talked about how everyone around her was doing well, but didn't bring up the other guy. Thank you to all who responded, I honestly feel like there's nothing there, that she really doesn't care about me, etc. Oh yeah, and coincidentally, the night I called her another girl called me that I've been interested in, came over and had a very enjoyable night. I get to see this new girl again, and I'm glad I'm moving on.

Carrying my laptop up/down Hearst is not very fun, so I've been looking into buses/shuttles.

I've known of the [H shuttle](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=207072823347146212274.0004b66e0462041827281&amp;msa=0), which goes around from Bart to Lawrence Lab. However, it doesn't run very often, and the number of stops also seem limited. After some googling, I've learned that there's a shuttle for LBNL called [""Blue Uphill/Downhill""](https://www.nextbus.com/predictor/stopSelector.jsp?a=lbl) that runs every 15 minutes. I was wondering if anyone knows whether Cal students can ride this bus, or is it just for the LBNL employees? 

Also, if I want to arrive at the workplace by 8:30 am, what time would be best to leave? I'm thinking 10 mins from Northside to Bart by bus, or 20 mins walking, 25-30 mins on Bart (stop at Montgomerry Station), 10 mins walk to workplace. Together, I think I should leave an hour in advance. How bad/crowded is Bart in the morning?

Apologies if these questions have been asked before, but I'm really nervous about this first internship. After getting some answers, I plan to ""test-drive"" tomorrow by riding whatever bus that goes down to Bart and calculating the time myself.

Thanks!"

1fd5e5,42,2013-05-30,The Summer Between Undergrad and Grad School,physicsthrowaway1,Physics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1fd5e5/the_summer_between_undergrad_and_grad_school/,"Hello all. So I've found myself in a predicament so I'm wondering you all had any advice.

I got accepted into a decent grad program starting Fall 2013. I was told by pretty much everyone that I'd *probably* be given some sort of research task over the summer from the institution. Well, I foolishly followed this advice and didn't apply for any summer internships since I thought I was covered for summer. Well, turns out, I was wrong. I'm a little peeved, but I suppose it was my fault for not making sure earlier.
Some of the reason was due to me having a late graduation date (mid-June). 

So now I'm a little bit worried about what to do for Summer. It's way too late for almost any internships, and the only ones I could find were at my local museums, but not very related to physics. I need to save up some money to move to my grad institution, but I also wanted to get my foot in the door with some research being done by the professors. I even offered to work unpaid and part time and they refused, which I found odd. 

My options seem rather limited now. Do I find a part-time job for only ~7 weeks? Even still, I have bills to pay, unfortunately, so it won't allow me to save any money for moving expenses. I'm a little frustrated at this point and wish I planned out my summer better.

Any advice? Thanks.

I'm an intern at MacPherson Architects and we are currently going over plans to create a pedestrian friendly area on Adams street and bring business/ people back to downtown. As some of you may know, downtown isn't exactly the busiest place in Toledo. In fact it's quite the opposite when there's not a Mud Hens game going on. With all these beautiful high rises sitting vacant it pains me to see so much potential boarded over and hoping for something to come along and move in. We have more open parking lots than we need and a beautiful view of the riverfront from the empty park next to it. 

What I want to know is what do you want to see happen? what could we do to make Downtown more inviting? 

Here are some precedents we've been looking at;

There's great potential in this city and there is progress being made. I look forward to seeing what you all think

Edit: Before I get all the hopes up this just a proposal I'm making, but we have significant interest from the businesses around here and it seems everyone is on board to see this happen. So the more people that want to make this happen the stronger we can argue for it and actually see this come to fruition.

I'm a transferring as a junior to CoE from a community college.

I may not be able to attend CalSo, as I just started a summer internship and I may not be able to get time off. If I can't, am I screwed? My registration date would be pushed back to mid-July, rather than early June. Will I have trouble getting into certain classes if I have to wait?

I'm not certain what my schedule will be, but here are a few classes I **might** be taking:

* EE 40 (4) Intro. to Microelectronic Circuits
* EE 20N (4) Structure and Interpretation of Systems and Signals
* CS 70 (4) Discrete Math and Probability Theory
* CS 61AS? (1-4) The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (Self-Paced)

**Questions:**

0. How many units should I aim for?

1. Is it a bad idea to take EE 40 and EE 20N at the same time during my first semester?

2. Will I actually have to take 61A or 61AS? It seems to be an introductory programming course, but no equivalent is listed for the CC I'm transferring from. I've taken multiple programming classes, and am working as a software engineering intern right now -- how can I determine whether I'll still have to take either 61A or 61AS?

3. How can I find out which general ed/humanities classes will transfer? assist.org only lists those for the College of Letters and Sciences. The EECS website says which Berkeley courses fulfill those requirements, but not what their equivalents are at my CC.

4. Most of this information is supposed to be made available at CalSo. Where can I clarify these questions if I can't go to CalSo?

5. Do you have any general advice for transfer students? For EECS majors, or CoE students?

Please let me know if I need to clarify anything.

Thanks! I'm incredibly excited about going to Cal."

I remember pretty vividly when I arrived in Vermont. It was so different than what I was used to. Mountains were quite unfamiliar to me having grown up in the Midwest, and I was in awe at being constantly surrounded by the beauty of it all. New England Culinary Institute (NECI) was located in Essex Junction, which was very close to Burlington, which was a cool little college town very similar to a college town that I lived near in Iowa. It was just enough familiarity for me to keep me going, seeing as this was quite possibly the boldest and spur of the moment decision of my life to date.

I fell in love with everything Vermont. The local businesses, the food culture, the farmer's market, the mountains, the weather, the microbreweries, and even the people. Except the hippies. I've never liked hippies.

So I moved into the dorms almost the instant I got into town. The dorms were basically converted housed where about 5 people shared a floor, common areas including a bathroom and kitchen, and we got our own bedrooms. Not a bad setup, really. I went to orientation, signed my life away to a student loan company, and began classes.

It was a completely new experience for me. The classes were all strictly hands on learning through cooking. The school was located in a resort with functioning restaurants and banquets halls, so everything that was prepared was ultimately served to a paying customer. Other classroom environments were located in Burlington at a high volume restaurant. It was a great learning experience all around. I was making friends as well, which was something I had worried about having moved away from all of my own friends. I was truly starting anew, having essentially left my entire life behind me. Was I running away from my problems? Absolutely. Was it one of the best decisions of my life? Well, yes and no.

I met a pretty little lady who was in my class. There weren't a whole lot of females in the school, and she was by far the most attractive. I had absolutely no chance with her, so I rarely made more than small talk with her. Well, until one night I got pretty drunk and I saw her in my building. She had been drinking a bit as well, but wasn't really as drunk as I was. I get pretty bold when I drink, so I started talking to her. And, hey, she was even talking back! I asked her for a drink of her beer (she was drinking sweet malt beverage, and I wanted to try it), so she took a big sip, came in to kiss me and spit it into my mouth. I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there.

The next day, she seemed pretty embarrassed about it and apologized for the way she acted. She was a bit of a goody, after all, and wasn't used to acting like that or being around people who acted like that. And then she asked me if I wanted to go out sometime. Score number two! We went out for coffee one night and walked around Church street. I was pretty convinced that it was a bit of a pity date because she felt bad (and also because I'm an idiot and oblivious to when a woman is into me) so I just enjoyed our conversations and our time spent together, took her back to her dorm room, and that was the end of it.

Until a week later, when she was asked out on a date by another guy, and she quite vocally replied to him, ""Well if inquebiss doesn't ask me out again, I might have to go out with you!"" Woah, what? She actually wanted to go out with me again? That's when we started dating for realsies.

So we finished our first year of school. We both went on internships at different restaurants for the summer, but were reunited the following fall. I signed away again at that student loan to attend another year of high end culinary school. Towards the end of the year, I heard rumor that the school was going to offer a Baking and Pastry degree program. Well, that was kind of why I attended culinary school to begin with. Now they have a program that focuses on just those things? Hell yeah! So, after having completed almost all of the required classes to get my Culinary Arts degree, I re-enrolled to attend another year and a half to get my Baking and Pastry degree. Oh, and the nice girl I was dating decided that she wanted to do the same. She wanted to be a cake decorator, after all.

And we signed our life away to the student loan company again.

The new school program was only offered at the other campus, so we had to move down there to attend. We decided to get our own apartment in the next town over having figured out that it was actually cheaper than paying room and board. We spent the next nine months in classes learning all about how to make artisan breads, pastries, deserts, cakes, and chocolate work. 

And after two years of dating, I proposed. Spoiler Alert: She said yes ;)

We finished our classes, but still had another internship to go through. We decided that we wanted to be together, so we tried to get an internship at the same place or places close together. We found a golf and beach resort that would take us both in their pastry kitchen, but it was in Florida. Sure, why the hell not? We were young and adventurous!

We packed up our cars, drove to Florida, found an apartment, and started our internship. We made $9.00 an hour. But we were livin large, because of all the overtime we were working. Being on an internship meant you were still technically enrolled in school, so we weren't paying on our loans yet. We weren't even thinking about them. Just makin money and spending money. The internship ended but we still had a lease on the apartment, so we figured we'd just stay for the rest of the year. We were offered jobs at the site, but the experience we had with the pastry chef was terrible. We jumped ship at the first chance. I landed a job at a pretty sweet beach club for the elite and my fiancee couldn't find a job in pastries, so she worked for Sak's Off Fifth and Victoria Secret. I wasn't doing any baking or pastry work, but I got a really good experience doing high end beach food at the restaurant as well as doing banquets, weddings, and special events. And the location was at one of the most beautiful beaches I've been to. Couldn't ask for much more than that!

Alas, the end of our lease was coming up and we knew the grace period on our student loans would be ending soon, so we began to plan for heading back to New Hampshire, which was where her home town was located. We'd stay with her parents for a bit until we found jobs and could move out. We enjoyed our stay in Florida, but we were definitely ready to leave. So the time came, we packed up our cars again, and made our way back to New England.

We both started looking for jobs right away and my fiancee applied to a high end pastry shop that she had dreamed of working at. It was her inspiration for attending culinary school. And she got the job! But she was only making $8.00 an hour. Temporarily, hopefully. I found a great job at a very nice artisan bread bakery making $10.00. The downside was that it was just outside of Boston, which was an hour and a half drive each way. But, I needed a job and I wanted it to be in that specific field, so I did it. It took a few months for us to both start working, but we got it in. And good thing too, because we got our first student loan bills in. 

Her's was about $1000 and mine was up around $1200. 

Yup. Having attended the most expensive culinary school in the country, I owed about $100,000, and she owed just under that. I was making less per hour than what I was before I started school. What in the hell were we going to do?"

So after being out of grad school for a year, I FINALLY found a position! (Woohoo! there's hope after all!) It's an internship, but I'm getting paid and the position is exactly what I want. My boss even basically said that by the end of the year I'll probably be a full time member of the team. There's a major need within this company for someone with my skills/talent, so I know I'm going to have a good time fitting in.

Now... the place I'm working is very new to me. It's very small (only about 7-8 people work there), and the attitude is very relaxed and collaborative. So far my job is to gather information and create sort of a knowledge base for both people in the company and for clients. I figured the easiest way to do this is to write blogs about different processes and post them on the company website (they're very active with their blogs).

The only problem is that I went to a very prestigious school, where everything had to be written in a very strict, essay format. I also did an internship during school with the government - where nothing can be written in a personal voice, and everything has to go through various levels of management before it's approved. I'm having trouble finding my ""voice"" as a blogger, and revealing the person behind the words (so to say). I'm not comfortable writing ""I"" and revealing things about myself through my work.

Any tips on writing blogs? Or becoming more relaxed in the workplace? Also, do you have any blogs you read regularly that has a style you like?

tl;dr: how do I reveal my personality through my blog? (and yes - actually, writing this reddit post helped me learn a few things about talking about myself, but this is still anonymous so it's not as scary)"

[23/F] and [26/M]",bjorns_free,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1fc7zi/long_distance_longterm_relationship_worth/,"I met Jai two years ago online while doing an internship in another city. It was my first experience with online dating, and I wasn't expecting to actually meet anyone in person, but we really hit it off and had a great three months there. He's a talented, sensitive, altruistic person whom I share many values with. At that point, I could really see us going places. Even in our difficult times later on, we've grown together. I met and love his family, and they really liked me; my parents weren't that thrilled, but they never are. He knew from the beginning that I was leaving for another state for a teaching job for at least two years, and we decided to try long distance.  

The training for my teaching job that summer and the entire first year after that were awful. I was stressed beyond self-recognition, and I definitely took it out on him. He also didn't understand anything about what I was going through, and I had a hard time communicating that to him. He would make it seem like there were simple solutions to the issues that I was having, and it would frustrate me. Things would escalate quickly, like if I was ranting and swearing about a work-related issue, he would yell at me about ""swearing at him."" I didn't feel like he was a support and added to the emotional burden that I carried from my job. He would say that he was supportive because he'd stay up with me many times while working, which is true, but he has usually used that fact to hold that over my head in arguments. We also had intimacy issues. I was so unhappy and overworked that I had no drive, and he would tell me that I made him feel unattractive and like I didn't want him.  

During that time, I also became close to a male coworker who empathized with me rather than criticized me. While I did develop some feelings for the coworker, I didn't act on them, but it strained my relationship with Jai that year nonetheless. This year, it has been a non-issue as we don't even see or speak to each other much anymore, but Jai still seems suspicious that there is someone else in my life.  

That first year, I only saw Jai once for a few days during Christmas. He lives with his parents, and I didn't have a good time with him; he seemed hostile towards his family, and because I didn't feel comfortable getting intimate in his parents' home, he was even more upset about the lack of intimacy.  

When I returned to work, I was back in survival mode and didn't think too much about our relationship except for putting out the fires that developed. When summer came around, I wanted out. I wanted to focus on getting better at my career and getting away from other stressors. I cried so much and had a lot of trouble articulating myself, and Jai's vitriol made everything worse. He accused me of cheating him of a chance to see what my life was like, since he had planned on coming to my state and maybe even getting a job here. Jai also accused me of ""emotional rape"" and being cold when I was trying to cut contact. I don't recall how, but we wound up getting back together after a week, agreeing that I wanted to focus on my work but that we could still be together.  

That summer I visited him, and things seemed better. He also came to visit at the beginning of the new school year, when I was still extremely stressed. I continued to express my frustration and wasn't interested in being intimate, and it made him resent me. He told me that my job was harder than he thought it was, which made me resent him. After he left and as the year went on, things seemed to improve as we took the time we needed to do our respective things and still spend some time talking together on Google Chat, the phone or texting. I've made a much greater effort towards intimacy, too.  

That being said, I still didn't see our futures melding. I don't know how long I want to stay in my current state and teach, and I don't want to live in the city where he and his family are. What I wanted to do was spend the summer together and then start talking about the inevitable. I'd been avoiding the future talk for some time, when a few nights ago Jai insisted on talking about it. He was looking for assurance, but I told him that I couldn't promise anything. He said that my indecisiveness was hurting him, so I told him that I would then need to let him go. He started backtracking, saying that he didn't need an exact answer, saying that he wanted to work things out. Then he said he wasn't going to let me break up with him. That he wanted to see me grow as a person and go to grad school, etc. Then he turned around and said he felt like committing suicide (I told him that I'd call the police if he kept talking like that, and he stopped), that he'd ruined his standing in his community with his relationship with me and would be doomed to be alone without me (we're an interracial couple). I ended the call with us both crying and feeling incredibly guilty.  

The next night we spoke again and Jai told me again that I gave up easily on relationships, that he thought I understood his culture and it was my fault, that everything could be worked out and I wasn't trying hard enough. I stood my ground this time the way I hadn't the year before, and we're broken up.  

I think I'd be willing to work things out if we were physically together and had therapy, but I don't know. I've seen comments on Reddit about girls in their early twenties wanting to find themselves, and there's some truth to that (although he'd told me age was no excuse that first night). I told him that last night and he said he wanted to look into online counseling. I said I'd think about it. My mom thinks he's emotionally abusive and that I'm crazy for considering it. How about you, Reddit? (Thank you for even reading. It helps to write it all out.)

**TL;DR I've been dating a man long distance for 2 years after meeting online and being together for 3 months. After I moved, our relationship tanked because of a lack of communication and stress. Things are better now, but I'm not sure if I should walk away because our futures don't seem to mesh well.**"

However, I have some classes and I'm going to graduate in the winter.
What should I do to make myself stand out from others in the field of embedded systems, and am I aiming too low for my career?

Second question: is there any good project idea that would prove I'd be a great software engineer? Or some sort of computer engineer, so that I can show off I can make a quality project and show off some creativity. I do have a 3D printer at my disposal.

Some ideas I already have are:

1fbqbu,1,2013-05-30,Looking to pursue a career in law enforcement upon graduation.. A few questions,[deleted],ProtectAndServe,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/1fbqbu/looking_to_pursue_a_career_in_law_enforcement/,"Hello! I'm not sure if this is the right place to do this but I have a few questions.. A little background about myself:

* 3rd year economics major at UC Irvine
* Plan on graduating Fall Quarter (December '13)
* No experience/internships with any departments

UCI has a CSO program which I could apply for, but one of the requirements is that I have a FULL academic year left at UCI (and even then, some people hear back 2 years later so it's no guarantee that I'll get in).

I've been asking around at a few departments in the area, but most prefer Social Ecology majors (such as criminal justice or psych) and give them preference for internships.

So my questions are:

1. Are there any other possible ways to get myself ready/become a better candidate?
1. How soon before graduating should I begin applying?
1. Is there anything I should begin preparing? (Aside from being physically fit).

Thank you!"

**3,092 American Idiots** for **1 year**.

Green Day is surely a name that most of you recognize. The group has been constantly releasing various very recognizable songs for the longest amount of time, which are world-renowned today. I mean, who hasn't heard of ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams""? And guess what, that song has been released *nine* years ago, at which point they have long established themselves as one of the leading rock bands of its time.

What is now one of the most important punk bands of the past two decades began as a duo between the two childhood friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike ""Dirnt"" Pritchard at age 15. After having adopted the name ""Green Day"", the group released numerous well-known albums to the likes of ""Dookie"" and ""American Idiot"" that ensured their rise to mainstream popularity. The group now has four regularly appearing members, which are the aforementioned Billie Joe Armstrong (Guitar, Vocals), Mike Dirnt (Bass, backing vocals), and the later joining Tré Cool (Drums) and Jason White (Guitar, backing vocals)

It is thus no wonder that a small branch of its fanbase have found themselves on Reddit, where they gathered themselves in a small, yet active sub, under the control of three mods, who are the founder /u/Garin2010, and his two minions, /u/MispelledName and /u/Slapdown, whom I was able to ask some questions:


&gt;1\. What brought you into listening to Green Day?

&gt;&gt; **Garin2010:** I discovered Green Day just as I was also becoming acquainted with other bands like The Offspring and Rage Against the Machine. American Idiot was given to me as a gift from a family member after it was released in 2004 and I immediately became a fan. From then on I moved on to listening to their entire catalogue and have been following the band ever since.

&gt;&gt; **MispelledName:** I actually got into Green Day because I saw them in the ""Thank You"" area of a lot of albums, especially my then-favorite band Good Charlotte (I was 14 at the time, don't judge). I kept hearing all of my favorite pop-punk bands saying that they were their inspiration in interviews, and it was love at first listen.

&gt;&gt; **Slapdown:** I started listening to Green Day when American Idiot came out. I heard Holiday on the radio and loved the song, so I went out and bought the album and loved the entire thing. A couple of years went by and I saw the music video for 21st Century Breakdown on MTV and loved that song too so yet again, I went and bought the album. That was when I went back and looked up all their older songs and I knew then that they were my favorite band and still are to this day.

&gt;2\. Which one is your favorite album?

&gt;&gt; **Garin2010:** As much as I would like to say that I have a number one favorite, I usually break down into selecting two. My first is Warning, I love the acoustic sounds of the album and also how it became the album that signified much of Green Day's style changing from their punk days, to the much more modern rock sound that we hear today. The second album is Insomniac, for it's raw sound and punk roots. It's one of those albums that I point to when anyone objects to their punk beginnings.

&gt;&gt; **MispelledName:** My favorite album is American Idiot, because it was the album that got me into Green Day, and actually got me interested in playing guitar and bass. I've always loved concept albums, and you can't go wrong with crunchy guitar and well thought out lyrics.

&gt;&gt; **Slapdown:** My favorite album would have to be 21st Century Breakdown because I love the music on the album and the lyrics. They just hit that spot we all have when listening to our favorite albums. I also tie that album in to being why I looked up all their previous records.

&gt;3\. What was your favorite experience with Green Day?

&gt;&gt; **Garin2010:** My favorite Green Day experience was undoubtedly my first concert. I saw them in 2009 on their 21st Century Breakdown tour in Salt Lake City. I was a Verizon customer at the time and they hooked me up with free tickets, soundcheck passes, early access to the venue, the whole VIP treatment. I was extremely lucky to have such an awesome experience at my first concert, and I still consider it one of the best days of my life.

&gt;&gt; **MispelledName:** My favorite Green Day experience is when I saw them on the American Idiot Tour in Dallas back in '05. I was right on the rail at the very front, and got to high five all of the guys. I even got a water gun blast right in the face from Billie Joe (No, that is not a euphemism).

&gt;&gt; **Slapdown:** My favorite Green Day experience I've had would be learning and playing the songs on guitar. My girlfriend inspired me to pick up guitar again and learn the songs about 2 years ago. I've been ""Having a Blast"" ever since!

&gt;4\. What motivated you to create the sub?

&gt;&gt; **Garin2010:** I created the sub about a year and some months ago after coming on to other band centric subreddits like /r/blink182, and also the fact that I felt that Green Day fans needed somewhere on Reddit to get together and discuss after seeing comments in Green Day posts get so hostile in other subreddits.

&gt;&gt; **MispelledName:** I'm so glad Garin created this sub, he's done a great job with it. Back when I first joined reddit, this was the first sub I looked up and it had barely any posts. Now, it's become a really great community.

&gt;&gt; **Slapdown:** Garin has done an awesome job with the subreddit so far. Keep it up bossman!

&gt;5\. Do you wanna say anything to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt; **Garin2010:** I love the fact that our subscribers are very active! And if you ever see a helpless person lost in an /r/music thread, direct them to the sub! Also, there are going to be a number of changes happening that I think many will like.

&gt;&gt; **MispelledName:** We have some pretty great posters, the only thing I really have to say is keep being awesome guys! Keep that good content coming! AND USE THE DAMN [MERCH] TAG!

&gt;&gt; **Slapdown:** All I want to say to the present and future subscribers is: You guys are the reason the subreddit is awesome, keep it up!

To finish this up, since I'm a new intern at /r/subredditoftheday, I would like to introduce myself:

My universal username is schampanes (shum-pun-ase), and I've had it for as long as I can remember. I've been on Reddit for just over a year now, following the path of one of my IRL friends, who introduced me to the site. I don't have a lot to say about myself, other than the fact that I like music of any form (which is the inspiration for this post), so I might be leaning more towards featuring music-oriented subreddits (or not, who knows?). 

Also, GreyWriter is the sexiest writer of all. ^(Now please put that gun away)"

The name would be recognized by some from the US but is in Europe.  I got poor grades as I only aimed to pass and get through the course. I screwed up my finals by having a panic attack in an exam - and they're like DVD-Rs - one shot. The result is me having a three year B.Sc degree with a poor grade stretched out over five years. 

I never completed any internships because I always made money elsewhere to support myself and took a year to work elsewhere after my finals to clear my head as I didn't want to add more stress to myself. In terms of technical ability I can only list two of the more sophisticated things I've built: a connect four app for iOS and minesweeper with Haskell. 

I'd love to take an internship somewhere or even get a real paying job where I can program or run tests/bug fix and get an idea about how the industry works but feel no one would take me due to me screwing up my finals. I've no real debt to speak of other than paying off a couple hundread to get my piece of paper next week. 

Every piece of advice I've gotten from friends to family has been conflicting - some say I should acknowledge it's not for me others tell me I'll have no problems. At the moment I've lots of free time which wasn't the case some months ago and am trying busy myself with little projects.

1fb99g,10,2013-05-29,I just got my degree in cs but I found both of my internships to be tedious and soul-crushing. Is it likely that I'll find a job I enjoy?,heytet,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1fb99g/i_just_got_my_degree_in_cs_but_i_found_both_of_my/,"I originally chose computer science because I knew it paid well and I didn't really know what else to choose. Eventually I started enjoying the classes. I really enjoyed learning the theoretical aspects of it, and all the amazing things people have figured out over the years. But I find the actual 40+ hour weeks of programming to be soul-crushing. At least in the two internships I've had I did. I absolutely HATE having to go through someone else's confusing uncommented code and figure out what the hell is going on so I can fix some bug. I hate having hours go by where I have nothing external to show for it, even though I have been running a mental marathon trying to figure out what the problem is with the code in front of me. 

At one of my internships, I feel like I basically bullshitted my way through most of it. It just felt like there was so much information to take in and I didn't quite grasp what all the different applications were doing. It seemed like some of the other interns picked up on it right away. I know I'm not stupid, but unfortunately computers really are not a passion of mine. So even though I can write software and I really appreciate the art of good software design, I don't know all the ancillary computer stuff that most cs guys seem to know because they really like computers. I see some people who I can just tell belong in cs and wouldn't belong anywhere else, and unfortunately I'm just not that person. I can write software, but it's just not a passion of mine. Although I did really love it the one time I worked on creating a project of my own. But anytime I have to sit down and work on the same boring financial application for a month straight, I start to die a little.

Can anyone else relate to my feelings, and if so did you ever find a cs job that you ended up really liking? And if so, what was it? Any advice?"

I told my parents that I'm going to be moving out and getting an apartment. I have the money. It's going to be a lot but I think it's going to be worth it. I'm really tired of spending 2+ hours a day on the train and being so left out. It sucks when you barely have friends at school and your'e afraid to talk to them/get closer to them because you're told you shouldn't. I just want to go out and enjoy making friends for fucking once...
Then I feel like I'm just being childish. People always look down on younger kids for being childish and bitchy. I can't help but feel now I'm feeling the same way. My mom is telling me to ""be more patient"" and just stay home until I graduate and that I have plenty of opportunities to be independent...but how the fuck am I going to make friends? I'm on an internship right now and it's fucking depressing how stale my routine is. I can't imagine my life being this way in the future. Fuck all of this. fuck. It's so hard to contain the anger.

1ffij5,8,2013-05-31,How important is the internship between Jr. and Sr. years?,dstark5,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ffij5/how_important_is_the_internship_between_jr_and_sr/,"Hello /cscareerquestions,

The only internship I was able to snag was basically IT work at a small manufacturing company. I don't do anything related to CS, and the most 'coding' I do is writing a few simple shell scripts here and there. My days are mostly filled with installing/updating Win7 on machines and helping people with mostly trivial problems.

Will an internship such as this basically close the doors to getting interviews for junior software developer positions at good companies (from large ones like Microsoft and Google to the small firms all over)? Or will I still be able to have a shot at this. I absolutely despise this menial I.T. work, and only accepted this (min wage+$1) internship as it was the only offer I received (I started looking relatively late)."

I'm coming to Atlanta for 4 weeks for a medical school rotation at Emory University Hospital Midtown starting Monday.

I went on Craigslist for weekly rentals for housing about a month ago and found a pretty decent place in Decatur for 125$ a week. I paid a deposit right away to confirm a room and text the landlord a week ago to confirm that there is still a room. I was told yes. 

I was all packed and ready to go this morning and thought I'd send another text to the landlord to tell him that I'm coming. I was pretty shocked when he told me that he actually doesn't have the room since he's not sure if the previous tenant is going to move out.  

I tried a few extended stay hotels around midtown Atlanta but all of them are booked full. I went on Craigslist again to try to find other places but no one is picking up their phones (I guess since it's because its Friday afternoon?). 

My internship starts Monday and now I've got the weekend to find a place to stay. People of Atlanta, can anyone help me out?

Thanks!

1feo40,1,2013-05-31,Computer science student looking to (possibly) pursue a career in finance. What are my options?,TheShadyInvestor,finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1feo40/computer_science_student_looking_to_possibly/,"I'll try and keep this short. I'm a computer science student and, as a part of my program, my school arranges a few internships for me. After a few of these internships, I've realized that I don't really want to have a career in computer science, whether it be as a developer or something else. I just don't find it very satisfying and honestly can't see myself doing it day in and day out. I know some of you might think that I should only study things that interest me and so forth so, to that extent, I can say that computer science interested me a lot before I started my degree, and it still does, but just not to a level where I can see myself doing it as a career.

One of my internships has been in a finance job working in middle office. (I'm purposely not giving away specifics but can try and clarify certain things if people have questions.) My question for you, /r/finance, is what career options do you think are available to me? The way I see it, I have 3:

1) Go back to that position for my remaining internships (if possible) and try to get a job there post-grad. After that, continue to climb the corporate ladder.
2) Work for a few years post-grad and get an MBA, which will hopefully land me a career I like better (but obviously there's no guarantee).
3) Try and go back to my finance internship position full-time and get a CFA. The only career I know I can have as a CFA (that I normally couldn't otherwise have) is being a Portfolio Manager, which I don't know much about but am currently exploring as well.

Any guidance and/or advice will be much appreciated!

Update: I called around my university and actually got into contact with my elusive dean. Asked him for letter. He sent one. I'VE GOT THE INTERNSHIP!!!! THANK YOU REDDIT, FOR STICKING WITH ME THROUGH MY PANICS!!!

Good morning, OMC. 

As a follow up to a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ercmt/reddit_please_help_what_do_i_do/) I wrote weeks ago, I was offered the internship, but I need a letter of acknowledgement because it's unpaid and legalities, etc. I was told to get it from an IT (computer science) professor, advisor, office of admissions, etc. 

Despite emailing all of those people, only my professor responded / picked up my calls and - phew - said he'd write it. But as of right now, I still have no letter. I even sent him the layout the internship said was what they needed (they literally sent me a fill in the blank letter for my professor, which really just required him to put his name and sign it). 

He's a nice guy, but he puts off things for way too long. For example, in his class, our homeworks from the beginning of the semester weren't graded until the very end in a rush. 

At first, I dropped little emails and reminders, but then it turned into a once a day memo of ""pleaseeee, I really want to do this and it'll advance my career, etc."". 

WHAT DO I DOLS JDL:FKJWKLRHLFSDF.

Edit: He just sent me a looonnnggg email explaining how he couldn't do it because it's an exam day and basically told me to try someone else, after waiting a week and a half. But he just has to PEN HIS NAME ON THE BOTTOM AND DURING EXAMS ALL YOU DO IS SIT THERE AND THIS IS SO DISRESPECTFUL TO MY PROFESSOR BUT WHYYYYYY AUGH. Professor, you could have penned it instead of writing me a wall of text in that amount of time it took to do so. "

My friend had 12-16, *at most* 20 months of experience from internships when he got this job straight out of his undergrad. When someone else asked him about the 6 year experience requirement, he answered - wait for it - ""lol don't worry about it ;)"".

1feel1,1,2013-05-31,Are you fucking kidding me?,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1feel1/are_you_fucking_kidding_me/,"This whole week got a whole lot worse. Some background on my part, I am a chemical engineering student graduating in under 15 days and for the last 4 months, my life has gone to total shit. If that's not bad, what I am going through right now is a world of mental bullshitting pain that is also eating up my wallet. 

First of all, I got an second interview at a Controls engineering company, Great right? I thought so to. Here I thought, after 4 years of pain, that I was finally gonna have what most people want--- a fucking job. This was for an internship but none the less work experience and getting paid. I had a midterm on Friday, 5/24, and I have my senior design due on 6/7. So after the midterm I was working on design, this is a group project so I was waiting on person#1 to send me his numbers( optimum pressure, temperature, reactor size, separation numbers such as # of trays, basic ChE plant stuff). Let's call person#1 : J. So after doing that for 2 days, it was a 3 day weekend here in the U.S, on the monday before the interview I was preparing for the interview. Before I get too far ahead here, I would like to say that J hasn't given me any numbers yet, and since this is close to the deadline, I am kinda freaking out. But this has happened before and I knew we would figure it out before this was due, so I didn't worry about it too much. Back to the interview, I knew the company wanted someone who wanted some sort of controls software knowledge, so I was studying that online, cause our school doesn't teach us any more than PID controls. So I am online learning about different controllers ( Allan Bradley, Modicon, etc) so I can ace the controls knowledge part of the interview. So I go home on Monday, and again prepare for my interview at home. Come the day of the interview, I get there 10 mins early, and just try to keep myself calm and collected. And at 11AM, one of the interviewees walk in along with the guy who interviewed me for the 1st interview, our school's alumni. I was happy to see him and he told me I needed to impress his team in order to get the internship. No problem, I thought, I have been studying online for a week now about PLC controllers, and I have a solid background knowledge about the company, this is in the bag no sweat. Here's where the trouble begins :
We walk in to the interview and not 10 seconds in, one of the guys tells me, ""we are looking for someone with a solid software background"". I am like ok, all  I know is MATLAB, but I can learn C++, Java, etc. Then the 3 guys start interviewing me and asking me about my projects that I have done in school. I tell them, in detail what I did and they seemed to be impressed. Here I am thinking, ""yea, what I learned in college and in my labs are really helping me out"". But then 15 mins in, they start going into software knowledge, and how good I am in programming, I tell them about what I taught myself in PLC controllers and they ask me if I ever programmed one myself. I tell them no I haven't because I have never seen a PLC in the first place, other than online on YouTube. They were not impressed but still we moved on. Second thing, they start grilling me about different aspects of PLC controllers and I can't say anything other than what I learned online. So after getting crushed at the interview, which was suppose to last 1 hour and it ended up lasting 35 mins, one of the 3 guys shows me around the company and I leave after. I come home feeling super pissed, IF THEY FUCKING WANTED A SOFTWARE ENGINEERING WHY ARE THEY LOOKING FOR CHE's? EVEN MY ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING BUDDIES DON'T KNOW ABOUT PLCs AND NEITHER DOES MY COMPUTER SCIENCE BUDDIES. FUCK ME. Well I take the train back( $90 round trip) and I come back to J messaging me on facebook saying, that he's thinking of withdrawing from the quarter. Remember J hasn't given me any of the numbers previously mentioned. I am about to lose my fucking mind. I go to his house and we go out get some food( I pay for his food as well), cause someone came and stole his wallet. Let me say this before, this guy never locks his front door and anyone can just walk in and take his stuff without anyone knowing. So anyways I tell him before he makes any decisions, talk to our professor cause this is pretty close to turn in time. He emails the professor, and I talk to the professor today and the professor himself is stunned. This has never happened before in the last 15+ years of him teaching this class. And to make it all worse, I get a message from him today at 9:27 PM : ""Dude, I just withdrew myself from the quarter"". FUCK MY LIFE, MAN. SENIOR YEAR OF COLLEGE IS SUPPOSE TO BE FUN. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. IT'S LIKE GOD, IF HE'S REAL, IS UP THERE PLAYING THE GAME, LET'S SEE IF WE CAN DESTROY HIS SPIRIT TO LIVE. 

Come on man. I just want a break. Is it too much to ask that after 3.5 years of work, I can't relax cause of stupid bullshit. FML. 

All I'm asking is why can't I get a break man. I want to be able to relax and enjoy the end of senior year with my friends. I just want a freaking job. Is that so hard? Is it? I was already exhausted but after what happened this week I'm just on the verge of saying fuck it all. I don't give a damn anymore. "

Over my four years my best childhood friend was struck with some form of epilepsy, another committed suicide, my mom got cancer, my dad lost his job, and then the house, they lived out of a motel for a bit and then moved thousands of miles away. There was no more safety net. I got a job and thew myself into my academic program.

But I also had the time of my life. I gained new lifelong friends, found love, and became well known in my major. I got to fly places, and study abroad, and get recognized for my work. I finished classes 2 months early and secured a paid internship before that. My family life is much better and things a pretty damn shiny.

But I keep freaking the fuck out. Now that life seems pretty secure I'm suddenly insecure. I'm dreading my move to the city and keep crying almost everyday about the most trivial of shit. I really need to pack but cant bear to get my suitcase out of the closet. Tomorrow I'm selling the car that I've owned for 5 years and it hurts to even think about it. I feel like I did everything I was supposed to do as a first generation college grad, and now, after everything, I feel lost.

I don't know what I mean to say except that I really, really, am going to miss my car."
1fdwtf,7,2013-05-31,Advice on completely an internship while having social anxiety.,throwthatawaymkay,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1fdwtf/advice_on_completely_an_internship_while_having/,"Hi! I’m a longtime lurker, first time poster. I'm very anxious in social situations. Specifically, I tend to dwell on past social situations for a long time and think about how stupid/wrong/dumb I was in a previous encounter and how I should never be social again. Then I start avoiding social situations, which is problematic now that I'm in a situation that demands constant social interaction.

 The thing you’re about to read are merely current symptoms of my worrying problem. It’s a lot of shit to describe my patterns of worry and how they apply to my current situation. So skip down if you want.  

I’m going to a shiny new Washington DC internship with an organization that I like a lot. And I’m scared shitless. The reasons are 1) I’m anxious 2) I rented a room in a house sight-unseen (they gave me pictures, but I didn’t visit) and am very anxious to meet the people I’m sharing the house with 3) I feel fucking incompetent half the time. I’ll go into detail about each on.

1) A little anxious. I do get anxious in social situations. Talking to people? Fuck that shit, it’s terrifying.  My heart races, I get sweaty palms, I usually blank out. I don’t know what the fuck to talk about unless I have a “mission” to tell someone something specific (eg – “did you know Governor Deal refused to endorse the Medicaid expansion? Here, take this pamphlet!”). Despite these problems, I can usually acknowledge in the moment that there’s no reason to freak out. They’re just people. But my body doesn’t seem to listen.  And on rare occasions I freak out completely. I'm currently in freak out mode with regards to my internship.

I recieved a mass email that was given to all the other interns discussing dress code, basic rules, blahblahblah. I’m coming out of town, and I though the other interns were too, so I sent a group email to the interns on the mass email thing asking if anyone had tips on finding affordable housing. Sure enough, several interns responded with similar concerns, which I was totally relieved about. 

So a few weeks pass, and I’m about to fly to DC. I send another group email suggesting that we meet up before the start date to make things less awkward on our first day as interns. Again, I’m thinking that out-of-towners won’t know anyone and might want to find one person to hang with. Doesn’t sound like I’m anxious at all, right? WRONG. I did this to push myself out of my comfort zone. I knew that I would freak out the first day and wouldn’t be able to function unless I knew someone a little bit. I knew that meeting up awkwardly for coffee would be a little better than meeting up while under the pressure of performing well on our first day. Even writing the email was bad, though. I got frustrated and mad that I didn’t know what to say in the email. I spent 2 hours on a 3 line email. But afterwards I got a little excited because the interns seemed really receptive to the housing email, and some even suggested rooming together. I thought people would really dig my carefully crafted email.

 Oh, how quickly my excitement melted into fear and doubt. I prefaced both emails by saying something to the effect of “let me know if you don’t want to get these mass emails. I know it’s weird to email people that you don’t know.” No one told me to remove them the first time around, but I still wrote it down. So sure enough, a person gives me a short “please remove me from this mass email”. She used the same words as I did - “mass email” – which bugged me and made me feel like she was mocking me. I’m sure the reader is thinking “what did the OP expect? Of course some people will be uncomfortable with mass emailing.” Yeah, some people will be uncomfortable. But why didn’t they express this in the first email? Is it me suggesting to go somewhere? Am I going to be considered “that girl” in the office that tries reallyreally hard to get to know people? Am I annoying this person? The only reason I’m doing it is because I know if I don’t try reallyreally hard, I will completely shut down to other people. So now I’m terrified that this person hates me for sending an email that they find repellent, trying too hard, and unnecessary. Like a mass email. Will/Do other interns feel similarly ( I just sent the email out today)? Should I have never sent out an email in the first place? Will this email ruin their first impressions of me? I literally can’t think of anything else.  I want to hide under a rock. When the other interns see me, they’ll think “there’s that mass email girl. Ugh.” I don't know how to control my thoughts at the moment.

2) Sight unseen. I know, reader. You’re thinking that it was dumb as fuck to rent a room sight unseen, right? Since I can’t spend 2000 bucks on a plane ticket to see my room, I really had no choice. So I did all the research I could on the person I was renting from (a family, actually), I looked up the coordinates of the house, and I asked trip advisor peeps about the neighborhood. It all checks out well. 

EXCEPT I’m so fucking terrified of meeting these people, making small talk with them every day when I go to the kitchen, and asking them for the wifi password. They’re picking me up from the airport upon my arrival, and I have no idea of what to say when I see them. I’m even more worried because their first generation immigrants, and it’s very difficult to understand them (on the phone at least). What if I can’t understand them? What if I offend them? I’m starting to think stuff like “well…I don’t have to use the kitchen…I can just live off of trail mix and water from the bathroom sink for 3 months!” I know that will be rough. How do I talk to people that I know nothing about, have nothing in common with, and might/might not understand? How do I relax?

3) Incompetence. This internship is with a nonprofit that I like a lot. It’s the kind of place where you’re always learning about what you don’t know. I feel like I’ll be less informed/less social/a total dumbass compared to the other people there. I sort of did that at my last internship. How do I not worry about that?

 

**tl;dr: I sent out a mass email that someone got annoyed with and I feel terrible about it. I’m moving into a house with people I don’t know and I don’t know how to talk to them. I feel fucking stupid. How do I stop getting anxious about these things?**

I'd prefer advice that doesn't involve medication or therapy - I cannot afford it. 


PS: Title should read ""completing an internship."" I feel so fucking stupid. "
1fdq9z,0,2013-05-30,Third year Chemical Engineer. Stuck on where to go.,shuckedoyster,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1fdq9z/third_year_chemical_engineer_stuck_on_where_to_go/,"Hi guys,

I'm finishing up my third year of Chemical Engineering in university and I honestly don't know what I want to do with my major.  Currently I have an internship at a company that works with elastomers, which is something that I don't wish to pursue in the future.  I am also minoring in Computer Science and take interest in the subject greatly.  I was wondering whether there is a specialization in Chem E that sort of utilizes knowledge from both.  What are some possible career options that I can pursue?"
1fdkw6,23,2013-05-30,Why GT has brought out the best in me in the worst of conditions.,GTretroguy,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1fdkw6/why_gt_has_brought_out_the_best_in_me_in_the/,"This is a throwaway, because I'm now pretty sure all my friends know my real account. Anyways, I'm not sure where to start, but I don't think anyone else is unaware to the shitty conditions that can exist when attending Tech. As far as what I've dealt with, classes can be abysmal, it can be tough to find other students you connect with due to the anti social nature of many engineers (including myself sometimes even), and Atlanta isn't exactly the best of places. I also don't think that it goes without saying that the reason we're all posting about the clubs we have around this time is to get to know more people/get involved in a hobby for some enjoyment. It's easy to come to Tech, plaster this place as a shitshow, and either become incredibly unhappy or leave. 

After working my first internship a bit, I'm here to say...it doesn't get much better! Stop talking about how bad you wanna graduate (unless your a 5th year...), because the real world is just as freaking boring, just in other ways. Pretty much all of the engineers at the massive company I'm working for have a hard time holding a conversation, even the other interns. Just like working at Tech to get involved and meet people, it gets 10x harder when you start a job. Don't get caught in the grass is greener type mentality. College can be the best time of your life. Get out. Have fun.

Here at Tech, I first fit into another one of those in the first category I described: I felt that this place ruined me after my freshman year. I was absolutely unhappy with life because I didn't really do anything, developed some anxiety issues, and blamed this school for EVERYTHING. In my future years, I've taken the more laid back approach, calmed down a ton, met more people, taken up 100 different hobbies. I stopped blaming this place for making me a certain way, and learned that if one day is complete shit, tomorrow can only be better. If you can't figure out that thermo problem and it's 3 am, go the fuck to sleep. Tackle it tomorrow with some help from someone else in the class. I generally love life now, even at Tech. It's a little bit of work to get to know others, but it's so worth it. Tech really does contain some of the best people. We're all incredibly similar anyways right?

A lot of my friends/family have said I've come leaps and bounds in such a short time. My advice is to do what everyone is posting about now! Get involved. Meet some other people. You'll find some gems in this school. Stop blaming this place for certain issues. Is it Tech's fault that I took life way too seriously and studied myself into depression? Yes, you have to work when you get here, but working hard doesn't have to make you unhappy.

Please let me know your opinions here. I haven't really shared much of my story, but I guess some advice to any incoming freshmen or students that are having a rough time. Let me know what you think.
