15sfyq,10,2013-01-01,"16 and considering dropping out of highschool for the sake of learning, am I being stupid?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/15sfyq/16_and_considering_dropping_out_of_highschool_for/,"So, let me elaborate a little.

I discovered programming when I was 14 and learned C/C++ during a couple of my classes with the help of a few books. Ever since, I have never been so sure of what I want to do for a living. Learning how to program almost inspired me to begin to learn about the full story, about how computers operate. I always knew that I wanted to do something tech related (I guess that's what spending tons of time on the computer does to you), but now I was sure.

Unfortunately, I still feel as though I cannot do anything close to what I hoped for.

Let me say that I pretty much have a hatred for school, not because of what it aims to do, but how it does it. I could go on a rant, but i'll just try to get to the point. I cannot learn anywhere close to the amount of stuff I want to learn about computers mostly due to highschool, and i'm afraid the same will apply to college. So now I have these thoughts floating around in my head, ""why should I bother with highschool when I can teach just myself?"" I really wish it were that simple. 

With that said, I have a couple of questions:
Is it realistic to expect being able to land a job in the CS field as a highschool dropout, assuming that the person has the required knowledge for the job?
If so, what are the kinds of things you would need on your resume to have an employer consider you in the first place?
Would it be possible to find an internship as a hs dropout?
Am I being stupid?

Any additional advice/words of insight would be greatly appreciated. Really. After all, I am only 16. I don't know anything. All I know is what I am interested in.

Thanks."

I am currently a freshman, and I am currently looking at Mechanical Engineering or Computer Science as prospective majors. Since it's the long winter break at the moment, I decided to look up possible summer internships. The google search results overwhelmed me, and I was not able to find any websites that looked credible enough to me. I know there are people here who have been through this internship mania before, so I took it to this subreddit to seek an answer. 

Alright, I'll stop giving background info. **So, what is the best way to look for an internship?** Are there any particular websites that you guys would recommend? Is there a university-based search engine that I could use to look up these opportunities? (with 'search engine', I meant something like the powerful Summon for credible library content)

All of your help is appreciated! Thank you. :)


EDIT: I am looking at CS as a major at this moment, but by the end of the second semester I will not have completed any specific CS classes (except for the introductory one, 131/132). So basically, I won't have any specific experience in the field of Computer Science. On the other end, I will have completed two Mech E. courses - (EMAE 160 &amp; EMAE 250). I'm guessing this will affect my chances of getting an internship with a CS-based company."
15ryxh,34,2013-01-01,What do I do with this toxic friendship?,thedictatorscut,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/15ryxh/what_do_i_do_with_this_toxic_friendship/,"Okay, I'm not sure where else to put this, so TwoX it is. There should be (or is there?) a sub directly related to solving female friendship problems. I don't know. But anyway.

So I've been friends with this girl for about three years, and in the time that I've known her, she's become steadily more awful to be around. She has one of the most self-defeating personalities I've ever encountered, and constantly sabotages herself and her future, then complains about it to me. She's 22 and has never had sex, a boyfriend, or even been kissed, which she also complains about constantly to me. (She's not bad-looking, either - at most, she's chubby, which she *also* complains about all the time, but when I've offered to make her my running buddy, she got upset and said - direct quote - ""Who says I *need* to improve myself? Besides, I never even ran in gym class, I'd fail at it if I tried now."" See what I mean by self-defeating?) She's floundering in her career and blames it on the fact that she went to a no-name school instead of one of the top institutions for her field, but instead of just putting herself out there and trying to get internships, part-time/freelance gigs, etc., she works a retail job she hates and complains about how the privileged kids at the ""good"" schools are taking all of ""her"" opportunities. She wants to do comedy professionally, but she won't sign up for improv or sketch writing classes. She only really cares about a TV show and its stars, which is seriously depressing and boring to talk about. If we're hanging out and I try to bring up something that's been weighing on my mind - guy troubles, for instance - she twists it around into how at least I *have* a guy to have trouble with, but she's forever alone, and now she's going to talk for ten minutes about that. Even when I go out of my way to include her in group activities with other people she doesn't know very well, she gets clingy and then sullen, and keeps me from being able to enjoy hanging out with my *other* friends.

Also, she freely admits she has depression and anxiety attacks, but she won't go to a therapist because she had a bad experience with therapy one time, and she won't try to get medication because... she just won't. I don't know why.

Needless to say, this has put quite a strain on our relationship. It seems like a lot of the time, I'm hanging out with her because I feel *obligated* to - because I know she'll throw a fit if she sees on social media or whatever that a couple of her mutual friends and I went to the movies together without inviting her, or because she texts me moaning about how no one has invited her out for New Year's Eve. (Guess how I spent last night?) I really liked her as a person when I first met her, and we do share a few interests, so she's a good activity partner and person to see movies with, etc. But sometimes, hanging out with her just makes me depressed and upset, and I don't know how to handle that. I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around her to avoid upsetting/offending her, and it's not worth it to me, because she doesn't offer much in return - she rarely invites *me* to hang out or does much to show that she appreciates me, but acts as though she's entitled to my friendship.

I know that the adult answer here is to just be direct and tell her, tactfully but truthfully, about what I'm feeling. But the thing is, I've tried that before, and she absolutely cannot take criticism of any kind. A few months ago I tried politely suggesting that she read some recipe blogs and learn how to cook (she was complaining about wasting money on $10 sandwiches at work every day) and it ended with her telling me that I was making her feel like a failure and threatening suicide. So yeah, clearly that's off the table.

I honestly just need some sort of advice here. Has anyone ever been in a friendship like this? Is there any way I can gracefully get out of it without it being obvious that I'm abandoning *her*? Now that I've written it all out, I see how clearly toxic this whole situation is - but I'm one of only a few friends she has and I definitely feel obligated to stick it out just for her sake. I don't know. I'd really appreciate any advice you ladies have for me.

**TL;DR: I need help gracefully extricating myself from a friendship wherein I can't talk truthfully or directly with the other person.**"

I have an interview for my dream internship in February.
I've been on one date my whole life, and that was a year ago.  I mustered up the balls to ask a cutie in my Econ class out at the end of the semester, and she said yes.  We'll see each other when we get back.
My GPA is shit but I always hated school until recently.  There's still time.

I feel like if I don't step up now, it'll be a huge setback.  

I will learn as much as I can about the Android platform.  I will get that job.  It might work out with the girl and it might not, but if not it won't be because I was a nervous fuck with a self-conscious tone of voice.  This won't happen with future girls, either. 

I will maintain a more active social life.  I will come on Reddit less (sorry guys).  I will only facebook someone when I plan on talking to them.  I will not let my past limit my present interactions.  I will build something cool.  
I may weird people out, but it will stop being because I'm feeling awkward or insecure.  I may have to work on this.  

I will feel comfortable whether or not I lose my virginity.  I will stop having those moments where I feel like a shittier person because no one wants to bang me.  How about the fact that I haven't been in a relationship?  That shows more about my ability to communicate.

I will actively monitor my list of shit to do.  I will eat healthy as FUCK.  I will become a better musician.

I will get some A's, and maybe sleep sometimes.

I will stop comparing myself to others.  I'm not them, and I'll never be closer to them than a shittier knockoff.

I can't do all of this if I keep fapping for an hour a day.  Here's to 2013.  Good luck, everyone else :)"
15riu7,3,2013-01-01,[21/f] How to tell friend [18/m] to grow up without being mean?,pikapikapikaCHUU,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/15riu7/21f_how_to_tell_friend_18m_to_grow_up_without/,"During my summer job at a summer camp, I became friends with a volunteer [18/m]. My boyfriend [21/m] was away for the summer months on an internship halfway around the world. This volunteer (we shall name him Jason) and I became really close friends really fast, and we found ourselves sending texts to each other very often. He would come early or stay late when his shift was different than mine just so he could hang out with me. 

He is a very shy and introverted person who feels very uncomfortable in a crowd. Of our group of staff, I was the only one he was comfortable approaching and talking to. Jason started telling me about his past relationships (or lack thereof) and about his insecurities. As he had just graduated from high school, he was very nervous about going to college and starting a new life. Since I was entering my fourth year of university, you could say that I was much more experienced than him, and therefore, I frequently tried to give him advice. He has since then thought of me as a close friend who listens to him and from whom he can seek advice. He complains to me all the time about not having made many friends in high school and regretting it. He feels that he only has female friends and has no “bros” and he constantly frets over it. I tell him that he’s starting a new life in college, so just learn from his mistakes and not to worry too much, that he’ll find many more like-minded individuals in college to make friends with. 

As close as we were however, even during the summer, he was constantly worried about my SO coming back. He has never been in any past relationships before and he feels that he can't be friends with girls who are in relationships. For some reason, he feels like girls who are in relationships can't be good friends while being in a relationship. I tried my best to convince him that it is possible to do both: to be a good friend and a gf at the same time. I once asked him, ""You know I have a bf, and we're still friends now. Why can't we be friends once my bf is back?"" His reply to me was that it didn't feel like my bf was there, and he was worried that my bf would take up all of my time.

At the end of the summer, he admitted to me that he liked me, and said, “I love you as a sister, but I would date you if you didn’t have a bf.” He has since then said “I love you” to me once in a while, but I never responded to it, since he knew that I didn’t like him that way.

A couple weeks ago, it was my birthday, and I planned to go out with some close friends for dinner, and I asked if he’d be interested in joining us. He was cautious at first, but said sure, even though I told him that he doesn’t have to if he felt uncomfortable. He assured me that he would go and promised that he would make an effort to get to know my friends and talk to him. However, the night of the dinner, he remained unsociable throughout the night even though I placed him next to someone he has met before a couple of times. He answered any questions that my friends asked with a simple yes or no, and snuck off to the washroom half a dozen of times. At the end of the night, he didn’t even bother saying bye and just walked off towards the bus. 

I have not talked to him since then, since I can’t stop myself from feeling disappointed and upset that he didn’t even bother to make an effort to be sociable. I wasn’t asking him to be best friends with them or anything, I just expected more of him. He has tried to contact me every day since then (facebook messages, msn, texts, phone calls…), but I have yet to answer. It’s been over a week and last night, I received a message from him saying that he was giving up, yet he called me twice that night. I have no idea what I should do… he is so socially awkward and I feel like I’ve just been too reassuring and babying him. He needs someone to tell him to grow up and suck it up, but I don’t want to be mean. What should I do?

TL;DR: Made a friend 3 years younger to me who says he loves me despite knowing I have a bf. He is socially awkward and whiney and I am tired of babying him. How to break it to him that he needs to grow up without hurting him too much?

December 30, 2012


I just woke up and thought I should write this down before I forget. I haven’t been sleeping that much lately, which is why I am just now waking up. The paranoia and fear is just getting worse as the case goes on. I had this really weird dream. I was in a field. Just a field like you would normally think of when you think about fields. Trees everywhere with shrubs at their bases. There were some deer off in the distance and I could hear birds chirping. The sun was shining. As I stood there thinking about how this would be a good place to come and think. I started thinking about my childhood. I used to come to a field just like this and play with my dogs. They loved to play fetch in the grass. When it was really tall they loved to sneak up on me or leap over the grass like gazelles. 


I thought it was a dream about that. But as soon as the sun vanished and the clouds covered the air, I knew this was no dream – but a nightmare – and not one that was about my dog filled childhood. 


When the clouds covered the sky, the plants all died. The trees lost their leaves, the grass turned brown, the flowers wilted where they stood. The deer dropped dead and the birds fell from the sky. There was a smell in the air that I can’t even begin to describe; it was so disgusting. Beyond disgusting. Like rotten flesh and rotten eggs and rotten milk all combined together. I watched as all the deer dropped to the ground and I ran to them thinking there could be a way for me to help. But when I got there, there was nothing I could do. Their flesh was already rotting and parasites had already come to eat the meat off their bones. 


Suddenly, I heard a loud, low groaning sound. It was coming from all around me. It sounded like it was coming from the trees. I couldn’t escape it by running. It just got louder and louder the longer I was in that field. I saw some concrete stairs going into the ground. I watched myself run. It kept switching from first person view to third person. It was really disorienting. I kept going towards the stairs and then hurried down them. At the bottom of the stairs there was a beat up wooden door. Something told me I shouldn’t open the door, no matter how badly I wanted to escape that groaning sound. That I should force myself to wake up and just keep going on with my life, without opening that door. But of course, like in all nightmares and typical Hollywood teen screams, your gut is ignored.

 
I opened the door. It creaked and it felt like it was going to fall off its hinges. There were scratches all over the back side of the door. Like someone had been trying to escape. It was cold as I entered the hallway the door lead to. Ice cold. I shivered. I didn’t know if I was shivering from fear or from the cold. Either one was entirely plausible. I closed the door behind me and the groaning stopped instantly.


 It was pitch black dark, but I walked down the hall anyways. I tried to move quickly, but my feet felt like they were made of lead. It felt like each step took five minutes. It was driving me crazy. I put my hands on the walls to guide me. I felt inscriptions on the wall, but I couldn’t tell what they said. I patted my pockets to see if my cell phone was there. It was, so I pulled it out of my pocket and when I went to open it to shine light on the wall, it shocked me and I dropped it. I winced and shook my hand to get the pain to stop. I went to pick it up off the ground, but it turned to dust as my hand touched it. The dust was unusually warm and more ashy than grainy. I stumbled forward, keeping my hands on the walls to guide me. I felt more inscriptions, but I wouldn’t find out till later what they were. I felt a corner and slid my hands onto the cold wall in front of me. As I felt it, trying to find an escape, I felt a handle. I put my hand on it, tried to push or pull the door open. It wouldn’t budge. So I tried sliding it open. And that worked. It slid open with a loud bang. 


I walked into the room and slid the door closed behind me. The lighting was like a doctor’s office. The kind of light that washes out your skin and makes it look blue. I always hated that light. The room looked like the morgue in the hospitals. In the middle of the room there was a metal table, shiny and eerily clean. Like it had never been used. Along the walls there were drawers you put dead bodies in. The room smelled strongly of sulfur.  Next to the table there was a little cart with various surgery tools on it. I walked towards it carefully. Every step I took was deafening. I got to the table and picked up the first tool I saw, a Stryker saw. My dad was a coroner so he would always talk about that stuff over dinner, which I really didn’t appreciate. The only time I put up with it was when I was doing an internship for him when I was trying to decide what part of the police world I wanted to join. 


I started thinking about how I had to watch him use various saws to cut ribs open to get to the heart. I remembered the blood everywhere and dropped the saw on the ground, forgetting I was holding it. It hit the leg of the cart and all the tools fell onto the ground. The metal clanked against the tiles on the ground. The sound was just as deafening as my footsteps had been. When the sound stopped, I started to look around the rest of the room. It was back in third person. I watched myself wander around the room. My other self looked into the file drawers that weren’t full of bodies. He pulled out some papers and looked at them. All the files were in a different language, but neither me nor the other me could tell which language it was. I watched myself find a single paper in English, talking about the Lake Bodom murders. I remember Googling the case a couple years ago out of curiosity because one of my favorite bands was named after them. No one ever found out who committed them. Maybe Stitch was behind those attacks too... Then suddenly I was back in first person. As soon as I oriented myself, I started hearing banging and moaning. I looked around the room and saw the body drawers shaking. I heard people pleading to be let out, moaning and groaning, begging. I started panicking and ran to the corner. I sat on the ground and covered my ears and closed my eyes, hoping against all hope that the sound would stop. And it did. It wasn’t a good quiet though. It was a scary quiet. Eerie. The quiet went on for what felt like forever until the loud groaning sound from the field started again. I walked to the sliding door trying to find a way to escape it again. I opened the door but couldn’t see anything. My eyes were still adjusting to the darkness in the hall. Once they did, I saw Stitch standing at the end of the hallway. You could only see one of his arms. He took a step forward and then I could see him holding his chains behind his back. 


“Are you trying to hide?” Stitch said. 


“Where am I?” I asked. 


“We are inside your memories,” he replied. 


“Why?”


“I want to ruin your best memories. I feed off fear and anger. I killed the animals and turned the sky gray. Now look behind you and feel more fear,” Stitch said. All of a sudden there was the stench of rotten flesh and blood in the air. I turned around slowly. As I turned around I slipped and hit my head on one of the counters. I put my hand on my head to ease the pain and closed my eyes. When I opened them, I looked at my hands and they were covered in blood. I looked around the rest of the room and the floor was flooded with blood. Papers covered the floor. I looked at the body drawers and saw all of them were open. The dead bodies inside them were sitting up on their metal beds, smiling, with dead eyes and pale skin. One had a gunshot wound on his head with crusted blood around the edges. Another had his throat slit. Another was severely burned; his skin was blackened. Their smiles were still and frozen. Like mannequins. I turned back to look at Stitch again. His arm was still bent back. 


“Meet my latest victim. Courtesy of you.” He grabbed his chains with both of his hands. He jerked someone roughly. As the mystery person went flying through the air, Stitch jerks him back by the neck even more roughly than before. It yelped and cried in pain. He landed right in front of Stitch. There was a chain around his neck. It could’ve come off, but there were spikes driven into his neck, keeping them in place. The holes in his neck kept oozing blood. His legs were broken off at the knee. His femur was sticking out. The skin and muscle were all torn, still bleeding. From his bottom lip to half way down his neck, the skin was gone. The muscle was disturbingly red, bloody… it made me want to puke. It seemed like every pore in his body was blood oozing out of it. He was so beat up. Some of his teeth were missing. His hair was torn out in chunks. His arms and chest had gruesome scratches all over them. His eye lids were missing. His eyes were dried and shriveled. There were chunks of his face missing, along with the rest of his body. 


“You know who I am,” Stitch’s victim said. 


“No I don’t,” I said quietly, scared. 


“Yes you do. You watched me get taken away.”


“RepetitiveRoutine,” he said. Then it hit me. I recognized his short dark brown hair with its slight curl. I felt a fit of tears coming and held them back. Suddenly, RepetitiveRoutine came loose and started bounding towards me. He ran on his fists, like an ape. While he ran, he screamed blood curdling screams. Terrified, I stumbled back and ran as fast as I could to the corner of the morgue-like room. I slammed the door and as soon as the sound rang through my ears I woke up. Or at least I thought I did. 


“You need to wake up, Ryan. It’s time to have breakfast,” a voice said. I found myself in my childhood bedroom, cuddled up in my Scooby Doo sheets. I rolled over and saw my mom watching me. Before I could answer her, Stitch came up behind her. He loomed over her. He was wearing a blue button up shirt with slacks. He put his hand on her shoulder. She put hers over his. 
“Hey, honey. I’m just trying to wake up Ryan,” she said. 


“Wake up, son,” Stitch said. Stitch was playing the part of my dad. But my mom couldn’t even tell that my dad wasn’t there. She couldn’t tell what was coming for her. Naked again, Stitch tore her skin off in one piece and danced with it, laughing. I was left frozen in terror. And even with her skin missing, my mom stood there smiling. After a little bit of dancing, he tore her skin in half. The back of her landed on the floor and he held up the front in front of him. He put his eyes where hers should be, wore her like a mask. 


“Good morning, baby,” he said, mocking my mother’s voice. He stuck his tongue through her lips and wiggled it around at me like a child, and started laughing again, even louder. All the while, my mother was standing there, all meat, just looking at me. Stitch dropped the rest of her skin on the ground and grabbed her veins from her ankles and wrists. He wrapped them together and swung her around, her feet touching her hands. As he swung her around, her blood splattered all over the room. It flew onto my face and I nearly threw up. I tried to get up off my bed and run away, but before I could reach the door, Stitch pushed me against the window. A piece of broken glass cut my back, leaving a huge scratch. I woke up for real then, drenched in sweat. 


I went to the bathroom before I started writing this. There’s a scratch on my back… I’m going to go to the hospital now and get this checked out. 
I just thought of this… My dad’s still alive. Why was Stitch pretending to be him in my dream if he’s still here? Maybe I should go stay with him for a while… 


I know you guys have been wondering about Anna too. I still haven't heard from her. It's been a while now, a week and a half... I'm starting to get worried. She won't answer her phone, her emails. There isn't even anyone there when I go knock on her door. This is getting distressing. What should I do?

There was a social event over the holidays, but I was out of town and wasn't able to make it.  As far as I know, the event was for upcoming full-time time hires, summer interns, and the recruiting teams.  It was held during the day and seemed like it was going to be pretty casual.

I may be overreacting but I'm wondering if missing this sort of thing is looked down upon?  I'm trying to start my career out on the best foot possible, and for some reason I have been stressing over missing this event."

A little background first:

The past summer internship that I had at Company X, I'm pretty sure I did a great job, and my hiring manager has told me that if I wanted to come back, I should send him an email, and he would help see if there are opportunities to come back.  Basically, I have an inside track in obtaining another internship there again.

While that is wonderful, I'm still looking for other opportunities because my internship at Company X didn't quite align with what I wanted to do for the future (however, it is still a wonderful Company to work for, and would look good on my resume).  That being said, I'm applying for another internship at Company Y, and it asked me to list references.  I'll be able to provided references from Company X (unfortunately, they would be my only good ones, and I wouldn't really have any other references to choose from), but I'm worried because if I get rejected from Company Y, would that hurt my chances with Company X?  I get the sense that it would be awkward if I ask the references to help me get another internship at Company Y, even if I plan on applying at Company X again.

Hopefully this is clear, and thanks for any help!

What about this girl, I thought. Did she need my help? If so, was I in any position to help? I took a few steps closer to get a better look at her.

She turned to face me, her head rocking with her body as she straddled a large, padded beam. Her feet and hands were held down by thick leather straps, and another one ran over her back, leaving her immobilized. She said nothing, and her expression was blank. If anything, she seemed mildly annoyed by my presence.

I mouthed the words, ""Are you okay?"" to her.

""The bitches don't speak,"" the man said as he continued thrusting in her.

""Is she -- is she drugged?"" I asked.

""I don't put drugs in my livestock.""

""I'm sorry? Your livestock?""

""You heard me.""

The man slapped the girl's ass and tugged again at her hair. She closed her eyes as her head tilted back and gave a satisfied grin. With her head raised, I could see her breasts hanging down, and I was suddenly struck by how beautiful she was. I've always been partial to girls. Had a few flings in college, and even a girlfriend for a brief time. So it wasn't a total surprise that I would respond to her, but in this context I found myself...well, confused, to say the least.

""You call her livestock? But she's a person. A human being.""

""Not here,"" the man said, slowing his rhythm down to address me. ""In here she's just a dumb animal. Her purpose is to take cock and get filled up with cum. That's what all my livestock are for.""

""All?"" I turned my head, suddenly noticing all the girls looking out over the gates of their stalls. There were at least a dozen of them.

""Oh my God,"" I said. ""What have you done to these girls?""

""I told you, they're not girls. They're livestock. And I haven't done anything to them that they didn't want done.""

I looked at their faces, vacant and pliant, seeing nothing to contradict what he was saying.

""That's not possible,"" I said. ""You've kidnapped them. You're some kind of sick fucking sadistic monster!""

The man chuckled. ""I'm not going to tell you I'm normal. But I'm no sadist. I treat my livestock as well as they deserve to be treated, and they all very much appreciate my affections. I don't know what it is, exactly. I just have a way with them. Now shut your damn mouth for a minute. This bitch is gonna cum for me.""

The man tugged at her hair with both hands, raising her head as far as the strap on her back would let it go. He leaned back, ramming himself deeper into her cunt and yielding moans from her that clearly indicated the height of an orgasm. I was silenced by her beauty, and for the first time I registered in my mind something that felt like...envy.

""That's a good pony,"" the man said. ""Keep on it. Squeeze that cunt around me. Here it comes."" He grunted, then froze, and spasmed. The girl's ass smacked rapidly against him as he unloaded himself in her. When he was finished, he released her hair and let her flop back down on the mount, seemingly unconscious.

He pulled his cock out, still somewhat hard and dripping with his fluid and hers, then walked over to a bench right next to the mount. To my surprise, another girl emerged from behind the bench, naked and on her hands and knees. Apparently she'd been there the whole time. She rose up as the man approached her and took his cock in her hand, then began licking it clean.

He turned to me as the girl took him all the way inside her mouth. ""Still think they're here against their will?""

I was speechless. Not knowing what to say, I blurted the first question that came to mind.

""Where did all these girls come from?""

""Oh, I've got a connection that delivers them to me. It's a law firm back in the city. I give them a lot of business, so they take in candidates I select, tell them they're 'interns' or some bullshit, then send them out to me on fool errands.""

My eyes bulged. I gasped audibly. And I swear to god my nipples sprung up right there on the spot. In amongst all the fear and anger and disgust, I don't think I'd ever been more turned on."

Prior to this, I was a business and mathematics double major. I'm only a semester behind on my Comp Eng. major because of the math classes and programming class that I have taken.

I have been a member of 3 organizations, but they're all business related and I'm afraid that this will confuse a potential employer. I also am not confident in my ability to answer technical interview questions seeing that I have not taken very many classes related to my major.

Do you think it's worth applying for internships now, or would it be better to wait a semester and get some classes out of the way and join an engineering organization? I would really like to get an internship this summer, but I'm not sure if it's possible. I'm afraid that if I don't find an internship this summer, I'll have a lot of trouble getting an internship as a junior and ultimately have trouble getting a job. I'll be all caught up after I take a class or two over the summer, so would it just be better to wait until then to apply?"

I feel like I've missed out on a big part of my life by going off to college with a girlfriend and not getting any time on my own, isolated from everyone I used to know, to just develop as myself in a new environment. My weekends are all automatically filled with spending time with her, and it's often stressful on me to have to find something that we'd both enjoy. Then again, this may be me blaming her and finding an excuse for introversion at college.

I also will hopefully be getting an internship next summer across the country. She says she's happy that I got an interview and wants me to get the internship, but then she just nags about how we're going to see each other over the summer, what is she supposed to do while I'm in California with my job, etc. 

In general I know she's much more involved in this relationship than I am. She talks about how she wants to marry me, plans for what to do after we get married, and so on, and talking about those topics makes me uncomfortable. Yet, I feel like I'm being unfair to her because I don't share those feelings right now, and I don't want to hurt her by telling her she can't discuss it with me. I feel like these feelings are my fault for not putting enough effort into the relationship.

So I thought about breaking up with her, and convinced myself to do it. Then we sat down and talked, and I told her what was happening with the job/relationship, and she didn't say much. She feels guilty, like she's done something wrong, and I don't want her to feel bad. This stuff bothers me, but I don't want it to hurt her, and I prefer that she get stuff out there in the open instead of bottling it up.

She treats me so well, and she is so honest with me that I feel bad having these thoughts about breaking up with her. I know I have it well, and I'm very lucky to have her, but I just don't feel the relationship anymore. But then we have talks like the one I just described, and I realize how lucky I am with her, and I start to feel for her again. At this point it feels like I should stay with her, but I also have a part of my mind that says otherwise, and I don't know what to do.

tl;dr: Spent a long time with this girlfriend, shared a lot, but feel trapped and like I'm missing out, but then when I bring stuff up with her, I feel a rekindling, and don't know if I should keep at this or let it go finally"

The lights come on and I hear a door open. The girls raise their heads to look out over their stalls as our captor steps in. He's a large man, dressed all in denim and wearing a cowboy hat. He keeps his head tipped down so we can't see his face.

He walks past stall after stall and I can sense each girl's heart racing as he moves on, leaving them be. He reaches my stall and I hear the hay floor crunch under his boot as he comes to a stop. He opens my gate and steps in, barely acknowledging me on my hands and knees before him. He clears his throat and spits. Without looking down, he unlocks my chain from the wall and gives it a yank, choking me and forcing me to crawl toward him.

The man in the cowboy hat leads me out into the center of the stable, past a stack of hay bales and into a clearing where all the other girls can see me. I crawl in time with his steps, keeping my head bowed as he leads me toward the leather mount he's built in the center of the stable. I know that today is my day. I am his livestock and I've finally been chosen for breeding.

***

How long have I been here? I can't even remember. Days, maybe weeks. I was an intern at a law firm. We needed signatures from one of our biggest clients and he couldn't be reached, so I drew the short straw and had to drive out to his ranch to get them in person. When I arrived, no one answered the doorbell, but the lights were on, there was a car in the driveway, and I'd driven an hour to get here, so I walked around back.

I found this stable, and I could hear music blasting inside, so I opened the door and peeked in. I found a dark, empty hallway. The music was much louder and it was coming from just around the corner. It sounded like 80's rock. Van Halen or something.

""Hello?! Is someone in there?...I'm from the law firm! I just have some documents that need to be signed!""

No response.

I thought about leaving, then I thought again about the miserable, hour long drive it took to get out here, so I stepped into the stable and let the door swing closed behind me.

The music became deafening as I walked down the hall. Reaching the end, I leaned into the corner and poked my head around to see where it was coming from. And that's when I first saw the man in the cowboy hat, his pants around his knees with his bare ass exposed. His belt buckle was jingling with each thrust as he pushed himself into some girl he had strapped on his leather mount. You'd think I would have run instantly, but I didn't. I was too shocked. Instead I just stared. I watched him pull at the girl's hair, then grab her hips and rock them in time with his thrusting. I heard him grunting, first quietly and then loudly as the girl's bottom smacked harder and harder against his belly. I had no idea if I was witnessing a rape or just a very kinky couple, but whatever was going on, it was clear the man was about to cum in her. Of course, part of me wanted desperately to leave, but I couldn't. For some reason, I had to stay until the man finished inside the girl. I had to watch her get filled...

And then, without warning, the pounding drums and cheesy, wailing guitars ground to a halt. And just as the song ended, wouldn't you know it, the pile of documents I had stuffed under my arm spilled out in front of me. For a moment, the only sounds in the room were grunting and smacking, and then it was me screaming at the pile of paper on the floor.

Both the man and woman froze. The girl turned to look at me, but the man kept facing forward. I dashed for the door and tried to slam it open. When that failed, I twisted and tugged at the knob. But it was useless. I saw the lock above the knob and realized the door couldn't be opened from the inside without a key.

""Shit shit shit!"" I screamed, pulling and pushing and pounding my fist on the door in faint hope that someone would get me out of this awful situation. Around the corner, I could hear the man's belt buckle jingling as he slowly pulled his pants up and zipped them. I turned to see him walking calmly toward me, his face cast in shadow.

""You interrupted me,"" he said.

""I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I don't know what to say, I --""

""I don't give a shit what you have to say. You have trespassed on my property and you are an intruder.""

""I was sent here by my office. I just need to collect some --""

""Why don't you shut the fuck up. You're not collecting anything until I'm done fucking."" The man turned and started walking away, as if that had settled things.

I was left alone at the door, totally disregarded. I realized that in seconds, he'd have his pants down again, and if I was going to get out of this situation, I'd better say something fast. I followed him back toward his mount, stopping to collect my papers.

""Excuse me, sir,"" I said. ""I don't want to disturb you any longer. If you could just open the door, I'll be on my way and we'll get the signatures from you some other time.""

""Nope,"" he replied. ""You're not going anywhere. Go cower in the corner if you want, or stay here and watch me. But I'm full of cum and these bitches need to be bred, so that's gonna get done."" And with that, he dropped his pants and exposed his penis to me, then turned and slid it back into the girl.""

And there I was again, standing there watching, this time in plain view. I could have done as he suggested, I suppose, and cowered by the door waiting for him to finish. But in the moment, that seemed really stupid. Almost immature. He was acting totally unphased, and it made me feel ridiculous for freaking out.

So I stood there. And I watched..."
15tfz2,6,2013-01-02,I can't control my anxiety and my life is falling apart.  I could really use some help.,ChocolateMagic,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/15tfz2/i_cant_control_my_anxiety_and_my_life_is_falling/,"Hi /r/anxiety,

I'm 22, male, senior in college, and I feel like my life is falling apart.

I think I just need to vent and tell my story, but if someone knows how I can get through this, then please tell me.

I've always been an anxious person.  When I was young, I was terrified of house fires.  When I was in middle school, I was extremely terrified that people were judging me for being overweight.  Throughout high school, I hardly did anything besides play WoW.  College, though, really changed things for me.  I began exercising, competed in ballroom dance, made wonderful friends, and met the most amazing woman in the whole world.  After almost 3 years, she broke up with me a week ago and I've been even more of a mess ever since.  My anxiety was out of control before, however, and I don't blame her for needing to distance herself from me.  Anyway, back to my story.

i mentioned before that I've always been an anxious person, but never has it been as bad as it has this past year.  It started last year around this time when I had my first panic attack.  I laid down to sleep and I was unusually aware of my heartbeat.  I also developed this strange sensation in my left arm and chest.  I couldn't get the idea that I was having a heart attack out of my head.  After a visit to the ER and an Ativan, I was sent home with the full understanding that my symptoms were caused by anxiety.  

But knowing that it was anxiety didn't help me.  I would go on to have panic attacks almost every night after that for the remainder of the Spring semester of Junior year.  My grades fell, my friendships dwindled, my relationship with my girlfriend strained.  I couldn't get to class since I would be up until 5am having a panic attack and then sleep until 3pm.  I would wake up and be anxious and just sit at my computer trying to distract myself.  I visited the ER countless times because each time I was CONVINCED that I was having a heart attack.

Junior year finally ended and I managed (somehow) to get an internship for the summer.  And for almost the entirety of my internship, my anxiety was nonexistent.  I flew across the country and worked in a state I had never been to with people I had never met before doing scientific research at a fairly high level and I WASN'T ANXIOUS!  I didn't have a single panic attack until one of the days prior to the day my deliverables were due when I woke with an irregular heartbeat due to the stress I had been under (at the time, I thought I was dying, of course).  But it was amazing, I had virtually no anxiety the entire time I was there.  

The summer ends and I realized that I have a gluten intolerance.  For years I've had incredibly bad gas and heartburn, but I never connected the dots until one night when I had Turkey Tetrazzini and had gas so painful and heartburn so fierce that I couldn't spend time with the people I was with.  Anyway, I went gluten-free and my gas/heartburn went away overnight.  

And then I had the best 6 weeks of my entire life.  It was the start of my Senior year and I hit it hard.  My classes were going better than ever, I was exercising 3-4 times a week, I was gaining muscle mass and feeling good about my body, my relationship with my girlfriend was amazing, and I was eating very well and gluten-free.  I felt so great about everything.  

I had the worst night of my life after those 6 awesome weeks.  Seemingly out of the blue, I started to feel incredibly nauseous.  The more I thought about it, the worse it got and after 5 hours of horrible bowel movements and incredible nausea, I went to the ER and they told me I was fine.  But my mind wouldn't stop.  What if I have cancer?  What if I have something serious that needs to be discovered ASAP?  I googled a hundred diseases and thought I had stomach cancer one day and thyroid cancer the next.  Also, I noticed that I had ""Jock itch"" and instead of realizing that it was harmless, I began to have trickles of anxious thoughts.  What if it's testicular cancer?  What if it's testicular torsion?  What's wrong with me?   The thoughts wouldn't stop.

This was when the anxiety began.  This constant feeling in my head and stomach that has ruined my life over these past few months.  Sometimes, my stomach even feels like it's on fire.  I haven't been hungry in months, I've lost 24 pounds (172 -&gt; 148 in three months, I'm 6' 1""), I had to withdraw from the semester and now I'm worried that I won't be able to return for the spring, my girlfriend dumped me a week ago, and I still can't seem to stop this anxious feeling.  I know it's anxiety but it won't stop.  

1.5 months ago, my doctor put me on Lexapro to help the anxiety.  It worked for the first few weeks or so, but the anxiety returned.  I continued to take the Lexapro until about two weeks ago when I stopped cold turkey.  I don't want to take medication unless it's the only solution anyway, and it wasn't helping.  I'm trying supplements that are supposed to help the thyroid and digestion because I'm desperate.  I'm seeing a psychologist and working with my doctors to figure this all out, but it doesn't seem to be getting any better yet.

I just can't keep living like this.  I'm terrified because I keep losing weight and I haven't been hungry for months, but I do try to eat quite a bit.  Can anyone help?  Has anyone been through this?  I've been ""cracking"" my neck for years, can that cause anxiety problems?  I can't seem to stop crying and I'm so scared.  I really need help.

TL;DR: Please read it because I could really use some help."

I hopefully should have passed the CAPM before my work term is done and will be graduating with a bachelors degree in Computer Information Systems early next year. I also have a Computer Science degree too. 

What kind of jobs should I look at? I'm pretty sure I won't get a role as a Project Manager with just a year of intern experience. I really don't want to start at a developers position. I really don't enjoy coding so much, I like dynamic roles where I am part of the bigger picture. I hope to hear your suggestions. Thanks"

At this moment I'm halfway through my junior year of a BS degree in Computer Information Systems, a little behind on courses because I was originally a Communication major (relevant!). I'll graduate on time, all requirements completed, but with very little interest in systems administration, networking, computer security or programming.

I worked for about a year and a half in NOC/HD within IT and I'm doing an internship in automated software testing at the moment. I've made attempts to teach myself programming concepts that haven't been touched on in classes but I just don't enjoy programming and don't see it as a possible career outlook for me right now.

Concern:

As of right now I'm looking into opportunities in the field that differ from what I've tried and researched already, and how I could best prepare myself for employment in that sector. I really, really enjoy writing and would definitely be interested in an opportunity to write full-time in a technical environment. I'm also familiar with the roles of BA/PM and I was just looking to see if anyone might have some additional insight.

As a side note, I wouldn't be opposed to scripting or light programming as a result of the position -- I just don't want to be doing so for the majority of my day.

Thank you for reading!

Senior in college getting nervous about future...,Brocccooli,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/15t2jx/beef_up_my_resume_senior_in_college_getting/,"I'm currently a senior in college with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. I've been sending out my resume to a bunch of different companies looking for internships before I get my degree. I've been doing this since Junior year and I'm finding it really difficult to land a position anywhere. My resume isn't that strong (I have no real on the books work experience, mostly off the books working in a company with my neighbor). I use that job as a reference but that's about it. 

 The only other real thing I have is a summer course that I TA'd for with my professor whom asked me personally. It was a CS 101 course in Scheme/Dr Racket. These are the two big things I can really think of putting on a resume. I have good experience in Java as that's the main language my university teaches, although I have experience in a lot more. (I'd say my university has the view of getting a lot of possible languages in working knowledge as opposed to strong studies in one language.)

I would appreciate any suggestions you guys would be able to give me about what to put on my resume to beef it up a bit. Maybe some things I have overlooked.

15spy8,0,2013-01-01,"My housemate won't return my $375 security deposit. After asking for it constantly, he now won't return my emails or calls. Can Reddit help a guy get his money back?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15spy8/my_housemate_wont_return_my_375_security_deposit/,"So here's some background information.

I'm a 20 year old film student from Australia and as a part of my course i decided to complete an internship in Los Angeles, CA. I saved up lots of money and finally flew out for three months in early October. 

Accommodation wise, i chose to find a place that was fully furnished (something with a bed provided since i couldnt exactly bring my own from australia). So i browsed Airbnb.com for months before and finally found a shared house with its own private bed near my place of internship. It was a short bus ride away and it was $900 a month, the cheapest place i could find! So i met up with the guy and he was a nice guy, a bit paranoid, but he agreed and we went ahead with the airbnb transaction. The night i got there, he told me he needed the security deposit..and he was eager to get it or else i couldn't get the keys. So we took a trip to the bank, and i withdrew the $375 needed for the 3 month lease. I gave it to him, and he put it in an envelope. 

Now comes the main part... 

This guy, his name is Akil Thompson, wasn't the best housemate. He was constantly knocking on my door asking for things, he would also go through my room to get to his extra storage. He was very flambouyant and would sing loudly every night, even at 11pm. And his wifi would cut out constantly...It was very hard living with him especially since he never stipulated in his airbnb post that he would be doing these things. Infact, he said he's a quiet respectable person. Whatever, i just pushed through these annoying living conditions and minded my own business. 

So just before Christmas i told him that my 3 months is coming to an end and that i'd be returning to Australia in the first week of January. I told him that i'm going to clean my room and put everything back to how it was. Throughout my stay, i never broke, damaged or stole anything! I was completely respectful and he knew i was! He constantly said i was a nice, easy going housemate. So the day came and i showed him my room and told him everything is back to how he first had it. 
I even cleaned the floor and washed all his towels and bed sheets!

Then... he told me he didnt have my security deposit. The odd part is that the first night i gave him the money in cash, right? Well apparently the room i was staying in actually belongs to a girl who is currently in japan.. so he sent all the money to her, because technically i was staying in her room. 

Now i didn't care where the money was, but i needed that money before i left. He agreed to it..and so did I. 

So the day i leave i tell him, Hey Akil.. i'm off to new york before i leave for Australia and I NEED that money now. 

He kept saying he didnt have the money and that the japanese girl wont get back to him. 

I told him..that's not my problem. I gave you my money.. and since there is no damage, I need my money back..or else that's considered stealing.

So he said he'd give it the day i get to new york..and i've been here for 4 days and he is ignoring all my calls and emails. 

I have a feeling he wont give me the money and it'll be too late. 


Can reddit help me try get my money back? 
Any ideas?

Don't get me wrong, I am very knowledgeable about my subject area, I get decent grades, I work hard, I try to network actively outside of school, and I even have previous internship experience. 

However, when I apply for positions in my field I do not even get a call back for an interview. Even in situations where I have networked and have some connection to the hiring manager; there is always someone ""with more experience"" or someone they know even better that they pick for the job. 

I want and am willing to start at the bottom to get my foot in the door, but the door is locked. I pursued an undergraduate education to get the key but it turns out in these economic times I need to pursue an MBA AND obtain some sort of finance designation to even ""get my foot in the door"".

This results in more time and money spent on education on top of the thousands of dollars I already owe in debt. The worst part is, by the time I get these credentials I fear they might not even be enough. 

You might say ""get some experience instead of degrees"" but that's the problem, I CAN'T get any experience, I've been working hard trying, even going as far as to walking into businesses dropping off my resume and talking to the owners.

I am not one of those people who believes that I am entitled to anything, but with the risk of going bankrupt before I even get my first full-time job, I want to feel that I at least ""bought"" something."

It usually comes back to the basic argument ""we were lied to and brought up to believe that simply attending college would secure us a job"", but is that really so?

While i do believe we were brought up with this concept, it feels as if too many people feel they are entitled to a career upon graduating college, without any real work.

I am a bit bias since i happen to have aligned myself with people who worked hard to get good grades and looked for employment well before graduation.  But i would like to know what people think.

I personally believe that college really is a ticket to a better future, but its not a given, you must work for it. This means you need to straighten up your act and focus.

* Pick a major that will actually get you employed
* Make sure you actually pay attention and get good grades
* Network and look for employment before graduation, internships are a awesome

And i think any major is viable, but some definately have a higher chance of getting you a nice check: Engineering, Finance, Accounting and so on.

So what do you think Reddit? Do people just feel entitled to a career because they went to school? even those who barely make grades and pick majors for which they cant even answer ""What do you want to do when you graduate?""

I have a very respected paid internship in my degree field (Marketing) and I'm in the top of my class. I also am taking on a second internship this semester doing advertising and social media public relations for a local law firm.

I will most likely be graduating school in the Spring of 2014 (I'm an older student because of prior military service.) And am extremely interested in practicing law. I have signed up for the LSAT this June and believe fully that I can be admitted into a T14 school, if not T6. 

Yet, going to law school is a hard choice. It's what I've always been interested in, (not because of Law &amp; Order, I have many family members who practice law,) and aspire to do with my life. 

It's a difficult choice because I could easily make an above average salary doing market research straight out of school. This would be my second choice though.

I have accumulated zero debt so far because of the GI bill as well as my native american heritage. 

I am also considering reenlistment into the JAG Corps to minimize all debts from law school.

Should I take the money and run or take the risk that you all seem so against?

15w4f3,3,2013-01-03,We feel the same way but he wants to give up before even trying,[deleted],wemetonline,https://www.reddit.com/r/wemetonline/comments/15w4f3/we_feel_the_same_way_but_he_wants_to_give_up/,"we only met 2 months ago but feel the same way about each other. the problem is that he doesn't believe it could work but I do. we live on different continents, and neither of us want to do a long distance relationship.  we already said we would take things slow and just chill before anything gets too serious, as we had been heavily flirting for the first month or so.

I'm a third culture kid. my dad's a diplomat so I've lived in many different countries and even the country where I live now where I'm going to college is only temporary and after I'm done with my studies I will go away and don't know where to yet. I have no 'home' because my own 'hometown' is almost as foreign to me as any other country. So essentially, moving countries is not really a 'big deal' to me, in fact, I need to go SOMEWHERE after I finish college.

As part of my studies I have to do either an exchange semester or internship for 5 months. I already got a placement but I'm unhappy with it, and have been thinking of doing an internship as well. The thing is, and I didn't wanna tell him this to freak him out, but I could try (and would probably succeed) to get an internship in his home country. Which would give us the possibility of being together. 

So we kind of had 'the talk' right now because he has been acting very distant and unresponsive, so he finally told me that he's having serious doubts. I told him he's just giving up, I mean it's obvious we both care about each other the same way and thikn of what could be etc. but he said he doesn't want to do LDR just like that and I said me neither, we could just be friends.

So he almost gave up on me but I managed to save it. My idea is that for now we'll just be friends because even talking about making a commitment seems to be too risky. But at the same time, if this is something real, we can just be friends, no pressure, while simultaneously both harboring feelings for the other. 

Now I would like to hear you guys' thoughts on that. Has anyone else done it this way and do you think it's a good idea? Should I try to get an internship in his home country (also, important note is that I have thought about living in that country long before I knew about him, so it wouldn't be JUST for him). Do you think we will still feel this way about each other if we are only internet friends?"

Why do I still care?,angermanagement_1,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/15vzhl/on_the_verge_of_breaking_nc_shaking_of_anger_and/,"I told myself I was going to be over this in 2013. I'm so incredibly angry and full of pain over what he did/what he's doing and I want to hurt him so badly, why can't I let go?

I [25f] broke up with him [23m] on Nov 8th because I didn't feel supported and felt hurt by his lack of faith in our relationship. He had previously moved to London, and I was in the stage of rounding up my thesis and graduation and finding a job there (not an easy thing to do).

He was my future, we felt so solid, I felt like nothing could break us. I was looking forward to coming to London and getting to a more serious stage with him (moving in together). But the cracks in our relationship had already started showing:

* after moving to London he would seek out friendships with girls only. I knew going in to the relationship that he had a lot of female friends but to see him seeking out new contacts with women made me feel like he was keeping his options open
* after an especially emotional day where I buried my grandmother I couldn't sleep that night and couldn't stop crying. He was with me that night, noticed I was crying, and fell asleep on me. I found it nearly impossible to form any sort of emotional connection with him
* he took me out to his hometown in the summer where I met his family and friends. I noticed he was texting/emailing a lot. Being a bad gf, I read his private FB messages with one of his female London friends. He was taking her out to concerts, initializing conversation every day, sending her sweet thoughtful jokes and stories (exactly how we had started out). Didn't confront him with it but proceeded to feel like shit in front of his friends and family that he was keeping his options open like this.
* I had to fly back to Europe earlier than he. He was still hanging out with his ex-gf a lot in his hometown, one day he lied about meeting up with her and a few friends while it was really meeting up with her to ""finally have a proper talk"". I caught him out on it, he felt like shit for lying to me, I managed to tell him that I was okay with him meeting up with his ex, but that he should be honest about it and that I wanted us to have the kind of relationship where he would speak to me about what he was going through emotionally. Seemed like we hit a breaking point, he emailed me every day saying how confident he was about us, changed his profile pic into one of us two
* he came back to London, removed his FB profile pic of us both together, started his new job which he was quite busy with. Drank himself into a stupor 4 nights a week, went to the gym on 2 others, ignored me as much as possible on the remaining night
* he took a year's lease on his apartment, effectively killing the option of me doing an internship in London in case I couldn't find a job
* he was getting short with me in his answers, didn't enquire about my thesis or job search. When I told him how unhappy I was, he said he just didn't know how long he could go on long distance and if I couldn't find a job in London, well, then he wasn't so sure about how long he wanted us to continue for.
* as a final attempt, I flew last minute to London (came there regularly) to talk things out face to face, see what he was feeling, see if it was still something worth fighting for. I asked him if he thought we would be okay, if he was willing to wait for me to try and make a future for myself in London. He said he loved me and of course he wanted to wait! But couldn't promise me his shitty behaviour of the past few months was going to fade away, because that's just how he felt.

I broke up with him because of his shitty attitude and lack of support and well, all the things mentioned above which made me feel I was better off without him. It was an incredibly sad break up. I remember telling him “I’d rather be alone than feel afraid you’re going to break up with me every single day”. Not feeling the support of your SO during important changes in your life is a shitty thing to feel. I couldn’t stop crying at the airport; normally a place of excitement and lovingness, feeling loved and missing him, now I just felt miserable and empty. I made a note on my phone saying “what good is a world without love?” I didn’t understand his lack of support and his lack of caring. I felt resolved in my decision to end it on my terms because even if I had found my way to London within the next few months, his lack of support would have always stuck with me.

Still, I am incredibly hurt. I heard via a friend, that he asked out the London girl he was msging 7 days after we broke up. 7 days. They are dating now. 

The problem is, is that I am hearing through one of his close friend (that I became friends with as well), is that he broke it off because **I wanted to stay in my hometown and get working experience before coming over to London. He is making it out as if I'm the one who didn't put in the effort to make things work. His friends are now complimenting him for being such a romantic, cheering him on for keeping the relationship going for as long as he did, and he is telling them how difficult it is for him being in the dating scene again because he's not good at casual dating.** Obviously, I need to cut off contact with this mutual friend, but for some reason my brain things it's the only way to find answers for the hurt and anger that I am feeling.

He pulled out of a 2,5 year relationship just because he couldn't wait another 6 months to let me find my way and start a career. He started dating option #2 **SEVEN** days after we ended things! How can he see himself as a romantic????!!! HOW? How is he getting away with this?

When he first came to London, he was very lonely, and was very confused about leaving his hometown and wanting to go back. I was there for him, asked him how he was feeling every single day, and completely supported him in his wishes to go back to his home country as I saw how unhappy it made him. I have always told him we would work out, whether it was in Europe or somewhere else, we would find a way to be together. It just feels like once he got his job, and found people to drink/socialize with, he wasn't interested in me anymore. It sucks to be put aside this way.

I hate myself because I felt so strong after I dumped him. I knew this wasn't the type of guy I wanted and I wanted to feel a stronger connection to somebody. This feeling is gone. I unfriended him from FB but feel the urge to still check his page through mutual friends FB. Peeked on the FB of a friend while she was away and saw his photos. With the new girl. His friends, whom I met over the summer, telling him how excited they are about his new love and good for him that he is having such a good time in London.

And me, I'm just shaking with anger and crying because I loved him so much and felt he was the real deal for such a long time and told all my family and friends about moving to London.

I want to hurt him. I want to send him an email saying what a jackass he is, how much he has hurt me with everything, how he's only fooling himself with his ""i'm such a romantic"" shit. 

WHY DO I STILL CARE?
Throwaway because I’m too embarrassed I’m still not able to deal with this shit. But I’m really active in the r/BreakUps community and always know what to say in other people’s situations, just not mine.
If anyone has anything helpful to say or experiences to share, please let me know.

I'm a Computer Science student, and recently I've landed a job for the summer at a pretty great Company, a company that is known for bringing hard working interns back each summer until they graduate and commonly providing them with full time jobs.  However, I've also been given the opportunity to work at a well known International Giant in the Computer Science industry, a company I'll refer to as IG.  The travel opportunities and pay are much much greater for me if I take the job at IG, however, as a downside, I will lose my good standing with my current employer for the summer and possibly lose the chance to work at that company altogether (many companies are judged by how many offers potential employees accept, so refusing a job offer would make them look bad and deter them from offering a job to me in the future expecting that I would again turn it down and go to another company) but IG is not necessarily known for bringing interns back for future summer positions.  What would be a wise course of action in this situation? Stick with my current company (which is no doubt fantastic in its own right) and keep job security, or take the job at IG for better pay, travel opportunities and the overall experience but sacrifice the reassurance of having a job at graduation?

Note: For good (and hopefully obvious) reason, I have not mentioned the names of the Companies"

I am all sorts of excited to graduate in May with a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from a state school known for it's engineering department.


**My elevator pitch**


I am currently in the thick of a job search, and I am looking for ideas as well as specific positions to apply for. I am really interested in an industry where designers, visionaries, and engineers all work closely together to realize a product that is user-centric and ideally fun!

This product might take the form of a website, an application, or even a physical object. In my opinion, the most wonderful part of Computer Engineering is allowing a way for the physical world and the digital world to communicate.  I would like to be involved in a product that strives to provide a novel, positive, and exciting experience to people.


**What I'm good at**


* Strong in Java (android) and C++
* Coursework in embedded design (ARM, Arduino)
* Love to work with Processing/ OpenFrameworks making artistic tech projects
* Comfortable on Windows/ Linux (and mac is probably cool too.)
* One summer internship as a Software Dev (C++)
* Two apps on the Android market (freelance)
* Working on a portfolio website to teach myself html/ css/ javascript

**Where I want to work**


* Seattle/ Portland area
* San Francisco
* New York
* Europe (my dream)
* Denver (IF it's the right job)

**What else I like**


* Music, literature, philosophy
* Traveling
* Skiing, hiking, rock climbing
* Good coffee and food


I think that covers it... Hopefully this isn't too meta, but I am really hoping some good ideas come out of this.  I am still very much in flux about what I want to do with my life, so this is a chance to mold a young and excited mind! 

OK, anyway, message me if you have any ideas/ tips/ job openings I might be interested in. I can provide more details as needed.

Basically, I have come into some Cisco 1242 Aironet APs. (I'm an IT intern and the networking dept recently replaced all the APs in a warehouse. These came back and are being thrown out.)
I know next to nothing about Cisco's proprietary stuff. I have set up home networks and consider myself decently savvy there. I know some C++ as well as HTML and CSS (I saw that Cisco's stuff possibly involves some scripting?) I'm wondering what it would take to configure one of the APs to run in my dorm room. I already have one wireless router that my roommates and I use for our phones/laptops. I'd like to replace it with a switch (a Linksys 16 port, the enterprise grade one, not the one that looks like WRTG54) for our wired stuff (we have an old PC set up as a media server) and the AP for our wireless. I would also like to set one up bridged (or separate) in the common area on my floor to take advantage of the awesome range the antennas give.
Thanks for any assistance/advice!"

So currently I'm a junior studying at UPenn.  I am an engineer that majors in Computer science and I also major in English lit (for shits and giggs).  I really want to try something different this summer and have started taking some classes in Wharton and think that finance would be an interesting and exciting internship.  However, I'm not in a business degree, so I am kind of daunted into how I could potentially get an internship in finance since my entire background and internship experience thus far has always been software engineering and software development.  I have a 3.3 GPA because engineering is hard =( but that hasn't detracted from me getting SDE interviews and internships.  I know that places like BlackStone and Jane Street offer software development internships, but I'm looking into Sales &amp; Trading, analytics &amp; risk, and other more technical areas of finance.  Does anyone have any advice and tips on how to present myself as an optimal candidate, even though I come from a non-finance background, what other financial analyst positions look strongly upon CS majors? (I did a search in this subreddit already, but there was nothing about CS going into finance)."

Almost NOTHING could be had.  When finding out most of our frustrated Engineers started bringing in their wanted extra gear from home (and were encouraged by their management to do so), we finally got some extra room in the IT budget to allow each department their own little piggybank within IT.

Extra monitors, extra RAM, larger hard drives, special order PCs, Macbooks, etc, could now be had if that particular department wanted to use what was in their ""bank"".  We even managed to carve out a bit of the extra money for an IT ""toy"" fund.  Much less grumbling from cube-land and from the helpdesk.

However, we have had a couple unintended consequences, departments forget that the money still comes from IT and stuff they buy with it is ""ours"" and goes back into our inventory when a user leaves the company.  It also gives users the impression that limitations on gear were due to a technological limitation rather than a budgetary one.

Example 1: One of our departments loves buying extra monitors for interns that are only with us for a semester, then they get pissed off when I go return their 2nd monitor and 16GB of RAM workstation to my spare equipment rack... no wait, they get pissed when I tell them they need a new request for the new intern and spend the money again.  Moral of the story: don't buy this shit for temporary employees.

Example 2: Line manager puts in request for his new hire's equipment. Asks for a laptop with 2 monitors.  Nobody gets 2 monitors to start with (only 2 exceptions which don't apply here).  I inform him of this fact and he replies that ""I thought the policy changed since the newer model laptops support multiple external displays.""  Yes, because monitors grow on a tree I tend to behind the building and totally don't cost $200/ea.

Oh well, if I had wheels I'd be a wagon.

tl;dr lusers fail to understand that hardware costs money.  What money they do have for hardware shouldn't be spent on temporary employees.

**Edit:** Sorry guys, I'm not a corporate accountant and it's hard for me to explain how all this works.  I probably also should have tossed in a ""You Don't do the budget, Gary, I do!""  It's just a typical workday frustration for me since I have to be mindful of our client-tower spend (as usually I'm the first one on the chopping block if things go south.)"

I am an intern at a corporation and I enjoy it here. Everyone seems to be relaxed in the IT office. There are laughs here and there, and we get serious if something happens. 


Anyway, on one of the floors, a user pressed on the call help desk in the teleconference room. The guy I learn from, and help here and there picks up the phone, and sees its the fifth floor teleconference room. Some mumbo-jumbo talk with the caller, and I hear ""Try pressing and holding the power button. Then let go, and push the button."" To no avail, the user continues asking my pal to have him come upstairs. My pal responds ""I'll be right there."" As we take one flight up, he mentions that the caller said something about a computer not wanting to start up, and that he mentioned Dell. So I think to myself what could be going wrong here. The conference rooms are setup in a wooden panel. These panels include multiple switches for TVs, shades, screens, etc. (Fancy-shmancy stuff). I've interned here over the summer, and have seen sh*t hit the ceiling when one of these panels decides not to work.


We walk through the door, and my pal walks to the panel. He opens the panel, and presses the power button on the Dell. The TV automatically realizes the computer is being booted up, and shows us the Windows loading screen. The crowd inside the room goes wild! The user speaks turns to us and asks [""Where's the power button?? I kept pressing the big, silver Dell button, but it wouldn't turn on!!""](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Dell_Optiplex_745_standing.JPG)


When I got back down to the place I sit, I only though to myself ""It hurt's to have a brain..it hurts..""

Backstory: Lost about 40lbs over the course of a year with cardio 4-6x/week (60 minute sessions), simply eating “less,” and drinking *tons* of water. But then 4 months ago, I took on a full-time internship (which has now turned into a full-time job, yay!), and have ended up commuting 2+ hours each way (moving next week so no more commute) meaning I was getting to the gym *maybe* once a week, and went from eating out maybe 3x/week, to 2-3 meals *everyday*. This negative lifestyle change has added ~15lbs back on, and I feel like crap, constantly. 

After about seven months of following r/keto, yesterday I said “fuck it, I'm doing Keto!” Now, the meat and cheese? Piece of cake (figuratively speaking, of course). I'm the kind of of girl who loves eating steak for breakfast anyway.

The issue? Green stuff. I've always been a picky eater, for as long as my parents and I can remember. Over the past 3 years, my tastes have changed *significantly*. 4 years ago I started eating steaks, 2 years ago I started eating burgers, and just a few months ago I've started to enjoy salmon, not to mention eggs! Six months ago, I started eating eggs on a regular basis, first time since I was a kid (I hated the taste before and just something about eggs freaked me out. I'm well over that decade long phase). 

But back to point of this post … I need help. I need a way to help ease some green into my diet. Lettuce is out. It's mostly a texture thing, and I've tried, even when covered in dressing. All in all, I'm new to leafy greens and most veggies, and looking for advice or help on where I should start. Smothering broccoli in cheese? Drowning spinach in a pool of butter?  I've looked into dozens of recipes with cauliflower… using it in muffins, for rice, as mashed potatoes, etc… but does it actually taste like cauliflower? Sorry if this all seems ridiculous, but veggies and greens aren't a thing I'm accustomed to eating, and I really want to make this work and better myself, hence why I'm asking for advice. 

Any help, picker eaters of r/Keto?"

I wanted to start over, go somewhere new and this was the chance. 

Problem is my mother has been spiraling through depression for the past 10 years, her ex husband (my dad) pretty much emotionally ruined her by losing all his money in the stock market and then passing away last year. Leaving her no choice but to pick up at 55 and find a job and take care of her self. 

She puts in no effort, rotates between cigs in the morning, alcohol mid day, weed and anti depressents at night. I am college during most of this but when I come home from break I see it first hand. She hasn't gotten a job in a year, she barely tries and is just crying and feeling bad for her all the time. Me and my brother are completely self sufficient and do not ask one dollar form her. All she needs is to pay her own way. 

Now I come home and she breaks the news to me we will have to sell our house because she can't afford to pay it. A house with no mortgage, that she can't even keep up the property taxes with, effectively she is guilt triping me to not take the job in the new city and come home and live in her bubble of sadness. Something I don't want to do.  

I cannot live with her, and need to get away from her lack of a passion for life. She has no desires to better her self, better her life, find someone else and now is bringing me down. Just because I am her son does that mean for the rest of my life I will have to support myself, my family? get out of student loan debt and support her? I am just tired of having a mother who has given up on life and wants to drag me down as much as she says she doesn't want to. 

I don't see my mom lasting 10 more years at her rate of constant drug abuse, and I am barely hanging on financially at the moment, I cannot fathom support myself and her. No idea what to do, and I feel like a terrible son if I don't step in front of a bus and sacrifice my future for her. "

EDIT 1: Removed the first story. That's 1000 words removed. Left the story that bothered me the most, made the first story pale in comparison.

The high school I went to was pretty shitty. Everyone only cared about football, which wouldn't be so bad, except that we haven't won any championships for ten years, so whenever people talked about the school football team it's always some dumb shit. I was always depressed during school. Always felt different from everyone. It was a typical high school feeling I guess. Elementary school and middle school was bullshit. I didn't speak English for the first couple years, so I was always weird. Also, I was the only Asian kid in all my classes, and being in the deep south most people are always fucking assholes to anybody different from them. Middle school was fucking bullshit. I remember getting in trouble for dumb reasons, like if two kids randomly decided to kick my ass in gym, and I would tell the teacher, and the teacher, being an arrogant fuckwad, would write both the kids AND me up, even though I was the one getting my ass kicked. Then, at the assistant principal's office, having bad communication skills at the time, I wasn't able to explain myself and got suspended anyway. And of course my dad would not be understanding and would have to rant and shit about how I'm an embarrassment and about how cousin X or cousin Y are doing so much better than me. 

Or about how this blonde asshole at my school would do the worst inhuman shit to me, like spit on me, or to the [Asian eyes](http://riogringa.typepad.com/.a/6a00e008ca9cc6883401156e357632970c-800wi) gesture at me with his group of friends. Call me names like ""Chink motherfucker"" and kick my ass whenever people aren't looking. All because of two reasons. 1.) I was Asian and 2.) I didn't know how to deal with people so the way I reacted to his bullying provided a lot of entertainment, I guess. This wouldn't be so bad, except for one thing: He was very into Asian girls. I don't know why but that still pisses me off to this day. It's so unfair. Pick on the Asian dude, call him names, dehumanize and emasculate him, but go after the Asian girls. That was super bullshit. And the girls were okay with that, too! I'm not getting any further into this because this is something I only like discussing with my counselor but...fuck middle school.

Got a little sidetracked. Back to the incident at my high school. I was pretty suicidal at the time. It got worse, since I didn't know how to express myself. I started to have outbursts in class, doing all sorts of dumb shit that you shouldn't do socially because people would judge you, whatever. It got to the point where I found out that most of the guys and girls were secretly talking shit about me, saying that I should really just kill myself. I also found out that my best friend was also involved in making fun of me. That..kind of changed me a little I guess. I started seriously considering suicide, and doing research and coming up with plans. I didn't know if I would've gone through with it or not, but... I don't know. My friend was doing shit that pissed me off at the time. He was becoming good friends with a guy who had a bunch of his friends on Facebook write shit about me on my wall. One of those popular asshole guys who thinks he's also a geek or whatever the fuck he is. 

After a bad night, I wrote a short bullshit suicide note and sent it to him via pastebin. Idk what I expected, maybe an apology? I know now that it was an asshole thing to talk about suicide to friends, since they don't know what the fuck to do about it, but..back then I was stupid and didn't understand people I guess. Anyway he replied that he got scared and called the police, which was a bit of a surprise. I thought he was joking at first, until the police came at my door. Fuck... parents. I don't know how I'm going to explain what happened... so much shit. Oh well, gotta get it off my chest.

Police... doing what they do. Gotta do their jobs, gotta respond to calls, gotta take me to the hospital, gotta make a report, gotta put it on the record, gotta make my parents cry, gotta go through all my stuff, gotta grab me if I make any sudden moves, gotta do all sorts of necessary but traumatizing shit to me and my family. They brought me to a local hospital. I still can’t remember the name of it. It was 12 in the morning. Gotta get me a blood test, my dad was there, he was disappointed in me for being such a dumb teenager. He had to get up to work in the morning, he hasn’t slept yet. He barely makes any money. The blood test cost him more than he would’ve made in a day. The staff and interns there, all judging me. I gave myself a stupid haircut a couple days ago, one of the dumb things teenagers do. I look ridiculous. I looked weak. They saw a stupid angsty Asian emo boy. They didn’t offer any sort of empathy. I didn’t deserve any. The on call counselor needed to talk to me, to get information. I was already overwhelmed, from having a bad night, from the police, from the hospital, from everything. I said I didn’t want to talk. He said okay and left for a few minutes.

THE FUCKING BASTARD came back a couple minutes later, telling me I was going to be sent to some kind of impatient teenager asylum or something. For people with mental disorders, he said. I didn’t want to deal with any of that stuff. I didn’t know what to do. I was a minor. My parents are immigrants, don’t speak English, don’t understand anything but to be disappointed in me for embarrassing them. I had final exams coming up. I had papers due. I didn’t know what to do. 

Why is he a “fucking bastard?” I’ll tell you why. I said it was a misunderstanding. I said I –didn’t want- to go to a mental asylum because I already have so much stuff to do in my life. I said a lot of things, but he’s already made his decision. “You didn’t want to talk to me,” he said. “You didn’t want to cooperate with me.”  THAT WAS NOT THE CASE. I already went through so much shit that night, if I sounded a little rude for the first 10 fucking seconds of conversation, you do not “punish” me by separating me from my goddamned friends and family, to an institution away from any fucking support I can get. He described it as a place where they would put me on medication until I would “stabilize” then, maybe after a few weeks, release me. That already sounded fucking horrible. I don’t know how, in any world, how that would be a good idea for anybody. 

My mom DID NOT FUCKING UNDERSTAND. She thought they were just sending me to a therapy place. She just said “Does he have to go? Can’t he just go every day after school? (:” A fucking ignorant question, the guy just looked at her and said “No.” and didn’t talk to my parents, because obviously they were not human fucking beings to him, that fucking asshole. I said “I want you to help me. This isn’t helping me. I need to be with my family. I don’t know what to do. Please don’t do this.” Oh well, he said. And left. Fuck him. Fuck him with all my life.

It was now 2 in the morning. My parents still need to get up, to work, to make earn back the money that the night has already cost them. Fucking world. In order not to go, they said, in order for me to not go to a place where (since I had final exams and projects and high school shit due, since I had to finish my last year in high school, since graduation was a month away) it would delay and fuck up my education, I had to wait for more “on call counselors” to come and “examine” me or some shit like that. They were on call and would have taken them hours to come to the hospital. It would’ve taken them a few hours. My parents wanted to stay with me, but I wanted them to leave. I didn’t want them to stay up all night and then go to work. Their job is already hard enough. I was left alone at the hospital. People looking at me. Probably judging me for wasting their time. Probably looking at me like I didn’t belong there, like they could’ve been helping people that actually needed help. I didn’t ask to go to that fucking hospital. I had to. The police brought me there. I had no fucking choice. I was a minor. Fuck anyone who judged me that night.

When the counselors came, I told them everything. I told them about sending that note to my friend, I told them about being depressed, I said I probably wouldn’t have done anything, I said I was just a dumb teenager who made a mistake and tried to be a person but didn’t know how. They listened. Then they decided that the decision to send me to that FUCKING MENTAL HOSPITAL was a good idea. I don’t know how, or why they thought so. Maybe because I did seem a little unstable that night. Well, anyone would be after being kept up all night, after going through a billion fucking things, after dealing with one trauma after another. Anyone would seem a little unstable and a little FUCKING WEIRD. Fuck them. So I had to go. It was already 4 or 5 in the morning. 

The ride would come to pick me up. They had to call the hospital, to tell them that I was coming, a lot of shit that would take more hours. I haven’t slept in forever. I had to stay up longer. There was a bed, but they kept the lights on. They kept the door open, they had to be always watching me. There was no way in hell I was able to fall asleep that night. I stood up to use the bathroom, the on call police officer practically tackled me, asked me where I was going. Finally letting me use the bathroom. I was in a hospital gown. I had to be in it for whatever reason. It had to be open at the end for whatever reason. I had to ride in a goddamned ambulance for whatever reason. I had to be carried on a stretcher for whatever reason.

I don’t understand hospitals. What is the point of all of this? I could walk. I could get a ride. Why did I have to ride an ambulance? Why a fucking gown? Why a fucking urine and blood test? Why charge us all this money? Why force me to do all of these things that was clearly not helping me in any way? 

It was 8am by the time I arrived at the mental hospital with the fucking name. I didn’t know what it was called. THAT PLACE WAS THE WORST. 

I can’t even begin to describe. But I have to. I fucking have to.

I called my dad. He looked up the address and got there. 9AM. He had to be at work at 11. He looked exhausted as hell. I was exhausted as hell. My hair was a mess, I looked like shit. 

This is the thing. This is where LACK OF FUCKING EMPATHY shows from the core of human nature. Lack of fucking empathy, and while I am already exhausted from writing over 3000 words, I will try to explain why. Those people…were white. My dad and I…were exhausted, lower class Asians that looked like utter fucking shit. They did not have any context of what we had to go through that night. They handed us the typical waiting room forms to fill out. The forms had questions that my dad and I didn’t know how to answer. Questions about my mental health. Questions like “Has your child talked about hearing voices at night? Has your child ever lost control of his or her limbs? Have you ever feared your child?” Shit like that. They gave me a fucking APPLE STICKER to wear on my shirt, god damn them! My dad didn’t know how to answer most of the questions, most of them were subjective, scaled questions. My dad didn’t know how to fill out most of the form. And because of that, the lady at the desk treated us like shit. Every time we walked up for help, or to turn in a form, she just gave us a shitty look, like we were shit human beings. The FUCKING lady even started to make comments, in front of us, like “Wow, here we go again.” “Why am I not surprised that you people didn’t complete this form again?” Shit comments like that. To my father. 

Another terrible thing is that my dad wasn’t allowed to leave. I wasn’t allowed to sleep. Until the “head psychologist” examined me. By now it is 10am. My dad has to be in work in an hour. He has SAID THIS TO THE LADY MANY TIMES. The lady just looked at him and told him to wait! Now pay attention, this is where most of the bullshit has accumulated. This is the moment where I decided to fuck life.  After several times of my dad telling them that he NEEDED to leave for work, or else, you know, he’ll lose his house and my family will lose our house, they told him again to wait. My dad asked how long, and the lady said this, “He will be here in about 4 hours.” BULLSHIT. DID YOU NOT LISTEN TO US? ARE WE NOT FUCKING HUMAN BEINGS TO YOU? Talking to my dad condescendingly, trolling us like this, without empathy, after what happened, Just because we look different from you. Just because we don’t speak with the SHIT EATING SOUTHERN ACCENT that you have. FUCK YOU. 

My dad and I left. We weren’t allowed to leave, but we did anyway. My dad raged at them as we left, in broken English. The racist thoughts that must have been in their heads while this has happened, I don’t know.

We left, and I finally got to sleep. My dad had to go to work. I felt numb as fuck. Mentally. I felt dead inside. I knew they would come for me. I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t think. I just needed sleep. 

At 4pm my dad is at work, my mom called in sick, and I heard voices outside. I knew it was them. I didn’t know what to do. I went outside, and guess who they sent? Guess who the good people of my city sent to convince my family to let me be institutionalized? 
A Korean social worker. HAHAHA. From what he told my family, what happened was this. The mental hospital called the police, telling them my father couldn’t understand what was going on. They suggested that maybe it was our culture that made us unwilling to accept this treatment. Do you understand now? It’s not because of the COMPLETE BULLSHIT we went through that night as to why we didn’t want to do this, it’s because we were not white!

Anyway, that’s all I have to say about that. In the end my mom had to sign a fucking form saying she was liable if I kill myself. Basically the city saying “Fuck you, do what you want, you fucking chinks.” 

Bullshit. I wrote about this, told my school counselor about this, and still they say, “Your [fucking asshole] friend did the right thing. He’s a good person.” Fuck them. Fuck all of them to hell. They didn’t hear a thing of what I’ve said. He’s the hero, isn’t he?  

This is why I’m mad. Lack of empathy. People just can’t empathize with things that they can’t empathize well with. This is a huge problem. Let me try to explain. Let’s say you’re an average redditor. I am almost like you. You are most likely a liberal, college age, a student. You are also probably white. This isn’t a bad thing, but lets examine what happens with empathy here. What is your reaction when you hear about a shooting made by a white student? It’s a terrible thing, but we’re probably able to empathize well with that student. We’re probably more likely to think about what drove him to this, whether he was bullied, whether he came from a bad family. If we have ever been angry at society (I know I have) we probably would have even empathized well with him, and not hate him as much for what he’s done.

Now lets make the shooter black. Or Korean. NOW WHAT???? This is the problem of human empathy. We just can’t empathize well with types of people that AREN’T US. How well can Reddit empathize with African Americans? With Asian Americans? With feminists? With republicans? With conservatives? Do we dehumanize them, do we joke about them without GIVING A FUCKING SHIT when some of them speak up and say “I’m offended by this.” Because it’s just a joke. Why are they taking the fun away? Why are they being like this? Those are questions asked when empathy fails. That’s the reason for my title. I don’t shit if you’re black and you donate a fuckton of money to a black cause, or if you’re gay and donated a fuckton of money to It Gets Better. I don’t give a shit. It doesn’t make you special that you EMPTAHIZE WELL WITH PEOPLE SIMILAR TO YOU. It’s a good thing, I admit, but it doesn’t make you a good fucking person if you empathize well with people similar to you but fail completely when it comes to people different from you.

I’m tired as hell. I’m going to pass out now. But if anyone made it this far thank you. 

EDIT: I forgot to mention one more thing that pissed me off. A few weeks later, the hospital sent my family the bill for the ambulance ride. It was like $4000 or something. Fuck them. They just wanted our money. This system sucks. Going to bed now. Goodnight

15xyag,19,2013-01-04,Investing Money I Make From Going to College,justgivingsomeadvice,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/15xyag/investing_money_i_make_from_going_to_college/,"Hey finance-savvy redditors,

I have a question that probably isn't too common on this sub. I'm only 18 (well 19 in less than 3 weeks) and in my first year at college right now. The catch is that I'm going on a full scholarship, where I actually receive money for attending this university. It's supposed to be ~$600/quarter (so about $2K/year), but because my middle class parents are willing to cover expenses like books and other misc. fares that some of the money is supposed to go to, I'm getting closer to $2K/quarter (or $6K/year). I'm not necessarily frugal, but I don't like spending money needlessly, so most of it just goes in my bank account. I had about $2000 before this year, but my first check put me at about $4300. I'm majoring in computer science by the way, in case that's relevant.

So my question is, what should I be doing with this money? My dad wants me to start my Roth IRA or something, which I know is a (safe?) retirement fund. Is that the only thing I should look into? How much should I be investing? I've talked to some of the scholarship's ""society"" and they basically expect that we get internships (paid preferably), so in 2013, I should be making more than the $6000 from my scholarship. (Obviously I don't know what quality internship so I can't put a figure.)

Any guidance would be great."

EDIT 1: Removed the first story. That's 1000 words removed. Left the story that bothered me the most, made the first story pale in comparison.

The high school I went to was pretty shitty. Everyone only cared about football, which wouldn't be so bad, except that we haven't won any championships for ten years, so whenever people talked about the school football team it's always some dumb shit. I was always depressed during school. Always felt different from everyone. It was a typical high school feeling I guess. Elementary school and middle school was bullshit. I didn't speak English for the first couple years, so I was always weird. Also, I was the only Asian kid in all my classes, and being in the deep south most people are always fucking assholes to anybody different from them. Middle school was fucking bullshit. I remember getting in trouble for dumb reasons, like if two kids randomly decided to kick my ass in gym, and I would tell the teacher, and the teacher, being an arrogant fuckwad, would write both the kids AND me up, even though I was the one getting my ass kicked. Then, at the assistant principal's office, having bad communication skills at the time, I wasn't able to explain myself and got suspended anyway. And of course my dad would not be understanding and would have to rant and shit about how I'm an embarrassment and about how cousin X or cousin Y are doing so much better than me. 

Or about how this blonde asshole at my school would do the worst inhuman shit to me, like spit on me, or to the [Asian eyes](http://riogringa.typepad.com/.a/6a00e008ca9cc6883401156e357632970c-800wi) gesture at me with his group of friends. Call me names like ""Chink motherfucker"" and kick my ass whenever people aren't looking. All because of two reasons. 1.) I was Asian and 2.) I didn't know how to deal with people so the way I reacted to his bullying provided a lot of entertainment, I guess. This wouldn't be so bad, except for one thing: He was very into Asian girls. I don't know why but that still pisses me off to this day. It's so unfair. Pick on the Asian dude, call him names, dehumanize and emasculate him, but go after the Asian girls. That was super bullshit. And the girls were okay with that, too! I'm not getting any further into this because this is something I only like discussing with my counselor but...fuck middle school.

Got a little sidetracked. Back to the incident at my high school. I was pretty suicidal at the time. It got worse, since I didn't know how to express myself. I started to have outbursts in class, doing all sorts of dumb shit that you shouldn't do socially because people would judge you, whatever. It got to the point where I found out that most of the guys and girls were secretly talking shit about me, saying that I should really just kill myself. I also found out that my best friend was also involved in making fun of me. That..kind of changed me a little I guess. I started seriously considering suicide, and doing research and coming up with plans. I didn't know if I would've gone through with it or not, but... I don't know. My friend was doing shit that pissed me off at the time. He was becoming good friends with a guy who had a bunch of his friends on Facebook write shit about me on my wall. One of those popular asshole guys who thinks he's also a geek or whatever the fuck he is. 

After a bad night, I wrote a short bullshit suicide note and sent it to him via pastebin. Idk what I expected, maybe an apology? I know now that it was an asshole thing to talk about suicide to friends, since they don't know what the fuck to do about it, but..back then I was stupid and didn't understand people I guess. Anyway he replied that he got scared and called the police, which was a bit of a surprise. I thought he was joking at first, until the police came at my door. Fuck... parents. I don't know how I'm going to explain what happened... so much shit. Oh well, gotta get it off my chest.

Police... doing what they do. Gotta do their jobs, gotta respond to calls, gotta take me to the hospital, gotta make a report, gotta put it on the record, gotta make my parents cry, gotta go through all my stuff, gotta grab me if I make any sudden moves, gotta do all sorts of necessary but traumatizing shit to me and my family. They brought me to a local hospital. I still can’t remember the name of it. It was 12 in the morning. Gotta get me a blood test, my dad was there, he was disappointed in me for being such a dumb teenager. He had to get up to work in the morning, he hasn’t slept yet. He barely makes any money. The blood test cost him more than he would’ve made in a day. The staff and interns there, all judging me. I gave myself a stupid haircut a couple days ago, one of the dumb things teenagers do. I look ridiculous. I looked weak. They saw a stupid angsty Asian emo boy. They didn’t offer any sort of empathy. I didn’t deserve any. The on call counselor needed to talk to me, to get information. I was already overwhelmed, from having a bad night, from the police, from the hospital, from everything. I said I didn’t want to talk. He said okay and left for a few minutes.

THE FUCKING BASTARD came back a couple minutes later, telling me I was going to be sent to some kind of impatient teenager asylum or something. For people with mental disorders, he said. I didn’t want to deal with any of that stuff. I didn’t know what to do. I was a minor. My parents are immigrants, don’t speak English, don’t understand anything but to be disappointed in me for embarrassing them. I had final exams coming up. I had papers due. I didn’t know what to do. 

Why is he a “fucking bastard?” I’ll tell you why. I said it was a misunderstanding. I said I –didn’t want- to go to a mental asylum because I already have so much stuff to do in my life. I said a lot of things, but he’s already made his decision. “You didn’t want to talk to me,” he said. “You didn’t want to cooperate with me.”  THAT WAS NOT THE CASE. I already went through so much shit that night, if I sounded a little rude for the first 10 fucking seconds of conversation, you do not “punish” me by separating me from my goddamned friends and family, to an institution away from any fucking support I can get. He described it as a place where they would put me on medication until I would “stabilize” then, maybe after a few weeks, release me. That already sounded fucking horrible. I don’t know how, in any world, how that would be a good idea for anybody. 

My mom DID NOT FUCKING UNDERSTAND. She thought they were just sending me to a therapy place. She just said “Does he have to go? Can’t he just go every day after school? (:” A fucking ignorant question, the guy just looked at her and said “No.” and didn’t talk to my parents, because obviously they were not human fucking beings to him, that fucking asshole. I said “I want you to help me. This isn’t helping me. I need to be with my family. I don’t know what to do. Please don’t do this.” Oh well, he said. And left. Fuck him. Fuck him with all my life.

It was now 2 in the morning. My parents still need to get up, to work, to make earn back the money that the night has already cost them. Fucking world. In order not to go, they said, in order for me to not go to a place where (since I had final exams and projects and high school shit due, since I had to finish my last year in high school, since graduation was a month away) it would delay and fuck up my education, I had to wait for more “on call counselors” to come and “examine” me or some shit like that. They were on call and would have taken them hours to come to the hospital. It would’ve taken them a few hours. My parents wanted to stay with me, but I wanted them to leave. I didn’t want them to stay up all night and then go to work. Their job is already hard enough. I was left alone at the hospital. People looking at me. Probably judging me for wasting their time. Probably looking at me like I didn’t belong there, like they could’ve been helping people that actually needed help. I didn’t ask to go to that fucking hospital. I had to. The police brought me there. I had no fucking choice. I was a minor. Fuck anyone who judged me that night.

When the counselors came, I told them everything. I told them about sending that note to my friend, I told them about being depressed, I said I probably wouldn’t have done anything, I said I was just a dumb teenager who made a mistake and tried to be a person but didn’t know how. They listened. Then they decided that the decision to send me to that FUCKING MENTAL HOSPITAL was a good idea. I don’t know how, or why they thought so. Maybe because I did seem a little unstable that night. Well, anyone would be after being kept up all night, after going through a billion fucking things, after dealing with one trauma after another. Anyone would seem a little unstable and a little FUCKING WEIRD. Fuck them. So I had to go. It was already 4 or 5 in the morning. 

The ride would come to pick me up. They had to call the hospital, to tell them that I was coming, a lot of shit that would take more hours. I haven’t slept in forever. I had to stay up longer. There was a bed, but they kept the lights on. They kept the door open, they had to be always watching me. There was no way in hell I was able to fall asleep that night. I stood up to use the bathroom, the on call police officer practically tackled me, asked me where I was going. Finally letting me use the bathroom. I was in a hospital gown. I had to be in it for whatever reason. It had to be open at the end for whatever reason. I had to ride in a goddamned ambulance for whatever reason. I had to be carried on a stretcher for whatever reason.

I don’t understand hospitals. What is the point of all of this? I could walk. I could get a ride. Why did I have to ride an ambulance? Why a fucking gown? Why a fucking urine and blood test? Why charge us all this money? Why force me to do all of these things that was clearly not helping me in any way? 

It was 8am by the time I arrived at the mental hospital with the fucking name. I didn’t know what it was called. THAT PLACE WAS THE WORST. 

I can’t even begin to describe. But I have to. I fucking have to.

I called my dad. He looked up the address and got there. 9AM. He had to be at work at 11. He looked exhausted as hell. I was exhausted as hell. My hair was a mess, I looked like shit. 

This is the thing. This is where LACK OF FUCKING EMPATHY shows from the core of human nature. Lack of fucking empathy, and while I am already exhausted from writing over 3000 words, I will try to explain why. Those people…were white. My dad and I…were exhausted, lower class Asians that looked like utter fucking shit. They did not have any context of what we had to go through that night. They handed us the typical waiting room forms to fill out. The forms had questions that my dad and I didn’t know how to answer. Questions about my mental health. Questions like “Has your child talked about hearing voices at night? Has your child ever lost control of his or her limbs? Have you ever feared your child?” Shit like that. They gave me a fucking APPLE STICKER to wear on my shirt, god damn them! My dad didn’t know how to answer most of the questions, most of them were subjective, scaled questions. My dad didn’t know how to fill out most of the form. And because of that, the lady at the desk treated us like shit. Every time we walked up for help, or to turn in a form, she just gave us a shitty look, like we were shit human beings. The FUCKING lady even started to make comments, in front of us, like “Wow, here we go again.” “Why am I not surprised that you people didn’t complete this form again?” Shit comments like that. To my father. 

Another terrible thing is that my dad wasn’t allowed to leave. I wasn’t allowed to sleep. Until the “head psychologist” examined me. By now it is 10am. My dad has to be in work in an hour. He has SAID THIS TO THE LADY MANY TIMES. The lady just looked at him and told him to wait! Now pay attention, this is where most of the bullshit has accumulated.

After several times of my dad telling them that he NEEDED to leave for work, or else, you know, he’ll lose his house and my family will lose our house, they told him again to wait.

Talking to my dad condescendingly, trolling us like this, without empathy, after what happened, Just because we look different from you. Just because we don’t speak with the SHIT EATING SOUTHERN ACCENT that you have. FUCK YOU. 

My dad and I left. We weren’t allowed to leave, but we did anyway. My dad raged at them as we left, in broken English. The racist thoughts that must have been in their heads while this has happened, I don’t know.

Now lets make the shooter black. Or Korean. NOW WHAT???? This is the problem of human empathy. We just can’t empathize well with types of people that AREN’T US. How well can Reddit empathize with African Americans? With Asian Americans? With feminists? With republicans? With conservatives? Do we dehumanize them, do we joke about them without GIVING A FUCKING SHIT when some of them speak up and say “I’m offended by this.” Because it’s just a joke. Why are they taking the fun away?

I'm a junior in high school who is looking into to IT career path. Recently, I've assisted/am assisting our tech guy with installing two computer labs and general computer maintenance around our school. 

I've also talked to him some about next year, dedicating half of my school day to working with him as an unpaid intern. I would be doing what he does, just helping I suppose. I don't believe I would get a credit because of his lack of a teaching license. 

My big question is though, is any of this beneficial to me for a job resume? Or is this just something they'll not care about?

15xub9,11,2013-01-04,"""Give me back my entry key and get out.” The story of how all my dreams died one day.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/15xub9/give_me_back_my_entry_key_and_get_out_the_story/,"Something happened to me a while back that I have been wanting to get off my chest for some time now. It’s a bit of a long read, so I’ll understand if you want to quit now. Here goes:

Some background: I’m a 22 year old, African-American female. I’m one of those people who entered college straight out of high school, attended for a year, and dropped out when I couldn't afford it anymore. During that year, I accrued about $10k in student loan debt.

Anyway, fast forward a bit, after I left college I started working at a Mexican restaurant, a Starbucks, and a Noodles &amp; Company simultaneously. They were all minimum wage jobs: $8 an hour at Starbucks, $9 at Noodles, and tips (about 100-300 per week) at the Mexican place. So after bills (rent, phone, gas, student loans, etc) I was living off of like $200 a month. It really wasn't that bad, but I felt like I needed to better myself. I had a shit ton of customer service experience since I had been working since age 15 and I had a year of college under my belt, I felt like I could get into some entry-level position and work my way up.

So after 2 years of working 3 jobs and sending my resume out like mad, I finally got a call that changed everything. A local insurance agency wanted to interview me for a customer service representative position. Apparently one of the women who had been working there for almost 10 years was leaving to spend more time with her child and they needed a replacement.

I went in with low self-esteem and even lower expectations, but lo and behold, the owner of the agency called me and told me I was hired! I immediately put in my two weeks at my other jobs and I was ready to put all that behind me. I never thought I was going to be anything other than a minimum wage-slave with a petty misdemeanor on my record and no real education or skills, but I finally felt like I was moving up in the world.

When I went into my new job the next day, my spirits were through the roof. This was the break I had been waiting for. They wanted to pay me $38,500 annually. That may seem low to some, but it was more money than I’d ever thought I’d be making. My first thought was that I was finally going to be able to afford to eat meat again lol.

Fast forward a bit- After a week, I began to notice some changes in the office. The lady I had been hired to replace actually came back and took her old job (my new job) back. They reassured me that they still needed me because one woman who had been there for 15 years left temporarily because her blood pressure was incredibly high from stress. One man got hired for a week and was fired over the weekend.

Some other things… I noticed that my boss, the owner, made me clean the entire office from top to bottom, take out all the trash, wash the windows, and shred all the paper in the office (we were about 70% paper, 30% online). After work, the other new girl and I joked that I was the highest paid janitor in the world. I thought it was odd that the other new girl didn’t have to do any of the “bitch work” that I had to do like cleaning and filing the mountains of back paper work in the office, but I didn’t care. I was so happy to finally have a break in life.

Fast forward again- 2 weeks later, my boss (who had been so sweet to me when I was hired) was cold and withdrawn. I noticed that someone was rummaging through my desk when I was out to lunch (this was confirmed by the other new girl during our after work chats). During work, I noticed the other women watching me and it seemed like they were waiting for me to mess up so they could go into our bosses office and tell on me. It was so unpleasant. They would tell him something that I did, made up or real, then they would come out with smug smiles on their faces. Then he would call me into his office and tear into me and curse at me and slam his hands on the desk until I cried and ran for the bathroom. At this point- 3 weeks into my employment- I still hadn't been trained to sell insurance (even thought one of my duties was to take every phone call and troubleshoot insurance issues) and I was still doing bitch work that no one else in the office (including the other new girl) had to do. There were 5 other people in the office, including an intern (who would often go to lunch and bring back food for everyone but me and the other new girl). They were all white. The guy I mentioned earlier who was hired for a week and fired over the weekend was mixed Black and Spanish. I tried to ignore all of these things because I had gotten two paychecks already and I wanted more. I had a plan, I was going to finish school and finally become an adult. 

Eventually I started getting called into the boss’s office for ridiculous things: My desk was too bare so it looked like I didn’t want to stay there, the teddy bear holding a heart I put on my desk that I got from when I had heart surgery was immature- but the teddy bears everyone else had on their desks was ok because they were from their children, I wasn't working fast enough, I was working too fast and making too many mistakes, I was being bossy, I wasn't being assertive enough, I was being too friendly by laughing at customers jokes, I was saying the word “yeah” too much.

One day, on the day that I had finished all the back filing, I saw both of the senior employees go into the boss’s office, come out with those smug smiles on their faces, and go into what I referred to as “the whisper corner” because they would whisper and giggle there and we (the new girl and I) always knew it was about one of us. Boss called me into his office at  the end of the day and said, “Anon, I don’t want you to work here anymore. You've been employed here for a full month now and you make too many mistakes. We all dress the same here, talk the same, and act the same here and you just don’t fit in. Give me back my entry key and get out.” I’ll never forget how he stood behind me and watched me clean out my desk, the way he smiled smugly as he watched me sob.

Fast forward- It took me 2 months to get a new job. It was at a restaurant. Unfortunately, without two more minimum wage jobs to back it up, it was not enough. My car broke down (I lived in a suburb with no public transportation whatsoever) and my bills piled up. The managers at the new restaurant noticed that my uniform was often disheveled and they admonished me for not taking the time to clean it every night. I was too proud to admit that I couldn't afford laundry detergent until they paid me and that I was living off of the free training meals they gave me each night. They told me that they didn't think I was fitting in. I saved them the trouble of firing me and I just quit. I briefly considered suicide. I tried a synthetic form of heroin called Suboxone that an ex coworker offered me because he said that was how he coped with it all (a degrading job, being a minimum wage jockey who barely survives). My boyfriend told me that I should stop thinking about killing myself, cut the drug crap out, and move in with my mother. He saved my life. But sometimes I still wonder if things would be better if I had just ended it all then and there.

So I packed up, left my best friend, my boyfriend, my home of 22 years behind, and moved from the East Coast to the Midwest where my mother lives. By the way, I had been (legally) on my own since I was 18, so it felt like I was crawling back to mommy with white flag waving.

Now I live in her spare room. I know I’m a burden to her. She left the East coast and built her own life in the Midwest- everyday I feel like I’m messing that up for her. Everyday, I apply for jobs. Everynight I stay up drinking. I can’t sleep at night unless I drink because when I close my eyes, I see that wealthy, well-dressed man smirking and laughing at me while I empty out my desk of all the hopes and dreams I had.

**Tl;Dr- Lost job, considered suicide, moved to the Midwest, suffering from (undiagnosed) ptsd and depression, life sucks maybe permanently.**

And that’s my story. I guess I really just needed to get that off my chest.

**ETA: I kept in touch with the other new girl from the agency. She said that after I was fired, they split up the ""bitch work"" equally between all of them at first, then piled it all on her so she quit and hit the bottle pretty hard.** Also, some spelling and grammar.

15xrwr,0,2013-01-04,Would like some advice on my next watch purchase [Bulova 63C010 Chrono],mustachianado,Watches,https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/15xrwr/would_like_some_advice_on_my_next_watch_purchase/,"I've been looking to purchase a new watch for a while now, but have decided to wait to save for a ~$500 - $1000 watch. (Kind of a self gift for after my internship).

Anyways, after looking at many Citizens, Tissots and the like, I stumbled across this Bulova Accutron:
http://www.amazon.com/Bulova-63C010-Watch-Chronograph-Round/dp/B003S0E8GG

I find it to be quite gorgeous, and right in my price range. I think [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vy4ZrkzWDc) video shows off its looks a little better. However, I've never owned a Bulova, and don't know how well received they are around here.

Does anyone have this or a similar Bulova, or have advice in general when purchasing Bulova's or similar watches? This is quite a bit of money to spend on a watch (for me anyways), so I want to make sure I get one that is definitely worth the price tag. 

Also, if you have any suggestions for other good watches in this price range, please let me know.

I'd definitely appreciate any insight, Thanks!"

We both went to a party together over the summer and then quite a bit later in the fall. She was cute, sweet, and she seemed to remember me even though the second time was a lot later than the first. She seemed to enjoy conversing with me. She sort of lives far away. The thing is, I worry that if I were to make a move, anything that happened with her would get back to my friend, and that would be awkward. Also, my friend knows her pretty well, and not being a disastrous touch freak (as I am), is much more comfortable being physically touchy with her. It always makes me feel a little weird.

Woman 2: This is one of my coworkers. She's cute and we have a lot in common. She has noted a few tastes that I don't share, but still. She seems to like being around me. She seems to insist on sharing my office space, although she could go elsewhere. The last day she was in town before going on holiday, she seemed to want to go to lunch with me. I am worried about asking out a coworker, though, given past experiences.

Woman 3: I met this one at a volunteer activity that we both do. We had seen each other many times, but only met recently when we were having a thank you for the volunteers. She and I talked almost the whole time and then ended up catching the bus together afterwards. I'll see her again in a couple weeks when the project starts going again. She was thinking about switching days, but I may have talked her out of it.

Woman 4: I went to a going away party for a friend a couple weeks ago and chatted with someone one who had tagged along with a mutual friend of the guy who was going away. It turns out that she did the same internship I did a year later. I had more or less forgotten about her, but suddenly she adds me as a connection on LinkedIn. Keep in mind, it has been a couple weeks since I saw her. She's not as cute as some of the others, but definitely worth dating.

Woman 5: I went to school with this one, and she seemed interested in me then. Or at least I thought she might be. She asked if I wanted to go to coffee once (which felt like a social thing, but what do I know?). So then she moved to another country, so I imagined her being out of the picture. Apparently she's back, though, and she wrote to me to try and meet again. She's really cute, but she's from a different culture and I don't really know how to read her.

Woman 6: I was at a New Year's party the other day. There were a lot of guys and not too many women. Of the four women there, 3 of them were there with men. This one was alone. Many of the single men there were good at dancing. This girl picks me to dance, even though I'm not a dancer at all. Then, she insists that we must dance *close*, because that's how it's supposed to be, and it will be easier that way. I'm not sure she's my type, but she was cute.

Woman 7: I met this one at work (a different job) over the summer. I fell for her in a big way. Finally, I managed to get up the courage to ask her out. She said she just wanted to be friends. Then she broke off contact with me. I was pretty heartbroken. I still miss her. I think about her every day, even though when I originally met her, I saw some pretty clear red flags. I brushed them off, because I don't want to get married to the first woman I kiss, and I could see myself breaking up with her.

I'd be happy to date any of these women, and chances are at least one of them wants to date me. Most likely, though, I'll have forgotten about all but #7 by the end of the year. That last one will probably make me sad for the rest of my life."

It's in a field I have experience in, but was considering moving out of. I'd also have to make an adjustment to my field of study in school to a program that would allow me to class only in the evenings.

I was really excited about the specific program from my university (mathematics and Econ) and the new degree would be econ only.

I was planning on spending this year barley getting by with my family hoping to take a few internships and with a Dec graduation land a job more like I'd want next year. 

I guess what I'm stuck on is ""am I a GS-worker person?""  I've heard so many bad stereotypes about the people that work GS jobs, and think between my school and experience i have a chance to crack some really nice jobs in another 12 months. BUT, having healthcare and a steady paycheck for my family now would be nice. And I kind of like the idea that GS workers have more time to be people outside of work. That they can be coaches and PTA members and cub parents and such instead of just working all the time.

But, I kind of really like working...

Also, I might have to decide in the next two weeks."
15xd1n,2,2013-01-03,GF [F25] and I [M25] having second thoughts during long break up.,LongBreakUp,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15xd1n/gf_f25_and_i_m25_having_second_thoughts_during/,"My GF and I have been in a relationship for 4 1/2 years.  We met in college and moved together to go to graduate school.  (I am an engineer and she is in med school)  We have lived together for 3 years.

We have had lots of ups and downs.  Towards the start of our relationship she had an out of town internship for 4 months and I lied about looking at porn.  (she at the time didn't want to be with someone who watched porn)  In the long run looking back, I think the lying was a bigger problem than the porn.  We worked through this, we moved in together.  We got pets and lived a busy full life.  However, both being in graduate school we have never really been able to make enough time for each other.  To top it off, I am not the most open of people.  I have trouble sharing.

Anyway, during our time in graduate school we have had a lot of other ups and downs.  We don't share a lot of the same hobbies and are constantly wrapped up in our own school work.  We have tried setting aside time to do date-like things: go out to breakfast, watch movies together, etc.  But it never really lasts.  Most of the time we just fall back into watching TV, walking our dogs, sleeping, and working.  Our sex life waxes and wanes with the rest of our relationship.

It seems like whenever we try and work on things it changes a little, then we fall back into our old problems.  After several years of this we both just started to become sad often.  I was even a bit depressed for a time.  Eventually it got to a breaking point for her.  After I was away for a week at a conference, she sat me down and said that she thinks it is time we end things.  She said that, even though we love each other, we just aren't happy together.  

We spent several weeks discussing these things and I eventually came to face the facts that we really weren't happy.  For long periods of time we just weren't as happy as we should have been. (or at least could have been)  At this point we both started looking for new housing.  Weeks went by--eventually about two months after the initial break up--and I finally found a place to live.  I signed a month-to-month lease and we both set off to spend the holidays with our families.

On the way back from vacation we started talking a lot.  A lot, a lot.  We started really looking at and addressing many of our problems.  We have been realizing that we are having some serious second thoughts about the break up. (unfortunately after I signed this lease...)  We talked with each other, with our friends/family, even wrote stuff down.  She has realized that she thinks this was a mistake and wants to give us another *serious* attempt.  She has specifically pinpointed many things that she wants to do differently. (by herself and as a couple)  She thinks she hasn't appreciated me enough, she wants to improve our sex life and is open to new things, she wants us to mandate time per week that each of us controls (we tried this before and it didn't work), she wants to try to be more involved in my hobbies, and several others.

This all sounds good to me, a lot of it I really like.  However, this also really scares me.  We love each other but have spent a lot of time not exactly happy.  We have had serious sit down talks about our relationship before; we try to pinpoint things that are wrong and fix them.  However, we always have fallen back into our old bad habits.  This time it seems different: her attitude, the things she wants to change, her enthusiasm, seriousness, openness, etc.  This *does* feel different than the previous times we have tried to change.  Nonetheless, I feel like I have one foot out the door.  I love her, but I am scared, terrified even, that we will do what we always do and end up back where we always do: unhappy.

** *tl;dr*--  Long term relationship with lots of ups and downs.  We have tried to fix things before but always fall back to our old problems.  This time feels different, but I am scared.**"

This is just a side project for me and I'm interested in getting some access experience, although I have fooled around with it in the past. The basic goal is to have an inventory database for a set of 2000-some plants. Each plant already has a unique ID given by the person who collected it as well as other data such as name, origin, # of replications, etc.

The issue I'm running into at the moment is that each unique ID represents several identical plants in different locations. That is, Plant #55 might exist in 3 or 4 different locations. The most important thing I want this database to do is call up two kinds of reports: 

* what plants are in greenhouse X or garden bed Y
* where can I find all instances of plant #Z

The simplest way I can think of doing this is to set an automatic master key and have multiple records of the same plant # each with a different location value, but I have a feeling thats a really bad way to go about it.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

I am a long-time reader and was wondering if any of you had advice regarding my current employment situation.


I am 20 have been working in Southern California for ~1.5 years as an Intern for a medium sized software company (~ 300m-700m usd market cap), and have lived here most of my life. I have stayed in college (at a junior college) and will eventually get my degree in CS, although not around the typical 4 year mark. I get paid $20-22 an hour (between that), after a small raise after the 1 year mark. The discussion was initiated by myself, and there is no formal internship to full-time program for my current position/department. I currently live with a parent in a comfortable arrangement and have been saving most of my money. The work is mostly writing lots of BI reports, SQL queries, website updates, and other small projects. My personal programming skills have been mostly self-taught and cover many languages such as C#, Java, Python, PHP, etc. Web Development and Windows/Java Development. Programming has been my life's passion since I started in middle school.


My problem is that I do not enjoy the work very much, which as mentioned, is mostly writing reports (more IT focused, instead of more CS/development focused). My passion is in actual development, such as Java and .NET (C#), versus the IT-related stuff I am currently doing such as making reports, etc.


As I am currently employed on a ""contract"" basis and do not have a full-time job, my question is this: Should I stay with the company for around up to 12 more months, which is when it is highly likely that I will get a full-time job (according what they have told me)? Or start looking elsewhere in the field of work I actually desire? My true passion and skill is in normal programming languages such as Java and C#, versus writing BI (Business Intelligence) reports I have been writing, even though I have become the top report writer at the company. My reasons for thinking about applying elsewhere, is that I am essentially working as much a full-time employee, and my passion is doing other type of work such as Java and C#. I feel the opportunity cost is possibly too great to wait an additional 12 months, and possibly not even a full-time position in the work I want to be doing long term (even though the field I am in would pay somewhat well).
Note: Although the position is on a ""contract"" basis, I am large part of my team and would regard myself as very well-liked.

Thank you for any advice. (This is a throwaway)"

I would love to find an internship/entry level job so that I can get a well rounded bit of experience that would enable me to feel confident enough to actually pass certifications like CCIE/CCNA.  (Run on sentence, sorry).  I don't really think I'd pass if I just went and tried tomorrow.  My university doesn't have a very reliable way to help me find these internships so I've turned to the strongest point on the internet, Reddit.

I know sites like careerbuilder.com are just full of scams and a waste of time.  Signing up for those is just begging to get your email box spammed with junk.  So, is there anyone in the network engineering field who can help me find out where the companies are in my area to get into this profession?

15x5nz,2,2013-01-03,Stuck 30 year old :( {Out of Ideas and Ready to Listen},[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/15x5nz/stuck_30_year_old_out_of_ideas_and_ready_to_listen/,"Well, I graduated from HS in 2000. I traveled for a while with my then girlfriend and we worked at a family business out of state for a couple years. We saved every dime we made there and decided that we had a great idea of our own and took what meager funds we had saved and went back south to open our business idea.


 That same year we got married and then pregnant. Business was good and we weren’t concerned. I had wanted to go back to school for my passion but the time just wasn’t there. I began taking some classes at the local CC while running the shop. Things were going pretty well and then we found that our daughter was not speaking or developing as quickly as she was supposed to. After many tests, she was diagnosed with apraxia and we began paying for her costly therapy sessions 3 times per week.  This is when the credit cards came out since we were not poor enough to get it free, but still not rich enough to afford the treatment without financing. This lead to a pile of debt totally about $60,000. Whilst this was ongoing, we both redoubled our effort both at work and home. I neglected my school for a stint there in the middle, but I buckled back down and budgeted my time a little better and finished my AA. 


I got the idea that 2010 was the year to start my BA. I had a full head of steam and was buoyed by my daughter’s recovery and her strides forward. I have always loved Political Science and law so I figured what better field to get my degree in than something I loved. I majored in PS and minored in Law. During the two years I was at the 4-year school our own business felt the hardest pinch of the economy. Our customers just were not spending the same as they had been. Our landlord had raised the rent and several unforeseen emergencies had tapped us out of extra operational funds. After nearly a decade in business, we closed our doors in November.  Then in December I finished my degree graduating with honors (Dec 2012). I have been applying for jobs and attending interviews non-stop since graduation. I have yet to get even a nibble.


 I had an internship that was supposed to pan out with a job for the clerk but cutbacks from the governor’s office froze my offer and I walked away with merely a heartfelt letter of recommendation and a law school referral.  Since then my only lighthouse has been that I was accepted into both the Ms CIS:Computer Science and MBA program at a state university in for May 2013. I can combine the two degrees and graduate with both.  I have a ton of business experience and such so I would much rather have found some good employment and perhaps go to school part time while working. Seemingly, this is not to be. I must have filled out over 120 job applications with no takers, made a 100% complete linked in, got on careershift, monster, indeed, etc. 


On top of this back in July despite contraception my wife became pregnant again and now we have a baby boy due on the 21st of January. 



I just do not know what else to do. I suppose I will start applying at grocery stores, Staples, Walmart, Target, Sears, etc as apparently I can’t get a good job and we need money. It hurts to have to apply for jobs I held during HS.  


What am I missing in my job applications? Is my experience combined with the degree just not suitable for any good job?


I have never been depressed before in my life, but .......

Here is my lame-duck resume:

http://imgur.com/xpj1B


I will take any advice that I can. Please help me. I need some direction. I feel like a storm knocked me off course and now I am lost.

1612qn,3,2013-01-05,The Day of the Brother,[deleted],shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1612qn/the_day_of_the_brother/,"The streetlights cast a forlorn light over the man, trudging slowly through the alleyway. His well-tailored suit, pristine shoes and immaculately coiffured hair gave the impression of success. The buildings on either side of the road loomed over him, their iron-shuttered shopfronts grinning at the man as he strode ever onward.  His colleagues called him arrogant, his CV talked of a “driven and determined personality”. He was Lucius Green, millionaire banker, tax avoider, and owner of the 3rd largest collection of Lamborghinis in the world. He didn’t like this part of town, he thought, as he zipped up his designer coat and looked warily over his shoulder.

“Save yourself!, for the day of the brother is almost upon us!”

A crazed and bedraggled old man shuffled up to Lucius, his eyes darting around inside his head like ants in a Petri dish. He was wearing nothing more than rags.

“Pardon?” Lucius answered, maintaining politeness while trying hard not to spit in the old fool’s face. He didn’t have time for this.

“The alignment has begun! Those in rags shall be saved, kings shall be overthrown! The riches of nations will turn to ruin! There will be no greater day than the day of the brother!”

The man began to shriek, flecks of phlegm hitting Lucius’ priceless clothing. “heed my words!” he screamed. Spooked, the banker began to run. He hailed a taxi and was back in the leafy womb of Knightsbridge, or “civilization” as he called it, in no time.

Lucius woke up and lazily pawed through his smartphone’s news app.  It was the usual mix of tragedy in the Middle East and governmental incompetence at home. But something caught his eye.

“Reports are surfacing that the King of Tonga, Tupou VI, has been deposed and killed at his extravagant palace by a mob of dissidents. Their motive remains unknown.”

*Kings shall be overthrown…*

A coincidence, surely. Lucius put down his phone and rolled out of bed. Another long day of making millions in the City awaited him, and all of it would go straight to his offshore account in…

“Tonga…” he said aloud.

*The riches of nations will turn to ruin…*

Another coincidence, surely. 

Lucius strolled through the marble and glass hallways of his building, and was at his desk in seconds. He checked his email, informing him of his ever-larger bank balance.

Life was good. 

Until the phone rang.

“Mr Green, I am calling from Brother Capital. It seems that due to the unforeseen circumstances in Tonga, your account has been frozen, and therefore you will not be able to use any of your assets”

The man down the line had a grey, monotonous voice. He was not someone to start an argument with.

Lucius slowly put down the phone.

*The riches of nations will turn to ruin….*

Did the old man have a point?

Brother Capital…

“Don’t be such a bloody fool!” Lucius barked at himself. Today was one of those days better spent on the deck of your yacht.

He was just unlucky that his account got frozen because of some political unrest in some unfathomably hot corner of the world… was he? He shook his head and turned on Bloomberg.

The colour red hit him first. Red arrows, pointing down, all across the bottom of the screen. His eyes widened in disbelief. The news anchor was frantic, trying to keep up with collapsing stocks across the world. NASDAQ, FTSE, DAX… all plummeting. 

A single bead of sweat rolled down Lucius’ face. This was terminal. He had £60 million invested across the world, he was never going to get it all back… 

Was there a way out?

*Those in rags shall be saved…*

*The riches of nations will turn to ruin…*

“He was right!”  “He was right!” Lucius sprinted out of the room, knocking two interns out of the way with frantic force. He spilled out of the building and onto the road, still screaming at the top of his lungs. He tore at his Ralph Lauren shirt and proclaimed to the sky:

“Save yourself! For the day of the brother is upon us!”

He was at once accosted by an angry taxi driver.

“You don’t understand! You’ll never understand!, It’s all over! The day is upon us!”

The ragged banker turned, and sprinted down an alleyway.

You can look in my post history to see the long, drawn out story I wrote, I was in a pretty bad place.

Long story short, after deciding to transfer schools for our almost 2 year relationship a few months back, and her dumping me a couple of weeks before I moved (over the phone when I was coming up the next day for orientation anyway, she didn't bother to wait), I was depressed as all hell. After dragging myself through the mud for awhile, I talked to my family over Christmas. 

They helped me realize that I was very codependant in my relationship, and my natural independence I had possessed my whole life slowly faded away as the months went on. I wanted it back. 

In a span of five days, I re-enrolled at my old school, regained my financial aid, was accepted into my program, found a flat downtown at a good price, and regained my old job. On top of that, I nailed an interview for an internship (which is unfortunately near her, but there are always downsides) and start that in the summer.

What I'm trying to say is, although I still think and dream about her every single day, find yourself again. Find that person you were, and don't be afraid to do anything in your power to get it back. Be strong, independent, and motivated. 

I called her once three days after the breakup, never got a call back, and that was it for me, I got the picture. I boxed her stuff up (threw it out a couple of days ago), and blocked her and her family on all social media. That starts the healing process.

Everybody heals in their own way, and certain days are still a struggle for me, but just stay strong and positive. YOU deserve better, just be who you really are. And in your next relationship, never ever give that up for any reason.

Thanks r/Breakups for all your help. Stay strong, and be positive. We are all in this together. It's always darkest before the dawn."

I have been lurking here and r/law for a while now and I have never been more intrigued by the discussion and debate of the law. For that reason and many others, I've decided to pursue law as a career.

That said, I'm currently finishing my A.A degree at a community college and I hope to transfer to a nearby University to complete my four year degrees. I'm planning to major in English Literature and Economics. I loved literature and because I'm interested in the business side of law, I decided to also major in Economics.

Having almost completed the A.A, my question is when should I start studying for the LSAT and what are some things to know before I start? What things should I do to be more attractive to law school (e.g. volunteering, internship, references)?

Thank you in advance for any advice. 

EDIT: Grammar/Spelling

EDIT 2: This is a crosspost from r/law. I asked them and they recommended I ask my question here so if it seems like I am addressing r/law then that's why. I don't post much, and have yet to figure out how to do a real crosspost. "

Him -22M
Together for almost 6 years, living together since last August

Long story short, we started a long distance relationship that lasted for 4 years until he moved down here a year and a half ago. Our relationship has slowly gotten worse since we moved in together. On paper our relationship is pretty good, everything my SO does is to make me happy but I just don't feel it. I used to love him with everything I had and now I find myself looking forward to when he goes to work so I can have some time alone. I don't look forward to when he comes into my room to cuddle. It's usually uncomfortable when we have sex because I'm not in the mood but I agreed a few months ago that we'd have sex every Friday so we do. 

I'm mostly confused because these feelings are new, sort of. They've never been this intense before and I just don't know what to do. Our relationship isn't passionate and exciting, and while I know that love isn't always like that and that it takes work, I just don't want this huge commitment anymore. If I wanted to be married I would be, but I don't.

If we were still long distance, I would probably break up with him. My main issue is he moved here to be with me. He doesn't really have any of his own friends and I basically feel like I robbed him of the last almost 2 years because he could've been making a life for himself at home but he came here to make me happy. I'm pretty sure I would destroy his whole world by doing this and I just don't know how to do that to someone who's loved me unconditionally for almost 6 years.

My second issue is we both have a lease to the same apartment until August (though I am leaving in May for an internship so if he stayed here while I was gone it wouldn't be bad but that's a while from now) but more than that is we need to decide soon where we'd want to live next year so I couldn't wait until May to talk about breaking up if we'd already signed a lease somewhere else.

Honestly, I just don't know what to do. We've had such an amazing relationship up until now that I'm worried these feelings might pass and I've broken his heart for nothing. I don't know if I should wait, what to say when he talks about looking for apartments. I don't know a way to bring this up for discussion without ending it right there and I don't know how to function after that in the same apartment. I just don't know anything, other than currently I'm not happy.

**TL;DR: Been together almost 6 years (4 LDR 1.5 living together) and relationship has declined since living together. I'm craving alone time and don't know what that means in the long run. If the right thing to do is to break up, I also don't know how to go about doing that due to living arrangements.**

15zchx,1,2013-01-04,test,choperius,asd,https://www.reddit.com/r/asd/comments/15zchx/test/,"### Wanna help me?


Hi r/starcraft, I'm looking for any opportunity to do something in E-sports for money after I'm graduating 12th June.

Most people I read about who wants to get involved in E-sports are recommended to start out as a volunteer, and so I did. Soon one year ago I joined the Swedish E-sports news website [Rakaka.se](http://www.rakaka.se) (you have probably heard of it, right?) as a simple editor. Being an editor is not very simple though.


### Online


Since I started at Rakaka in March 2012 I've done this:
    
* published [137 news articles](http://www.rakaka.se/index.php?do=search&amp;search=chop&amp;type=3&amp;news=1)    
* published [213 videos](http://www.rakaka.se/index.php?do=search&amp;search=chop&amp;type=3&amp;news=2) or other similar content (the ones linked to the right at [Rakaka.se](http://www.rakaka.se))    
* published [47 articles](http://rakaka.se/index.php?do=search&amp;search=chop&amp;type=3&amp;news=3) involving stream embedds and similar

That's a total of [**397** articles](http://www.rakaka.se/index.php?do=search&amp;search=chop&amp;type=3&amp;news=0). I do also wanna point out that it took some time to get my feet wet, most of these posts are actually from after August when I started to post about **50-100** articles a month instead of my earlier average of **10** posts a month.




### WCS Europe Finals (Stockholm, Sweden)


* In September I visited WCS Europe Finals to make coverage together with [bobhund](http://reddit.com/u/bobhund). Together we produced 6 interviews with [MaNa](http://rakaka.se/index.php?newsID=19822), [Seiplo](http://rakaka.se/index.php?newsID=19823), [BabyKnight](http://rakaka.se/index.php?newsID=19832), [SortOf](http://rakaka.se/index.php?newsID=19833), [ThorZaIN](http://rakaka.se/index.php?newsID=19834) and [Grubby](http://rakaka.se/index.php?newsID=19835). The only one I did was with SortOf though and it didn't go very well, but it was my first interview, and I expect to improve at it. I recorded the other interviews that [bobhund](http://twitter.com/_bobhund_) did and also two [walk-arounds](http://www.rakaka.se/index.php?newsID=19818). Since this was my first event as press I learned a lot about how to do event coverage, interviews and etc. 




### DreamHack Winter 2012 (Jönköping, Sweden)


In November I visited DreamHack for my 6th time.


Together with [Iceman](https://twitter.com/nameci), [Ciaiei](https://twitter.com/ciaiei), Grue and [EndarSpire](http://twitter.com/EndarSs) from Rakaka I produced a ton of videos. We made 17 interviews only with StarCraft-related people. I did [one with TLO](http://rakaka.se/index.php?newsID=20089) which didn't become very good either, but I didn't give up because of that.    


* [r/starcraft post with interviews](/http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/13rmyx/great_bunch_of_dreamhack_interviews/)


I did also get to use our Canon EOS 7D a lot more and took some nice pictures, two of them made it to the frontpage of r/starcraft.    


* [TLO photobombing Western Wolves](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/13o05j/tlo_photobombing_western_wolves/)    


* [Weird picture of the Liquid family](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/13pucz/weird_picture_of_the_liquid_family/)    




### THOR Open (Stockholm, Sweden)


Two weeks after DreamHack Winter I went to THOR Open together with [EndarSpire](http://twitter.com/EndarSs) to make some more coverage since it went well at DreamHack. Here we focused on covering every game (there was about 7 different tournaments) so we didn't get a lot of StarCraft content, but we managed to talk to VortiX, his brother Ryo, Ourk and Bischu. 

* [r/starcraft post with links](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/14kgnp/a_great_bunch_of_interviews_from_thor_open_2012/).    
* I did also make [an okay 9 min interview with the Swedish Dota 2 player Akke](http://rakaka.se/index.php?newsID=20199) (currently playing for No Tidehunter).


Next event I plan to go to is IEM Katowice in Poland.


### Other than Rakaka?


Before Rakaka I was involved a lot in the Online Arena PvP game [Bloodline Champions](http://www.bloodlinechampions.com) for about two years.  A game developed by the Swedish company [Stunlock Studios](http://www.stunlockstudios.com) and published by [Funcom](http://www.funcom.com), tailored for E-sports. Sadly it didn't succeed very well but [James Harding (2GD)](http://twitter.com/follow2GD), who worked as an E-sports Manager for the project, managed to get the community three DreamHack tournaments where I participated and finished at 5th place out of 16 all three times. [Semmler](http://twitter.com/Semmler_) who works for [The GD Studio](http://www.reddit.com/r/thegdstudio) does also come from the BLC community.


* In BLC I was a part of a group of the best players called ""council"" who gave feedback on the balance of the game and tested out new patches on a QA (Quality Assurance) server.


* I did also run a daily news blog about the scene, which can be found [here](http://choperi.us/archive).


### Who am I?


18-year-old from Sweden, currently living in Stockholm studying Natural Science at the ""gymnasium"" (similar to High School I guess). I'm graduating at the 12th of June though, therefore I'm looking for something to do after school. 


Apart from E-sports I played chess before, I keep pretty good track of the public debate in Sweden, like to discuss on forums and read books. I have also begun to work-out.

### What do I want to do?


I'm very passionate about E-sports in general and perceive myself as very open minded. Actually, for now I'm open for anything that can give me enough to pay my rent where I'm going to live. I'm good at writing and interested in social media. I'm open for most countries around the world, though Germany is appreciated since I want to get better at German, which is my third language after Swedish and English.


Internships, full-time or part-time are all interesting.

### Where can I reach you?


You can reach me at 

* [Twitter (@choperius)](http://twitter.com/choperius)


* Skype (ch0ppen)


* E-mail (alexander.holzmann.ekholm@gmail.com)

* [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/edit?locale=en_US&amp;trk=hb_tab_pro_top)


### tl;dr:
I'm looking for opportunities in esports, summer/fall 2013. I've been volunteering for Rakaka.se for soon a year and done coverage at three big events. Got any tips?




That's all, I'm thankful for every tip or comment,

We knew each other since we were 3 years old and were close friends in high school, so I went into the relationship already being attached to her.

The problem is it's been really one-sided. We're 3 hours apart but I'm always the one visiting her. I'm always the one calling her. I'm always the one trying to Skype her. I've invited her to visit on several occasions and she's always busy; she can't even come for one day out of the weekend despite all the times that I drove to visit her. So since she is ""busy"" during the school year I invited her to visit after her exams were over, but she still didn't come up. It gets exhausting and I feel like not asking her out anymore because I always know that the answer will ""no"".

I'm partly in the wrong for all this because I never expressed to her how much this has been bothering me. I guess I just bottle it all up because I don't want to seem ""needy"" or whatever. But we got in a little fight over Christmas break where I ended up saying ""I don't know if I can do this anymore"". She thought that meant I was breaking up with her and got really mad and didn't talk to me for a couple days. 
We talked on the phone the other day and basically established that we need to work on our communication, but before I could get to how I was feeling about the stuff above she said she had to go to bed to get up early.

Today she's in the process of moving to another city (only 2 hours away) for an internship so she's pretty busy, so two nights ago I called her hoping we could talk about stuff since she probably wouldn't want to do it during move-in weekend. She apparently was out with friends and said she was really tired but that we will talk tomorrow (last night). But once again last night she blew me off and said she couldn't talk and said she was too tired and that her phone was dying. Which is always the excuse.

I was upset by that and haven't talked to her or texted her since, and she hasn't made any effort to talk to me. Is this situation salvageable at all? Should I try contacting her or should I wait until she contacts me? I hate playing stupid games but honestly I'm tired of always trying to get ahold of her because right now I have no idea if she cares about me or not.

I want to be with her but I can't be with her if things are always going to be like this. I thought things would start to get ""better"" since we agreed we would work on communicating better, but since she ended up blowing me off and hasn't tried talking to me since I'm not sure any more.

**TL;DR Girlfriend has never put in much work in our relationship. We got in a fight last week and haven't talked much lately; afterwards we said we were going to work on communicating better but she ended up blowing me off and hasn't talked to me since. Should I do anything at this point? Thanks**

162j09,16,2013-01-06,Miles Moon - Slither Hunter,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/162j09/miles_moon_slither_hunter/,"You know how some people spend their entire lives wishing things were different, hoping that something will come along and make everything more interesting? They’re the type of people that spend so much time complaining that they’re bored, they never do anything to combat the boredom. Well I wasn’t one of those people, I was happy with things just the way they were.

The name’s Miles Moon, once upon a time I was a normal guy, a writer of sorts, just making my way through life and taking everything as it came. Very few interesting events happened, it was peaceful, I liked it that way.
 But good things don’t stay that way, and the day I was enlisted turned my quiet existence on it’s head, now I’m Miles Moon - Slither Hunter, and nothing is ever going to be the same again.

You’re probably wondering what a Slither is. You know about them, or the affect that they have anyway. Slithers are creatures from the dawn of creation, beings that don’t quite belong in our dimension, but have made it their home anyway, Slithers are a cause of nightmares, depression, murders and suicide, and for the most part, they’re also a damn nuisance. 

There’s a chance you’ve seen one, if you’ve ever seen something out of the corner of your eye, or felt a breeze in a draft-free room, then you’ve most likely come into contact with a Slither, and you should be afraid, because where there’s a Slither, there’s trouble.

							               ***

I remember the first time I saw one, though I didn’t know what it was back then. It was the day of my Grandfathers funeral, and we were standing around the grave, I was too young to really understand death, only five, looking back I’m amazed that I was even at the gravesite. 

 It appeared after the priest had finished and the family had been left to grieve, everyone was standing around hugging each other and crying, I was holding my mum’s hand while she cried into my father’s shoulder, not really sure what I was supposed to do. I was sad, sure, I loved my Popo, but I’d accepted that I wouldn’t see him again. 

That’s when I saw it, the Slither, it was hanging around outside the circle of family and friends, at first I could only see it in glimpses as it passed behind people. Curiosity got the better of me and I let go of my mothers hand, it seemed to be going around and around the circle, so I stepped out in front of it, just before it passed us by.

The world froze, birds that had been singing were instantly silenced, and the noises of mourning vanished. It stopped and looked at me, I don’t think it knew what to do, it sort of swished it’s head from side to side, as though searching for something. It was ugly, it’s rather hard to forget what a Slither looks like. 

Imagine a tadpole, but grey in colour and about fifty times bigger, the size of a full grown adult, they float above the ground as though they’re swimming in water, and their tails seem to turn into mist before disappearing completely. They have arms of a sort too, protruding from just under the head, they’re long and spindly things, with two joints in each that might be elbows, they end at a point, which when spread turns into a four fingered hand, there are no nails, but their skin ends up the width of a needle on each finger.

The heads are harder to describe, they don’t really have one, there’s a bulge and the body just sort of rounds off at the front, where they keep their face. The faces are interesting, they take on the likeness of the last person who’s life they’ve affected, and keep it until their next pray succumbs. The faces they take are lifeless, with grey orbs instead of eyes and a mouth that turns into a black emptiness past the teeth. The one that I saw on the day of my grandfathers funeral will stay with me forever, because it was wearing his face.

It made up it’s mind about what to do next, snapping it’s face back to me, looking at me with a cold and dead version of my grandfathers eyes, and it started to advance. I didn’t move, I was scared, but something was stopping me, I willed my legs to turn around and run, but they didn’t.

 It crept closer by the second, I found myself unable to look away from those eyes, and I was sure that it was opening it’s mouth wider and wider the closer it got, I tried to scream, but my mouth was following my legs example and stayed firmly closed.

 I could feel a chill on my face when it was inches away, I started to think about the next week, when it would be my grave the adults were crowded around, and my mum would be crying even harder than today.

 Then a strange thing happened, there had been no sound since I'd locked eyes with the creature, but there was sound now, a low hum that seemed to be coming from all around, the Slither must have heard it too, because it suddenly started to back away, thrashing from side to side, it’s form seeming to bulge and bubble, before exploding in front of my eyes.

The second it exploded I could move again, and it was just in time to cover my face with my arms, making sure I got none of the creature on me. When I lowered my arms again I saw a figure walking towards me.

“Name?” The man asked, as he put a metallic object back into his pocket, and took a notebook out of the other.

“What?” I could feel my eyes welling up with tears, I looked around for my mum, but the adults were all frozen in place, it was silent again.

“Look kid, I’m sorry that I have to do this, but you’re a Hunter, and we’re fighting a losing battle, so we need everyone.” The man sighed, he flipped open the notebook to a clean page and knelt down so that he was at my level.

“Miles... Miles Moon.” I could feel my lip quivering as I said it, the man looked at me sadly, before writing the name in the book and patting me on the shoulder.

							               ***

That’s what I remember of the day, for the longest time I was scared of what I saw, but as I gradually got older I started to forget, my memories faded as childhood memories often do, and the Slither, along with the man, disappeared into the haze.

I managed to forget about them for seventeen years, during that time I led a nice and normal life, going to university, getting an internship, and eventually landing an awesome writing job. Everything was falling into place, but all that changed on my 22nd birthday, when I was visited by the person that would change my life. 

I’d decided on a quiet one, just a small gathering of friends at a local restaurant, I’ve never been one for big parties, so I was happy to just spend the day with those that were closest to me. The place was nearly empty by the time we’d finished eating, and I think the waiters were sick of living up to their name, I asked for the cheque. 

My girlfriend, Alex, leaned over to me as the waiter skipped towards the register, and whispered into my ear.

“Hey, I don’t want to freak you out, but that man over there has been staring at you since we got here, don’t make it obvious.” She squeezed my hand under the table and lifted my finger to point to the man, I casually took a swig from my drink and looked at him over the top of the glass.

He was younger than I was, hardly a man at all, probably still a teenager, but Alex was right, he was staring right at me, and the plate of food in front of him had barely been touched. He saw me looking, and stood up.

“Everyone ready to go?” I turned to the group, who were playing the ‘how many toothpicks can you get to support each other' game, none of them paid attention to me.

The man walked around our table and straight up to me, Alex squeeze my hand again, before turning around to watch the toothpick contest with faux fascination.

“Mr Moon?” The man extended a hand, I took it. 

That was the second time in my life when the universe stood still, all of the tiny movements around me suddenly stopped, the sound of the register broke off mid slam, and the beginning of shouts from my friends were instantly silenced. I turned to see a handful of toothpicks half way to the tabletop, and Steve with a mad grin on his face stood above them.

“Cool.” I turned to the young man who’s hand I was still holding, he smiled.

“I’m impressed, most people usually start with ‘What the-,’ not ‘Cool.’” He let go of my hand and grabbed a chair from the table behind us. “My name is Rathford, and it’s a pleasure to meet you Miles Moon.”

“Are you like him? That man?” My childhood memories had come flooding back to me the moment that the universe froze, I remembered the creature at my grandfathers funeral, and the man that had taken my name.

“I am, and I’m here for you Mr Moon, I’m going to offer you a job.” 

“I have a job.” I responded, picking up my drink to take another swig, it didn’t work, the liquid stayed defiantly at the bottom of the glass, Rathford grinned.

“You don’t have a job like this one, you’re a Hunter Miles, the ability was temporarily buried by my co-worker until you were ready, but it’s about to come back in full.”

“What ability?” I put the glass down, hoping I hadn’t looked too foolish.

“The power to see the Slithers.”

“Slithers? You mean that grey tadpole thing?”  Rathford laughed at the description.

“I suppose they do look a bit like tadpoles don’t they, but yes, they’re the Slithers, and there’s considerably more than just the one at your grandfathers funeral.”

							               ***

So that’s my story, and here I am, fighting in a war that I didn’t even know existed until my 22nd birthday. The Slithers are the scourge of the earth, and if there weren’t people like me keeping them at bay, then they’d run rampant and destroy us in weeks.

I don’t know what makes me special, Rathford told me that they haven’t worked out why some people can see the Slithers and most can’t, but they’re hoping to try and find out, it could be the key to a decisive victory against them, and the end to the suffering.

Ah yes, the suffering, I should probably qualify this. See it’s a hard life for myself and the other Slither Hunters, we’re tasked with tracking down and exterminating them, until such time as we can find out which hell they come from and close the door. We have to give up everything for this, our families, any friends, our whole lives, though I suppose that we do get the ability to control time, and an arsenal of weapons.

But it’s a much harder life for the human race, people that otherwise have great potential, or an untapped intelligence, will simply collapse one day, any future ripped from them, the lucky ones are killed, the unlucky ones... well, they simply become husks, and that person becomes just another meal for the Slithers.

Honestly, if it weren’t for the fact that we’re on a pretty level playing field, the human race would have been wiped out aeons ago. "

I know it will be hard but the payoff will be great once I am through it all. I will of course teach myself along the way too. I am poor so tuition came into play here, these are not very expensive schools, though living around the Boston area has made my selection tough ( a LOT of the schools in Boston are expensive) compared to other areas in the US.

These are the course layouts for each college. If you have the time please look through some and tell me what you think. I would like to start CS in the next 6 months or even go to CC to get my math courses out of the way there.

I live in Massachusetts so Salem State and Fitchburg would have resident fees (lower tuition) so that is a plus.

Thanks, hopefully you guys can help me out. A redditor was talking to me on skype and explaining CS and what exactly goes on in the field. Once I talekd to him it gave me the motivation to actually go through with going to school for this. I was always put off by the large amount of math involved but I am willing to put in the effort to do what I want and hopefully study and work hard to get internships and so forth along the way. Thanks reddit for the help you have already given me.

If I messed up my formatting I will fix it, I am still new around here.

edit: I typed the formatting the same for the others for Fitch but it keeps coming out wrong :( Anyways for Fitchburg simply select Computer Science to get the layout for the course."
1625uf,6,2013-01-06,I'd like to share a story that's never told in any support group. A story of a false diagnosis with some detail attached.,[deleted],BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1625uf/id_like_to_share_a_story_thats_never_told_in_any/,"Pull up a chair.

I’ve been meaning to write this for a while. I used to be a regular here on an old account before I left the forum. I had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder type II for almost 4 years until I started questioning it. I was dead positive I had it. I mean, I experienced symptoms, could relate to those with the illness, went to psyche hospitals, had a psychiatrist, had therapists, went to a PHP and an IOP, basically the works. Last June, I even stated in a support group that I considered myself a severe case and symptoms have started emerging in childhood. It was all a false positive. I wish that sometime in the middle of it someone made a detailed account of a false diagnosis and what it was like going through it. It’s something that’s never told in support groups or forums or programs because anyone that got a false positive has moved on and left. So I guess I’ll be the one to tell the story. 

Around mid-July, I realized that no matter how much therapy and treatment I got, I still felt like shit. Always. Not so much at times, but a deep misery was always in the background. I started questioning whether these “treatments” were actually beneficial to me. By the end of the month, I realized that they were in fact crippling me further. Every doctor, therapist, counselor, patient, and institution has treated me like a psychiatric train wreck. I was convinced I was, and needed a new way of solving problems. 

Before going any further, it’s important to know several things about me. **1)** I have some pretty severe sleep issues and they’re measurable. They’ve been, for the last several years, the fuel of my diagnosis. I saw my pdoc in an effort to figure out these sleep issues (always feeling tired, hypersomnia – the sleep for 3 days kind, an unpredictable sleep schedule – travelling around the world through its time zones, and hyposomnia – 3 hours of sleep for 3 days was all my body could force itself to do leading me into being psychotically miserable and exhausted). These issues come and go and can’t be predicted. Sounds like a symptom of bipolar disorder, does it not? And **2)** I’ve had to overcome more than the average amount of hardships than the regular person. Enough said.

So things weren’t working. I was in college and forcing myself to do work. I was lonely for any sort of companionship. I wasn’t doing well in school. My GPA was shot (partly because of mental health and sleep reasons, partly because of my own fault). Before “the disorder hit” I was active in extracurriculars, ejoyed working, and even ran for president of my RHA first semester. Aside from some easy on campus jobs for 4 semesters, I’ve been doing nothing with my life since 2008 and I have pretty much nothing to show for it. Nothing special at all. Nothing measurable. Now I have a panel of people telling me how fucked up I am on top of everything else? Great. More crap to wipe up. 

The first thing I did was realize that I could go without my “panel of negativity” (Sure, most were trying to help. But in the end, none of them did). I cut myself off from any sort of talk therapy. The last thing I needed was someone telling me I had more problems which I don’t have. I decided that meds were something I still needed to take. I’ve had bad experiences with just about everything I was given, and nothing seemed to make much of a difference expect lithium (and what a difference that made without me realizing). So the plan was see an overworked pdoc once a month for 15 minutes to get myself a refill and be on my way. The rest was up to me. 

In the beginning of August, I dropped out of school instead of showing up to a final and decided my life was destroyed and I needed time to fix it. One thing was certain, I had some *fucked up* sleeping patterns. I’ve been to a psyche hospital 3 times. The first time in late 2011 was because I could almost never sleep. 6 hours every two days grew itself into a luxury. I was exhausted all the time, my memory was blown to shit, my perception of time was off, I became increasingly psychotic, and I wasn’t handling it well mentally (watching myself screw up in school by taking exams on 2 days of no sleep wasn’t fun, and when you just cannot physically fall asleep after trying so hard to it becomes physically painful – you can *feel* your frustration). They called it mania and it was off to the looney bin with me.

I stayed there for 2 weeks. Why 2 weeks? Because I tried to kill myself over the summer. Long story short, I got fired, got heartbroken, became a hermit, lost most of my friends due to isolating myself, and made a premeditated decision to kill myself. Wow. How depressing. I was running out of meds and didn’t want to spend the 50+ dollars to keep receiving them if I wasn’t going to be around by the end of the month. Literally, the day of my planned attempt I started feeling better and attributed it to mania after ceasing meds. So that was the topic of choice amongst my negativity panel for some time. 

Then there was my next lock up. My sleeping issues were once again ruining me, so I went back to the hospital under the name of depression. I stayed for 10 days, went to another PHP, etc. etc. The works. I was in this program doing summer classes, and I always seem to get depressed during the summer, so a PHP, some classes to keep me busy, and a med change was the best of what I could do at the time. I did get depressed pretty badly during last summer (the one which immediately following my second stay), and my sleep issues manifested themselves into something so uncontrollable. This is where I began sleeping for days on end. Sounded like depression to me, so let’s keep trying to treat that I thought. 

Then, adjoining with the beginning of the post, I went through a questioning period. One of my friends whom I met at the hospital first time around was going through the exact same phase. It was later where I would realize how important our friendship was in the course of changing events. 

So there I was, college dropout living back at home with recently divorced Mom and taking all the emotional abuse she had to offer. Not good. This led to my third hospitalization. I called an old counselor asking for a refill (didn’t have a pdoc at the time) and someone to talk to for a conversation on alternate housing. A few hours later, some cops and a screener show up to my house and told me they’re taking me to the ER. What the fuck. I went to a very violent hospital (the only one nearby), and no combination of words, actions, or calmness could convince them to let me stay home. Within a few days there most of the staff realized that I had no reason to really be there. The doctors kept me there for a week as a “precaution.” 

I left the place in early September and decided I’ve been betrayed, unintentionally harassed, and shat on by psychiatry. I had tens of thousands of dollars in student loans, hospital bills, and program bills and NOTHING to show for it. No improvement. It was then that I started asking the big question: Am I actually bipolar? My friend mentioned earlier was getting tossed about the system in the same manner as I was and had the same questions I had. It was then I started really breaking down and analyzing what I thought and was told were symptoms. Let’s break it down.

Sleep. The easiest to measure. I had always thought of my sleep issues as post-mental illness. The plan was to go to doctors and sleep specialists and get a real diagnosis from that (and get tossed around and fed shit from THAT system as well until I received some real help). I was pretty depressed when I went to the hospital the second time, no doubt about that. But wait. Let’s look at the formal and recognized definition of mental illness for a second…

*1) A mental illness is a result of internal dysfunction.*

*2) A mental illness must prove to have severe impairment.*

*3) A mental illness cannot be from the result of external stimuli.*

The reason I was depressed was because I just watched myself get destroyed by school due to my sleep patterns, laziness, and tendencies to be late for everything. Actually, come think of it, it’s always been a similar story to that. My sleep issues came before any sort of “symptoms” emerging from them. It breaks rule 3. I had an app where you could monitor your mood (I posted it on her once) and I used it to track not only mood, but amount of sleep I got. There was a pattern. I would alternate between a high and low amount of sleep (15 hours day 1, 11 hours day 2, 14 hours day 3, 10 hours day 4, etc.) My mood followed the pattern almost perfectly, and that *makes sense*. It would make sense to be in a bad mood when your body gets less sleep than it’s used to. Sleep issues, the backbone of my diagnosis had to be taken off the list.

“Fearchosis.” Yeah, I made up that word. Since around March I’ve been experiencing rare instances where things just get “weird and scary” for a while. The best way I can describe it is taking an infinite list of *everything* you know (how to turn on the shower, where you live and how you got there, your friend Cindy and who she is) and trying to read it back to yourself while you realize that nothing on it actually makes clear sense to you. I call it fearchosis because it’s scary when that happens, sort of like a panic attack without an elevated heartbeat or sweat. I *guess* it can be similar to psychosis, as that’s what doctors called it (/whatever other symptom they can’t explain), but I didn’t actually leave my basis of reality. I was firmly grounded in it actually. It just became unfamiliar in a sort of “HOW THE FUCK DID I GET HERE?” kind of question you ask yourself when you’re 38, married, and with children in a new state. But alas! A pattern emerged. These would only happen if I missed sleep either the night before or the night before that. It never happened any other time. Since it breaks rule 3, this one’s also off the list.

Racing thoughts. I used to get these occasionally at random. It seemed to satisfy all 3 rules, so maybe there’s something to my diagnosis. After all, let’s be careful before abandoning medications and therapy. The first time I was in the hospital, I was given abilify. I was forced to take it same time every day. Towards the end of my stay, from around 1:30 – 5:00 PM, I experienced a quick manic depressive cycle, something new to me (should have noticed that…). I was a little bit too cheerful for an asylum and then at the exact same time I began feeling like shit. The meds were screwing with my emotions and moods. I stopped taking abilify because of the side effects immediately after discharge, and when it left my system the side effects and mood swings were gone and I was back to just being depressed all the time (should have noticed that…#2). The thought that my meds were affecting my mood negatively didn’t really daunt me until a few months ago. When I was analyzing my symptoms, I put this one “on hold” in the event of a possibility that I have a more mild case of bipolar disorder. 

Anger. I almost never lose my shit, or at least not visually. When one of my roommates found out about my diagnosis, he had a hard time believing it because he’d never seen me angry. Despite my ability to keep calm in stressful situations, I do get angry like everyone else, but I can’t recall a time where anger was inappropriate. I mean, I saw a man get pushed and beaten into a wall right behind me in my third stay at a ward because a stranger brushed shoulders with him as he passed by. I don’t get that. So by rules 1 and 2, that symptom’s off the list as well. 

Drug abuse. Yeah, I do that. But it isn’t constant. There were only a small handful of times I’ve gotten drunk/tipsy alone (a few times when I was coming home from working two jobs 60 hours a week, and once when I got depressed before my second hospital stay). I did drink a lot my senior year of college, and no doubt that affected other things too, but it was always with company and rarely to escape. I have used drugs as escape routes before, but hey, so did Private Joe when his friend in ‘Nam was burned to death and he wasn’t bipolar. Other than tobacco, I’ve never developed an addiction. I go on binges and then when my supply runs out I don’t bother with getting more. I stopped using any sort of narcotics since around March unless they were prescribed for legitimate medical reasons (a few close calls for addiction, but I worked through it each time). Looking back, though I did a LOT of experimenting, and that seems to be all it was. I rarely did a drug more than once or twice and then go on to trying something else. I guess I was just curious, and sometimes I needed a break from things. Breaks all 3 rules.

Mania. The euphoria of mania can be very difficult to accurately diagnose. There are times where I notice myself talking faster, where I get more cheerful and excited for little reason, etc. I went by the typical “journalistic” definition (the “OMG, I think I might have that” definition). As I heard account and stories from and of those were had a clear cut mania episode, I began realizing that I couldn’t relate. All of those stories were much more severe and stranger than mine. I act like an ass sometimes when I’m excited, but I’ve never lost friendships, got myself into debt, engaged in strange erotic behavior, hurt anyone, make any important impulsive decisions, or ANY of that. I do get lost usually, but hey, so does my Mom. Maybe I just don’t pay attention and suck at coordinates? Even then, not a big deal. I did get what I thought were manic episodes, but I also got those when abilify came into the picture. Either it was cancelling out my other meds or causing the problem completely. I never got manic for more than a full day. There was one time, which doctors and I used as a measure of my mania severity, in which I impulsively bought a 550 dollar guitar when I was “just browsing.” The thing is, though, it was a really nice guitar and I’m a musician. I touch it almost every day, and I paid for it in cash. As in, I didn’t use credit, I didn’t go into debt, it was something I could afford, I didn’t take the money away from anything else, and I don’t regret the purchase. It seems like all 3 rules were broken with this one. The more I learned about what true mania was in detail, the more I realized I’ve never experienced anything like it.

Depression. It’s so, so, so difficult to accurately measure depression. I mean, my Mom was having financial issues and going through a horrible divorce when she decided to make a stop at as pdoc. The guy just GAVE her benzos and SSRIs on her first visit as if she had a clear cut mental illness (for those curious, the antidepressants ended up not working (well, duh. It was made for a neurological disorder) and the benzos became “Mother’s Little Helper”). A massive point often ignored by pdocs and patients alike: **There is a difference in feeling depressed and being unhappy.** I was pretty unhappy, and to a high degree I still am. But hey, I’m a college dropout who left behind a shitty GPA, I live at home with an emotionally draining Mother, I have no girlfriend / much experience with them, no job, no internship experience, no volunteer work, most of my friends were lost from isolation graduation and moving from place to place, my dad hates our family and left one day without saying goodbye, I have no figures to look up to, I’m in physical pain almost every day, and I’ve done basically jack shit for the last 5 years of my life. I‘ve done nothing special with myself, nothing I can call an achievement. I have hobbies, but those are just hobbies. I was always timid and lazy to meet new people and join clubs at school, and my schedule was always packed with shit to do to the point where I was always busy catching up on or procrastinating schoolwork. I made excuses. LOTS of them. This is a “symptom” I couldn’t ignore, but at the same time, there was always a reason for it, and depression always happened after this reason. It broke rule 3 pretty hard. 

So there. My psychiatric profile in a nutshell. Aside from racing thoughts, and a few more minor issues not mentioned, it seems like things are pointing towards a misdiagnosis. Time to do something about it. Time to answer my questions through experiment rather than by just pondering. Let’s go back to the system, explain myself, and then promptly get SHAT ON by it.

**If there’s one lesson to be learned from all of this and from this entire post, it’s this. The practice of psychiatry is inefficient.** I could say it’s a joke, but I can’t forget the people who actually do have mental illnesses that are receiving treatment the best ways that are practical. But it’s undeniable that a rather significant portion of mental patients are mis/overdiagnosed. The system is set-up in a way that this just happens naturally, even with the “good docs.” The DSM wasn’t always the way it is now (a list of disorders and their symptoms). It used to be organized free writing of mental disorders. This approach was back when talk therapy was popular (~1920s). Patients would see a therapist and talk things out before jumping to conclusions. Breakthroughs sometimes took months, the process took a long time, and it could be a while before a diagnosis was declared – if any (well, those are some rare words). Psychology was *as it should be*. Doctors were actually careful and focused on accuracy before just slapping a label on. Currently, with the way our modern system is set up, you need insurance to approve your help before you get it. You go into a new doctor’s office, have only a 30-50 minute interview with a doctor, and he’s supposed to decide whether you have a lifelong condition before lunch. Why are there multiple steps in getting major surgery but only one for getting a lifelong psychiatric diagnosis? 

Everyone here has seen the criteria they use to judge you with. You get a form. On it, there are about 12-15 vague and generalized questions like “do you have racing thoughts often?” How often is often? Like, every day, once a week,  what? Well, what exactly are racing thoughts? Do they mean thinking of all the things you have to do before the day ends on your commute from work and stressing out? Not really. It’s more like having a thought cloud containing fragmented bits of sentences, concepts, and ideas where your stream of consciousness is physically much faster as you try to grab these thoughts. I never experienced that, but that’s how clear cut patients describe it. I thought I had racing thoughts, but it was really just the former idea. Why was NONE OF THIS explained to me? I even asked questions like this during interviews with new pdocs, and I was just told “don’t think about it too deeply, just answer honestly.” No. Fuck that. If this sheet of paper is what determines my diagnosis, then I want to know what every question means. I’m basically diagnosing myself here. It’s your job to oversee that I do it correctly, not just give automatic confirmation. 

And automatic confirmation is what it pretty much is. If someone goes to a psychiatrist, then they think something’s wrong with them / looking for speed and valium, right? That doctor could get a nasty lawsuit if he just said you were ok and let you go if you wound up killing yourself a week later. So he writes *some* diagnosis down and plans to explore it later. I’m told by staff at a mental ward that a bipolar diagnosis is what’s given if a doctor really can’t figure out what’s wrong with a patient and has about an hour to make the decision. It’s an easy diagnosis since it covers basically the whole spectrum of moods. If someone selects the correct words and actions, anyone can get a bipolar diagnosis. I know this from trying to change it. The doctor will mostly likely give you a prescription (if it isn’t narcotic), hand you a pamphlet on it if you bug him enough, and send you on your way. But hey, the doctor did write down his opinions and you’ll get more visits later so you should have a chance to really look over your diagnosis before making a confirmation like that, right? In practice, this isn’t what happens. Doctors are so swamped with patients that some only see them for 15 minutes. They don’t know you.  Period. The second time you’ll see time, they’ll barely remember you if at all, so they pull up your charts and see “Bipolar Disorder” along with your Seroquel prescription and just start talking about how the meds are working for you instead of really debunking your hasty diagnosis. There’s a lot of precaution that goes into liability of a mental patient (taking them in, not releasing them too early at wards, making sure they keep getting prescribed medication, etc.), but hardly ANY of the precaution goes into the accuracy of a diagnosis itself. This is an invisible, permanent illness here, and the drugs which are expected to be taken throughout a whole lifetime have a massive list of unhealthy side effects. This isn’t a decision a doctor can make in a 30 minute interview.

It’s easy to be misinformed and work your way towards a prescription whilst being completely honest. Surveys have been taken to determine how much of the population is mentally ill, and they all fall flat on their faces because they’re just not reliable. A patient / survey taker is expected to answer very general questions on a topic they know little to nothing about. In my case, I heard “impulsive spending” in a description of mania and stated my guitar as evidence even though it wasn’t the result of mania at all. There’s just no detail anywhere. “Do you feel down lately?” What a completely subjective question. I bet I’d answer it much differently if my fiancée left me at the alter last week compared to if I just got promoted to a six figure salary. Mental illnesses are basically self-diagnosing and going to the office of someone with an MD. Even those who make the informal diagnoses are uneducated. If your son’s teacher tells you that she thinks your kid has ADHD, guess what they based that off of. The DSM? Academic journals? Chances are, their knowledge of ADHD was based entirely on conversations with other teachers in the break room. There was a HUGE spike in diagnosis in the mid-90s because that’s when pill manufactures realized they’d get a lot more customers if they advertised directly to the consumer instead of just the doctors handling this stuff. Your diagnosis today is what information you choose to reveal about yourself in a 40 minute interview. People are expected to make critical choices when they don’t have the education to make them. Stating the obvious, the mood you were in the office affects your diagnosis severely. Hell, the doctors are “trained” to look for subtle hints not just at interviews but subsequent visits. Drinking coffee &gt; fidgeting ledge = mania. Staying up late to finish paper  &gt; exhaustion from sleep deprivation = depression.  Coming to my last criticism of the diagnosis process, the whole practice of psychiatry is just a big, grey, hairy catch 22. 

It’s an endless loop in a game you can’t win. I can’t tell you the amount of times I’ve been given a new prescription based solely on the fact that I happen to be talking fast in the office or something equally as trivial. What exactly is the proper “doctor’s office etiquette?” How can you best assure that your follow ups are judged neutrally? Do I act more energetic when I’m in a good mood and risk mania talk or do I stay emotionless and bland and risk being called depressed? I don’t know. There’s no way I can compile all of my feelings, emotions, and thoughts of the past month in a single 30 minute session. Instead, the same questions get asked to get me my refill (Voices in your head? Feel like hurting yourself or others? “How’s your mood?”) and new ones are added based on how I present myself at THAT particular time. The deeper I went into the field, the more confident I became that I was a severe case and knew symptoms well. Yes, I did keep track of my behaviors and emotions pretty closely, but I was systematically wrong in what was actually a real “symptom.” This led to doctors trusting my word instead of questioning it. But if I firmly stated “this is not a symptom,” there would be a disagreement. That hospital on my third stay kept claiming I was severely depressed, but they were neglecting rule 3. I told them of how my life was genuinely shitty without any sort of mood disorder on top of it, but it was still labeled a symptom. I first mentioned my guitar purchase years ago to my long term pdoc. How come no one ever asked if it impaired me or even if I was a musician? Why were these questions ignored? Are psychiatrists really just prescription machines? Put yourself in my situation. You’ve been through the mental health system in full. You left a long track record of the places you’ve been to, the doctor’s you’ve seen, and the symptoms you claimed to have. You weren’t given the chance to amend your charts. You were brainwashed, lied to, and not given information. You fueled your own diagnosis. Years have passed. You are now educated and as time goes on you’re finding natural causes for your problems and natural, yet simple, solutions to them and they work. You’ve realized that everyone, including yourself, was just incorrect and you’re largely to blame. Maybe you’re just fucked up, but psychiatric medication isn’t going to fix that. You’ve left behind you a whole crowd full of friends, family, professionals, and strangers with a firm understanding that your problems are not like theirs, that your loneliness is different than whatever they experience. They know you’re different, that you’re not like them. You need special care. Locking you in an asylum would do you good. You’re a psychiatric train wreck, and everyone knows it. 

How do you tell them you were wrong?

Currently, I’ve been seeing sleep specialists and one of which has finally been able to help me. It’s a slow process. The visits are often months apart at minimum, so I wish I was getting more proactive attention. I’m believed to have a free running circadian rhythm (explains the time zone thing), sleep apnea, and restless leg syndrome (explains sleeping too much and always feeling tired). I’m given tools to accurately measure it. There’s a chance I might have insomnia, but the doctor is telling me we should first fix the free running sleeping times before we make that conclusion. In about a month or so, I’ll have my own CPAP machine, sunlamp, and muscle relaxers. Sleep is by far my biggest impairment. It’s nice to see it finally getting proper treatment.

I’ve been dabbling around volunteer work recently. I sent some emails to organizations and a few have replied saying that they’re able to work around my sleeping patterns until they’re fixed. I’m excited. I get to go out of the house on a regular basis, meet some new people, build a resume, contribute to society, and get to know myself a LOT better. I was browsing through some descriptions of opportunities and it really made me realize I know little about myself. *Could I* cheer someone up who’s terminally ill? Can I handle that person’s death? So many questions about myself. I think getting to know myself better will help in my self-esteem and confidence. I’m definitely not ready to work yet, though. I mean, it’s 6am right now and I still haven’t slept and this is all too normal for me.

Taking so much time off from school and responsibilities has given me some much needed time for some soul searching. I feel like I’m at the beginning of a self-improvement success story. I’ve realized it’s time that I need to stop hiding behind some bipolar shield of excuses and accept that I have much more control over my life than I thought. I stopped taking medication completely mid-October. I was on my own for it because no doctor wanted the liability, so I watched myself over like a hawk. My friend which I mentioned earlier was going through the same motions. He wanted to kill himself but couldn’t do it, so he figured if he stopped taking his medications he could have the courage to do it. He stopped taking them, and a week later, he didn’t feel like shit anymore. He stopped feeling suicidal after his meds left his system. My suicide attempt parallels his. I just don’t know why I couldn’t make the correlation at the time. When I stopped taking lithium, I was pretty scared, to be honest. I didn’t know what would happen. I knew that mania will come after a med cease, and I wanted to measure how bad it would get. I’ve been on medication for years. There’s no telling how hard this would hit. The big surprise? It never did. I didn’t get horribly out of control without them. I didn’t even get a *little* out of control without them. It was one of the biggest (and most pleasant) shocks of my life. I’m still in a bad life situation, and my sleep is still an issue; so feelings like loneliness or exhaustion are still there, but they get passed through a sort of filter. I feel lonely because I spent months on okcupid and put many hours into it with just one date with a weird chick as payoff, not because my life is a big heap of loneliness and no one understands me. That’s how I think now. And you know what? I feel fine. But it’s a different kind of “fine.” It’s not the kind of fine you tell your therapist that really means, “I feel like shit, but I can deal with it.” Most importantly, I don’t feel “too fine.” My feelings and moods are appropriately matched. I’ve forgotten what it’s like to experience and react to things on a 1:1 ratio and take in things for what they are. When I’m angry, there’s a reason for it. When I’m smiling and laughing, there’s a reason for that too. I’m free from this veil that medication has put over me, and it feels pretty…nice. I do have times where my day doesn’t go too well. If I meet up with a friend of mine who just got accepted into a good graduate program, it’s kind of difficult not feeling like shit in comparison. However, this “depression cloud” which I had my entire time at college / my entire time on medication is gone. It’s hard to describe, but I can see it in the sense that I don’t have bad days where I can’t get out of bed and I don’t feel miserable when my friends and I are out having fun. I didn’t feel miserable ALL the time on medication, but there was a feeling of just “feeling crappy” I was never able to shake. I’d walk home from class and just think of how miserable my life was, but now it doesn’t happen anymore and I don’t enter these perpetual negative thinking sequences. When I’m in the shower, I think of season 2 of Dexter which I just watched or video Alex took of me at the bar instead of things like “Why does my life have to be so damn tough to live?”

Apologies in advance to people who have faith, but I was raised Roman Catholic. I was a true believer in God and Jesus and the Holy Spirit. I felt like I was talking to someone when my hands were folded and I was sitting in a dark, silent room. I made it through my communion and confirmation until one day I just questioned religion out of the blue and realized it was all just *made up*. I went to church all those times, I gave all those donations, I had the proper ceremonies, I went to CCD for years, I revolved my entire life philosophy and everything I thought and did around this faith. Then I realized I was wrong, and all of that was for nothing, just a waste of my time making my life more complicated than it should be. Realizing I’m not bipolar has brought on these EXACT feelings. It’s like finishing a chapter of my life and realizing it wasn’t part of the curriculum. 

I’ve bashed the mental health system enough for one night, but I have PLENTY more where that came from. All that was just about being diagnosed as bipolar. Now, let’s be real here. Mental illnesses are real. People are bipolar. People do have MDD. People are schizophrenic. There’s no denial of that. Aside from lack of funding for programs and care centers, I say that those with a mental illness have a pretty good chance of finding and getting help. Mental health care has plenty of faults, though. The system is set up to treat every patient (as long as they can pay for it), but there’s no real filter for saying who’s a patient and who isn’t. Either that, or some filter does exist and it’s being ignored, hence all the Adderall floating around campuses. My main point out of all of this is that psychiatric treatment is inefficient; it overdiagnosis…a lot, and there aren’t safety nets in place to sort that out.

Hopefully, someone is touched by my story and gets encouraged to start asking questions, too. But if not, I’m content with the whole thing just being food for thought. I gained a self of closure writing all this up, anyway. I’m taking a risk putting this up here. I don’t care about whether it blows my identity, but I do care about being discredited and pulled back down by the hands of anonymous internet strangers. Yeah, this is 9 pages on MS word single spaced, but it isn’t the full story. I left a lot out because I’m not going to make anyone read a novel, as long as this already is. If you want to give me advice, I’d like some on how to clear my name and make my diagnosis void. I only tried to do that once and it ended by a nurse and a doctor kicking me out of the office as soon as they heard I wasn’t there for medication (they knew nothing else about me other than what I study in school and that I have “some sleeping issues,” so it’s not like they heard any part of my story). How do I complete this process?  I feel like if any sort of symptoms are eventually taken care of and disappear then I won’t have anything to prove it. Sure, my charts were essentially just my word, but people trust doctors’ charts. How do I stack up against that with just my word to go on? I met a man in his 40s on my third trip to the ward and he told me that he had a mental illness (didn’t say) already diagnosed and when he presented divorce papers to his wife, she called the police 2 days later saying that she was afraid of him because “he’s been violent lately” and they threw the guy in there and interrupted his life (and probably made him lose his job) over a precaution. I don’t want that to happen to me.

So nothing resembling a mental illness has showed itself for months now, and my sleep issues which have been the strongest support of my diagnosis have found different reasons for existing other than bipolar disorder and treatments look promising. I know someone out there will try to discredit me by just skimming around my story and tell me I should go right back on medication and start seeing a doctor just because it’s the “safe thing to do.” I know exactly what the comment will say, too. It’s going to be a catch 22 statement, but it really just demonstrates my earlier criticisms of the diagnosis process. That sentence is one I’ve heard many times before and has stopped me from cancelling treatment to look for the answers myself. It’s a “Gotcha!” sentence. Sort of like, “What if it was your mother who was the one that…” where there’s really no way out of it, and my experience was filled hearing similar things. It’s: *“Just because you feel fine now, doesn’t mean you will continue to feel fine. Sometimes symptoms of mental illness take months or even years before they start emerging again.”*

I have been slacking, lazy and procrastinating. After seeing this sub reddit, I have decided to take action and use what is left of my vacation, and more to do what I always wanted to do.

My next 40 days, starting from 1/06/2013, I will spend atleast 30 minutes to an hour understanding finance. My goal is to be able to follow 5-10 companies and produce my own equity research, or atleast understand finance better.

This will include watching Money week videos on youtube and grasping an understanding of the balance sheet, cash flows, etc.

This includes reading books : The intelligent investor, fundamental analysis, Random Walk Down Wall Street. etc

This also includes learning about fundamental/ technical analysis

Of course, certain days I will have school or have parties. But I will try to post in this everyday with a post, up to 40, about my progress

Final step: Put it all together, create a report, and create a resume and apply for internships! "

161q95,11,2013-01-06,"23 years old, started a new ""dream"" job recently at a very small company after 1.5 years of trying. Part of me is worried that I might blow it.",joddaboy,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/161q95/23_years_old_started_a_new_dream_job_recently_at/,"I should start off by saying that one of my major insecurities is that I'm not smart enough. I'm well educated and went to a very good college, though I didn't work hard enough and earned only a 2.9 GPA. Definitely one of my biggest regrets in life, though to be honest, I don't really believe that if I was to be thrust back into college, I'd work that much harder. I do, however, work pretty damn hard for my job (I have to, because there's so much to learn since I'm new, plus lots of work). I'm super interested and passionate about lots of things: science, tech, politics, green energy. And I can talk all day about them. I'm not the most organized though I'm working on it, and I don't think I'm very creative.


Technically it's a paid internship as an energy auditor in Boston. Basically going through buildings, looking at all the HVAC systems, lighting, etc and writing a report on how they can save the building 20%+ energy. 

I've always been interested in this type of stuff, but I've never done anything nearly so technical, as the job forces me to gain a comprehensive understanding of nearly every aspect of building systems. There's just so much to learn and I've frankly never worked this hard. I find I'm pretty well able to wrap my head around things. My memory's not so great, so I sometimes need to be told things twice or perhaps I ask the same question twice over a two week period, not a huge deal I don't think but worth noting. 

Now the deal when they offered me the internship was one month part time paid, one month full time paid, and then if everything goes well, fulltime job. It's been a little over a month. We lack an office (they're looking for one pretty seriously but it could be weeks) so we work from a temporary office once a week and from home otherwise. This makes it a little tougher because things are somewhat strained due to it being harder for my bosses to manage me, but also since I can't just walk over to one of their desks and ask a question. 

I spoke to my boss yesterday, and he basically said, ""well, since we don't have an office yet, it's too hard for me to manage you and other employee John remotely so let's wait until we have an office before going fulltime internship, and then around two months from then, (and I quote) it'll turn into a fulltime position."" 
He said he wanted me to be fully trained before offering me the job. I'm worried that he's having doubts, at least enough to want to try me out for longer. Or maybe he's just sort of flakey? (I can sort of see how he might be for other reasons, but it could be in my head). He's investing a lot of time and effort training me, and the company is financially investing in me as well. (Or do they just see it as ""he does the work, if he doesn't work out, we let him go, no biggie? Other side to this argument is all the time he's putting into training me...) 

Something I've really been trying to get better about is not making little mistakes, and when I do and they ""call me out"" on them, I'm like shit they're going to turn sour on me. 

Then again, people make mistakes right? How perfect do employers expect their employees to be? Back when I interviewed, my boss said he was looking for smart people. A little voice in my head said ""Hopefully I'm smart enough"" and since then I've had my doubts when I make mistakes, and yesterday after the conversation with my boss. I'm doing my best to just power through and work as hard as I can. I know this won't accomplish anything and only satisfy me, but should I ask my boss if there's anything I could be doing better? I mean I know the mistakes I'm making and learning from them, so I'm thinking probably not and that I should just push on, work my ass off and I'll be fine.

*Thanks for bearing with my rant.*"

164l21,5,2013-01-07,I don't know how else to help or what to do next. ,[deleted],askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/164l21/i_dont_know_how_else_to_help_or_what_to_do_next/,"I apologize in advance for how long this post will be but this has been a long developing issue within my relationship, and my boyfriend and I are at a loss as to where to turn next. I suggested to him that I would take it up with the council (you guys) and see if you can come up with a solution. 

First I just want to say that in spite of this issue that we're facing, my boyfriend and I are in a very happy relationship. We're about to celebrate our four year anniversary next month. We just moved in together a couple of months ago and everything has been going so well. We love making dinner for each other, and spending more time together. Our communication has improved, and we're more in sync. Our relationship has always been long distance, He was in college and I had just graduated. We both lived with our parents who live 45 minutes apart. We just saw each other on weekends, until I moved to the south (we're from Massachusetts) for four months to complete an internship. The past couple of years I've been waiting for him to graduate, which he did last year. Now we live together but I travel for work which brings me home for only 10 days a month maximum. 

Now that everything else in our relationship has lined up and things are getting better, our bedroom issue is now front and center as this big problem that we need to overcome. My boyfriend has always been, shall I say, less enthusiastic about sex. It doesn't take much to get him off. A bj and some body rubbing usually do the trick. I guess I'm more traditional, in the sense I'd like to try the top and bottom dynamic and it takes a little more effort to get me off. We never experimented when we lived with our parents because I don't think we were comfortable trying that under our parents' roofs. Now that we live together, I'd like to try more things. But he is completely turned off by it. The mere suggestion of him topping me is a boner killer for him (can't stand the thought of him getting shit on his dick, no matter how many times I tell him that I can douche and try and minimize the problem for him). I know I can't make him be more comfortable, and I can try to forget about topping and bottoming, it's his complete lack of sex drive that worries me the most. I worry that the problem may be more medical than expected. I've wondered if he is just a little asexual, or if he is low on testosterone and therefore doesn't have the sex drive I do. 

I'll admit, it doesn't take much to get me going. But I feel like I have to coerce him every time, and I feel like I force him into it, even just doing the little things that get him off. Then I feel terrible. It gives me less confidence because I feel like I'm not attractive enough to him to get him going. And because he has a hard time satisfying me, he has no confidence in himself and he doesn't do a lot of things I tell him will satisfy me. His gag reflex is terrible, and I've never had a proper blowjob. He almost throws up every time he brushes his teeth. He says he's tried methods to improve his reflex, but they haven't been working. His lack of confidence is so bad, it's getting to the point where he doesn't want to have sex with me at all because it just makes him feel like shit. 

I love this man with all of my heart, and I know he feels the same way about me, but we're having such a hard time expressing that love physically. It's become such a frustrating subject for us and we've had multiple fights because of it. We had one big fight in October where he didn't speak to me for a week. We talked it out and put it behind us. By the time Christmas came around, I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him because I know we can work out any problems that we have. I asked him to marry me and he turned me down. He was really shaken by the last fight we had, which I understand. I then started to have my own doubts and worries about the relationship and I got really scared and upset that we aren't working as a couple. Which then led to two more fights the last two nights. We're not on bad terms but there was a lot of baggage that we've been holding on to that needed to get out in the open. We realized that any other doubts and concerns we have all boil down to our intimacy issue. 

And now here we are. Have any of you bros had experience with an issue like this? Have you dealt with a partner that lacks a sex drive? Anyone know any techniques for relaxing your gag reflex? I appreciate any feedback and comments.

**TL;DR Boyfriend has a lack of sex drive problem which has lead to a slippery slope of confidence issues for both parties. Do you have any suggestions for increasing someone's sex drive?**"

16485h,90,2013-01-07,[Operation Floodgates]  Stop The New Legislation In The House Committee On The Judiciary,Deradius,progun,https://www.reddit.com/r/progun/comments/16485h/operation_floodgates_stop_the_new_legislation_in/,"Folks, 

A large number of [gun control bills](http://onlygunsandmoney.blogspot.com/2013/01/lots-of-bills-filed-in-congress.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NoLawyers-OnlyGunsAndMoney+%28No+Lawyers+-+Only+Guns+and+Money%29) were introduced last week, all in the house of representatives, and all were referred to the [judiciary committee](http://judiciary.house.gov/about/members.html).

The incoming chair, [Bob Goodlatte](http://blogs.roanoke.com/politics/2012/12/19/goodlatte-will-be-key-player-in-gun-control-debate/), is opposed to new gun control measures.

The 2012 committee was comprised of 18 Republicans and 15 Democrats.

The upshot here is, **the house judiciary committee is our best shot at shutting most of this legislation down before it starts**.

In addition to calling your own representatives this week, here are the numbers for the members of the Judiciary committee.  As the 113th congress committee hasn't been formed yet, this list is subject to change, but generally most of them stick around from year to year.  Call as many as you can each day.  All is better than some, some is better than one, one is better than none.  Most of their officers open either at 8:30 EST or 9:00 EST.

Remember, no need to deliver a lengthy speech.  It's an intern on the other end of the line, marking tallies on a pad.  Just ring the phones and say something like, ""Please encourage the representative to say **no** to new gun control measures.  We need to shut these bills down in committee.""

If they ask for your zip code and you're not local, consider saying, ""I'm calling with respect to Representative [X]'s role on the Judiciary committee, where s/he is making decisions that affect every American.""  Then give them your zip code if you want.

Pro-gun reps need the call so they have big numbers to point to when they argue in our favor. Anti-gun reps need the call so they'll feel weak and be less likely to push the issue.

I get no karma for this post.

**EDIT**: Getting [some information](http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/266575-house-judiciary-committee-roster-to-undergo-changes) about possible committee roster changes.

**EDIT 2**:  I asked as many interns as I could if they were returning as I went through the call list.  Updated the list with the results.  For the last three (Sanchez, Waters, Watt), I was getting loopy and forgot to write down whether they're coming back, so if someone could ask and post in this thread, I'd appreciate it.

164549,4,2013-01-07,"Going to college for the first time ever, I want to prepare before I go. Also details from an earlier post which might give some context to my situation.",Williamjones4,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/164549/going_to_college_for_the_first_time_ever_i_want/,"I am 18 and not totally sure what I want to do in college. I slacked off during high-school and haven't learned anything on my own. I have been accepted to a few schools miraculously though. Some schools are mor expensive than others so I may be going to a school close by to save money, if the program is still good.

The majors I have been looking at are Advertising, Graphic Design, and Computer Science. I know they are all different but I would like to do CS the most. I have no knowledge of programming but I want to get started before I go to college. I have one year before I set out for college and would like some advice on how to prepare for what is to come if I did want to pursue a career in CS.

Should I start teaching myself, through books or the internet math? What kind of math should I teach myself before going to college. I can't even do algebra correctly. The courses require up to Calculus 2, I can't even dream of doing that. Should I start from Algebra 1 and work my way up and teach myself until I can do Calculus 1 and 2?

Should I start programming before I start CS in college? Will this help me or will I not need to program until my third of fourth year? Programming will help me land an internship easier at least, right?

If I wanted to learn programming, could I match it with other degrees that are less math-intensive if I really struggled with math and couldn't get past CS? I am going to try and take CS but for me I cannot see it being remotely easy.

Thanks, hopefully you guys can answer my questions about teaching myself and getting prepared for my future in CS. Is the math in the CS courses used in programming at all? I have seen people post saying that when they got jobs in the CS field they hardly, if at all, used math in their line of work, is this true?"
1644i2,0,2013-01-07,"6 months after graduation, I make 90k/year. Here's my journey.",[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1644i2/6_months_after_graduation_i_make_90kyear_heres_my/,"1. Immigrated to U.S. when I was 8.  Didn't speak any English.
2. In high school, had a 2.8 GPA.  
3. In college, declared electrical engineering as my major. Failed Calculus I twice.  Switched to Business MIS.
4. Had 1 internship working in IT.  Didn't like it.  Had 1 more internship working in marketing.  Loved it.
5. 3 months prior to graduating college, I started working full-time at a marketing agency.  Boss allowed me to come in work every other day so I can finish classes.  45k/year job.
6. Graduated from college in May 2012 with a 2.4 GPA.
7. Had an interview at a very promising startup for a marketing manager position.  Also had an interview for a marketing manager position at Apple.
7. In December 2012, received a job offer for a 90k/year marketing manager position at the startup.  Turned down interview the with Apple.
8. I wasn't even a marketing major.  I turned 23 in 2012.

The point of this post isn't to brag.  I just want to let you know that it's not all about grades when it comes to jobs.  There are probably tens of thousands of graduates with super high GPAs who are unemployed right now.  You need to separate yourself from the pack.

You need to know what field you want to work in, what kind of company you want to work for, how much you want to make, and go for it!  You need a plan.  You need to stick to it.  You need to work towards it.

For myself, as soon as I found out that I wanted to do marketing, I applied to marketing internships to gain experience.  Then I studied marketing on marketing websites/blogs almost every day(who needs to pay for expensive college?).  I also created personal projects for fun and to show off what I knew to employers. By the time I graduated college, I was more skilled than almost all marketing majors.

And instead of waiting to find a job after I graduate, I started working full-time at a marketing agency while I was still in college for a cheap rate because I knew companies like prospects that come from consultant roles in agencies.

My advice to you all in college:

* Know what you want to do early and understand that unless you are rich, you'll need to work in a profession that companies actually need.  So no art history major(unless you are rich). Business/Engineering/Economics majors are best if you want a job right away after college.

* If you don't have one yet, sign up for a LinkedIn account and fill out your profile.  If you don't have a lot of experience, write about what you want to do after graduation.

* Actually spend time on LinkedIn.  Add people in the profession that you want to work for as connections and look at their work experience so you know what how to get to their level eventually.  For example if you want to work as a software developer, add software engineers, VP software engineering, software architects as connections.

* Apply to internships! I would have started applying in my freshman year in college if I knew what an internship was.

* Create personal projects that you can show to employers.  For example, if you are a software engineer, create a program.  If you are a statistics major, create a model to solve a problem.  If you are an economics major, start a blog and write your thoughts on how to solve our economic issues.

163teh,3,2013-01-07,20 year old college sophomore with a question about paying off student loans early,radil,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/163teh/20_year_old_college_sophomore_with_a_question/,"I am a 20 year old college sophomore studying chemical engineering at a state university. This summer I'll be working for a major chemical company as an intern. I'll also take off of school and work two non-consecutive semesters there, totaling to about 10 months working time before I graduate. During this time I'll make between $3300 and $4000 a month depending on my classification.

I have no credit history right now, I have no credit card or prior loans that have been or are being paid for. I have a car that I purchased in cash in high school from working for 3 years. That is really my only ""valuable"" possession (beyond $1000). I currently have about $1700 saved up, and I have about $2000 in stock that was given to me at different times in my life as gifts. 

Currently I am very fortunate to have only taken out one federal student loan for this semester and the past semester. The value of the loan is $6500 at an interest rate of ~2.4% (I'm sorry, I don't know the exact value off the top of my head). My parents are also doing fairly better financially and think, but can't make any promises, that in the future I shouldn't have to take out more loans. In this regard I am very fortunate.

This summer I'll work somewhere between 2-3 months depending on when my start and end dates are and I might have to relocate, which means paying extra living expenses since I am already leasing my current apartment through the end of the summer. So I'll hopefully make between $7000-$10000.

I have thought of two scenarios to handle this money. 

**Scenario 1**

**1.** Get a credit card this summer, and use that to build my credit/get an early start to have a longer credit          history. 

**2.** Take half of the money I earn (at the very least) and invest it/save it through some sort of mechanism       (Roth IRA, CD, unfortunately I don't have access to the 401k benefits at my company as an intern) that I could     access in 5-10 years when I need to put a down payment on a car or house. 

**3.** And of the other half of the money pay my living expenses, invest in a new wardrobe, reward myself for my            work, and then whatever is left after that lump back in with #2.

**4.** After I have graduated either pay off all of my loan at once with money I have saved from my internship or     from a hypothetical signing bonus that I might receive.

**Scenario 2**

&gt; I take all or almost all of the money I earn this summer alone to pay off my student loan. 
But with this scenario I have a few questions:

* Is there even a mechanism by which I can pay off a federal student loan before I graduate?

* Which will have the greatest effect on my credit score: Paying it all off at once, before I graduate; Paying it all off at once, after I graduate, before my grace period ends; Paying it all off over time, making more than minimum payments? I understand that in the third option I'll be incurring interest charges obviously.

* If you recommend this ""early loan pay off"" scenario, where 60-90% of my income is going to go towards paying off my loan, would you recommend me not getting a credit card yet? 

Keep in mind that I'll also be working the spring semester of next year, and the fall semester following that. The summer term is 2-3 months and the semester term is 3-4 months. So sacrificing this summer's earnings is a big deal to me, but a semester later I'll be able to reenter the work force. 

**I guess my main question is this:** Which of these two scenarios do you think would benefit me more? Paying off all of my (current, hopefully only) loans and sacrificing a summer's worth of earnings, or keeping those earnings and saving them for the future and paying my loans off in a much more normal fashion?

**EDIT:** I guess I forgot to include one reason that I had been considering scenario 2. It might sound kind of paranoid, but I'm worried about the effect that the bursting of the student loan bubble would have on loan holders. I've read a little bit about it recently and it makes me nervous. I understand that comparatively, and if what my parents hope is true, with my single loan I am in a better position than other loan holders. But if handling my loan as soon as possible and then not having to worry about whether or not the possible bursting of the loan bubble will effect me is a better option than whatever the potential outcome of that may be, then I'd like to consider it."

I graduated with honors in 2010 with a B.S. in marketing, minor in economics, and I couldn't find anything in my field at the time. I took a job in information systems, and then in 2011 started a graduate program which I am about to finish when my thesis is approved. My masters is in accountancy with an information systems concentration (my thesis is in network audit trail management).

I would like to get in to systems development, but I have had little luck landing a relevant position. It seems that the popular career track for a job like that is to go to get a technical major, intern in your Jr. and Sr. years, and then work with the college career center to land a job. I may have missed that boat.

I am willing to take a paid internship to prove myself if necessary. The issue is that most companies seem to consider internships something that happens in your Jr. and Sr. years of undergrad. Am I too far out of that to have a good shot at internships? With my experience/education, should I be trying another angle to get into this field? I feel that I am somehow ""locked out"" of most of the college-to-career opportunities because I missed the boat with my school's career center.

I appreciate the help!"
163lxm,4,2013-01-06,Can't be together.... Can't be apart....,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/163lxm/cant_be_together_cant_be_apart/,"Alright. I'm in an almost LDR that has been an on going three year experience (Let me explain...). It started in a strange way and nothing had been normal about it since. In the most basic terms, here is the story. I'll elaborate on anything if someone asks:

We met while I was visiting friends in his area. I came back home and we ended up building a very close friendship while I helped him try and date one of my friends out there. While I was helping him with that, we both started to develop feelings for one another. Regardless, he began dating her and I went off to college. I went through a lot of crazy stuff in my first year of college and he and I became even closer because of it. Eventually, we both expressed our feelings for one another. However, he was still dating my friend. I even had been dating a few people during this time. Basically, we knew we could never be together. But I ended up going out to visit him and his girlfriend (my friend) anyway. It was the absolute worst time of my life. It tore me apart seeing him with her and it tore him apart knowing how upset I was. But what could we do? We were just young kids hundreds of miles apart anyway. We did not talk for awhile after my visit. We tried but his girlfriend's jealousy took over on his end and we ceased communication. Eventually they broke up and we began talking again, but it was not the same. We both still had feelings but the pain from everything that happened was hard for both of us to get over, especially me. So while he was trying to make it happen, I was starting to push him away. I was at a new college (even farther from him) and I was really happy. I was happy to have him back in my life, but I felt like I could do better slash I was very scared of getting hurt again.

This is now two years into us knowing one another. I ended up having a conversation with my best friend from home and she kind of knocked some sense into me that obviously I was being crazy and that him and I were perfect for one another. I had just been too scared of being hurt again. However, I was kind of too late. We never stopped talking through all of this, but I had kind of forced the flirt and anything past friendship between us. So in normal girl gone crazy mode, I tried to salvage all that back as quick as I could... Dummy.

This is a few months into 2012, He and I have pretty much swapped roles. Then the most ridiculous thing happens. He decides that in order for me to move on, he's going to just stop talking to me because he thinks that I did something behind his back to ruin any other chances at relationships with anyone else. Which I swear I never did anything like that. (I mean I know I'm a girl, but I'm not THAT crazy) I was devastated. He wouldn't respond to me or speak to me. It was horrible. Then the worst news was finding out that I got an internship in his area for the summer...

Before I went to the internship, him and I did actually speak a few times (got to love alcohol). I told him where I was going to be and he did try and apologize. My feelings had been so hurt though and he obviously wasn't doing MUCH to fix anything, so I just didn't let him back in at all. But oh my gosh did I miss him. Wow. I tried to date other guys, even while I was in his area, and nobody compared. Nothing made me as happy as he did. Anyway, so I went to the internship and he did text me while I was out there, but I was just not having any of that. I was out there to pursue my career and my passions and I wasn't going to let him ruin that.

I got back to school in the Fall of 2012 (junior year) after having the best summer internship anyone could ask for. I was so happy to find the perfect career path for me and even though EVERYTHING else was going so perfect in my life, I wasn't complete. It was like there was just this stupid hole in my heart that I hated so much because I didn't want to still care about him. But I did. Oh, I did.

So once again, alcohol began to help out. Eventually, one of our drunk night conversations rolled into the next day... And it hasn't stopped since. He said he was terrified to come see me while I was there just because he knew how mad at him I was. He said he had been miserable for the months we didn't speak. He said he never could understand how he could miss someone he had barely ever spent time with, but he know knew he never wanted to live without me. He knows he has a ton to prove and he even sent me flowers after a serious talk one night just to show me he was actually serious.

I know it's not enough and he knows it's not enough. I know that I can't just up and forgive him in five seconds, but now that my future is going to have me moving to his area once I graduate... it's like we finally have a future. We don't have to push each other away because we'll never be able to be together anymore. We don't have to deal with that stress. It's also nice to know that he's grown up a bit over the last few years. When we talk now, he doesn't talk about us in vague terms or if's, he says ""when we're together"". He even told me how much he hated not being able to be my boyfriend, but I don't want to just up and decide we're official over the phone.

The other thing is that I'm actually very glad I didn't spend any of my summer with him now because I now I know I went and did my internship for ME and nobody else. I do love the career path I'm on and it has nothing to do with anyone else. I believe in God and I believe that everything happens for a reason. I truly do think a huge part of my summer being so amazing is that I didn't have him around. Now I could never blame anyone, especially him, for me choosing my career. I didn't pick it because it was near him. I chose it because it was what I wanted to do.

Wow, this ended up being so much longer than I anticipated. Anyway Reddit, what do y'all think? I know I'm only an almost LDRer of 3 years, but we are planning a visit right now so I know it won't be much longer until it's the real deal. Anyway, Suggestions? Advice? Questions? Help? Anything is appreciated. If anything, thanks just for letting me get it all written out!"
163guo,2,2013-01-06,Girlfriend [21F] and I [21M] of 5 months just broke up due to her emotional issues which doomed relationship from the start... any advice please? I'm really having trouble swallowing all this...,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/163guo/girlfriend_21f_and_i_21m_of_5_months_just_broke/,"My girlfriend (now ex... it really hurts to say that) and I dated for exactly months to the day (I just now realized that, now it hurts worse).

We've known each other since we were 3 and were friends in high school. I really liked her in high school but she never gave any obvious signs so I thought I was friendzoned. We ended up going to separate colleges and lost contact but reconnected our junior years of college.

We ended up getting internships in the same city and became closer and I realized I really wanted to date her. She actually initiated the talk that would eventually lead us to getting in a relationship--one day she asked me ""How would you classify our relationship"". From there I felt like I had a ""green light"" so I began pursuing her.

She was very awkward and slow about it at first. She then opened up to me and told me about her abusive father who died when she was 13, that she usually dates abusive assholes because of it, that she was seeing a therapist in order to help herself heal emotional, and she was taking medication for anxiety from all of it.

I really liked her and cared about her though so I didn't bother worrying about any of that and we started dating. When we went back to school it became long distance and after a while it felt like I was doing all the work. She never visited me; she hardly called me; I was doing all the visiting and calling.

She was also very physically distant. As in when I would kiss her it would feel like she wasn't kissing me, and we never even had sex. Most relationships I would have been out the door a long time ago because of this but she was really special to me so I thought it was just her wanting to take it slow due to her ""trust issues"".

Well she had been blowing me off and ignoring me this past week so I confronted her about it. Basically it came down to her emotional issues. I asked her about the physical distance and she basically said she never felt anything when we kissed and she never had the sexual desire for me. I asked her why she even wanted to date me then (since she basically initiated the transition from friends to relationship) and she said that she ""wanted to want me"" and that I was the ""perfect guy for her"" but because I had known her before and because she had a fear of intimacy (or so her therapist said) she never felt any physical desire for me. But she said she really wanted it to work out though.

I asked her how she dealt with previous relationships and she said she was the one who ended her LTR with her high school boyfriend for the same reason that it didn't work out for me. And her college boyfriend before me was apparently very emotional abusive and dumped her because as he put it, he ""just wanted to fuck dumb bitches, but she wasn't a dumb bitch"".

So we basically decided it wasn't going to work out. She said ""I know the 'it's not you, it's me' speech is a common excuse, but this time it really is me."" I don't know. I just feel completely rejected. Because I love this girl, and although she said she ""loves me as a friend"" she doesn't see me in ""that way"". I have a difficult time understanding that so I asked if she just thought I was unattractive or something and she said it wasn't that, it was just that she couldn't see me in that way.

I don't know. This hurt me a lot. Also especially because the physical part. It really hurts knowing that we didn't sleep together or do anything more than kiss, but she's had a bunch of sex with these abusive guys. It really brings up feelings of jealousy and I don't know, hurt.

Any advice? How do I get over her? She said she really wanted to be friends (of course, they always do) but I don't know how I can do that even if I really want to. And what does all this emotional stuff even mean? I honestly felt rejected when she talked about the whole ""it's not you it's me"" thing, so was it really her? Can anyone help explain all this? Any help through this would be great. I'm a wreck right now. Thanks.

**TL;DR Broke up with my long distance girlfriend (who used to be one of my closest friends) due to ""emotional issues"" that prevented her from seeing me as a sexual partner. Can anyone help explain these emotional issues and help me sort this out please? Thanks**"

Thank you in advance!

My motivation to earn a graduate degree in psychology stems from my passion for psychological and brain sciences, my desire to become an experimental psychologist and university professor, and the necessity to learn as much as I can in my chosen field. Through thorough academic preparation and several years of experience in neuropsychological research, I have transformed into the ideal candidate for the Master's of Awesome Science at the University of Equally Awesome Science.

I sought out my first experience in psychological research during my second year of college: a position as a research assistant in a child development lab. My main responsibility was to learn a complex coding scheme and use it to correct discrepancies between codes in previously coded narrative transcripts of maternal word choice in picture book reading. Through my involvement in this project, I gained experience with the post-experimental aspects of behavioral psychology. I continued to work on this project throughout my undergraduate career, and I am currently in the process of helping to train incoming research assistants, as well as beginning some preliminary statistical and data analysis.

In addition to my experience with research in behavioral science, I had a strong interest in neuroscience methodology, and sought an internship in an event-related potential (ERP) lab. Initially, my responsibilities were to run adult participants in ERP studies, which involved attaching scalp and eye electrodes, explaining event-related potentials to participants, and troubleshooting if participants had any questions or if programs went awry. During the summer of 2012, I accepted a research assistant position in the Undergraduate College ERP Lab, which not only afforded me the freedom and funds to pursue my own research interests, but also gave me valuable experience running child ERP participants. I left my summer placement confident in my ability to program studies in E-Prime 2.0, to recruit and schedule participants, efficiently execute data entry, and to explain neuroscience to children in ways that are both engaging and exciting to those with no prior interest in science. 

My positions in research for the last 3 years, as well as my experience designing and carrying out my own undergraduate research thesis have given me a thorough understanding of some of the frustrations psychological research can present. I have worked on projects tirelessly for months, only to find that researchers in Finland have been working just as hard on the exact same project, and have published their findings just as I begin data analysis. I have programmed and piloted a series of studies, only to realize after recruiting and running many participants that adding additional trigger numbers to stimuli could have yielded even more interesting research. These speed bumps have only made my passion for science stronger, and although there are numerous challenges in the process of psychological discovery, the rewards yielded by the findings of a study, whether they are expected or unexpected, make the frustrations along the way totally worth it.

My personal research interests stem from a fascination with human emotion, interpersonal interaction, and how we use our own experiences to relate to others. My undergraduate thesis, a novel ERP study on the role of mood congruency in the implicit processing of emotional faces, was my first real foray into the field of empathy research. My study yielded significant findings that present potential new challenges to the field of affective empathy research: since mood congruency is important in our processing of emotional facial expressions, the validity of some previous research on the empathetic response (that has not considered mood congruency as a variable) may come into question. Should I be granted admission to the Master's of Awesome Science Program, I would hope to continue this research on emotion and empathy at the University of Equally Awesome Science, using the same or a similar paradigm to more closely examine the role of the cross-race effect in mood congruency and implicit emotion processing, as well as to correlate the ERP amplitude responses to mood-congruent faces with participants with both high- and low-trait empathy. 

Master's of Awesome Sci at U of Eq. Awe. Sci. is the ideal place for me to begin my graduate studies in Psychology. The individualized structure of the program is one in which I have experience, and one in which I thrive. My undergraduate program allowed me to design my own major and academic concentration, excel in graduate level courses, gain unprecedented research experience, and carry out every aspect of original psychology and neuroscience studies, from the discovery of an idea to the programming of stimuli, to running participants, to data collection and analysis. Although I do not necessarily expect this amount of freedom at the Master’s level, my undergraduate experience has given me the discipline, responsibility, and tools to successfully navigate my own education. Additionally, your program will give me the opportunity to learn from those whom I consider “science rock stars,” whose research I have admired for years.  

My education in brain science will not end at the Master’s level. I aspire to earn a PhD in psychology with a concentration in integrative or social neuroscience, and conduct empathy and emotion research in academia, as well as teach at the university level. My life’s ambition is to research the neural bases and psychological manifestations of affective empathy, and discover novel ways to facilitate these neural processes so humans can best allocate our resources to understand and empathize with each other.

1636v8,2,2013-01-06,I'm almost at the edge and I don't know how much more I can take.,DrummingViking,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1636v8/im_almost_at_the_edge_and_i_dont_know_how_much/,"So I guess I'll start from the beginning. (warning this is long)

In 2010 I had to call the ambulance because my mom was having really bad abdominal/stomach pain. They rushed her to hospital, turns out her intestine had ripped open. There was an emergency surgery and they had to remove her large intestines and she was given a colostomy bag. Well she eventually came home from the hospital and my world was turned upside down. She had trouble doing many things but it wasn't so bad.

Fast-forward to 2011 they put her intestines back inside her and things were going to be better. They weren't. Her stomach wouldn't heal correctly. She went in for a check up at the free clinic like she did every other week (her doctor said he'd check on her there). He asked a intern to take her to a sterile room and undo the incision half an inch so he can get a camera and look inside. The itnern takes my mom to a room where someone just lefts and he completely opened her up. The doctor came in, asked intern to leave and he went out and yelled at him and the doctor re sewed up her stomach and we left.

The next week or so my mom started feeling ill, fever and her stomach was a little swollen. We go to get her looked at and she now has MRSA. Having MRSA and other complications her stomach wouldn't heal. 

Fastforward to 2012 they had put in mesh in to help heal her stomach. It wasn't working. Turns out they used the trans vaginal mesh that had been recalled inside her and her body was trying to push the mesh out. They would not remove the mesh. But she had another surgery that was supposed to fix everything but it didn't the wound again would not heal. My mom is also overweight and the pull of her stomach didn't make this easier but after the surgery she had a 13in hole in her stomach that wouldn't heal. I mean a hole that I could put my hand in and could reach inside her. She was completely useless now. I hate saying it but she was. She could not get out of bed. 

She came home and everything hit me even harder. I was still in highschool but always having to worry about my mom and having to take care of her took everything out of me. I couldn't keep up friendships, I had a girlfriend but I started to drift away from her, I felt alone...I still do. Nobody understands what I have to do everyday.

So I started college. I did my best first semster but I was also moving me and my mom to my dads old house. My grades were reall bad. Now we are into my dads old house and we've been here for 3ish months. He bought a new house and he needed someone to stay at this house to take care of it so that's why we moved in. My dad has had a gf for a few months and she hates us. After my dad ASKED us to move into this house that HE PLANNED TO GIVE TO ME he suddenly now wants to sell it and has asked us to move out. What are we supposed to do? My mom gets disability checks but it's not a lot. We only get 1,100 a month. Add food,gas, and bills we have nothing left. 

So now I have to find and apartment for me and my mom to move into. Something that costs under $550 and is big enough for me and my mom. Now I know people have it much worse than me but I'm tired of being ignored. Nobody acts like it's a big deal. I don't complain about it at all. I try my best to look on the bright side and think things will get better but they don't. My gf left me, I can't get a job anywhere, I have to find an apartment AND move all of me and my moms stuff, I gotta go to college ontop of all that and take care of my mom everyday.

She tries her best to help but she only messes things up. I don't complain because I have nobody to talk too. I don't have friends, no girlfriend, nobody and I hate it, I hate myself. I'm so socially awkward to everyone. I'm stressed. I just don't how much more I can take. I'm ready to just shut down and put a bullet in my head. I don't want to live like this anymore.

**TL;DR** I'm pushed to my limits and I'm ready to kill myself.

**EDIT**: There's more that I could add here but I left quiet a bit out for lengths sake."

Anyways, I am currently an intern at a specialty truck manufacturer and had been given a task.  It is essentially data clean up.  I was given an excel file that contained records that failed a process (missing information in records).

I was told to bring up each record using queries and check the record to see part of the data was missing and if it was I would look at the excel sheet and put in the appropriate information in the appropriate field and update the record.  I had hundreds of records and had to do it manually.

My first thought immediately was to create a python script that would grab the key from the excel file and select the record from the database.  Check if a field in the returned query was missing information and then if it was I would go to the excel file and grab the appropriate input for that record and update the record using a sql statement and then move on.  Bonus points would being able to format the row in excel with a certain color as in if it had been changed or some other condition.

So my question is can anyone point me in the right direction on how I can achieve this?  I am not sure how to look up something like this.

Thank you."

Started smoking daily during my first year of college (2011-2012), quit for 3.5 months over the summer (2012), and thought I had a handle on my problem when I went back to school in the fall. First i'd just smoke with friends, then bought myself a gram when i got stressed. At the end of the semester I was so wrecked that I bought an eighth and smoked a bowl every night after my work was done during finals/exams week. Then I got dependent on weed for sleeping so while visiting my mom in Texas for Christmas, my sister (who is a proud Californian stoner) and I ate a square of weed chocolate each night before bed (made me feel shitty and hungover the next day, ugh). Got home, spent 3 days sober, then one of my BFF's from high school and I reunited and decided to smoke a jay together in the snowy woods under the stars. On New Year's Eve dad offered me some weed chocolate my sister sent him. I stopped again for about 4 or 5 days, but then I started taking from my dad's stash for 3 days straight, until today. The days I wasn't using weed or busy with friends, I was taking xanax from my dad.

I see myself participating in this cycle of addiction--rationalizing, justifying, etc. (I'm home and bored, I got an amazing internship for the summer, I worked my ass off this semester so I deserve it, etc.) I guess i feel like because I went to a restictive/therapeutic boarding school for cutting myself to cope and family issues driving me away from home, I didn't get much of a childhood. Now I'm at a prestigious women's college at which the mentality is very much work-hard-play-hard. It's hard for me to be a part of this culture when there is an honest adult inside of me saying I shouldn't be smoking weed. I want to be able to ""be a kid"" but also be my adult self, because my adult self is the best version of myself (my therapist is always saying this and it's true IMO). Especially since my grades were NOT what I wanted them to be. I expected three A's and a B-/C+. Ended up with an A-, two B+'s and a C+. I wanted straight A's of course. My GPA didn't even break through the 3.0's!!!! I wanted to get into a conference at Harvard for which I really thought I was a shoe-in, but I was rejected. 

This summer, when I had quit weed, I was exercising 5 days a week. At school, my stress was insane with all of my extra curricular activities, internship and academics, and breaking up with my boyfriend (but still talking to him, calling him when I'm anxious or depressed, generally depending on him) yet I wasn't dealing with the stress in a healthy way. I stopped exercising, started using the weekends--when everyone is partying--as my release. Drinking too much too early, getting high. I even relapsed (cutting) twice this semester. The weed use also led to my use of other unhealthy coping skills I love to indulge in--isolating myself and binge eating junk. Through it all I'd get angry with myself and call the recent ex-boyfriend crying.

I really believe that if I channel my stress in healthy ways before turning to the unhealthy mechanisms that are much easier--weed, food, partying, cutting, isolating, dependence upon others, whatever--then I will feel better and can really begin achieving my dreams and fulfilling my life. it's now just a matter of getting myself there.

I've been thinking for a few years about getting on a low dose of a long acting anti-anxiety medication. Prescribed, medically, to me and not my dad. Prescribed by a doctor who knows what they're talking about, not decided by my own anxious mind. I'm hoping that might give me the push I need to get to the point where I can push through my anxiety and SUSTAIN healthy coping skills, not have quick runs with them before falling back into an addiction to self-medication and unhealthy means of dealing with my anxiety.

Anyway I'd love some support, advice, feedback, reddit hugs, anything. I know my biggest battles while quitting/withdrawing will be: sleeping, mood, maintaining a healthy lifestyle while at college.

The problem is that I took my data structures course at a different University, where the curriculum was extremely lacking.  We didn't even touch sorting or searching algorithms, Big O, or anything along those lines.  I do have some basic experience with these concepts from previous courses, but it's just that-basic.  When I get asked more in-depth questions on these topics during my interviews, I feel like this is something every programmer should know, so ""I didn't learn that"" seems like a very poor excuse for my lack of knowledge.  I am doing some research and trying to teach it to myself, but the interviews are soon enough that I don't have time to learn it all.

So, how should I address this in the interviews?  Do I attempt an answer and if I get it wrong then I just move on? Do I mention that my course was a bit lacking, but I'm doing independent study to fill in the gaps in my knowledge?  Any advice would be appreciated.

I've wanted to move to Europe since I started high school and got into languages. I speak English natively, Dutch and Spanish comfortably (B2/C1), and German at a level that could use improvement (A2).

Specifically, I'm looking at Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany or Austria. France would be nice too, but I don't speak French.

I have been working with Java and Python in back-end web development (in which I had a paid internship at a small company most people don't know of), and am interested in AI/computational linguistics/collective intelligence. I also have interest in data analysis for optimizations, marketing/product research, etc. and math skills related to that.

Is it possible to get a decent [entry-level] position with only internships as prior work experience?

A little background first. I am a college graduate with a Bachelor's of Science in Homeland Security, with a ""Cyber Security"" track. (Yes, I know ""Cyber"" is a buzz word but that's what it says on the piece of paper. Upper management tends to fawn at it. Go figure.) I went to a medium sized telecom company as a Security Administrator Intern to get my last six internship credits, and stayed there for as long as they could manage to retain me. Once that job ended, I moved to a new company as an IT Operations Technician.

I've been handed a job offer by my old company that I went to for that internship. They want me to be an IT Security Analyst I, working full time. This seems like a great opportunity. Compared to my current job, I'd be getting comparable benefits, a slight pay raise due to the shortened commute and lack of taxes (getting a job in a tax free state rocks). The only thing I'm losing is my current company's PC Reimbursement program and a week of vacation per year. And yes, IT Security is what I want to do for a living.

But the problem is I feel a loyalty to my current company, almost to the point that it's making me debate turning down this new job offer. Have you guys ever run into this before? My current company's never done wrong by me. It's a great environment with great co-workers and a great boss... It's just an extremely long commute, and not the field I want to be in for the rest of my life.

I guess what I'm saying is, what are your thoughts? Do you, /r/computertechs, think it's worth it to move, despite the unexplained loyalty? Thanks for taking the time to read this.

I could really use some advice. I graduated from college with a computer science degree last summer. It was pretty challenging for me but in the end I managed to creep my way up to a 3.0 GPA / 3.3 Major GPA. I didn't get an internship though, which was my first big mistake. 

After graduating and moving back home (near Los Angeles), I wasn't really sure what to do, and it took me a while to get the hang of fixing up my resume, applying to jobs, doing interviews and whatnot. The real problem is that up until about a month ago, I barely did any programming at all, so I got pretty rusty. I'm not sure why, but without the structured environment of school, I got really lazy and time flew by at an unbelievably quick pace.

So right now I find myself jobless, with a resume that has a suspicious 6 month gap. Even the last school project on there is from 2011. I've had only a handful of interviews over the phone, and one in person. The most recent one asked me about what I've been doing since graduating, so I can sense that the gap is becoming an issue. 

I know I've made alot of mistakes so far, due to both ignorance and laziness, but now I'm really starting to feel that I missed the window of opportunity, and I want to get things back on track. Do I keep applying to jobs hoping that I get lucky? Do I just focus on programming, maybe doing a few projects that I can add to my resume? Do I get a job in something unrelated for the time being? Look for an internship? All of the above? Something else? I want to get out of this ever-worsening situation but I don't want to make any more mistakes due to ignorance. What do you guys think the best course of action is right now?

Here is what I learned:

1. It's all about who you know - and I knew no one, like, I had no connections - it sucks!. _just find a way around HR_, it is easy to figure out the corporate emails of employees, email the manager or leader in that area and say you are interested. Whats the worst that could happen? You do not even have to use your full name, so you can still apply traditionally. For example, 8/10 times Dexter Morgan's company email at Microsoft is just dmorgan@microsoft,com or dexter.morgan@microsoft,com

2. It's all about timing - I was denied a job at this place originally and then the interviewer called me up 5 weeks later to say he remembered me and there was an opp for me. This is out of your control, you can just hope you are lucky?

I, just like you, applied to those job boards and heard nothing back. I just imagined what it must have been like to be the HR person on the other side of the screen who got to feel better and better about themselves everyday by looking at all the schmucks trying to get where they work. So, I went around them. Kind of. The best advice I can give, which can only apply to some of you, is work with recruiters/contract work. These are people that are given special privilege to opportunities and have connections to people at a lot of different companies. Call them, say you are interested in X type of work and see if you think there may be an opportunity. They will ask for your resume and it continues from there. The goal is not for a cushy job right away, but somewhere where you can at least have a chance to prove your worth and progress from there. Some contracts are truly contract work, some are like professional internships - jobs that need to be filled but companies quickly and cheaply fill them with potential incumbents and get to try them out. Similar to the probationary stage of full time jobs but without the benefits.

Prior to graduating I had a few internships and studied abroad. Econ degree. This didn't seem to factor into the qualifications; my personality, analytical background of econ, and some Excel experience are what sold it, I believe.

I may be back on here in a few months if the contract is up and no opportunities show themselves during that time, but I will do my darndest to earn my spot there!"

John and I were working on the case in my office. It was weird not having Anna around. I was so desperately hoping that my suspicions were wrong, that she wasn’t dead, just hiding until the case was over or was taking a break. The office was cold, so cold we could see our breath. Neither of us really knew what to do about the whole Stitch thing.

We looked through the pictures, read the journals, and watched the tapes, God knows how many times. We would watch the tapes in slow-motion looking for any little clues that might tell us where to find him. But we couldn’t find anything. First, we were thinking he must be hiding somewhere outdoors. He always seemed sort of dirty and disheveled, like he didn’t have access to a shower and was always running around barefoot. But then we wondered, if he’s an outdoorsman, why is he naked? Doesn’t he get cold? Then we played around with the idea that he lived in a cave somewhere. Which would make sense – he’d have some warmth so he could wander around naked all he wanted. But it still didn’t quite work in our heads. Since when do supernatural creatures and serial killers not have homes and established lives outside of their murder sprees? Vampires, you think live in castles, mansions, and whatnot. Werewolves are only like that once a month, so they obviously have stuff to do the rest of the time, and have a house. Even zombies sort of have a home – their coffins until they rise from the dead. What would make Stitch want to be the outcast and not have a house and established life?

Nothing was making sense to us. Our heads hurt. Our coffee was running out. The sun was going down. The work week was coming to an end. Our options were running out. Thankfully no one else had been killed. But surely, it would happen again soon. Stitch wasn’t one to sit and do nothing for extended periods of time.

“What do you want to do?” I asked John as I stretched out my back. Before he could answer, the door to my office slammed open and an FBI team walked in.
“We need you two to come in for questioning,” the only one in a suit said. The rest of them were wearing the typical FBI uniforms, with their guns and everything. John and I were confused. What could we have done to catch the FBIs attention? We complied and went with the team willingly. We all walked out of the office quietly. My coworkers watched, just as confused as we were. Their eyes were all wide. Some of the mouthed words at me, asking what was going on. I just shrugged. I really had no idea. They shoved us into the back of a car and drove us to where they wanted to question us. 

We arrived at the jail in Downtown Seattle. It was a tan building with small windows with bars over them, so the prisoners couldn’t escape. I was scared. I looked over at John. He was squeezing his hands together; I could see they were sweaty. He had wide eyes, like he was a child caught stealing candy. My palms were sweaty too. I’m sure my eyes were just as wide. 

We were let out of the car. Two men grabbed both of my arms and pulled me into the building. I didn’t know what we’d done to deserve such harsh treatment. They didn’t give us time to look around the building, but I didn’t really mind. I’d been there countless times. I was just confused by why we were being brought there for questioning.

John and I were put into separate rooms. Each room had white walls, a white tile floor, a white ceiling, and a white light. There was a metal table in the middle of the room with chairs all around it. I was told to sit down and wait. So I did as I was told, in an attempt to stop the brutal treatment. The walls were entirely bare of everything, even texture. As I waited, I tried to find something to fix my eyes on. But I was so nervous I could hardly sit still. I tapped my feet and drummed my fingers and chewed my nails. What could I have possibly done? I’m just a detective! I’m the one who’s supposed to be solving the cases, not be a suspect or anything. Interrupting my thoughts, a man in a gray suit walks in with a file. He sits down across the table from me and just looks at me for what felt like an eternity.

“You’re probably wondering why we brought you and your intern in here,” he said. His voice was deep and scratchy. He had a bird’s nest type of hair, mostly white with shades of gray. His eyes were tired and old, like they’d seen everything to be seen. I nodded at him, unsure if I was allowed to speak.
“What do you know about…” He looks at his papers. “Repetitive Routine… What do you know about his death?”
“I know what happened on the tapes,” I said. “I have them back in my office if you want to see them.”
“We know what happened in the tapes,” the man said. “What do you know? Is there anything we should know that can’t be learned through the tapes?”
“What do you mean?” I asked. The bright light was making my headache worse.
“What did you have to do with it?”
“Nothing!” I said, shocked. “I didn’t kill him, if that’s what you’re asking. He offered to help us find Stitch and that’s what ended up happening. Stitch came and killed him. We didn’t think that would happen, but it did. And from that side of the webcam you can’t really do anything.” My speech got faster and faster as I kept talking. Was I really a suspect in his death? In my own investigation?
“Okay,” the man said. “Calm down. We’re just investigating his death.” That made me fume. That was my case. I didn’t work so hard to become the best detective in the Seattle PD just to have my case taken from me. Even if it was impossible to solve…

“You’re free to go,” the man said. “We’ll be in touch with any further information on his death.” I nodded at him and walked into the hall. As I waited in the hallway for John to come out from his interrogation, an idea crossed my mind. An illegal one, mind you, but an idea nonetheless. And despite its illegality, I decided to pursue it. I jogged down the hall to the man who’d questioned me and asked him where the nearest bathroom was. He pointed and said down the hall and around the corner. So I walked down the plain hallway and stood just around the corner, near the restroom. I peaked around to see the man go into a room with the folder, and come out without it. When the coast was clear, I snuck into the room, quietly so no one could hear. The room was dark and dank with file folders covering all the walls. The files were organized in alphabetical order so I found the J drawer and searched for my file. At last I found it. Johnson, Ryan. I opened it and found a small notebook. Flipping through it, the pages were covered in notes. I smiled to myself. Suddenly I head the door opened so I stuffed the notebook into my pocket and closed the drawer quickly and silently. A woman with sharp features and a stern expression walked in.

“What are you doing in here?” she asked.
“I was looking for the bathroom,” I said.
“Wrong room. It’s down the hall and around the corner,” she said.
“Okay, thank you,” I said. I walked out of the room and found John waiting at the end of the hall by the rooms we’d been questioned in. 

I swiftly walked to him and gestured for him to follow me quickly. We stepped out of the building into the crisp Seattle air. I kept walking until we were a good distance away from the building. Then I pulled the journal out of my pocket and showed it to John. He looked at me with concern.
“Did you steal that?” he asked. I nodded but didn’t care that he was worried. We were already in trouble. I flipped to the first page. It talked about how we were suspects in Repetitive Routine’s murder.
John Freeman and Ryan Johnson – present at time of crime, could have orchestrated it in ploy to solve serial killer case, follow after questioning.

That made both of us nervous. We looked around as soon as we read that, looking for suspicious cars. Cars of different colors and models whizzed around us, but nothing was standing still watching us. We felt small rain drops start to hit our heads and neck so we started walking and fast as we could to the office. The rain started to really pour and get us soaking wet before we reached our cars.

“I was thinking…we should go up to Anna’s parents house. She might be staying with them,” I told John.
“Let’s go now,” he said. “Why not? The sooner we find her the sooner we can let our minds ease.” I agreed with him and we both piled into my car. It was getting dark as I pulled out into traffic and eventually onto the freeway. The clouds were ominous. They were a dark gray. The rain was pounding on my car. John and I were silent the whole time. Neither of us knew what to say. We didn’t know what we were going to find. But both of us were praying to whatever God was out there, that we’d find Anna alive. A couple hours went by. The weather kept getting worse and the sun kept going further down until it was pitch black outside. That’s when I felt a bump and then it got really hard to drive all of a sudden. I pulled over to the side of the road and jumped out of my car. The front left tire was completely flat.

“Great!” I nearly screamed. “Just awesome.” John got out of the car and looked at the wheel. I ran my hand through my messy hair and sighed. It was already getting late and I didn’t want to deal with this. Especially given the situation. What if Stitch found us? I shoved those thoughts aside and tried to focus on fixing the wheel. I opened my trunk and found my spare wheel. But only a spare wheel. All my tools to fix it were gone. Nowhere to be found. How was I supposed to fix my stupid tire without tools? I nearly screamed again. I shut my trunk and leaned against the driver’s side door and waited for someone to drive by and help.

“You okay?” John asked after a while. We were both standing the pouring rain, in the dark, in the middle of nowhere. Neither of us were happy. Our suits were soaked; our hair looked like we’d just taken a shower; it was late; we were tired and stressed out. Things just weren’t looking good for us.
“What do you think?” I said. I wasn’t trying to sound rude, but I guess that was the vibe I put out because John scooted away from me a little bit and didn’t say anything else for a while. We waited in the rain for half an hour before a car finally stopped to help us. A man and a young woman got out of the car. The lady had long brown hair in a braid down her back and hippie like clothing. She had a kind face and walked towards us with welcoming arms.

“What happened?” she asked, sounding genuinely concerned.
“Flat tire,” John said. He sounded in a better mood than I was. Even if he had been acting strange lately, he was still more chipper than me. “We can’t find Ryan’s tools.”
“Oh, that’s terrible!” the woman said. “We have tools. Go help them change their tire, Josh!” The man she was with was tall and extremely muscular, to the point that it was kind of weird. He wore a plain white t-shirt and jeans. He didn’t seem like he would be dating the woman he was with – if they were dating, that is. He nodded in her direction and went to the trunk of their black car. Shortly thereafter he came back with the necessary tools and helped us change my tire. In just a few minutes we were ready to go.

“Thank you so much,” I said. “This really means a lot.”
“Oh, no problem at all,” the woman said, grinning. “Just one question though. What’s with the car with the two scary looking men in it back there? They’ve just been sitting there the whole time.” John and I looked back at the car and then back at each other. Neither of us had noticed it until she pointed it out. It was sleek and black, nearly unnoticeable in the dark from that distance. I thought on my feet.
“Oh, that’s the FBI. We’re detectives working on a case with them. It’s nothing to worry about.” It was something to worry about…
“Interesting!” the woman said. The man stood beside her silently the whole time they’d helped us. “Well good luck with your case!”
“Thank you. And again, thank you so much for the help.” I smiled at her and John and I got back into my car, thoroughly soaking wet.

“What should we do about them?” John said, pointing at the FBI car trailing us.
“Just let them do whatever. There’s nothing for us to hide; we didn’t do what they think we did,” I said. I started up the car and kept driving. John and I were silent the whole ride to Bellingham. The car kept trailing us all the way to Anna’s parent’s house. We tried acting like we didn’t see them. We tried to act as natural as we could. It was hard, but we did as good a job as possible.

Soon we pulled up to Anna’s parent’s house. It was a small little house just outside the city. They owned a little ranch with three horses. They were neighing in the barn a little ways from the house. They sounded panicked, but I didn’t know anything about horses, so for all I knew, that was what they sounded like all the time. John and I walked up to the front door of their shabby little house. Anna’s car was sitting outside. It had frost on the windows and what looked like fresh mud on the tires. Maybe she had just come back.

The paint on the house was peeling and the grass was unkempt. The stairs creaked as we walked up them onto the porch. I knocked on the door, but as I knocked it just opened. I pushed it further open and John and I walked in skeptically. The air was freezing cold and bugs were crawling on the ground. The first room we came to was the living room. The furniture had that typical old-lady pattern of canvas flowers. The furniture was covered in those plastic covers. The window next to the television was broken. Glass was all over the ground. The television was on. A news broadcaster’s voice rang through the silent house. It was eerie.

The floor creaked beneath our feet as we kept walking slowly through the house. We got to the kitchen. The fridge was open and the sink was running. Food was sitting on the counter like someone was about to prepare a meal. The food was rotting and there was a slight stench in the air. It was starting to get various colored mold on it. Flies buzzed around the plate, loving the stench of the disgusting food. John walked over to look at it. He winced a little.

“One of those flies just bit me,” he said. He poked at the food and a bunch of fruit flies jumped off the food on the table. We couldn’t tell what the food even was. The table was set and one of the chairs was pulled out from the table like someone was sitting there watching the other person cook. I started to see specks of blood on the floor as we kept walking. We followed the blood drops until they turned into trails of blood. Some places it was hard to make out on the brown carpet.

The trail led into a room that appeared to be an office, but also kept going down the hall.
We decided to go room by room and started in the office. It had a computer, printer and a desk with some cabinets. The blood trail went right past everything and up the wall. It stopped halfway to the ceiling. John told me to come over to where he was. I walked around the desk on the side where the chair was. The chair was covered in blood and so were the keyboard and the top of the desk. Some of the keys were missing from the keyboard, the monitor was completely broken and the mouse was hanging down, covered in blood. The damage and destruction of the desk area was not the most disturbing part. The worst part was, all over the keyboard. We found teeth. Like someone had gotten their face slammed into it repeatedly and their teeth had fallen out. They were white with yellowing at the top of them where they’d fallen out. The monitor still had glass around the frame. It was covered in blood and on one long shard of glass, there was an eye ball. It was brown and still had the veins attached to it. There was also some hair caught on glass on the side of the monitor. It was long, white, and sort of crinkly. 

At least I knew it wasn't Anna’s. I went to pull the chair out from the desk, and as I did, I heard a loud thump. I look down and there was a hand coming out from under the desk. John and I crouched down to have a better look. It was Anna’s mom.

She was curled up under the desk, her knees against her chest, sitting up. Her left eye was out of its socket, some teeth were missing as well and there were a few holes in her scalp where hair and skin should be. We could see the white bone of her cracked skull. Her right eye was still in its socket. It was swollen and black with bits of blood trickling down her pale white cheek. Her nose was severely broken. You could see the cracked bone beneath the crusted blood.  We decided not to touch the body continued down the hall way.

The blood trail was on the ground for a good five to six feet then it swerved to the left and went up the wall. We followed it on the wall until it came to a door. This door was locked and after several attempts to break it in with our shoulders, John kicked it in. It was Anna’s dad’s personal room - bachelor pad, if you will. It had a flat screen, computer, fish tank, various mounted animal heads, a gun cabinet and a cigar humidor. We didn't stay long in that room.

The first thing we saw was her dad’s body. He was ripped in half and replaced on the wall with his mounted bear head. His lower body was still standing up, right below him on the ground. On the wooden plaque, where it read the name, size and weight of the bear, someone had carved over it. It said ""Collateral"" and below that it said ""You can't run"". Maybe this will get those damn FBI agents to finally believe Stitch is real. Maybe this will get them off my back.

John and I went outside to find the FBI agents. They weren’t in their car so we assumed they were following us around the house. We turned to go back into the house and look for them and saw them coming towards us. Their guns were drawn but they weren’t pointing them at us.
“Do you believe us that Stitch is behind all this now?” I asked. “Do you believe we didn’t kill Repetitive Routine?”
“We don’t know what to think,” one man said. He scratched his head and rubbed his chin. “Maybe we should call the local authorities. They might have some insight on this couple. Maybe someone was out to get them. We’ll also call in more field agents. This might be beyond your control now, if what you’re telling me is true.”
“Didn’t you see what was written on the plaque? It was Stitch!” John said, getting flustered.
“Show us,” the second man said. We walked back into the house and tried not to look at the gore too much. We got Anna’s dad’s room and showed them the plaque. They looked at the words carefully.
“Collateral, huh?” the first man said. “Collateral for what?”
“We’re thinking he has my partner, Anna. She’s been missing for a little while now. We don’t know where she is,” I said.
“We definitely need to call the locals. We need all the help we can get.” The second man pulled out his phone and dialed 911. He told the operator about him being an FBI agent and needing back up. He asked for the address, I gave it to him, and we waited for the police to arrive.

“Maybe we should go check on the horses,” John said. “We don’t know how long these people have been dead. They might be needing food and whatnot.” We all agreed and walked back out into the cold. It might have been dark and freezing cold out, but it was a nice change to the disgusting sights inside the house. I loved the open field that lay between the house and the neighboring house. Although, it did remind me of the dream I had a couple days ago. 

As we walked further into the field, my heart began to beat faster. I found myself staring into the woods that surrounded the property. I can still hear that loud groaning sound from my dream. I know it was just a dream, but it still makes me nervous. We walked towards the barn quietly. Part of the thought maybe Stitch was waiting for me. The barn was like a typical horse barn. Red outside and stalls inside with open windows so the horses could get fresh air when they were inside. We opened the door. It squeaked loudly.

You could smell the stench of decay from 20 feet away from the barn. I doubt I was the only person who noticed it. All of the straw and hay on the ground of the barn was damp and stuck to the bottom of our shoes. It felt...gross...beneath my feet. I almost slipped a couple of times. The horses were in the back of the barn in the last three stalls. As we got closer, we noticed only 2 of them were alive and they were just skin and bone. You should see every bone in their body and their neighs sounded like they were in pain and scared and they could barely stand. Their legs were close to collapsing underneath them. As I checked them out, I noticed they had rope around their necks. Why would they have ropes around their necks?

When we found the horses, three more police men showed up.

“We were the closest officers to your location. We checked out the house and we called for more back up though,” one of the officers said, almost out of breathe.

“Oh my god... what is that smell?” another said. He put his hand over his nose and mouth.

“That's what we're here to find out,” I said.

I opened the stall where the third horse should have been. I wish I didn't. The only thing left in there was the scalp of the horse... It's whole mane and the horse tail was on the ground. The tail had a giant chunk of meat at the end, still connected, where someone ripped it off the horse. Next to these things on the ground...there were three of it's hooves.

“Jesus Christ! Where did the other hoof go?! Where did the body go?!” John yelled.

We all walked away from the stall and one of the FBI agents ordered another officer to take the two remaining horses out of the barn and take them to a veterinary clinic. As we opened the stall to one of the live horses, blood was everywhere. All over the horses feet, it's mouth and in its hair. We couldn't see any wounds or anything on him though.

Around the food trough, there were flies flying around it. I walked closer and my nose started to burn. There was a lot of meat in the trough. Some of the meat was still connected to bones. But... they didn't look like... human bones. They were much too long...much larger than human bones. The joints were different. The horses had been eating the third horse whose body we couldn't find. Who the fuck does this? I thought.

“Guys... I think I found the third horse...” I said, trying not to puke."
169mhy,7,2013-01-09,Returning to DC for Inauguration weekend... How much of a clusterfuck should I expect?,phantasmagorical,washingtondc,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/169mhy/returning_to_dc_for_inauguration_weekend_how_much/,"Traveling there with my brother, who's only been there a couple of times. I lived there for an internship in 2010, so I've been around some major events (most memorable - the Stewart / Colbert Rally)

I'm staying near the Virginia Square Metro station at my friend's condo, I'm hoping to show my brother around my old stomping grounds, as well as inauguration activities. Just a few questions

1. Traffic to and from the airport that weekend - landing on Saturday afternoon 5:30pm and leaving Tuesday at 6:30am. My brother is taking the train from NY - is it going to be nuts?

2. For the non-inauguration days, should we bother trying to get an early start on the day? Or will it be packed all day?

3. Should I be making reservations now for dinners, etc? Or will they have some special prixe fixe menu?

4. How do I get tickets to the parade? Or does anyone recommend a fun place to go watch inauguration activities where it isn't terribly crowded?

Thanks for the all the info, and I'm really excited to go back to DC!

169gk2,2,2013-01-09,[24/f] and S.O. [28/m] takes 0 initiative in just about anything.  What's the best way to express my disappointment?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/169gk2/24f_and_so_28m_takes_0_initiative_in_just_about/,"Background: We have been together for a year and he has lived with me and my mom for 8 months (we pay rent, but it is minimal and goes toward student loans she took out for me in undergrad).  We live in an expensive area and do not earn very much, plus I'm close to my mom, and SO and she get along well as well.  No issues there.


He was laid off about 3 years ago and has been working in a higher-end retail environment (where we both work) since.  He is full-time and it's a great company with decent benefits, but at the end of the day, his primary duties are things like customer service and rearranging displays.  I am part-time there, but in addition to that, I am in a weekend graduate program that I am doing well in, I have another job that I go in to whenever I need the money (although it's still where I make most of my annual pay), I freelance in the field I consider my career, I just working pro-bono on a pretty big project that is a big step up for me in terms of duties, connections, and title, and it is looking like I am also about to land a part-time internship in the industry that comes with a small monthly stipend, but it is also a huge step forward for what I want to do.  The things I am doing now are pretty much things that have worked for me in the past in furthering my career or things that we are encouraged to undertake in my program, even as volunteers/interns, so although I spend a lot of time at home on the computer and I make quite a bit less than him (~16k to his ~24k), I am also busting my ass to move forward; the vast majority of the time that I am at home on the computer, I am touching up my resume, looking up/applying to job opportunities, networking, etc.


S.O. is a fantastic guy and it is obvious that we will be married at some point in the future.  He is a good man, always tries to do the right thing, is gentle, affectionate, stable, considerate, and fun.  There is no issue with him being a ""moocher"" or any other concerns about financial fairness; he pays my health insurance, I pay his car insurance, I pay the most for groceries, he pays for me just about every time we go out.  It is pretty equitable.  

At work, he has a strong reputation at work as being one of the most hard-working people there, and has even started the process of being endorsed as a manager.  But work is pretty much the only place he takes initiative.  He basically doesn't give a shit about his health, and has a BMI of 33, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and sleep apnea.  Since we've been together, he's lost about 15 pounds, and his snoring/sleep apnea has improved quite a bit, and I think if he got to a healthy weight he wouldn't need his CPAP (which he hates).  When we got together he had just the worst fucking diet on the planet, and since moving in, he's gotten a bit better just because we don't Coke and chips and Hot Pockets in the house (we're not fanatics by any stretch of the imagination, but we all have high cholesterol and I know what it's like to be laid up with poor health, so I try to stay healthy).  But I know he's at McDonald's pretty much every day that I'm not with him (I find the wrappers in our trash can constantly).  He'll eat better and make an effort to keep up with his nutrition journal if I mention it, but if I don't, I can pretty much forget about it.


He hasn't done anything with going forward with his manager endorsement because his current manager is always ""busy"" and he doesn't want to bother him or go over his head, I guess.  Meanwhile, our mutual friend (same company) has had her endorsement started and completed, whereas he's been sitting on his for months.  He says he doesn't want to work retail forever, but when he comes home or has off days, he pretty much just reads or plays computer games.  If I ask him to submit some resumes, he will shoot off a couple to jobs I've sent him (that he has indicated interest in and asked me to forward him), but that whole process will take about 20-30 minutes, and then it's back to whatever else he does.  We have both discussed it and I plan to be the breadwinner, but at least initially, when we start having kids, I will need him to be employed so I can be with them while they are little.  Right now, I'm pretty sure that I will either be waiting a long time for kids (which he has said he would like), or that we will have an accident and he will be forced to quickly find some shitty desk job that he hates, neither of which are attractive options to me.


Anything that we do (activities, going to the gym, job fair, etc), we do because I initiated it.  He doesn't complain when we do these things, and even seems to enjoy them, but if I slack even a little, or if it's not my invitation, we simply won't do it.  Even with sex, if I don't initiate, we don't do it.  I have a bit higher sex drive than he has, although honestly, most of the time I initiate it's because I like being close to him rather than I'm revved up or anything.  He initiated a few times in the beginning, but throughout the relationship, it's mainly been me, which I'm generally fine with, but occasionally I'd like him to want to get something started too.


He has had some bad shit happen to him in his life and I know it sucks to be 28 and underemployed, so I have always kept the possibility of depression in my mind.  However, his level of motivation and initiative is the same on the months where we're physically active and taking vacations and meeting all other needs, as it is on the weeks where we sit around the house all day doing nothing and eating garbage.  If he is depressed, he is very consistently (and very subtly) depressed, although I have not ruled it out.


He's so wonderful in every other way, but it wrecks me to see him just not give a shit.  Again, basically nothing gets done (unless it involves food, which he absolutely loves), unless I ask, initiate, or do it myself.  For the most part, I don't mind doing the laundry and cleaning and making his dental and doctors appointments (which, by the way, he hadn't done in about ten years), but it feels like a punch in the gut to realize that if I wasn't around, he wouldn't be looking out for himself in the slightest.  I don't need him to be a millionaire or have a six pack, but I'm very afraid that he is going to die young, and before that, he's just going to flounder in life.  


I realize I've written a goddamn novel here but I just want some outside insight, because I've tried doing the gentle suggestions, I've tried doing stuff *with* him (inviting him to the job fair, gym, doctors...and since we've been together my eating habits have changed pretty drastically because I know if I slip up and get a kid's milkshake, he'll get a jumbo size), and nothing seems to really work.  I usually get up when he gets up (if he has a morning shift) to make him breakfast and pack his lunch, because otherwise he just stops at McDonald's or some other bullshit factory for breakfast and/or lunch.  I couldn't today because I had to leave for a job interview, and instead of making himself breakfast, he just went to McDonald's.  It breaks my heart absolutely every time he does that, and I've told him my concerns about his health and happiness, and he's so, so smart....but nothing seems to click for him, unless it's about something he's interested in (which tends to be things like how traffic patterns vary from region to region or what the best kind of yoke for a canoe is).  I don't know how to make him care about things that are just by his very nature out of his sphere of interests, but I need to find a loving way to tell him that he needs to grow up, and nothing I've tried so far works.  It's not anything I'd leave him over, but it still hurts a fucking lot.

**Edit**
Was kicking around including this because it's personal and I wasn't sure it was even relevant, but just for some additional background, his mom died when he was 18 and a freshman in college, and I know that after she passed, the house (mostly brothers) turned into a ""boar's nest"" (his words).  No cleaning, less emphasis on hygiene, eating habits completely disintegrated, etc.  His family is absolutely lovely and I know they were close (although he's a typical midwestern guy, so no real long emotional chats with them), so I suspect this might have something to do with the way things are now."
169dz0,6,2013-01-09,"Things are shit, i'm going to vent for a while. ",endlessninja,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/169dz0/things_are_shit_im_going_to_vent_for_a_while/,"I'm in a dark place right now Reddit. I've spent the last few days awake, not eating, not doing anything to better my life. I'm just sitting watching movies or reading articles trying not to think. I've ran into depression before, but it always got better after a while. I'd take a few days off, chill with some friends, recognize the things in life that made me happy.

It's all darker now though. Since the beginning of December things have been getting progressively more shitty. The love of my life left me. It started as a break but I knew she just didn't want to hurt me. The other day she told me her feelings for me were just fading, and she wanted to be alone. I understand I'm more than likely to go through a few more relationships before I find the one. This isn't what's making me depressed, it's just the one thing that pushed me over the edge. Nevertheless, it still kills me to think about her. I haven't gone to class for a week just do I don't have to see her, standing there in the lobby, smiling and flirting. 

I'm lonely, and I'm so sure I have reason to be, but I am. Most of me and my ex's mutual friends have held on to her while letting me go. It hurts. Not saying I don't have friends, I have one who I cherish, and he's helped me a ton through these last few weeks. I miss intimacy with love. I could call someone right now and have a fun night. After the break up I went wild and tried to fill the hole in my heart with sex but it felt so empty and meaningless, and it was. It was a very bad decision. I miss being loved the way my ex loved me. She was so deeply in love with me, I couldn't believe it when she ended things. She always dropped hints for a promise ring, when I was going to ask her to prom, about her plans for us after high-school. It doesn't make sense why she left it all behind. It fucking sucks. I know I'm most likely going to get over it in the future, but right now, it really fucking sucks. It's been a month and it hasn't gone away. 

I can't stop thinking about what I'm going to do with my life and how not to be a failure. I used to have such high aspirations, now all I want is to graduate and work my ass off as a painter. I'm very smart, though I'm a terrible student. I love learning and being educated; I'll stay up until 3 in the morning reading about epigenetics and morality, but I can't bring myself to write a compare and contrast essay for English class.

When my parents broke up I wasn't sad; I was more frustrated things were going to be difficult. However as things went on I realized how it really affected me. My dad left me and my Mom $60,000 in debt, with a house being foreclosed and $12,000 of my college fund missing. I can't get mad at him though, I don't know why. It was a few years ago and I've forgave him. We work together now; we're sub-contractors, painters. We just work though. I ask to go out for dinner but it never happens. I ask to go camping, shooting, hunting, it never happens. He says it will, but never follows through. 

My dad just had a stroke and I don't think he's going to last much longer. There's a burst hot water pipe underneath my floor and it's causing insane amounts of mold. I have to find a new place to live next week. I've all interest in doing well at school. I dropped all my classes this semester, I'm going to try to start fresh at the end of the month. 

I'm very depressed, though I know I shouldn't be. It's understandable to be sad dealing with what's happening to me right now, but not this fucking depressed. Last Thursday it got really bad. I called my best friend and thanked him for everything he's done to help me and the last 12 years of friendship and then hung up the phone. I walked to the park a few blocks away from my house, across the ravine, and onto the train tracks. I sat next to them and waited for twenty minutes. I felt the ground shake and heard the noise coming from up the valley. I layed down, and put my head onto the tracks. I closed my eyes and hummed the misty mountains song from The Hobbit. I was just about to fucking do it and I don't know why I didn't. It was so close and so loud and I could feel the train in my bones and I sat up. I sat there as the train went right by me and I just fucking bawled. 

I don't want to die. I want to graduate, work, serve my country, go back to school, find a girl, marry her, have a family, build a house in the Yukon. I just fucking need these feelings to stop. I want to be completely numb. 

This runs in my family. I've stopped my Dad from killing himself. Growing up I always knew, he has a huge scar running from the inside of his elbow to his wrist. My cousin hung himself, my uncle taped a bag around his head and suffocated. Auntie's tried a hundred times. Everyone's tried at least once. Fucking genes. 

I'm going to have a meeting later today a Doctor. I want to get counselling, as long as the person's intelligent and actually helps. A few years ago they gave me some fucking intern who had me chose my current emotion from a piece of fucking paper with a bunch of smiley faces on it. I want to take medication. I'll do whatever it takes for these feelings to leave me the fuck alone. 

Thanks for listening Reddit. "
169dn9,0,2013-01-09,"Well my post didnt show up in samegrassbutgreener, and there is no one there anyways that would see it. So I will post my story here.",timeelostt,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/169dn9/well_my_post_didnt_show_up_in_samegrassbutgreener/,"Where to start? A bit of background on myself? No job, no money, no friends. mid 20's, Adhd, depression, anxiety, introvert. Living at home with mother and 2 sisters, its filled with garbage and junk, all counters and tables have no open space. Even the stove top is a place to store coupons, newspaper, and magazines the neighbors were throwing out. Even dirty paper plates get set next to the garbage instead of being put into the garbage. My mother works 3 jobs, and takes care of my eldest handicap sister. The other sister who lives here doesn't do anything to help keep the house nice, but adds to the mess since she picked up my mothers hording habits. The kitchen sink has a pile stacked higher then the faucet of dishes that wont get cleaned till probably next week. I do my part by cleaning the dishes and utensils I use right away. If I need to strain the water from my noodles, sometimes it requires me to use the upstairs bathroom sink.

I sit in my room(because it's clean) from when I wake till I fall asleep, talking to my family as minimal as possible. I would go hangout with the few remaining ""friends"" that I have that my parents are constantly telling me to hangout with, but that requires money for gas since only one of my ""friends"" are local. Invite them here? No one wants to visit this house, have you looked at it recently? I do have a few xbox friends, and I game with my cousin too, but they are only on at night. And since I am the only one in this house that sleeps with their door closed, I get upset calls and texts for me to stop playing because I am too loud. Are their xbox mics that allow you to whisper in them?
""What about a job Timeelostt?"" Well I used to have a job I enjoyed. But when I come home from basically working out for 6-8 hours, tired and stressed, I didn't enjoy having to clean the stove stop, finding the cleanest pot to clean, make food in a kitchen that has the stench of rotting food, week old bacon and pork grease, and a cup or two of milk that has been sitting out for a day or two. Well that didn't continue on for too long. With it being a challenge to make myself breakfast or dinner, I ended up eating once a day at work. Jimmy Johns, Subway, the hot food at Pick n' Save, or Piggly Wiggly, fast food is way too expensive. Now that I don't have a job, I have no money to go out and buy food, so I continue to eat as little as possible. Typically a frozen pizza at night, finish it the next day, the next night repeat.

""Didn't you try to save money and move out?"" Of course I tried. My job was a lot of work, and little pay. So when you have an income of $1000 a month, and $240-$260 goes to gas to work and friends, $240-$280 goes to fast food and restaurants, another $240 goes to cannabis. That's about 3/4 my paycheck. Then with Netflix, Xbl, a video game here and there, maybe a case of beer, and a hobby. That isn't much left to save. I even found someone to get an apartment with. That would of given me a clean place to live, where I could cook my own meals, and lunch for work. I would of lived close to work and friends to cut way back on buying gas. I sold my iMac for less then it was worth to get the money for the down payment. But with little income, you are required to get a co-signer. Who could cosign for me? My parents? Nope, they refused. With no co-signer, that apartment was quickly taken, and my apartment buddy disliked the other apartments in the area. By the time he finally did find one he liked, I was out of a job, and out of any chance of moving out.

""What if you stopped smoking /r/trees[1] ?"" Well this message would have never been written, I would have killed myself by now if I couldn't smoke. My family and friends of past pushed alcohol on me. That lead to severe depression, self cuts and burns. The only reason I smoked cannabis, after being told my whole life by friends and family how bad it is for me and that it's just as bad as coke and heroin, is because I planned on killing myself. I had it planned and all thought out, and was ready to off myself. Would it matter if I looked like a coke head if I was dead? Not to me. So I talked to some sketch people, got jipped a few times, then lucked out on some nice herb. That week I was a different person, I was happy, motivated, no anxiety, my finger nails grew past my finger tips! (first time since I was a child). Cannabis is what motivated me to getting that last job. That job got me a nice tan working outside, some buff arms, a muscular back, and then I found a great girlfriend. I have never been close to my parents, because of my poor relationship with my parents, I have always had trouble and really disliked talking to past gf's parents, or even any of my friends parents. But I connected with my last girlfriends parents. Tho I was in my 20's, it was fantastic to have a father figure, and a mother I could talk to. And their house!!! It was SO CLEAN! It was the prime of my life, I was motivated to get a place with the gf and my buddy, to lead a life with love and friends, my life was looking bright and I couldn't ask for anything better
But as time continued, having to live in this house continued to take its toll on my mental health. I started going into work late, then a day off here and there. Some days I just couldn't handle my depression. I went from seeing my gf from our usual twice a week, to not being able afford gas to see her that week. She eventually left me, and I can understand why.

""You haven't said anything about your father yet."" My parents divorced when I was 8. I could care less about my father. I could write 10,000 words on how pathetic he is. He is an active member of his church and hold a high rank in his Knights of Columbus club. He has canceled family vacations because he didn't want to have to bring his handicap daughter along. He finds excuses and reason for why he cannot come and help her if no one else can. Before any of his children turned 18, one by one he emptied our savings accounts into his pockets. I had to split live with both parents, and couldn't move out of my fathers till I was 18(court order). Once I turned 18 I was out of there because he was always putting me down for being a ""low grade"" student, and the control he needed to have on his children's life's. But I still talked to him here and there, he has a nice income, and my mother drowned herself in debt, and she is still sinking lower in it. If my car broke down, only person who I could ask for money was my father. After I lost my job I broke down in front of him, with tears pouring out of my eyes, I cried to him about how harsh my life has been, like being a target kid to be picked on and harassed all through grade school and high school, in and out of school. I cried to him how I wanted to end my life. He only sat there for a few minutes before he decided to leave, so we could talk ""when I was calmed down."" The next time I talked to him I realized he could care less. I asked him why he doesn't care, and with a few seconds of thinking, the exact first words out of his mouth were ""Well you don't ever come up to my house and help with chores.""
So with no support from either parent, no motivation for myself, no reason to take care of myself and my body, never a reason to leave the house, no cannabis to settle the stress, and my birthday a week away. If this is the life I will have to continue living, I can honestly say I don't want to make it to my birthday. An xbox friend has been saying that in 4-6 months I could move south west by him, he could get me a job working for him, and he could fit me into his apartment. It wouldn't be ideal for me, but it would be a step out of this house. But having to wait such a long time, if I don't make it to my b-day, how will I make it 4-6 months?

Well I guess I should get on with what I am looking for in life, and I guess what I am looking for is a lot. Since cannabis is the only medication that works for me(yes I have tried anti-depressant pills, keep them the fuck away from me please), I would love to live in a state where I could get my medication, I have looked a bunch into finding a way to move to Washington and would be a dream come true if I could live there, but living in any state with medical cannabis would be amazing. If I could also find a job or internship blowing glass, then I would be the happiest kid in town. I'm not into glass blowing because of marijuana, I have had an interest in glass blowing for a long time. Making something out of a lump of molten glass if fascinating to me, not just glass pipes, but any type of glass art, putting my imagination into a form. ""Degenerate Art"" was one of the coolest videos I have ever seen. Jackpot if I managed to find myself working in a dispensary. But I don't need the perfect job to be happy. I need a new place to live, surrounded by positive people, people I could call friends. It would be nice to have someone one to talk to, to have some social interaction.

But this all just a dream of hopes and wishes.

I was hired into a healthcare environment as a help desk intern. I was told to monitor the help desk and fix basic windows issue, reset passwords, etc. Right after I was hired in, the two network admins quit, they hired one new one, but there were alot of duties not being done so I decided to get my feet wet. I handled enterprise backups, server installation, learned a bit about networking, a bit about sql, basically your general ""wear alot of hats"" IT work. This went on for nearly 2 years.

Also after I was hired the company got a new IT manager. When I was hired the company had the head of accounting working as an interim IT director, but for obvious reasons that wasn't working out. 

Last year saw a huge software implementation. I configured and installed more than half of the new hardware (despite this being the assigned job of one of the admins). Worked tons of overtime. Helped deploy the new servers, and incorporated the new backup systems for the new hardware. 

I should mention at that right after I was hired there was a 1 year pay freeze. I was hired at intern pay of $10 an hour. As of last year, after picking up tons of responsibility and 2 years with the company I had still had no raise. I brought this up multiple times to my manager, and she said we would address it after the software implementation. So I worked hard during the lead up to go live, worked a couple 90 hour weeks during go live, and have been on call about three weeks out of the month for the last year.

I finally got our meeting for the employee evaluation scheduled. went to it. And (drumroll please) $0.10 an hour raise. My world pretty much exploded. Between the huge blow that was and the stress the previous year had brought, I had developed some health problems, actually was rushed into surgery one day after nearly collapsing.

I'm back from my surgery now and have had plenty of recovery time to think about my situation. Basically I've been spending all this time working hard and getting practical experience at the cost of academic experience. I had to drop out of school to accomodate all the overtime and on call that I take around here. What I want to know is, Where do I go from here? I can barely afford to live on what I make currently, but theres alot of people in the IT job market right now and I feel like I have no skills that look pretty on a resume. Are there any quick certifications I can get, or am I not looking for a job correctly? Any advise would be great.

**tl;dr after two years and sacrificing school for a company, I have no degree, not sure what marketable skills I posess, and could make more money working at walmart. What should I do?**

168x9d,6,2013-01-09,How long is the main quest?,MrMocca,DragonsDogma,https://www.reddit.com/r/DragonsDogma/comments/168x9d/how_long_is_the_main_quest/,"Hey guys, I first bought this game a few months ago, I read some reviews beforehand and I really couldn't get into it because every bad thing the reviews pointed out bugged me to no end. Things like the pawns not shutting the fuck up, which is still annoying but whatever. To things like the lack of fast travel, which is also still annoying but bearable atleast....

I decided to pick up the game a few days ago since my internship gave me a nice paycheck for christmas but while most things are still annoying, they just don't bother me as much as when I first started playing. Anyway, I was wondering how long the main quest was, I'm currently level 31(?) and I only just met with the duke. I finished up every quest aside from some escort quests before meeting him though.

I must say that I am using a guide. I am not using a guide to finish up the quests or looking where to go when on a quest, but I am using a guide to find out where I can find quests. I am a completionist, but some of the things in this game are just really hard to find. I mean after I reached Gran Soren I went back to Cassardis a couple of times and there were new quests there, who would have tought? Things like that I would have never found out on my own, because what game expects you to go back to the town you started in after I don't know how many hours of gameplay?

So yeah, how many hours is the main quest? Because when I play the main quest I actually feel immersed sort of, the cutscenes are great IMO and I love the way my character looks. Maybe because I managed to create myself in the game... Who knows. I just want this experience to last a fair bit longer. I plan on doing all the side quests ( The Hero achievement) so you can also take that into account. By the way is there any way to see how long I've actually played? I can just see how long the owners of other pawns have played. 

This game is also the first game in a long while (The previous probably being WoW back in the day) where I get really excited and laugh. I hired this amazing looking Warrior pawn the other day and I entered a cave. The cave had one of those trolls which go wild after he sees a woman, my main pawn being a woman he got a massive hard on and went HAM on my girl. This badass pawn which I hired clinged on to him, screamed something along the lines of: I'll attack him from above! and started wailing at him. My main pawn tought it would be a good idea to stand near a cliff, the beast charged, you gained 8000 exp, RIP Nostele the brave. I was also absolutely blown away when I came back from work one day and I saw my pawn had been hired by two people. As soon as I left Gran Soren and I tracked my quest she ran off screaming: I know where to go! I just tought that was fucking amazing, never seen anything like that in a game before. I can honestly see why this game is getting a lot of flack, even by avid RPG fans but if you manage to look past the bad things, which even turn out not to be THAT bad (Walking everywhere doesn't take up THAT much time), the game is truly amazing.

Also this game is the first game where I ever had a true sense of accomplishment. I beat Dark Souls not a week ago and that entire game was 'meh' difficulty wise to me. But when I faced my first Chimera(? Liongoatsnake) I was practically screaming with excitement because I expected him to be a breeze like in the prologue. But in the prologue you play as the Arisen at the end of his journey, mine was just starting and you could really tell.

Only thing that's bugged me thus far is the Metal golem quest. Mettle with metal? I figured you had to destroy the crystals, but there's one up in a tree which I can't hit being a mystic knight. My ranger pawn doesn't want to shoot it so I guess I'll have to switch to ranger. 


PS
Also, any of you have visually badass looking pawns? I'm not talking about midgets with high pitch voices, but badass warriors with gigantic armor. Or a ranger with a neat set. I just want visually cool pawns. 

PPS
If I hire a higher level pawn, will it gimp my game and make is super easy?"

I'm a sophomore at a large school in Maryland and I'm looking for advice on what to do next. I live right next to DC for reference.

I'm pursuing International Studies at my school. I'd like to work for the State Department or even become a diplomat someday. How do I get there from here? I'm planning on taking numerous language courses as well as studying abroad for a semester or two.

What should I do this summer? I tried applying for an internship at the State Department but I haven't heard yet from them (I'm assuming this means I didn't make the cut). If I can't find anything useful to intern for, I'm just going to continue at my menial job I work at on breaks, which doesn't add anything to my resume, but does bring me closer to paying off my college debt early.

If you don't think working for the State Department is realistic/a good idea, what would you guys recommend I pursue?

Thank you so much guys for your help!"

168jcq,13,2013-01-09,"Broke up with my girlfriend, lost my place and my confidence",concievable,OneY,https://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/168jcq/broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_lost_my_place_and_my/,"I apologize for the long post in advance. I feel like one of the hallmarks of being a man is not talking about your feelings, or about yourself in general. As such, I have a lot on my chest that I want to get off. Maybe there's a better subreddit for me to post to, but I've been following this subreddit for a while and you guys seem like a really supportive and welcoming group.

So I started dating my ex within the first month of college. She was my first girlfriend and for the first year everything was wonderful. Then over our first summer apart, we started to have some problems.  She tried to break up with me, and although I was able to talk her into keeping me, things were never the same. All throughout the Fall semester of our sophomore year, she started pulling away from me, and she became very depressed.  Of course, seeing her pull away only made me hold on tighter which is not the right response.  She was also having other issues at the time, but problems academically, and she felt like she had no friends. Suffice it to say, she was in a very bad place. We spent a lot of time together, but we didn't interact much. I'd stay over her place every night, but we'd only do sexual things once every two weeks or so.  When I confronted her about our lack of sex, she basically blamed it on me, she said I wasn't very good. She didn't mind, but she really didn't want to do anything with me.  So I accepted that. Then spring semester came, and she started feeling better. We started going out more (previous to that, we'd spend most weekends sitting home together despite the fact that I'm in a fraternity and there were always things we could go to), and things seemed to be turning around. Then she started criticizing me, my clothing choices (to be fair, I have horrible taste in clothes and it was pretty deserved), my sense of humor (I have a fairly dry sense of humor, people can rarely tell if I'm joking or not), my interactions with her friends (I'm fairly awkward, but I did try most of the time), and my choice of conversation topics (I tend to over think minute details of things and it would drive her crazy).  Eventually it came out that she was embarrassed of me, which is why she rarely wanted to have me do things with her and her friends, or generally go out in public with me. The only time I even had a shot of doing anything sexual with her was when we were both drunk, and even then it was only a 50/50 chance.  She tried to break up with me a few times, but I was always able to talk her out of it.  Even through all this, I loved her and I couldn't even think of being without her.  Then the summer came, and we were further apart than ever. The first time I saw her that summer, she came to visit me for a long weekend and it was terrible. She was in a bad mood to begin with, then I accidentally broke her laptop (it was breaking already, but I do feel terrible about that). Her bus home was in another day, and through the entire time, she was barely even willing to talk to me.  Needless to say, it was the awkwardest trip you could imagine.  It was then that I decided that I didn't think I could be with her long term. Before that, I just figured I had found the one and we would be together forever.  So later in the summer, I broke up with her. Cue things getting worse and worse for me.

Some background about my summer, I was working 40 hours a week at a job I hated, at school with is in the middle of nowhere. My job was in a kitchen so I tended to work nights and weekends, so I barely saw the people I'd been living with, who I wasn't very close with to begin with.  I also did research on the side for another 20 hours a week.  I was miserable, but I kept thinking to myself: as soon as school starts in the fall again I'll be happy. 

Then school started and I was starting a new major. It turns out my major is the hardest at my college, which is a fairly hard college to begin with.  I had always been a smart guy, and for the first time in my life, I was struggling to keep up. I was pulling all nighters once a week just to finish my homework, and worse yet, no one else in my classes seemed to be struggling at all.  Add on to that the fact that since I'd been dating my ex for the past two years, and essentially living and spending all of my time with her all of last year, I didn't have many friends to speak of, even in my frat house. Add all of this up, and you can tell that I was pretty miserable, but I sustained myself with the though that Winter break will be better. Ironically, I was going through almost exactly what my ex had gone through last year, but unlike her, I really wanted to pull somebody closer, but I don't know many people at school.  So I contacted my ex, and while I got no sympathy from her on what I'm going through, we ended up awkwardly on and off for half of the semester.  That ended around the beginning of November, and then after a little while I was ready to start talking to girls again, but it was Winter break.  

So I went home for winter break which I'm currently on. What I would want more than anything is to go out and try to meet a girl at home, just to get myself back into the swing of things, but that's not really a possibility at home.  I do have a better support system home than at school, but I've kind of lost my place in my group back home. For one, I kind of let them fall by the wayside. For another, I've kind of lost my place in the group. I was always the smart one, but I feel like such an idiot because of my classes.  I used to be funny, but I'm so unhappy that I can't really muster up any humor.  So when I see them, I don't really feel like I belong.  Once when we were drinking together, I started talking to one of my friends about my relationship with my ex and how lonely I am, and he had me practice talking to women with one of our female friends. But every five seconds I talked to her, he would shout ""WRONG"" and tell me why the way I was talking wouldn't make a woman interested in me.  His heart was in the right place, but it more made my confidence plummet than gave me practice.  At a later date, I heard him tell someone I was a depressing drunk. 

Now in this time, I have gotten closer to guys in my frat, just not close enough that I feel comfortable with sharing much of what I've written here.  And I feel so out of place with my home friends that I'm not comfortable talking to them about it.  When I talk about myself too much, I feel selfish and weak and so I don't talk about any of this.  I just feel kind of lost.  I don't feel like anyone I know gets me. I'm not happy at home, I'm not happy at school, I keep saying to myself ""well this situation right now sucks, but wait a few months and you'll be in a different situation and you'll be happier"", but I've stopped believing it. I don't have much faith that the future will bring good things to me.  I've been applying to internships, but I can't think of anything I would be happy doing for the rest of my life. I've been glorifying the idea of talking to women, but I don't even know what I would do if I found one that was interested in me.  My ex took all my confidence in my sexual ability, and while I'd like to practice and improve, the thought of how bad I am getting out would mortify me, so I'm made impotent by that thought (not literally).  (To be completely honest, I'm pretty sure the lack of sex had more to do with her depression than my lack of ability, because we were find for a year before that, but the thought does haunt me.)  More than that though, I just don't see why someone would be interested in me.  I don't feel like I have anything to offer to anyone.  This semester proved to me that I'm not smart, I don't have the capacity to be funny at the moment, I'm definitely not good looking. And while I am actively trying to improve all of those things, it's hard to see any progress.  They say you have to be happy with yourself before you're ready to be with someone else, but how do you become happy with yourself? I feel like I've been wallowing for so long, I want to get out of my rut. I go back to school this weekend, but I don't see how things will be any different.  

If you made it through all that, thank you for listening. Like I said, this is really one of the most supportive subreddits out there.  If I have to resort to pouring my guts out to a bunch of strangers over the internet, I'm glad it's you guys."

",AgonistAgent,circlejerkcopypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerkcopypasta/comments/168ihr/retrosrs_and_blackmailing_archangelledworkin_by/,"and blackmailing ArchangelleDworkin by uncovering the sweltering volcano of drama she had with gqbrielle after seducing her as well, through a PBS shoot.

gq and I had chatted for a while by modmail. I knew she wasn't as into men as I was into women, but I have sensitive eyes that rival a woman's, to the extent that I can even attempt to understand a woman's experience, because I can't. after picking at her name and using that as a springboard to talk about dresses, she invited me to a genderqueer fashion show.

it was glorious. we reveled in how much the androgynous models smashed the patriarchy, we sampled the raw foods vegan Hors d'oeuvres and we knew that this was truly the 21st century. progress, people.

I had noticed toward the end of the show that my hand was tugging on her waist. it wasn't even a conscious thing, and I felt bad because I didn't have her permission. I don't know if this makes me a tool of the patriarchy to say this, but her eyes seemed like she liked it. as much as I hate the idea, it was ... implied consent.

she was a surprisingly good kisser, and was impressed when I said I didn't think about masculine gender norms at all when I brushed the bangs of her hair intimately.

at her hotel room, we agreed to have tequila shots out of shooter glasses, even though we agreed that the phallic nature of shooter glasses is a little bit creepy. I wanted to comment on how I was impressed how much she could hold her liquor for a girl, but implying that girls have a natural capability to hold less liquor than men is a biotruth, so I didn't.

by 12:34AM we were leaning into each other a bit too much, and her shoulder knocked against my chest. we fell back on each other laughing, and I shot her a glance. not because I was objectifying her, but because I was considering all aspects of her humanity. it was incredible.

that's when, after a hiccup, she broke silence: ""that was good, now do this to AADworkin and find out what we can do to fire her. if you don't, I've recorded this whole thing, and I'll be sending it to various activists groups to let them know that you raped me.""

a false rape accusation. an MRA's worse nightmare, but I am not an MRA.

still, I was shocked how used I had been, that even after browsing /r/seduction in my shitlord ways she had known my game the whole time and made me feel like an AFC back in the days when the most I could get was an HB7. the hardest neg I've ever had to deal with in my life. if I believed in traditional masculinity, I'd say I felt emasculated.

the next day, when I put gq in my contacts, I found a couple of people who could set me up with PBS. it's good that I was able to get my blogs out on reddit, because PBS took me much more seriously after that, and allowed me to intern for them for the fall.

after telling them that I could do a follow-up story on reddit, PBS bought the idea. it wasn't long after that I had Dworkin, in the flesh, responding to my questions. I was uncomfortably attracted to her emotions.

We interviewed for a while, and I got to show her my androgynous side.  ""Maybe he's not as much of a shitlord as he seems,"" she mumbled in her coastie accent. After a while, my piercing yet understanding eyes that totally show I understand her humanity must have got to her. I asked her about her opinions on the direction of SRS, and that's when she said:

""well, you know, I really think there are some terrible people here, and I wish I could just fire certain moderators.""

I tried as best as I could to understand. I reached out a hand -- only with her consent of course -- and felt her palm tightly grasp mine for comfort. it was cold. something was clearly on her mind.

""i'd really like to get rid of gqbrielle and her gang, once and for all.""

this is what I had come here for.

""would it be too Elevatorgate if I asked you for coffee tomorrow?""

""it would, but I'll oblige you, shitlord. I kind of like you anyway.""

it was about 10:45PM and we went to a swank coffeehouse with couches clearly designed for couples. the wind outside had made both of our noses stiff with cold, so we huddled next to our coffee cups on a couch, embracing each other for warmth and for each other's company.

""you know, in spite of our disagreements, I've always found you attractive.""

""you're objectifying me FROM THE START? jesus christ I'm out of here.""

""no, no. I've found your ideas attractive.""

""uh huh. thanks. I have always enjoyed reading the stuff you write, even if I hate you.""

we conversed like this -- half-hating, half-flirting -- until 12:05AM. I get a text from gq:

""if you don't get her back to the hotel room, you'll have a lot more to worry about than transparency.""

freaking out, but determined not to show it, I invited Dworkin back to the same hotel room gq and I were in.

Dworkin was considerably more resistant to the idea of consuming alcohol. champagne flutes? phallic. a margarita glass? gendered, it needs a stem to be held up by women. we eventually settled on martinis in those stemless wine glasses.

""if you found me physically attractive, it wouldn't be objectifying.""

""why?""

""because I'm giving you my consent. jesus christ you're thick. fuck me already.""

in a rush of passion, we threw the glasses on the floor. for someone who thinks I am a cissexist piece of shit, her body was remarkably... cisgendered.

12:45. we had just finished, our breaths exchanging such that my inhale was timed to her exhale. I had slept with a lot of women, thanks to my /r/seduction past, but none I found as attractive as her at that moment. there was a kind of beauty to how she tastefully defied gender norms, such as having armpit hair but not too much, or unshaven legs but not really in an extreme way.

12:57. we are sweatily embraced, and I hear a crash.

gq had been equipping herself in the bathroom. she had kicked open the door and was pointing a gun at me and Dworkin.

""I have pictures of both of you. and if you don't bring both of your cissexist shitholes to the ground, I will kill both of you on sight.""

we nervously put our clothes back on, and never spoke of the moment since.

ever since then, I've been wondering what was going through dworkin's mind when she made those SRS decisions. surely she remembers the beating of our hearts as gq's finger caressed the trigger. but we haven't talked about it. not once.

out of respect.

I'll wait for my death patiently.

Thinking about Chemistry + Computer Science double, while doing premed",ilovedumbpeople,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/168f11/need_some_guidance_thinking_about_chemistry/,"I'm in a very interesting scenario. I am both very interested in Chemistry and Computer Science, and am considering getting BS degrees in both. I am a current freshman. My first semester GPA came out to be above a 3.9, and am taking organic chemistry this year (got an A first semester). 

My scenario is interesting because I actually took a lot of my premed requirements (all the math, General Bio + Lab, Gen Chem + Lab, Gen Phys + Lab) while I was in high school from another university, and I counted the credits as ""college credit only."" What I'm told is that this satisfies the requirements of medical schools, even though I'm not taking them at my current college. 

So, what would you guys suggest? Is double majoring possible? What classes should I take besides the ones that are technically required by med schools? Should I retake my med school requirements in order to get into a better med school, or will they look at my (hopefully) good grades in higher level bio/chem courses and (hopefully) good MCAT scores and think that it's enough? Should I start looking for labs right now (already kind of know the answer to this one)? Will med schools frown upon internships at tech companies during the summers of sophomore and junior year rather than research? I have many resources available to me from my university, so any suggestions are welcome.

Thanks!

**UPDATE: [Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/16bsub/so_i_left_heres_how_it_went_down/)**

**TL;DR = I hate my role as the 1 man IT department and feel I'm overworked, and none of my pleas for help (people or tech) go answered for over a year.  I'm burnt out and my new 'manager' knows nothing about tech, or IT/support roles, and is doubting I do anything because there are still some open tickets for ongoing projects.  Do I rage quit? or bite down and play nice and 'man up'?**

And the full rant... 

I'm so pissed right now and my apologies if that comes out here.  I'm going to try and lay this out here in a way avoiding ID of me or my current employer.

I am the Network and Systems Admin for the company in title but in practice I am the one man IT department.  When I took the job, I knew I was getting into that role and with the size of the company it was quite manageable.  The company has now doubled, if not nearly trippled in size (including merging with another small company) and now spreads over MULTIPLE offices around the midwest US, and overseas sales staff that are operating on all time zones pretty much.

I am on-call 24/7.  Literally.  I am the only one and they all have my direct cell and while I accept 'mission critical' calls are par for the course, I get the ""my printer is beeping at me"" calls at 3:20 am just the same.

I manage everything from reloading printer paper at the office I am based in, to troubleshooting phone lines, over the phone, with people who don't know the difference between a busy tone and a dialtone, across the country.  I also manage the Cisco and HP network devices, and am expected to administer multiple Linux boxes running KVM, with multiple (too many sometimes) KMV guests.  

I am expected to document everything.  I do not feel shocked at that expectation as it's good practice for everything IT, but... I am expected to document everything I do, as I do it (get to that in a second), as well as retro actively document the 5+ years of things they've set up before I was even hired!  I am also expected to document it in such a way that ""anyone in the company can open a PDF and do what you do.""  Basically a how-to for everything, up to and including (this was a real request), configuring a Cisco ASA firewall... written for someone who doesn't even know how to ssh or what a firewall is.  Back to the ""at the time you do it"" rule.  I am often doing MULTIPLE tasks at once and rarely ever get more than 15 minutes straight without someone dragging me into another discussion that probably shouldn't even involve me, but hey, it involves a computer or a file so... IT right?  I rarely get the time to go back and close out the ticket I just completed work on, before I am dragged away to another thing... and I rarely get the chance to open, fill out, and then close a ticket, for many of the things (most things) when people just walk up to my desk (the front of the whole office so everyone can get to me instantly), give me a problem, and need a resolution right then and there.

On that... I'm at the front of the office.  For fuck's sake.  The UPS guy has ME sign for everything and asks me if we have shit to pick up.  Fedex too.  Postoffice dude comes in, drops mail on my desk, goes out.  I'm closer to the front door than the people who answer the phones, deal with mail, and UPS/FedEx.  This not an issue for anyone it seems.

I have been with the company over a year now, as the only IT person.  The only assistance offered is whatever lowly 'intern' they have hired to help with 'random office things' for that period of time.  For that persons time though, I have to queue up along with everyone else in the office who wants assistance answering phones or filing paper or scheduling meetings for them so they dont have to.  These people also NEVER have any IT skills, so all I can have them do if I get time with them is tell them to update a spread sheet with numbers (file sizes) they find on various network drives.  That's all.

I have personally installed 2 full racks in 2 locations for them with servers, NAS, network, VPN, spares, etc.  I am the only person with access to 1 of those which is 2 hours away from my home office, and no one else is willing to get access so that if anything ever happens, I  alone have to drive to the datacenter to flip a switch or console into a server when a dev turns eth0 off.

We also deal with media quite a bit, and we have multiple people who are geniuses with Adobe products.  I am tasked with managing all of the 'licenses' (very very grey area in some cases, if not just pirated), and the workstations they run on.  I am also tasked with keeping a 40TB Netapp from being full.  38TB they need to retain there ""just in case"".  So I am constantly copying 2TB off to external drives for off-site storage, and by the time I get it open for another project to fit on, they fill it back up and yell or open tickets ""NETAPP IS FULL!!! HORRIBLE DISASTER!! NO WORK CAN BE DONE!!!""  They refuse to buy more disk space for the netapp, or alternate large storage solutions for quicker offload of data.

Now, they have decided that I am using my time inefficiently, which I totally agree with.  I have no idea how to 'effeciently' keep up with the level of demands placed on me.  Their solution however is not to bring it another IT skilled person to balance the loads and work beside me, but to assign the office manager to be my boss because ""she's good at schedule everyone's time"".  ie: she makes the meeting calendar.

I have a ticketing system.  No one opened a ticket for the first 4 months it was up and running.  No one.  Everyone called me directly and no matter what I did they didn't get it.  Not until I had to tell the CEO to open a ticket 5 times in a call did he get the message and then make a note about it for everyone.  He still never opens tickets but that's what it is, he's the main man.  Now I get tickets for ""My mouse needs cleaning"", or ""Our site is giving php error code... ""  I am expected to clean mice balls, and replace mousepads, or hand them out.  I am expected also to apparently PROVE that a PHP error code in our products is NOT the fault of the Linux server it's running on, before I am allowed to have a dev look into it.  

Just tonight, sitting here installing a VM for our Oracle guy because he'd rather have a ""clean slate"" than upgrade his current VM's oracle with a patch... I have gotten an email telling me that I have failed to close all of my completed tickets in the past few weeks, and there is now reason to suspect I have spent 3 weeks doing nothing.

3 weeks, of a one man IT shop, doing nothing... the place would be burned down.  But, there's reason to doubt that I've been doing anything?  Really.

I emailed the CTO, my direct boss, who's been avoiding being ANYTHING of a manager to me for my entire time with the company up to the past few weeks, and who had repeatedly shot down requests for a) more IT help, b) more storage options, c) developers to look at site errors instead of me, d) meetings to keep us both on the same path with IT needs... I told him I need to know if HE personally has any reason to doubt my abilities and efforts, and if so HE needs to tell me, not this office manager (in an email she CC'd to him, the president, and the CEO, none of which have mentioned any concerns to me directly).

Oh and fucking vacation time.  I haven't had a vacation since I started. They have a ""strict, not strict"" vacation policy.  ""as long as work gets done when it needs to get done, take whatever vacation you need"".  There is no written policy.  No accumulated days.  No anything.  People just say ""I'm out from now til then.""  However, I am IT.  We are a tech company.  I am always on call.  There is always something relating to some type of technology that needs to be looked at.  The only 'vacations' I have gotten, is the drive time across the midwest to go from office to office now and then to work at differnet places for a week at a time.  Seriously, they consider that vacation, or 'personal time'.

I am fucking tired of this.  I'm tired.  I'm just fucking beat down by all of it.  I think most of the people in this company are fucking awesome and great at what they do, the other 1/3rd are all college friends that came along with the CEO when he made the place so they're untouchable and I'm just tired of getting slammed with multiple offices, remote users, everything from piddly shit to being the 1 person on high fucking alert during Sandy's landfall.  I'm just fucking tired.  I'm not personally invested in the company like my superiors are, and not guaranteed anything if they do sell, or we strike fucking industry gold or anything.  I'm just getting my paycheck (about 80k) and that's it.


I want to quit.  I want to clean out my fucking personal shit tonight, drive home, and fucking email them a ""good luck with that shit"" letter in the morning and never go back.  Okay, maybe hand them a formally typed letter and say ""sorry, it's just not working out."" in the morning and then go home, but what the fuck ever.  

Now, I ask you guys, from what I rambled here, does it sound like 1 IT person should be handling this kind of load on their own?  Does it sound like I'm just ""not realizing my true potential""?   Should I bit the fucking bullet and nod and play nice and wait for .. what?

I am already taking phone interviews, and look to get more when I bump my resumes.  Meant to do that this week actually but I have had to do lots of last minute ""we forgot to do this, could you look at it..."" shit for the DBA's and Dev's.  I am also at this point willing to work outside IT if it comes to that again.

I am just looking for someone to tell me that they've been here, done that, and it's not as bad as I think it is.  Or tell me what you've done to unravel situations like this in your past.  If no one can, then I'm probably in my last 12 hours of being part of this company.  And in that case, how do I deal with this going forward, eg resume?  Whats the best way to walk the fuck out (not staying for an awkward 2 weeks, fuck no)... and not cause it to bite me in the ass on my next interview?

**TL;DR = I hate my role as the 1 man IT department and feel I'm overworked, and none of my pleas for help (people or tech) go answered for over a year.  I'm burnt out and my new 'manager' knows nothing about tech, or IT/support roles, and is doubting I do anything because there are still some open tickets for ongoing projects.  Do I rage quit? or bite down and play nice and 'man up'?**"
168ccx,9,2013-01-08,How should I properly set myself up for future jobs?,ragnvaldr2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/168ccx/how_should_i_properly_set_myself_up_for_future/,"I'll give the TL;DR first, because I'm afraid I'll let the full story get too long.  
**TL;DR:**  
* 22, No college degree, getting married in 3 months   
* No previous experience  
* Self taught--and it shows...poorly  
* My job isn't giving me useful experience, and I doubt ever will ever will  
* Would really like to get into software engineering, but am very lost and directionless  

Background: I'm 22, and live in southern California. I took enough community college to transfer to a UC/CSU, but never actually did so.   Instead, I took a full-time job offer at a company I was working at part-time. I'm also about to be married in 3 months, and both my fiancee and I make $30k, pre-tax, which is barely enough to scrape by where we are.  
  

The company I work for is a mostly family run, non-profit, movie review business. And I might add, it's a **very** poorly run company, and with the possible exception of my immediate boss, I'm the most qualified to do their IT--which is scary. A total of about 12 people in the office, plus another 6-12 in different areas. I was originally hired to do data entry, learn how to use their production printer, and generally just be smart enough to fix things and solve problems. I've grown up with computers, and have a number of years learning and fixing things, but didn't start getting a deep understand until fairly recently--still don't have near as deep of an understanding as I'd like.

  
When I was given the full-time offer, they made promises of teaching me programming and having me **just**  be a programmer that didn't quite end up as planned.  

That was a year ago, and I still only know enough HTML and CSS to get by, and a bit of javascript, and I'm still little more than the office grunt doing little jobs that everyone else can't be troubled to do. Every now and then I'll have to set up some new little website in rackspace and stick a WP theme on it (and try to customize it a little,) but that's hardly something I can put on a resume.  
Just today I was asked to make a ""piss simple"" app for them that basically just is a news feed of all our website's content (new articles, reviews, etc,) using something like Titanium, since it's JS, and though I feel like that's getting closer to what I'd like to do, I feel like it's not something I realistically *can* do yet.

I try to fit in some time to learn more, but there's not enough time to focus on it. Mostly codecademy (almost finished all the JS courses) and some Lynda.com. At home, on the side, I'm starting to go through C++ Primer.

What I'd really like to get into is software, I think mobile in particular. ...But I have no experience. And no one to teach me. And while I know there are unlimited resources online to teach myself, I feel like I'll be missing out on a lot not having someone guiding my curriculum or being able to explain certain things that I'd otherwise miss. 

So I think what I'd most like is to find a job where I can start out low (preferably making at least what I am now...) but somewhere where I have someone to teach me as I go. Or even a mythical paid internship would be great. 

I've looked at colleges, but the local school, CSUCI, doesn't have a night/online CS program, and I couldn't find a decent looking and affordable program anywhere online either.  
I'm also open to moving--my fiancee is at a job she'd like to leave as well, and we're both up for moving around a little for work if need be.

I'm sorry if this is the same old story you guys hear in here, and I'm sorry for the horribly long post, but any advice would do wonders for this desperate man. I feel like if I don't do something soon, I'll be paying for it dearly in the long term."
168a1n,4,2013-01-08,"Need advice figuring out how to get anywhere in video games. Suddenly don't know what I want anymore. (long post, contains tl;dr)",arcturin,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/168a1n/need_advice_figuring_out_how_to_get_anywhere_in/,"TL;DR: Moved to LA 1.5 years ago to get into video game audio. After a job at Starbucks and another for a film composer, I haven't gotten anywhere in video games. Don't know what to do anymore, because all my effort seems wasted.

Ever since I thought about what job I'd like to be doing for the rest of my life, I've been sure I'd want it to be in video games. I first got the idea in my first year of college - completed a double major at Berklee College of Music, and graduated August 2011, ahead of schedule. I love writing music and working with sound. It is my passion, and the only other thing that I have the same love for is video games. So, after connecting the dots, I started studying video game sound design.

After college, I moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in video game audio. After two unpaid internships, a lot of effort, and a few small paid projects providing music and sound for video games, I ended up working at a Starbucks to make ends meet. This went for six months, and I was left with little time to pursue my passions and started wondering what I was doing with my life. In late October, I got an email about a major film composer looking for a new assistant. I applied for it, and after a few emails, an interview, and less than 24 hours, I had been hired. I was so happy I cried. I don't think I've ever done that before.

Very quickly, I began to learn that the life of a composer's assistant is not one I want to lead. Constant 10-16 hour days left me exhausted, and I felt like the work was taking its toll on my soul - I didn't emotionally connect with any of it. I started making mistakes. Nothing major, just occasionally forgetting one thing or another. But it was still more than enough to annoy my boss to the point of firing me right before I flew home for Christmas. I had a bit of a mental breakdown the night beforehand (the job was really getting to me in a number of ways), so losing my job didn't unnerve me too much.

The entire time I've been in LA, even during my time as a composer's assistant, I've wanted to music and sound for video games. I got the opportunity to attend GDC 2012, I met/interviewed people from Activision, Infinity Ward, Riot Games and more, I've happily stayed current with what video games are hot (indie and AAA alike), and so on. After everything I've done, I've felt like I haven't gotten anywhere towards getting hired fulltime to work on video games. What's more, I don't feel particularly driven to do sound design in my free time, because I have nothing to design sound for. That's made me doubt if I have any place in the industry at all.

At any rate, I need a job very soon, and I no longer feel like LA is a good place to be for getting into video games. Today, I was looking at an application for Trader Joe's and, being disgusted with myself, tossed it aside. I feel like all my time since college has been a waste. I don't know what to do, other than continue creating random pieces of work and hoping that someone likes what I've done. I've been heavily considering applying for jobs at small, indie studios in San Francisco and Boston, but I am thoroughly dissatisfied with my work portfolio, and don't want to apply anywhere until I'm sure I can impress someone with something I've done (don't even have the money to move anyway).

I just want to work in the video game industry, and hopefully make enough to pay rent. I want to get involved in the community, assist in the design process, write character backstories, schedule progress milestones, maybe even provide music - I want to contribute in some way to something I'm passionate about in an industry with people I identify with. It doesn't have to be in audio, but audio is what I'm best at. Am I being naive? What on earth could I do competently enough so that my work is considered helpful, necessary, and excellent? I'm a member of the LA IGDA chapter, I've been on GANG and Gamasutra constantly, I've submitted so many applications to video game companies, I've networked my ass off, I've done sound design and music for video games, and I'm still at square one, because my work is mediocre and my effort seems wasted. If someone told me to do three different pieces of background music, twenty sound effects, and an essay to be considered for a job at a video game company, I would be happy to. But I've never felt so unwanted in an industry before - it seems like nobody will even give me a chance. I am now confused and desperate, and don't know where to focus my effort."
168a05,12,2013-01-08,"So much stress, but still losing it",kiwias,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/168a05/so_much_stress_but_still_losing_it/,"Background: 5'4"" 21 year old female. My starting weight as of May 1st 2012 was 168. I was disgusted. Lost 9 pounds the first week then followed with another 10 before classes ended mid June. I plateaued all summer but finally joined 24 hour fitness in early October when classes started back up. I went off and on then started losing focus. 

The weekend before Halloween I went out to a party with some of my guy friends I've known since freshmen year at college (seniors now). After the party I was driving everyone home. The last stop was an apartment two of them shared and I lived 20 minutes away. Despite not drinking I was extremely tired and they invited me to crash on their couch. Long story short in the middle of the night one of them attempted to rape me. After that it was scary to go to the gym as they went to the same one as me. After a couple days I realized I needed a new motivation. I signed up for a personal trainer. It was the best decision I've made.

Fast forward to now and I've been counting calories (1200 a day), exercising every day, and I just finished my 18th training session. I've still been under a considerable amount of stress but I have lost another 11 pounds since I started training on Halloween and despite battling major foot problems for a few years I'm training for a half marathon at the end of this month.

The stress has been coming from so many places. I have two jobs, I'm struggling to pay rent, I'm graduating school and trying to find an internship and job (and I want to move when I graduate so I'm looking for jobs outside my state which is harder than I anticipated), and of course I'm still dealing with the ramifications of what my ""friend"" tried to do. At this point I haven't seen any of those boys and only talk to one.

It's been a hard road but it just got harder. Despite everything I never once went over my calorie count or missed a workout (except two extreme sick days). But tonight I snapped. I drank a beer, which isn't smart because I also suffer from chronic migraines and for some reason even one alcoholic drink is a trigger, and had a double double with animal fries and dr pepper from in n out. Just for dinner.

I did this because 24 hours ago I was informed by my dr that the benign mole she removed two weeks ago is actually pre cancer. I have to get more of it removed and it has to be monitored for the rest of my life. If I hadn't asked her to remove it (I just thought it was ugly) it would have been melanoma within a year. 

But guys, tonight might have been an overreating day but tomorrow I WILL be back at it. I told my trainer what happened and asked him to completely kick my ass tonight since I wasn't planning to count calories. He agreed I needed this night but still looked like a kid in a candy store when I said he could do his worst. Which he did.... I don't think I'll be able to lift my arms tomorrow.

Don't worry about one night. Distressing via food is okay if it's not every week. Sometimes you need it, I know I did. Thank you for letting me share my story. 

18 pounds til my goal weight. I can freaking do it.

TL;DR: Attempted rape by a trusted ""friend"", ankle problems, chronic migraines, and now pre cancer. But I'm still losing it."

What should I do this summer? I tried applying for an internship at the State Department but I haven't heard yet from them (I'm assuming this means I didn't make the cut). If I can't find anything useful to intern for, I'm just going to continue at my menial job I work at on breaks, which doesn't add anything to my resume, but does bring me closer to paying off my college debt early.

My summer internship has me in Minneapolis all summer, so I need somewhere to live!  If you are looking for a subletter for the summer, let me know.  I would hope that you are in the city and near public transportation - but ultimately I'm just looking for some laid back roommates for the summer.

 - Liberal leaning but i'm not overbearing about it.
 - Pet friendly, people friendly
 - Clean living habits, respectful with shared spaces
 - Currently live in a fraternity house so even though I personally don't create a lot of noise, people and music don't bother me
 - Trees friendly however my rule of thumb will be to respect house rules whatever they might be
 - I'm up for adventures, chilling, and general shenanigans whenever I'm not at work
 
I don't know anyone in Minneapolis so I'm definitely looking for any opportunities to get involved with stuff on the weekends too.  So if anyone has advice on cool things to do in the city, I'd appreciate it.

I'm worried about college, finances, the fiscal cliff, the state of Congress, and the list goes on. I'm desperately trying to hold on to my faith, and it's getting tough.

I know that I have been gifted with intelligence and discernment, more specifically I've been investing my intelligence into IT, and I struggle to find how this will glorify God.

I guess what I am asking for is encouragement and prayer, because I feel like I'm at the bottom of the well so to speak. I want to glorify God, and I want rest. There hasn't been any peace in my life since last semester, and I'm not sure what happened to bring that along. 

On a side note, please pray that I find an internship for this summer. I've been diligently looking, and I'm just not sure if I'll find one.

16c9og,4,2013-01-10,CS Career Paths,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/16c9og/cs_career_paths/,"Hi reddit,

I'm currently a junior CS student at the University of Idaho, and working as a software engineering intern for Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories. My manager has asked for a write up and what direction I want to start pursuing for my career. The problem is, I have no idea. I have experience in several languages, and love designing software (not just programming). I've talked with my academic advisor, but he unfortunately could only tell me that it's too early to go down any one path, and I personally also feel I have too little industry experience to even know what all the available paths are.

Currently I think there are a few things I don't want to do: I'm not the biggest of fan of worrying about low level programming (I prefer high level abstractions, and I love studying different programming paradigms), so I don't think I want to to systems engineering or anything embedded.

My interest is currently piqued by release engineering. I am a major fan of source control, especially huge scale systems like GitHub. Continuous Integration I also think is a super neat concept.

I'm currently possibly being tasked with Jenkins plugin development, which would give me a lot of experience with Java and build systems.

I'm excited, but apprehensive, as RE seems like it can be very dirty, possibly unappreciated work, where if something breaks it falls on you to fix it ASAP (which is something I really didn't like as a system administrator with a small company I used to work for). I like my days 9-5 without a whole lot of work pressure during my off hours. Also, RE seems like a pretty set path that's difficult to hop out off.

I'm looking for advice, what would you do in my situation, and where would you look to learn more about what all I could go into?

[What happened between you and Jenna? I understand she left to run the YouTube videos, which was always her goal, but why does the animosity/bad blood exist between you, as shown by some of your blogs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/169yz5/i_am_dave_portnoy_owner_and_founder_of/c7u2vzo?context=5)|This one would take forever to reply.  Should have written it first because I obviously knew it was coming.  Truth is Jenna and I didn't have problems for 99% of the time she was here.  When I hired her she cried she was so happy. She was working in a tanning salon.  I told her I wanted to make her into a personality.  Hence ""Getting Weird with Jenna"" videos and shit.  Turned out she could write too.  Gave her Stoolala.   She'd do anything we ever asked.  The second and I mean the second her first video hit she got weird.  She'd come into my office once a week and say I was exploiting her because I wanted to make money off her.  I told her that's why I hired her.  She'd refuse to meet with advertisers who wanted to advertise.  She tried to charge me 10K to appear in Quirk ad when I was paying her 50K a year as an employee.  Still we got along because I thought she was just nuts.   She hated blogging which she openly admits.  She basically stopped working for me.  Money was tight and I told her that as long as I could keep the lights on she'd have a job with us but if things got too tight she'd be the first to get the axe.   I suggested she sell tshirts with her face on them and I'd front the money and she could keep all the profits beyond her salary.   Long story short is once she thought she may be done at Barstool she went beserk making videos and doing all the things I'd always asked her to do.  Despite all that I still would have left on good terms if it weren't for the last blog she wrote saying her succcess had nothing to do with Barstool and spitting in my face basically.  This was despite us having a 2 hour heart to heart the day before.  She talked about how she was getting fired and didn't know when Stoolala would be shut down.  I offered to give her the site no strings attached.  Just give it to her.  Bottomline is I thought she painted me out to be a douchebag when all I did was help her.   Now when people ask her how she got her start she says she was just making videos in a tanning salon.  It's infuriating.   It has nothing to do with money.  She emailed me six months ago and apologized and I pretty much told her to go fuck herself.

[Why do you think Barstool and similar sites get a lot of hate from feminist groups for promoting rape culture, sexism, etc., but when someone like Chelsea Handler can make jokes about men from the other side,  it's somehow okay because she's a woman? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/169yz5/i_am_dave_portnoy_owner_and_founder_of/c7u2y13?context=5)|Yes.  And feminists are morons.
[What do you think of the comments section on Barstool? How often, if ever, do you look down that ugly dark hole of brave anonymous basement dwellers?  PS. I’m guessing your decision to always close the comments section for the Local Smokeshow of the Day was not accidental. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/169yz5/i_am_dave_portnoy_owner_and_founder_of/c7u35be?context=5)|I read em a decent amount.

[Hey Pres, long time Stoolie. My question is about the business side of the Stool. Where do the majority of the profits of Barstool come from?

Writers 60ish.
[What do you think of “rape culture”, a term that seems to have originated specifically from critics of Barstool? I imagine you wouldn’t deny charges of your website being misogynistic in tone, but do you feel the accusation that your website actually subconsciously or explicitly condones rape to be fair on any level? When you hear that specific term, what is your reaction? Does it piss you off? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/169yz5/i_am_dave_portnoy_owner_and_founder_of/c7u34wt?context=5)|I don't think it is fair on any level whatsoever.   ZERO.

[Pres - Big fan. Long time reader, first time, whatever.  With all the shit you spew on Barstool regarding how you'd love to bang other smokes or how many women you'd take down if you were single (which in 99% of the cases, wouldn't happen;  but that's neither here nor there\), is your wife able to always distinguish and separate the blog from real life? I can imagine there are a lot of ""David we're married now..please tone it down with your obsession of Sophie Turner and her huge dump-shoot"" moments. Does your stuff ever lead to blow-ups at home?

I can't look for a job. I'm too depressed to, and I don't know what to look for or where. My interest is in working with bears, it's been the focus of most of the internships I've taken, I've gone on an internship each summer, at zoos and wildlife sanctuaries and on field studies, but that's all I've been able to do, just summer internships, not permanent jobs, and as soon as they're over I'm back at home with my parent in a house and environment that crushes me with depression and hopelessness, and robs me of all motivation to do anything. I've had some neat experiences on my internships, working with bears and lots of other animals, but as soon as I get back home they become distant memories, like worlds away, and I feel the gloom of our house close in on me, like I've never been anywhere or done anything and never will. My dad died 3 years ago and it's just my mom and brother on and off, and the house feels almost haunted by its memories and quiet. My goal when I return home is to always look for a job asap and move out, to improve my habits and get involved in lots of activities, but I always fail at all of those endeavors and sink into a slump of doing hardly anything at all at home. I've had a job listing website open on my browser for weeks, hoping I'll eventually look for one, but i physically can't bring myself to go past their front page, I'm so addicted to the internet, to facebook and reddit browsing and to MLP:FIM and other dumb distractions that I can't even get the first item of my shit together and get through a few simple clicks of job searching. I don't know what to do next. I don't know where to go from here. I can't stand my environment anymore and I want to move onto something else but I'm so crushed with depression and guilt and self loathing from it that I can't motivate myself to do anything to try and get out of this situation. I need to move out of the house and find my own place and live around other people i can regularly socialize with but I can't fucking get out of this house, I can't move, I just don't know what to do. 

Each day goes by I swear to myself I'll do something today... I sit on the internet all day and when the sun goes down the guilt hits me hard, I stay up all night hating myself swearing I won't go to bed until I get something done, and I don't, my body resists everything I try and tell it to do, I just stubbornly browse facebook/reddit/ponies until 4:00 am and finally give into exhaustion and crawl into bed hating myself, and sleep until noon the next day and immediately get back on the computer again when I get up back for more. Months go by like this with me hardly noticing. I don't know where the fuck time goes. The internet and all of its crap is the only thing that keeps me from thinking about how much I hate myself for being such a lazy incompetent bum. When i'm off of it I freak out and panic about these things. I want to smash my computer, but it's the very thing I need if I want to find a job and get out of here, it's what I need to escape and to find a job and it's what's keeping me down. I don't know what to do. This cycle has been going on for too long, and it's about time i put an end to it, by whatever means. I don't care if I have to move out onto the streets and live as a beggar, I just want something to change and I want to be self-reliant."

I've got a bachelor's degree under my belt already, and I'm doing a 2 year addition at my alma mater to get a second degree in CS. 

From what I've hear from friends and relatives and found online, its really difficult to immigrate to California. Has anyone here done this who was originally from Canada?

What are my chances of landing an internship at a big company like Google, Amazon, or Msft down in the states before I graduate? I've got near a 4.0, and hopefully will have some local co-op experience before I get into my upper division classes. 

My goal for the future is to move to California. Even if the money wasn't better there, I would still want to go. I don't mind Vancouver, but I've been to Cali and I fell in love with the weather and the cities there. Washington would be okay too.

I'm hoping to hear some success stories, but I wouldn't mind knowing about some of the pitfalls as well."

I'm studying computer science at college and I'm going to start applying for internships for this summer soon - specifically, it's always been a dream of mine to work at Blizzard and I plan to seriously apply there. I read all over the place (and have heard from employers first-hand) that it is a HUGE plus to have code that they can look at, presumably in the form of an open source project or contributions to an open source project. In my case, I'm nearing completion of an XNA platformer in C#, and could hypothetically make my github project public so that they could view the code. However, my game isn't architecturally very profound (because I've been focusing more on the design side of the game) and I'm worried that they would look at it and scoff at its lack of professional game-development techniques, or have a hard time understanding it's layout or why I made the decisions I did.

So my question is this: what exactly are companies looking for in ""sample code""? What are the risks of showing a company your code? Are they really looking for smart engineering decisions, or is it more of just a screening?

On the one hand, I want to show off the fact that I can make a game and know to code, but the other hand I'm scared to show off any inadequencies that I may have. If anyone could give me some advice on how to approach this, whether from personal experience or what they've read, it would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

16at0g,6,2013-01-10,How can I bow out of being in my friend's wedding party without ruining our friendship?,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/16at0g/how_can_i_bow_out_of_being_in_my_friends_wedding/,"Last summer one of my closest, long-time friends asked me to be a bridesmaid. I didn't immediately accept, and explained to her that I was honored but that I did not think that it would be financially possible for me because I am currently in graduate school across the country and my budget doesn't allow for more than the bare minimum of living expenses. She said that she would speak with her dad and that as he was very wealthy and had lots of frequent flier miles my $400 airplane ticket would be covered one way or another. So I agreed. 

I checked in with her to see how the conversation with her dad went, and she said that she hadn't found the right time to talk to him about it and that she would later.  A few weeks later she casually mentioned in an email that her father lost his job and is now unable to help pay for her wedding. She did not mention anything about the airplane ticket, but she still continues to send emails about the wedding planning.

I am still unable to afford a ticket and rental car expenses, and she and her fiance would be unable to pay for the ticket as well since they had to postpone the wedding because he was filing bankruptcy (plus I would feel horrible having them pay for it). I think that she is hoping that I will suck it up and just pay for it (she has done this in the past), but part of my even agreeing to be in the wedding was on the understanding that airfare wouldn't be an issue.

I also just found out that my dream summer internship that I am applying for would require me to relocate the weekend of her wedding, so if I was accepted for the internship I would not be able to be in the wedding anyway because this opportunity is instrumental in my career. 

So far no dresses have been ordered, the wedding isn't until May, and quite honestly there is a chance that it could be called off as she has been unhappy with her fiance. What is the most tactful way that I can step out of the wedding party without ruining our friendship? I know that my presence there would mean a great deal to her, and I care about her and want to support her, but with the unexpected expense of paying for airfare and the internship dates conflicting with the wedding, I am just unable to. I can't help but feel selfish."

Mid 20s College student trying to do the right thing. ,Off-By-One,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/16aic8/should_i_be_consulting_with_a_financial_advisor/,"I apologize in advance if this is the wrong place to ask.  

I feel like I am mismanaging my money. I try to do the right thing in terms of debt but have no idea how to invest properly. I'm 25 years old and will be completing a Computer Science degree in ~1.5 - 2 years. Currently, I have roughly $12k in a Vanguard company sponsored 401K. My Company matches up to 6% of my contributions something I take full advantage of, however, as a part time employee, 6% of nothing is still relatively nothing, so it's slow going. I was thinking about switching over my 401K to a Roth IRA where (I think) it will grow more quickly but am not sure if this is proper logic or if it's even possible. My current school debt is $6467 and am estimating it to be around ~$15k (all loans are subsidized) when I graduate. I make roughly $1k a month after taxes, insurance, union dues, etc from my part time job and occasionally intern during breaks in between school to earn some extra cash. I have no credit card debt (pay it off monthly) and no car payment. I feel like I need to be doing more financially but am at a complete loss.

Also, I was employed by Circuit City for 2 years before they went under and contributed to a 401K there as well, however, never followed through when claiming stuff while they were filing for bankruptcy (big mistake). The 401K provider, Wachovia, was purchased by Wells Fargo. When I created an account with Wells Fargo, it recognized I had a Circuit City 401K plan with a balance of $0. Is there any way to recover my own money I put in to the 401K?  

I apologize if it's difficult to follow. I would like to become a better investor while in school. I've only recently followed this forum, however, it's been incredibly helpful and I've already taken advice given in other threads.

Thanks in advance!"

I'm hoping I can get a few questions answered. I'm in my final semester of school, about to graduate with a CS degree. Obviously, I would like to get a good job, and have a number of things going for me. I'll be graduating with a 3.8+ GPA and have internship experience. However, I feel like this isn't enough. I have worked on large projects for class, but I haven't really done any projects on my own outside of class. How much will this impact me?

Also, I'm pretty apprehensive about technical interviews in general. I do well in school, but a large part of that is because of my study habits and whatnot. As previously mentioned, I don't do a ton of work outside of class so I need to refresh myself on some things. So really any advice for preparing for technical interviews is appreciated.

Finally, I have a question regarding my interests in CS. I'm really interested in both linguistics and artificial intelligence. I've enjoyed most of my other classes, but these were the ones that I was really passionate about. I may be wrong, but it seems like it would be more difficult to find a job in those fields. Also, would I need a graduate degree in order to really work in those areas?

I've had a few internships since getting out of high school. The most recent was developing some test scripts for a large internal application (using QTP). I have also worked with a company, before leaving them after about a month, partially because my coursework was pretty heavy going into the fall semester. They were building a web application using ExtJS and Java. I had done all the necessary training and was starting to work on an actual feature, but of course decided to quit. Before that, I had a work-study where I created educational 3d worlds/helped manage servers and labs, classrooms. The first internship was basically scanning/importing maps and drawing the walls for a Cisco WCS, along with helping image systems, and moving machines around.

My programming classes have been in Java, and I feel reasonably comfortable reading javadoc, and java in general. Did a simple android app last semester, and studied android security for that upper level security class. I have also done some linux kernel programming in C, and while I understood that class well, I had a partner to get help with the actual programming.

At home, I have an ESXi server as well as a pfsense firewall. Mainly have a file server and a minecraft server running off of it.


I'm not sure what direction I should take. I feel like I don't have enough programming experience, and my grade in the upper level security class wasn't great either. I am planning to learn Python this j-term. When reading around reddit, the usual response it to find an open source project and contribute to it. I would indeed like to do that, but never know where to start. 

Finally, I'm not sure if I should go to Grad School. What should I be asking myself about this?

I figured after having completed the first cycle myself, I can point out a few things I've noticed to help others who have been asking the same questions a couple of times now:

1. I am doing an unedited version of the program, which can be found [here.](http://www.charlespoliquin.com/ArticlesMultimedia/Articles/Article/441/German_Volume_Training.aspx) **DON'T FUCK WITH IT**. It is enough work in itself.

2. EAT BIG + SLEEP BIG = GET BIG. I actually had one member inform me they were tired all the time, weren't really seeing results, feeling depressed, etc. If you're doing this program, you MUST eat a LOT and get more than enough sleep. I'm currently at 4,000 calories and sleep between 8 and 9 hours a night, and I STILL hurt in the mornings.

3. Yes, I'm keeping track of everything. Food, sleep, performance, bodily measurements, water drank, supplements taken, etc.

4. Leg day will wreck your soul.

As far as DOMS goes, you will feel if it. Chest day and arm day hurt about equally, but you're going to know a new kind of hell if you have a job requiring you to stand for hours (mine) and have to do it the day of, after, or after after leg day.

That's about all I can think of to address the question that have turned up. I can't be on here as long as I'd like due to currently doing 2 internships, my job, classes, and sleeping early. Ain't nobody got time for nothing with this bullshit. I should be done with this by the first weekend of March.

16dd80,2,2013-01-11,Hey r/Memphis I could use some advice.,the_smoke_monster_,memphis,https://www.reddit.com/r/memphis/comments/16dd80/hey_rmemphis_i_could_use_some_advice/,"Let me start by saying thanks for taking the time to give this a look!

Ok to start off let me give some background info: I am a 19 year old, male who just finished my first semester at the UofM. I am a aerial performer working with a local aerial company by the name of Valeria's Wings(http://www.valeriaswings.com/) I make a small amount of money doing shows but when I say small I mean maybe once a month I make enough to fill my gas tank(and I drive a small car). 

However though I am honestly losing money doing aerial it is my passion. There really isn't a better feeling then flying and performing in front people. It's the only thing that has ever inspired me in my short little life and I couldn't be happier doing anything else!

Now here is where I ask for the advice.

I mentioned earlier that I had just finished my first semester of college. And well yes I will admit I enjoyed it and had a lot of fun and learned a lot of things...I don't think it's for me. ACTUALLY no it's just not for me right NOW! I do want a degree one day(hoping to get one in Hospitality) right now it just isn't what I'm passionate about. 

Money for college isn't even a issue either I am lucky to have VA benefits from my parents and that money will still be there when I come back.

What I do love however is my performing in aerial. The problem however is right now I'm not making really any money from it. HOWEVER I can be very soon. I am working on a internship program with a bigger traveling company that I've already worked with before. The issue is money till then. Membership at the studio I practice at is $130 a month. I've been applying everywhere but so far no luck.

So here is where y'all come in. I need help deciding:

A) Following my dream continuing being a circus performer and until then hopefully finding a job that can fund me till then.(if anyone knows of one of those that would also be great)

Or B) Choosing the easier route and stick with college, but giving up on my dream(this however is probably the more safe choice)

TL;DR (Follow my dream or take the safe route?)

Thank you for reading!"
16dbxj,2,2013-01-11,I need to get some things out and I have nobody to talk to at this point. ,ErodedThoughts,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/16dbxj/i_need_to_get_some_things_out_and_i_have_nobody/,"I've been depressed on and off for quite some time. I've battled with insomnia for the last 13-14 years or so and I'm only 26. I had some issues with drugs when I was a teenager and witnesses a few fairly horrific things that have never left my mind. I've recovered though...I haven't done any drugs aside from smoking weed since I was 18 and I've lived on my own and supported myself for the last 9 years and managed to maintain healthy relationships and friendships throughout.

Bad decision in my youth and lack of motivation or direction lead me to drop out, so I've struggled to get ahead for many years. After dropping out I traveled aimlessly for about a year and returned to my home town and lived on minimum wage doing whatever I could - washing dishes, telemarketing etc. 

I was in a long term relationship in which we lived together for about 4 and a half years - from the ages of 19-23. It wasn't a great relationship and it should have lasted about half as long but we both became complacent, and in the end it ended up holding me back from trying to get my shit together and start going to school so I could make some progress in my life.

When I broke up with her she took everything - pretty much all of our money, the bed, the furniture, the dishes etc. I was left with my computer on a desk, a guitar, my clothes and a few blankets. I was 23 years old and had no idea what to do with myself. I felt stuck.

I had finally gotten a decent paying full time job about 2 years before that, so after I ended that relationship I worked my ass off working overtime and any other odd jobs I could find to save money so I could move out of the town I was in and start going to school. I always wanted to move to the west coast - Oregon or Washington. Where I lived made me miserable and I was sick of struggling for so long and it motivated me to work my ass off to get somewhere better.

A little under a year after I had ended that relationship I had a decent amount of money saved up and I was figuring out where I wanted to go to school, for what, student loans and etc. I was finally going to make some progress in life and I felt more excited than I had felt about anything since I could remember. 

I met a girl completely randomly online one night. We got close despite our distance of about 800 miles. She traveled to see me not long after we met online so we could meet in person and we got closer and closer from there. We started a long distance relationship. I'd never felt so close to somebody.

About a year ago last July I was suffering with some depression and some severe insomnia issues and I got pneumonia. Around this time I posted something to /r/insomnia trying to express my frustration and get some things out. My health did recover, but I was scared for a while. It kept getting worse and worse and I felt like I was slipping into insanity. 

I ended up having to use almost all the money I had saved for medical bills so after I recovered I was back to the beginning. My girlfriend stayed with me despite the distance and despite not knowing me for very long and without even thinking twice she was there for me as much as she could be. After I recovered I made as much effort as I could to see her but more often than not she would take the time and the effort to travel and to spend more money so we could spend time together because I was living paycheck to paycheck. I ended up owing taxes and it put me farther behind. My girlfriend helped me financially in a few situations and never questioned being with me. I appreciated it more than anything.

I was able to save a bit of money up after a period of time but it wasn't enough to move. My girlfriend knew how much it would improve my life and how much it would mean to me if I were to be able to move out of there and have another chance and she gave me that chance. She gave me money to help me move.

I moved to Tacoma, Washington in September.

She had to go to work for an internship far away as soon as I moved here though, so it continued to be a long distance relationship BUT only for 8 more months - until May, 2013, at which point she would come back home and we would only be about 2 hours from one another. I was moving away from my home town, all of my family and all of my friends and everything I knew so I could be happier, improve my life, go to school and be closer to her. She had put so much effort into our relationship I figured that was the least I could do. She put everything into it, and it was my turn.

I've just looked forward to starting school and her being done with the internship and coming back home so we can be close and actually have a non-long distance relationship.

When I moved here I moved in with a friend and slept on his couch. I couldn't find a job for a few months, and even now I've only managed to find a part time job. My friend and I managed to move into a 2 bedroom apartment in December, so now I'm on the lease and I'm responsible for half of the rent. My expectations were unrealistic for how long it would take to find a job when I moved and I've been struggling financially since I got here.

In the last few months since I've been here my computer ( which was my only solid form of communication with my girlfriend. ) died and I couldn't afford to have anything more than a tracphone. I was unable to keep the contact with her that I wanted to. She was getting frustrated that I was still not finding a job and making progress and I started to feel resented. I just wanted to be stable and not stress about things and it was causing me to delve into depression. We grew distant and not being able to communicate when we wanted didn't help. 

At the beginning of December she met somebody else that lived far away from her but was working at the same company for an internship. They got close, and she never told him that she had a boyfriend. After a week of them getting close in an inappropriate way she broke up with me on the internet two weeks before she was supposed to come home for Christmas and see me. She told me she still felt exactly the same about me but she needed to see that I was getting myself together and she couldn't handle a long distance relationship where we rarely talked and I was constantly struggling. She said she wanted to be with with me again when I was stable. I asked her if there was somebody else and she said no, but there was - and the next day she started fooling around with him. 

We didn't speak for about a week, I sat in my room heartbroken and depressed. My roomate is my only friend here and he's busy but talking to him occasionally has helped a bit.

The week after we split up she contacted me and cried and told me everything that happened and how horrible she felt and that the guy she met ended up being a scumbag. I had no idea what to think. I was only the second person she had ever been with. We didn't have sex until we had known each other for almost a year and she required an STD test before we ever got involved like that. She was VERY careful and had a lot of self respect. It was completely unlike her. I was heartbroken and hurt. My trust had been destroyed. She agreed to see me in person when she came home for Christmas, and I saw her twice on her week long break. It was emotional and nothing really felt resolved - it was just confusing. She told me her feelings haven't changed but she can't be in a relationship with me. She acted like we were dating again when we were together and it was incredibly confusing. She wants distance now, and we haven't talked much. I'm still confused and hurt. Tonight we talked for a bit and I told her that I'm confused because what she did after she broke up with me wasn't something I would expect from her because I always thought she was so classy. She flipped out and said fuck you and I assume she'll never talk to me again.

I still can't find more than a part time job and I'm getting into bad territory. My phone stopped working a few days ago and I have $3 to my name and no food. I need my phone for the only job I have right now so I'm probably going to lose the job. I haven't eaten in 3 days. I don't know how I'm going to pay rent next month. I was supposed to start school on the 28th but there's no possible way of that happening now. Everything is hopeless. 

My roomate started dating a girl about 6 days ago and ever since then I've had to listen to them fuck constantly. When I'm able to suppress the tears to go get some water from the kitchen or something I have to awkwardly interrupt them having romantic dinners and etc. He hasn't really talked to me since he started dating her. I sit in my room alone crying and he's enjoying himself with his new girlfriend. Nobody has asked me ""what's wrong"", I feel like he wants nothing to do with me because I'd ruin his mood. I have no friends here,I have no money, no car and nobody close to me anymore. I have nowhere to go to even try to escape and take my mind off of things. I don't know what to do. I can't stop shaking or crying. 

Any time things start to look up it all crashes down on top of me again and ends up worse than it was before. I'm probably going to be homeless in a matter of a month or less. I just wanted to be stable and be happy.

I'm not suicidal. I couldn't do it. Maybe if I had no family that loved and cared about me and I was all alone in the world but I couldn't do that to them and I feel like it's kind of cowardly. I can't help but wish that the world really would have ended on December 21st though...or a plane from Seatac would have engine failure and come crashing down on my apartment and disintegrate me into nothing. I'm just sick of being alone and being in pain.

16dap2,14,2013-01-11,Just got my first real job and it happens to be in tech support. Any hints for me as I embark on this treacherous journey?,Chizzoink,computertechs,https://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/16dap2/just_got_my_first_real_job_and_it_happens_to_be/,"Well, by a wondrous stroke of luck (and some persuading from my girlfriend), I applied for a job listed on Craigslist, got a call the next day, got interviewed, went on to the second interview, and got the job along with one other, less tech-savvy guy.

I had held an intern position at my old school district for 3 summers in a row plus September to December (until they ran out of money and had to let the interns go). It allowed me to learn about hardware and troubleshooting and such, but only limited to the fleet of computers we had. I had never dealt with viruses and such. 

I consider myself very adept at working with hardware and I can hold my own when it comes to software.

Our company is more of an on-call place, where people call in and either bring in their computer to be repaired or we'll go out to their house and fix it. It's solely a tech support company, not a parts sales company (although we attempt to sell parts in addition to services).

At my new job (which I'm still in training for), I'll be required to do opening stuff, check in customer's computers as they come in for appointments, fix said computers, ship some off to be repaired if the repairs are more serious, and just all around manage the shop while the other employee works out in the field.

I'm not sure what else to put here. So if you need more info, just ask! Thanks for any input!

**EDIT:** Thanks for everything so far! I'm gonna compile a list of all the main points and hang onto that while I work."
16d9id,6,2013-01-11,Need some advice!,eloraw,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/16d9id/need_some_advice/,"So, last summer I bit the bullet and really committed to some weight loss. I am 23 years old, 5'9 and my heaviest weight was 235lbs. During the summer i began calorie counting and working out regularly. By the end of the two months my weight dropped to 205lbs. Over the fall I became really busy with internship and didn't have a chance to get to the gym at all. However my life style is very active. I was up and moving all the time with kids, teaching creative movement to 3-6 year olds etc. I also kept up my healthy eating habits. (Don't get me wrong, i definitely cheated every once in a while) but over those 4 months I maintained the weight of 205. 

Dec 27th I headed back to the gym. My goal was to get back on the weight loss train and try to shed some more weight as my goal weight is around 175. When I go to the gym I do about 30 minutes of weights and core strengthening. (100 sit ups, stretching, and some upper and lower body weights) I then do 30 minutes of running as I am doing the a 5k training program through an app I downloaded. (I run approx 3-3.5kms in the 30 minutes). 
I also began calorie counting again keeping my daily caloric intake below 1200. In the past two weeks I have gone over this amount 3 times however I have not exceeded 2000 calories in a day. 
My diet: Generally for lunch I have a sandwich or wrap with lean meat and lots of vegetables and always on a whole grain wrap or bread. and for supper its usually a lean meat with a large side of vegetables/salad. When I snack i usually snack on fruit and vegetables or nuts and dried fruit. I drink mainly water with the odd diet coke if I want to treat myself. 

My question to everyone out there: Why have I gained almost 5lbs since being back in the healthy routine these past 2 weeks?!

any ideas? Let me know if I missed anything about my routine...."

We've all known each other for about 3-4 years and we're all around 25 and we all go to grad school. Two of us are in each room. Lillian and Marissa live together while I live with Shauna. We all paid the same fee for the apartment. We're only living in this specific place for a two semester period since we all go to our hometowns for the summer or internships usually/

Lillian moved in first. The rest of us showed up later. Turned out that one room is much bigger than the other. We had no idea they were unequal sizes until we got there.

Fast forward to during winter break. Shauna and I had talked a few times about asking about switching but we never did. My roommate suggested that during winter break, we could just move everyones stuff and switch without having to tell Lillian and Marissa.

This is where I was stupid. I told myself doing that would be a prick move. But then I convinced myself that was the only way to do it because of two reasons:

1. Lillian is a OCD type person who gets partly irritated by small things and every year I lived with her, she comes first thing during move-in week to pick the bed and etc.
2. We had mentioned it to Marissa in passing and she had said no. I mentioned it to Lillian through text and she said she was laughing.

So I convinced myself that if we had directly asked them, the answer would be a no and they might even padlock the door or something. Our logic the whole time was that since we had all paid the same price, we each should get the bigger room for one semester.

Anyways, so I still had doubts about switching the stuff without telling them. So this was what we did. We got to the apartment and tidied our stuff and moved everything to the living room. Marissa wanted to switch the stuff without telling them, but I really felt that would destroy our friendships beyond recognition. So I txted Lillian and Shauna, telling them that we wanted to switch. I told Lillian that we had moved our stuff in the living room and we were happy to move all the stuff for her or if she could come and do it with us if she wanted to. Marissa said she was fine with it but to make sure with Lillian.

Lillian responded angrily that she did not agree with it and it was completely ridiculous and shady. I responded that it only made sense since we all paid the same fee.

The conversation came out to be that Lillian sounded pissed that we hadn't asked her before and to her, it seemed shady. I told her that I didn't want to switch the stuff without her knowing and I didn't want to touch her stuff. I told her that all of our stuff was in the living room and she could move her own stuff to the smaller room and then we would move our stuff to the larger room later on in the week. She stopped the conversation by saying that she was hurt and a bit shocked by this and we would talk later.

Anyways, I really realized that I should have listened to my conscience and told Shauna in the very beginning that we weren't going to do anything unless we asked them directly. The worse part is, Lillian is obviously made at me because I did all the texting and asking and it looks like it's all my idea.

Any advice on where to go from here in terms of repairing my relationship with Lillian? Also, are we in the wrong for assuming we all should get a shake at the bigger room?

16d2zu,0,2013-01-11,I'm [f23] sick of my boyfriend's [25] mother [~50],manicrysis,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/16d2zu/im_f23_sick_of_my_boyfriends_25_mother_50/,"So, my boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year (10 months to the day of this post). Now, I've had some other posts bringing up issues in our own relationship. But never including his mother. This is really the final straw. 

First, I'll explain some of the difficulties in his own relationship with her. He lived with his parents up until March or so of last year. The parents moved out leaving my boyfriend and his twin brother the house. The boys pay rent on the house ($300 each) and their father pays the rest (approximately the same amount). The boys also pay utilities. There was no written lease. There is only a small sheet of paper saying the boys would pay rent with their signature. My boyfriend was never allowed to read the paper, only was able to sign it (I'm not sure of the reason, I can only assume). 

Now, this doesn't seem like there should be an issue here. Only that their mom constantly bitches about rent and how they should be paying more, and constantly wants it to be known that they couldn't find any place cheaper (aside note: they can). She always expects them to be grateful for *everything* she does for them. And they are. However, the mother takes it to an extreme. She's constantly badgering them about it. On top of this, she always complains about buying the boys groceries all the time. However, they never ask for help and she just brings them food whenever she feels like they need it. Yes, it's a nice gesture. But she constantly complains and holds it over their heads that she buys them groceries.

On top of all this, she has overstepped her boundaries constantly. I live an hour away from my boyfriend. And until this Spring, I haven't had a car to drive for years (anxiety issues after accidents - not completely relevant here). Anyway, I'm going to have a car. So, over this year he has been awesome and drives to see me for a day, or picks me up and takes me to his house for the weekend (sometimes longer). Here's where the issues started. 

She learned that I smoke (she does, too). And bitches at my boyfriend about it. Because he hated it when she smoked because she would smell up the whole house. I don't smoke inside their house and I never would. He hates the fact that I smoke, but we make it work because I've constantly said ""I'm going to stop smoking for me and not because of you."" He accepted that and we moved on. However, his mother can't understand that. She thinks I'm a bad person because I'm overweight, I smoke, and apparently laze around the house all day. 

She makes an issue of my ""issues"" and bitches at my boyfriend (okay, I'm getting sick of writing ""my boyfriend"", so now his name will be Carl) even while he's at work. She complains that I need to ""earn my keep"" while I'm there. That I should vacuum and clean the entire house. I have no problems cleaning the house while I'm there. And to say the house needs cleaned all the time is an overstatement. That place is *spotless*, practically. I do their laundry (especially since I shower and use their towels). And I do their dishes for them (it's a dishwasher, but I would do them if they didn't have one). As a matter of fact, when I'm over at my friends' houses, I wash their dishes if there's a pile up, or clean their bathtub because it's absolutely disgusting. I can't stand sitting in a dirty place. Anyhow, she constantly complains that I never do anything. 

Once she texted him, ""She's fat, smokes, and sleeps all day. What a life to lead..."" And I'm just going to put this out there, she's had plastic surgery. And she is by far not thin. I admit I'm overweight, and I'm working on that. But she constantly cuts me down to Carl. And for the record, that's never bothered me. It's the fact that she's overstepping her boundaries and interfering in our relationship. 

I'll tell you a story. I made a friend on the internet from California, who was coming to my hometown for an internship. Anyway, her and Carl met. And since Carl lives in the nearest city, her and I made plans to visit Carl and his brother for the weekend. Everything was okay with the boys. So, this happens over the course of the summer. Well, one weekend, while Carl was at work, their mother came over. Anyway, she made big exaggerations about how we were basically living there (it was only once or twice a month) and that we need to start paying rent (or something, I don't remember much, I was seething the entire time, biting my tongue). She kicks us out. And my friend and I go to a mutual friend's house to get away. 

Okay, so there's that. She's overstepped her bounds countless times. There was one time where she complained about me getting her sons sick because I was putting my toothbrush where their's were. Okay, I'll give her that. Sure, except that neither of them were sick. I stopped putting my toothbrush there for my own sake of not having to deal with that anymore. Another incident: I'm lactose intolerant and only drink organic milk. So, I always bring my own milk (sometimes I accidentally leave it there, but it doesn't entirely matter, because it doesn't go bad as fast as other milks). Usually, I get back to be able to use more of it and eventually throw it away. She complains that I'm basically living there because of this. 

I'm going to get to my last straw now. Carl's brakes are acting funny and his father is a mechanic. So, we go over to their house with our food (because Carl hasn't eaten all day) and let his dad fix the brakes. For the first half hour I'm there, she's talking to Carl, complaining about me like I'm not even there. I don't want to get involved, so I bite my tongue. Now, you might say ""Why didn't he stand up for you?"" He *does*. *She* never listens. **EVER**. She just continues on her high horse and just keeps going. Eventually, I gave Carl the rest of my food because I was so nauseated I couldn't eat anymore. Then, not even five minutes after she's done with that conversation, she shows me a baby picture *and* ask me which one is Carl. What? Really? You're going to act all nice to me like you weren't just bitching about me?

I know a lot of you might say, ""OP, you need to speak up!"" I know. But I haven't because I have absolutely nothing productive to say to her. I know if I say something, I'm just going to go on a rampage. So, I bite my tongue and don't say anything at all. 

Now, the last and final straw (for me). I'm at my house and I get a text message. It's Carl. He says that she is accusing him of seeing other people. Apparently, she got on his call log history and found a number she didn't know. They were two calls. He didn't answer because he didn't know who it was. And they never left a message. This woman (his mother) *pays* $1.99 to get the name of the person who called the wrong number! He's never even known anyone by this name! Who does that? First of all, it's his business. Second of all, shouldn't she be happy if he was seeing other people? She hates me and constantly complains about me. 

Anyway, that's pretty much it for me. I want to know what my boyfriend can do short of moving out and cutting all ties (he can't right now due to other reasons). The only solution I can come up with is Carl and his brother move out of the house and into an apartment that's not controlled by their ridiculous mother. 

So, what should I do? How should I react when she does this type of stuff again? How can I help my boyfriend?

**TL;DR** Boyfriend's mother is becoming a monster-in-law and I can't stand it. She constantly oversteps her boundaries in our relationship and tears me down constantly. I don't know what to do, what to tell my boyfriend, or even how to react anymore. I'm pretty much done with her.

16cyce,4,2013-01-10,To my first love,emzmurcko,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/16cyce/to_my_first_love/,"D,

So I’ve had some time to gather my thoughts. I was wanting to talk to you when you got back, because while you were gone I had time to think about everything. This was before you had called me.

 I was thinking about how you don’t make me feel good. I always felt like I was putting so much effort into everything and you couldn’t give a fuck. I loved you, and cared for you a lot for like almost six months. I can’t ever say I was in love with you though, because before I got the chance you pulled that first bullshit on me with the manic episode at my house and I could never actually trust you fully again. Granted, I have trust issues... but I was attached to you at the very least. Which was mostly my fault for letting it happen, partially your fault for fostering it, but kinda no one’s fault because I think it was somewhat out of our control and pretty much bound to occur. 

I knew you didn’t feel the same way about me. I knew you never loved me the same way I loved you. Always. But I ignored it, because you were comfortable, even though the thought fucking hurt. And as much as all of my friends and family thought you were a scumbag, told me not to waste another tear on you, that I’m better than you, I always protested. I would tell them you cared about me as they rolled their eyes, but dutifully listened. I made a fool of myself, every time I would call the same round of people after you did something to make me cry. Then they would all come over and we’d get fucked up on whatever substances people brought and the girls would declare that none of us needed men anymore.  The guys would tell me I was too great of a catch, you didn’t deserve me. “They don’t know our relationship,” I’d always think to myself.

Then something would happen, you’d come over, we’d have sex, the cycle would start again. I let it happen. Even though it wore me the fuck out. People noticed. My grades this semester were the worst they’ve ever been. I missed the most amount of classes, ever, because I was so unable to focus. I was more anxious and depressed then I was since the last time I was in the hospital. I kept trying to snap myself out of it, force myself to get my shit together, and it just wasn’t happening. I’d been on an upward swing, so it was frustrating. I knew in my mind that the only thing that had changed in my life was the fact that I’d been in a new relationship. But I ignored that rational fact as well. 

The last night we saw each other, you dumped all this news on me that you were going travelling, I wasn’t going to see you for weeks, etc etc. That was during my vacation, and I guess that showed that you weren’t taking me into consideration, or making me a priority in your life. Not to mention the fact that you were going to see J, and obviously hook up with her. But we weren’t boyfriend and girlfriend, and while you were gone I hooked up a few times too. B, S, a new guy who leads the T's on NYE. I wanted to prove to myself I’m fine without you, too. Also in the back of my mind was the fact that you said you were planning on moving this summer. I honestly was skeptical as to whether or not you would actually follow through, but either way, there was no way I was going with you, and if we kept on this way I would have just been delaying the pain of saying goodbye while getting more and more attached as time passed.

You called me Thursday morning, I thought you were going to suggest plans for the day. We’d left on a pretty good note, I thought it might be nice to see you. Instead you told me that you’d gotten back together with your ex-girlfriend who lives in another country. What. The. Fuck. Are you fucking serious? I am shocked. I cannot believe, even after everything, that you could do something like that to me. The words felt physical. After everything I’d done for you, put myself out there, let you fuck with me for so long, you come at me like THAT? D, you knew you were stringing me along this whole time, and you really just don’t give a fuck. I let you know how deeply I cared for you, how sincerely I wanted you to be happy. And you seriously just gave me the finger in return. Don’t try to tell me that you care about me now, or ever, because no decent human being does that to another. Not to mention the fact that you decided to be a coward and tell me over the phone JUST LIKE THE LAST TIME. I asked you if you had anything else you wanted to say and barely whispered, “Sorry?” You should be ashamed of yourself. I don’t surround myself with people who have a negative attitude and are so uncaring. You have treated me with such disrespect and insensitivity since I’ve known you, and I’ve just put up with it, because of my own fucked up head and insecurities. But I’m better than that. I guess I should have wised up the first things fucked up between us, but I’m a person in a state of constant denial.  You really fucked up things up between us with that phone call. I’m not gonna say I’d have a different reaction if you’d manned up and told me in person, or at least worded it a little more tactfully, but at least I’d respect you for it and we maybe we could’ve talked again sometime.

You hurt me extremely deeply, but I’ve made a conscious decision to bounce back. I refuse going to fuck up my last semester in college, I just got an amazing internship, I just turned 21, I have friends and family who love me, and there are plenty more guys out there who are interested in me. I always get what I want when I set my mind to it. And I certainly don’t need to be wasting any more time and energy on a person who doesn’t even show me respect or reciprocate effort. I definitely deserve someone who is crazy about me, and would choose me over anyone else.  That’s not you. 

We are not friends, D. We were never friends. And together, we discovered we are not meant to be a couple. We are lovers. We are only meant to be lovers. That’s all I want from you, all I wanted. I don’t want to make it sound like we never had any good times; we shared a lot and I don’t regret the fun we had. I learned a lot about myself from being with you, and I can appreciate that. 

I honestly wish you the best. Good luck finding a new job, and seriously take the time you have off now to work on yourself. Don’t just fuck around, be productive. I know it’s scary to think about when you’ve been on autopilot for so long (not to mention how cliché it sounds) but really take a look at who you are now, and what you want to be. Do work to better yourself. Continue with your professional mental health help, it’s going to be really important for you in the long run. Think about what I’ve said, I hope it makes you understand—not just know—that there are other people in the world, with feelings. Not just you. Learn from this. Maybe next time you won’t fuck up so badly.

16cvmw,3,2013-01-10,My ex and I share the same friend group... I don't think I can handle seeing him so much...,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/16cvmw/my_ex_and_i_share_the_same_friend_group_i_dont/,"I [20f] met him [21m] over a year ago. We started as friends, became friends with benefits, and by last summer it had become so much more than that. We both claimed we didn't want a relationship but that's what it turned into. There was no fighting it. He became my best friend and the person I felt the closest to.

And it was wonderful. I'd always cheated on boyfriends before but this time I was so content to only be with him. I actually felt myself falling in love.

But at one point things started going wrong. Basically it was a series of stupid insecurities, distrust, and suspicions of him seeing other girls (he had cheated on his previous girlfriend with me). In fact, he had lied to me about this same ex-girlfriend spending an entire afternoon in his room. He was bailing on me almost every single night for his friends (and her). I was feeling so lonely and sad all of the time, and I convinced myself that breaking up with him would somehow improve my life. So I did.

For the next few weeks my heartache got the better of me and I wound up sleeping with him. A few times. Those mornings-after were terrible, so awkward and loveless, that I knew it would never be like it was. The last time he asked me to come over, I politely declined. That's when we stopped talking completely.

This was almost two months ago.

The problem is that we've always shared the same group of close knit friends. Since we broke up, I see him everywhere. Every weekend I'm dreading the prospect of him walking through the door. The second he arrives I feel my smile fade and this sadness descends and sucks out all of my energy.

He acts like I don't exist. I'll say hello and he'll look at me then turn away. We were all walking to a concert and I asked him about an internship he had applied for. He just walked away and started chatting it up with some other girl. He'll leave the party and walk right past me without even a ""bye"".

It's breaking my heart. I miss our friendship and it's so exhausting to see him constantly dangled in front of me but so far out of reach. I don't feel any progress at all getting over him. The constant crying is actually painful. I've never run out of tears before.

But I can't avoid him. I would never see my friends if I evaded every party I knew he'd be at. Tonight I'm supposed to go see all of my friends that I haven't hung out with in over a month. But I know he'll be there. So I'm at home sobbing typing this and just dreading having to go there and hold back tears the entire time.

I don't know what to do. I'm still in love with him and to sit in the same room as him and be completely ignored... but I love my friends even more.

I guess this ended up just being a rant but any words of advice/comfort? Right now I'm trying to muster the courage to go to this apartment but right now I'd rather stay at home crying.

Maybe I do deserve to just be ignored. It makes more sense to feel isolated *outside* of a relationship rather than in one... right?"

I am currently on my second internship with a company. I have been with them since the beginning of last summer so about 8 months. It was a summer internship which turned into part time when I went back to school.

The thing is that Im not really happy working here. It has nothing to do with the people but just with the type of work Im doing. I don't find it challenging and its very boring for me. Its a manufacturing position which turned into working with quality department.I go in and the only thing I think about is leaving that place. The last internship I had I absolutely loved and I left it to try a new company. 

Saying that I dont see myself working full time with this company when I graduate. I do all my work and I am told that I do great work but Im pretty much there in order to get some extra cash while Im at a school. I could go my last semester without the extra cash though. 

So what are your suggestions? Should I quit? I dont have any other jobs lined up when I graduate so Im just kinda worried that if I quit I wont find anything. I general Im just unsure what the future will hold for me. I guess this is normal. So what advice would you guys have for me in my particular situation."
16cqvu,11,2013-01-10,Looking for resume advice for internships given my situation as an older CS transfer student with little experience.,KagedFC,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/16cqvu/looking_for_resume_advice_for_internships_given/,"I'm 25, and I transferred to my current school about a year ago (UC Santa Cruz) from a community college as a non-CS major.  When I got here, I decided to switch to CS, and the switch added two additional quarters to the expected two years to graduate (two years plus two quarters total).  What this means is that I'm cramming a lot of complex concepts in a short period of time, and it seems like I have very little time to comfortably complete outside projects.  However I decided to begin working on a simple iPhone game with a few friends that we are hoping to release by the end of the school year in June.

Unlike a lot of younger CS students, I actually have a lot of other kinds of work experience under my belt.  I worked at Wells Fargo for a year, a recording studio for four years prior to moving to go to UCSC.  My questions are:

-Should I put on my resume the fact that I'm working on an iOS game, but that it's not yet submitted to the app store?

-Should I list the languages that I know given the fact that I have no previous work experience?

-Should I provide school projects or courses that are relevant to computer science?  For instance I wrote a simple compiler in C for a simple C-like language, an AI simulation of simple creatures on a three-dimensional plane, etc.  (I would put these on GitHub but they are assignments that other students could potentially search for...)

I won't have trouble filling the page, I just want to know what I should emphasize and what I shouldn't.  School takes up a huge portion of my time since I finished me GEs at community college, so the workload for me has been pretty intense.  Any guidance would be appreciated!

**TL;DR** Started after transferring to 4-year institution, little programming experience, spending most time cramming a lot of schoolwork rather than outside projects, what should I emphasize on resume for internships

My family is breaking apart, my stepdad and brother recently left us, and my mom and other brother are moving to California soon. Moving usually isnt an issue, ive done it ~13 times, but this is the first time ive ever had real friends, and have really been happy. After talking with my mom, she said she would be okay if i stayed here if I can find a job to support myself. I was already looking at trying to get an internship, now i just need one that pays.

I like to think of myself as smart, and i will be very hardworking. I know some Java (because of clubs) but am very willing to learn anything you need me to. I can provide my own transportation, and can/will drop some clubs from my busy schedule to make as much room as the job requires. If need be, i can get out of school an hour and forty-five minutes earlier for commute times, and more work time. 

I dont need to be payed much, i dont live an extravagant lifestyle, and dont mind the field. I would prefer an engineering based internship, but im not one to be picky right now.

Bottom line, i need you guys. I am willing and capable to learn to preform any job you need me to do.

Please PM me if you, or someone you know has any available positions.

16g711,1,2013-01-12,[22/M]Confused about a situation with an ex [21/F] over the recent...chapter of my life. (Forgive the life story),[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/16g711/22mconfused_about_a_situation_with_an_ex_21f_over/,"**Background:** I've known this girl since we were sophomores in high school. We shared a friendship that grew into mutual attraction before we started dating for a majority of that year. We broke it off (rather roughly) our junior year as she suddenly transferred to a boarding school across the state. Our SENIOR year, she moved back, we went to prom, graduated, got back together, etc. etc. Needless to say, by this point, we had developed quite an attachment to each other.

**Fast Forward to college**. It was obvious things wouldn't work out as distance became an issue. We grew apart. It didn't take long before I broke things off rather abruptly. As close as we were, it would be quite a while before I felt comfortable with opening up to another girl. With her, however, within a month, she was seeing another guy. It ended up being about a year and a half before we really talked again. 

**Summer 2011**, she calls me, tells me she's in town for a few days and wants to get together to catch up. I agree. She stands me up on the night before her flight leaves and I don't hear from her.

**Christmas 2011**, she sends me a text explaining how depressed she'd become since starting college and how I was the only person she felt she could trust/turn to about it. I respond, briefly asking what was going on. No response.

**Spring 2012**, I have an emergency surgery. She somehow finds out about it through the magic of social networks and texts me out of the blue in a panic to see how I was doing.

**Summer 2012**, She calls again. She's in town for another couple of days, wants to hang out before she starts an internship elsewhere. No response from any of my attempts to get in touch with her and she leaves a message letting me know that she left a few days early to travel with her sister but she'd be back occasionally throughout the summer. Nope. Spent the remainder of it in Texas.

By the middle of the summer I'm pretty much done with whatever she's doing and I delete her number and unfriend her on facebook. While this was once a person I cared for deeply, I simply couldn't deal with the emotional fallout from whatever mind games she was playing.

This past semester in school, I really let go of it all with her. I actually hit it off with someone new right towards the end of the semester, which was a huge deal for me. As luck would have it, though, about a week before Christmas I get a random call on my cell phone from a number I certainly don't recognize. Surprise. Once again, she shows up out of the blue, informing me that she's in town indefinitely and that she ""absolutely needs to see my face"". At this point, whatever offers she brings to the table are met purely with cynicism. I literally don't want to deal with her outside of simply clarifying what the fuck she's doing ignoring me if she wants to see me so bad. For six days, we go through this pathetic cycle of making plans and her backing out at the last minute with these embarrassing excuses that I don't want to hear anymore mainly because I know her best friend and they'd been hanging out since she'd been in town. 

On one of the last instances of her contacting ME I decide to call her out on it, seeing as how this was an extremely rare opportunity. She apologizes knowing how pathetic it must seem. She admits she's scared. She knew it would be hard but she didn't expect it to play out like it did. 

Last thing I heard from her. After New Years I find out that she literally went out with some local friends and got absolutely wasted while club hopping. 

Why is she doing this? Is she trying to drag me along? Are there residual feelings involved? I don't mean to sound selfish but I've been dealing with this fallout for far too long. All I want at this point is clarity.

**TL;DR**
Ex constantly wants to meet up. Ignores/blows off every single time for 2-3 years. Tells me she's scared. What does she keep contacting me for if this is the only outcome?"

[I have a good friend who is a VP at your firm . They blamed the entire Financial crisis on ' poor people who could not afford their mortgages ' they said this was pretty much he opinion among the investment banks .  How do you feel about what happened to Greece and Goldmans hand in it ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16eu5v/iama_goldman_sachs_investment_banker_amaa/c7vfvp7?context=5)|That is not true. Opinion is very much split within the investment banks and there is no right or wrong answer. I personally don't believe at all that the crisis was caused by 'poor people' - and I don't like that sort of categorization of people in the first place. There are perhaps 15/20 different institutions you could blame for the crisis, there's no way of isolating individuals.  I'm not sure what exactly you think GS's hand in the Greece affair was. Of course it's a sad story and I feel remorseful - I recently donated £50,000 at a charity ball to help rebuild one of the islands which has almost been burned to the ground. But ultimately Greece employed GS at the time because they wanted to fudge their finances  so as to meet entry requirements for the Euro i.e. the greek government was knowingly employing GS to help perform an extremely risky task - GS didn't force anything upon them. If the experiment explodes 10 years later (as it did), should GS really be the party to blame?

Even if your average is 60% or 61%, that's enough to get you past the minimum requirements and through to interviews. After that it's up to you - they'll take someone with a good business mind and strong communications skills irrespective of whether they average 60 or 78 or 92.  I disagree with him. My job is extremely rewarding and i wouldn't swap it for any other industry at the moment.

And if not, to what extent does regulatory capture play a role?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16eu5v/iama_goldman_sachs_investment_banker_amaa/c7vdb1n?context=5)|Regulatory capture is a seriously problem not just in banking e.g. also in the energy business. How do you reduce it? It won't happen unless the public demand it, as everyone with power tends to benefit from it and so they won't make meaningful steps to change anything, i.e. its a win win situation for government and business. However it needs more than just 'occupy movements' but rather i am talking the mass voter population.

16fuet,1,2013-01-12,Phone call from potential employer was super confusing. ,throwawaythebelt,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/16fuet/phone_call_from_potential_employer_was_super/,"OK, yesterday at about 5 after 5 I get a phone call unexpectedly for a job I applied for about 10 days ago. The first thing the woman did was gush about my experience and how great my resume was. Then she took time to  pick my brain about various things I had done.  It was a great boost to my ego as up to this point I have had no luck since my graduation on December 8th. My only interview was for an unpaid internship that maybe they want to make a job and pay me for it, but they are not sure yet. That one was a real let down as the whole conversation both people took pages of notes on my ideas, but there was no promise of paid employment at the end. 


Well after she was done with that line of thinking, she went over the job and stated that normally the position pays low 30’s but considering my experience, they were willing to go as high as 38/39. She then said she knew this was not enough considering my background and experience   and she wanted to make sure I was aware of the compensation before I came in. Then she asked me about my plans and where I saw myself. I told her that I would finish my MBA while working full-time and hopefully get to a point in my career where I can be comfortable enough in my finances to help my two kids with college. 


Now, right here it got a little awkward as she started telling me that they wanted to make me a happy employee and they wanted to make sure I would stay at least a little while as they were investing in me with their training and such. She made sure to tell me there were not a lot of title changes at the office and that it may be difficult to climb the ladder there. She said that she wished she could fast-forward two years as they have some need for an MBA for some kind of other position and that would be just the right salary for me. 


We then closed with her telling me to take time to think it over and call her on Monday to set a time to meet if it seems agreeable. She thanked me and told me how great I was again and we hung up. 
The whole conversation had an awkward vibe to it. It is weird when someone offers you a position but then says there is no real mobility to it and then goes on at length about how great a candidate you are. I just do not know how to take that. The money is less than I would want as I wanted at least 45, but I do not want to turn it down and lose my chance. 
Last evening I added her on LinkedIn and thanked her as well as letting her know I would call to set a meeting to further discuss salary and such next week. I figured maybe they could come up to 45k.


The thing is I just got an email from another position I had applied for and then a follow-up email with a login for a Predictive Index® survey. THEREFORE, they were interested enough in me to do that. The pay on that position is a bunch more. I still have quite a few applications out there and I do not want to jump on this offer and then be thrown something better. 
I would feel like a douche if I take this job and then something better comes a week or two after and then I burn my bridges with them by leaving. 




What should I do?


What is the take on that whole phone conversation? 



Is the other company interested in me if they went ahead and sent out a Predictive Index® survey login?

16ft51,16,2013-01-12,Can I safely let myself fall into debt in order to make it through school and graduate with a BSc in Mechanical Engineering?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/16ft51/can_i_safely_let_myself_fall_into_debt_in_order/,"I am half way through my 2nd year of a 5 year program. I have maxed out my student loans every semester so far. In other words, I am in:

4 semesters x $7000 = $28000

worth of debt in the form of student loans. I have owned a credit card for many years now and have never missed a payment and never carried over any balance.

Here's my problem: Due to the program I am in, I have to work as an intern about once a year (for a 4 month period). Due to this, I'll likely have made too much money to be eligible for loans in my province. So I'll receive $0 in loans from now on. But considering the costs of living, I will not have made up the difference. 

So I'm thinking that the only way to make it through these next two and a half years is the following:

-Live from penny to penny  
-Try and use my available credit intelligently to its limits while making sure I make the minimum monthly payments

Or are there any other recommendations?

PS: I was just approved for a second credit card with a limit of $7500. I'd like to restate that I currently have absolutely no debt other than student loans, and I'm fairly certain that I have a decent credit score."
16fc6i,4,2013-01-12,Any help for IS majors?,[deleted],SFSU,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFSU/comments/16fc6i/any_help_for_is_majors/,"So, I am an ISYS major with an expected graduation date in June 2013. Unfortunately, I am a transfer student, and a lot of my courses didn't transfer over, so instead of having five classes left this semester, I will have seven. That makes my goal of graduating this semester a little harder. I haven't taken any IS courses yet, except for IS 350.

So, my questions for you awesome peeps are:

1) Should I push myself and take seven classes this semester, or just take it easy and take five classes this semester, and get a full time job and take the rest after work next semester?

2) I've been looking for internships, but so far, haven't found any. Any tips on what I can do? Like I said, I haven't taken all the courses yet, but I know that one of my strongest skills is my ability to grasp and pick up knowledge fast. How can I use that to land an IS based internship?"

16fai1,3,2013-01-12,Finally got an accnt and my first post is to ask y'all for help. I got fired today...here's my story...,[deleted],misc,https://www.reddit.com/r/misc/comments/16fai1/finally_got_an_accnt_and_my_first_post_is_to_ask/,"I'm a lurker too. Been a redditor for a little over a year now and ironically, just last night I upgraded to a ""pro"" account on the iPhone app to support reddit and thought today I would join. 

Go figure that my first post is a, well, downer post. I got fired from my first job. I know it sounds like an ever-day Joe Shmoe woe, but this one was particularly tough, I wanted to share it and get your guys’ help. If you don’t want to read the story, skip to the end – I totally understand, heh.

So here is my story and here is why I wanted to post it on Reddit.

My name is Justine. I'm 24 and I graduated in 2011 from Ringling College of Art and Design as part of their first digital filmmaking class. I don’t know if y’all know of Ringling, but it isn't cheap. I was frankly surprised my parents allowed me to go there, knowing I'd come out with over 70k in loans, but they had tremendous faith in me and my talent/passion for filmmaking. The four years I spent there were tough - I was new to film (having never touched a record button in my life) but I made it through. Bumps and bruises to be had, but I survived. But I managed and even snagged a few awards along the way.

Here was the hard part though. We were the first graduating class and that meant we were pretty much on our own – no alumni of the major, no real connections, nothing. So I had to get really creative and no small amount ambitious. The looming graduation brought to light two options that I had: either go back to suburban Pennsylvania and live with my folks, or find a way to get to Los Angeles and pursue my (yes it sounds cheesy) dream. Of COURSE I was doing the latter.

Another problem (as it is with a lot of recent grads) - I had no money. I knew that, my parents knew that, my friends even my teachers knew that. So after talking with some people I came up with the idea of posting an ad on Craigslist with the title ""will trade work for room and board"" - I thank my lucky stars for ""the Sams"" as I call them. A family of two (widower and his daughter) living in northern Los Angeles took me in and said I could stay with them until I found work in exchange for light cooking, cleaning and nanny-ing.

As many if not all of you know, job hunting isn't easy...especially in the entertainment industry. I got a part-time job at a retail store and took up working as a PA on more student films, did some free jobs and got one or two paying jobs. Despite that, it's hard being at home all the time - your head gets to you (mine in particular is ruthless). I fought really hard to get to LA but even that didn't prevent me for wanting to give up. My student loans had gone in to effect and my parents were paying them, but I knew that wasn't going to last long as they are close to retirement. If I didn't have a full time job by the summer (one year from when I moved out there) I was to go home and pretty much work as a waitress because I would be cornered by the loans/debt. Needless to say those were some of the darkest days of my life. The lack of being productive and independent made me feel like a failure. I got in to shit that was not good, drama that was way outta the realm of a reality TV show among other things. I'll spare you all the details.

I kept going, and finally got an internship in Feb 2012 (yes AFTER school). The internship was only $8 an hour but it was a hell of a lot better than nothing!! 

Three months of that and then I got my big break, or at least what I thought was my big break. A dear friend of mine suggested me for a position she was temping in at BIG Cable Network (i.e. premium channels) as an executive’s assistant. After lots of phone calls and an interview or two, I was hired. This was unusual because one, I didn’t have any agency experience and two, I was very nearly fresh out of college. But I had a bang-up resume and some wonderful references. It was a job I felt I was made for.

Little did I know, haha.

I don't now if many of you have ever worked for an executive in the film/entertainment industry but let me tell you. It's hard. Check out this website: http://hollywoodassistants.tumblr.com/ or watch ""The Devil Wears Prada"". Granted, my story as an executive assistant wasn't AS bad as Anne Hathaway's but my fear and paranoia was EXACTLY the same.

I worked my ass off, making a few mistakes, but I was just out of college and this was my first job. Everyone told me my boss knew that and mistakes happen so I should just keep working hard.

I would ask for feedback, talk to his previous assistant for advice, talk to OTHER assistants, I asked HR to find a class I could take on being the best assistant, I even tried to train myself on the particular department I worked for (as it wasn’t my forte). Shit hit the fan a few times (but nothing that was major, or so I had been told…this was my first job, so I needed other people’s insight), but I did everything in my power to fix it. I thought things had been going smoothly....he really hadn't indicated they weren't. And like I said, I was paranoid as shit so I double and triple checked things.

Then today, two days after he got back from a HUGE conference in Vegas that I organized down to a ""T""...he calls me in and there is HR.

Boom. Fired.

Dunno how I didn't fall to pieces in that meeting today, but I didn't. I calmly packed my things with the help of a coworker, sent a goodbye email and made it to the elevator where ALL my friends/coworkers had gathered to wait for me. The faucets turned on and I bawled.

I need your help. If you guys know of anything in Los Angeles, openings, websites, even advice ...please email respond or email me at sigyn.astira@gmail.com (or if any of y’all are interested, I have a website you can check out, just ask). I have one month's rent left before I'm looking at having to head back to PA.

And I really don't want to do that. So please…anything helps :-/

16in7j,5,2013-01-13,"I can no longer afford college, 23 years old, seeking advice on what's best to do next...",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/16in7j/i_can_no_longer_afford_college_23_years_old/,"I should have graduated May 2012, but I took time off when my mom passed away from cancer when I was 21. She was the reason why I was able to receive Pell Grants to go to school, as well. Now I can no longer get those grants. Dad is unable to pay. As Bursar charges have prevented me from enrolling in future classes, I'm left with the question of what to do next.

At 23, does it make sense to get a job, save up, and finish the remaining (~two) years I have left? Or would it make better practical sense to go ahead and try to pursue a career, despite not having finished? Further, is it possible to get a job that could benefit me later professionally while paying off school in the short-term? My degree focused on political/geopolitical affairs.

I was an active campus leader elected to run some of the largest organizations at my university (at a larger state school), and I also had many national opportunities to network (where various organizations would pay for my travel to many activist-related political/geopolitical events). I've also had 11 internships since the age of 16; ranging from every level of government (local to federal) as well as private-sector.
 
So what do you think: stay and work it off, or go out and try to join the workforce? That would probably entail me moving from the South to Washington, DC. 

Any tips you might have are much appreciated. "

I've always tossed and turned at night. My dad was always yelling at my sister and I, and my mom. He was that way until I entered high school. I wrote my first suicidal note during class in 2nd grade, I was lonely and didn't know how to interact with other children. I did have a friend on my street, she was very manipulative. The coach of my PE class hated me. He always thought I was cheating and lying because I couldn't look him in the eyes and because I was always off to the side being nervous. He'd make me sit out sometimes, and I wouldnt even know what I did wrong. He loved my sis. He told my sis ""You're nothing like your sister.""


When we moved from TX to PA, things just got worse. I started 4th grade there. I was bullied for being chubby and for being different, because I said ya'll. I'd get pushed a lot, and kicked, and one time got beaten up at the bus stop. I had a friend that wouldn't even acknowledge my existence in school... and even be a part of the bullying, but she'd be nice to me once we got off the bus to go home. I had another friend. I remember walking with her hand in hand down the hall and everybody started calling us lesbians right there and started laughing at us. I had to ask what it was because I didnt even know what a lesbian was. The bullying kinda tore our friendship apart. I just decided to be alone.


This girl would bully me and then say ""Geez, why are you always crying?"" I remember the day I got fed up for being bullied because I was chubby, and threw my uneaten lunch away. I descended into anorexia. Some kids caught on and told the nurse. The nurse told the teacher and my teacher said that if I didn't eat, he'd take my recess away, but it didnt make any difference to me, I had nobody to play with. Id usually just sit on top of the highest place in the jungle gym and watch everybody else live their lives, lives that I was not allowed to be a part of. Alone.

**Middle School**

Still lonely, but I had a good friend at lunch. Was never able to hang out with her after school because her mom was strict about visitors and didn't let her outside the house. I didn't have much energy, and depression made it hard to concentrate. Teachers would stop in the middle of their lecture and pull me out of class to scold me outside for not paying attention.  I wouldnt want to go to school, sometimes Id drink a bunch of salt water and make myself throw up so that I could feign illness and stay home.

When we moved to FL, I had one teacher scream at me in front of the entire class because my folder wasn't organized the way he wanted it to be. (They were all looking at me, remembering how embarassing it was, I've started crying while writing this. I've always tried to not draw any attention to myself, yet theres been so many instances where the whole class had their eyes on me, like ""Why are you here? You aren't like us."") This was the same teacher that didn't let me go to the nurse when my fingers were sprained and got mad at me because I hadnt written much by the end of class.


Things were slightly better in FL. I still had bullies, but I had some friends. I met my (now) husband when I was 13, we met online. With my poor self esteem, I could've ended up with an asshole. That's not him. He's a wonderful person and he's helped me a lot... He's very sweet and understanding, the best kind of influence. 

**High School**

It seems like every time a teacher scolded me, even if it was something really minor, I'd start crying. I don't know why. And everybody would be looking at me again. I still cry really easily when someone is scolding or criticizing me and I can't stop it. But I've always been hard on myself too. I had a solo in high school chorus. The first time I performed it in front of people, I went back to the dressing room and started sobbing. ""That was terrible, I hate myself."" 


I got a concussion one day, it took 2 weeks to get better, and when we got an MRI, they discovered that I had arachnoid cysts on my brain. Many times they wont have symptoms, but I have a really big one in the front. It may contribute to my depression.

High school was not so bad... only that the damage done during the previous grades was still there. I was really paranoid and on the edge. Really shy and awkward. I felt like every whisper was about me, and some of them were, but... not to the extent that I felt. Still stayed up late, tossing and turning, afraid about tomorrow.

**College**

I finally got over my anorexia towards the end of high school, and at the beginning of community college, I was starting to feel pretty good. I was still pretty awkward, but still


Things kinda went downhill when I entered university and got my first ""job."" I majored in Web Design. I was working with my mom at the UPS store and this guy comes in and says he needs help with his website. I was so naive, I really wish I had said no...


My fiance had started fire academy back where he lived. With this ""job"" I thought, ""wow this is a great opportunity for me to do my part too and start getting experience in my field."" Not so. 


I slowly started to realize something was fishy. ""Something isn't right, or am I going crazy?"" First he told me he'd pay me. Then he said he'd get me school credit instead of paying me, he told me an internship was required for my degree and then I found out that it wasn't. Then he said he'd pay me again. He'd play mind games.  He'd make you feel like crap. He'd lie. He'd make you feel like everything was your fault.


My facebook was set on private and I only add people I know. I never added him. I swear he could somehow see my posts though. It was like... a couple times, he brought up something up that I said the night before on FB. I had started complaining about this whole thing on facebook because I wanted advice. This is hard to explain correctly, but he'd even use  some of the same wording as I did, using emphasis one a specific part that pissed him off, but at the same time, be so vague about it that you aren't quite sure that you know that he knows... it makes you feel like you're going crazy. I didnt get on facebook on a company computer, my computer scan didnt pick up any spyware, my facebook was private. ""How could you possibly know that?"" I didnt feel safe inside my own head, you know?


He always seemed like he was about to boil over and go off on us at any second. He felt dangerous, I was afraid... I thought he could kill me at any time. I wanted to believe that what I was doing was a good thing though...


 I saw him lie to someone about his name and then he made some excuse to me that, at the time, I believed. Pay time came around, and he kept making excuses and putting it off. ""I'll have it tomorrow"" I asked the other woman there if she'd gotten paid, she said no. We swapped numbers. When he heard us doing this, he flipped out. He called me and told me not to believe anything she says because she was bipolar and unstable.


It turns out my so-called ""boss"" was a scam artist. He hops from city to city, running from the police, changing his name. Before I quit I discovered that someone even made a blog dedicated to all the people he scammed. For a while he was using the website that ""I"" helped make to scam other people. I felt like I couldn't live with myself. I was afraid to quit because he was so violent. After my summer class was over, Id sit in the empty art building alone, sobbing and hyperventilating. I couldn't talk to my fiance about this because I could never get in touch with him while he was in fire academy. He was going through his own hell at the time.


I finally got the courage and made up some excuse like ""working full time and going to college full time was too stressful and I keep having panic attacks. Im going to go start seeing somebody about my stress.""


I called the other lady that  worked for him that was suspicious about him too and she said she was going to stay and that theyd worked out some agreement. I told her what I knew about him and told her to get out of there. I asked her to not tell him that I gave her this info. She tried to fight for both of us, and it was a kind gesture, but she wound up dragging me into it. I just wanted to cut my losses and  walk away from it. They'd both be calling me with their arguments about each other. 


I was shaking violently out of fear when I called her and told her that she didnt have to stand up for me, that I appreciated what she was doing, but I just wanted it to end. But now he wouldnt stop calling me, and it lasted for months. As quiet and submissive I am, even I got tired of it and yelled at him. He finally stopped calling after that. I had to change my ringtone, because every time it went off it made me remember everything and gave me panic attacks. This is kinda funny looking back at it, but I had been playing pokemon on my DS, and and NPC called me in game and had the same name as him, I wound up flinging my DS because I had this overwhelming and irrational feeling of dread that he was trying to contact me again. 


I had a few short jobs/internships after that. For the rest of my college career I was pushing through burn out, depression, stress, paranoia. I started skipping many of my classes and doing all my work at home. I also always felt like group partners were trying to take advantage of me.. and there is a ring of truth to that because I had a lot of lazy partners, but perhaps I should not have viewed them as harshly I did my ""boss."" 

I was lonely without my fiance, we spend 9 years apart while visiting maybe once or twice a year. Towards the end of college, I was contemplating suicide daily... and had to do everything in my power to stop myself. I remember sitting in the bathroom with the door locked with a razor blade in hand. ""Do it. Do it!"" Id sit there for a long time trying to convince myself not to.

**Now**
After graduating, I got married to the love of my life and moved in with him, but it's been months and I can't find a job. I feel so worthless. I feel like I don't belong in this world, like I can't fit in anywhere. I've sent out a lot of e-mail applications for jobs in the area and remote jobs. I try to write my e-mails as professionally as I can, and I keep improving my design and programming skills while I'm waiting for a reply from SOMEBODY. Even if someone were to get back to me, suppose they want an interview? I still stutter and shake and mumble, not to mention I look like a 16 year old... nobody is ever going to take me seriously. Even when I was booking hotel rooms for our honeymoon, they were all ""What are you like 12?"" I'm twenty three, TWENTY THREEEEEEE! 

My husband gets upset because I seem unhappy sometimes, its only because I feel like I can't pull my own weight no matter how hard I try to. He makes me very happy, but I worry about my ability to make him feel happy and fulfilled, and he in turn... sees this and becomes upset because Im unhappy, and then Im all ""Oh no ;__; hes not happy with me."" I know its stupid...


**TL;DR : My long sob story, you dont have to read it if you dont want to, I feel a little better after writing it down. I didnt have it as hard as some other people... I'm just so... weak.**"

What are your favorite recipes?"
16hnmd,1,2013-01-13,How do you guys handle all the bitchy girls at bars/clubs? *rant*,[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/16hnmd/how_do_you_guys_handle_all_the_bitchy_girls_at/,"What really turns me off to nightgame is how uptight and bitchy 90% of the girls are (especially as the night progresses). Even the ugly ones carry themselves as if they're fucking royalty. Even when they're actually receptive after you open them, they're usually really boring to talk to and make absolutely no effort to enliven the conversation (eg. I'll make a ridiculous sarcastic joke, she'll laugh, pause for 5 seconds, then give me some serious super-boring response or wait for me to say something else).

I know this sounds cocky, but I know that I'm a decently attractive guy and have pretty high standards when it comes to both looks AND personality (I like fun girls who don't take themselves too seriously). When girls are boring to talk to or make no effort to enhance the conversation, it's a turn-off to me and I don't feel compelled to keep making the effort to converse with them so I naturally stop talking (at which point they'll usually leave). Girls act completely different at bars/clubs than, say, a house party or a day-time social event. It's as if they expect you to do all the talking, provide all the entertainment, initiate everything, etc. 

How do you guys do it? When a girl doesn't really seem that into it do you keep at it or just eject from the set? It seems that in order to be successful, you have to be very aggressive and keep at it. The problem is, personally that goes completely against my style. The way I have it internalized in my brain is that if she's not even willing to make a certain minimal amount of effort to make this work, then she obviously doesn't want it enough and it's her loss. (I don't view myself as some sort of amazing prize or anything, but I definitely don't put a random cute girl on a pedestal.)

**the rest of this post is just ranting from tonight so you can stop reading here**

---

I'm seriously considering abandoning nightgame altogether. I hate to sound misogynist, but it's almost unreal how practically every girl gradually morphs into a cunt as the night progresses. Some examples from just tonight (sorry I feel like ranting):

* As I'm leaving the bathroom I see a girl fixing her hair and whatnot in front of a mirror. I say ""you look nice"" as I'm walking by. She gives me this death stare as if I just tried to date-rape her. In hindsight I wish I had said ""too bad you're a bitch"" but I'm too nice of a guy to say that...
* Countless times I'd approach a girl and she'd respond ""I don't know you"" (with a ""fuck-off"" expression on her face). O RLY? No fucking shit. This kind of response pisses me off. If you're so anti-social and/or uninterested in meeting strangers, then don't go out to a crowded bar/club. Actually, I don't even have a problem with you coming here, but how hard is it to give a polite rejection like ""sorry not interested""? Fuck's sakes.
* I had one of the most unpleasant conversations of my life tonight. Basically she was one of the most insecure losers I've ever met in my life and has absolutely no ability to detect sarcasm. To summarize, she just started working in IT consulting at Ernst &amp; Young and I'm a student applying for summer internships who's still figuring out what to do with my life. I was asking her questions related to her job to see whether or not it might be a good fit for me. When she said they had to travel a lot and I said that I'd only be willing to travel to cool cities and not the middle of nowhere, she legitimately got pissed and angrily said ""noooo you can't be that picky"" (as though I was a god-damn employee. wtf?). I tell her that I'm not set on consulting and could work in X industry and still get to stay in the city. She's like ""fine do that"" in a bitchy tone. Then I sarcastically say ""so basically, fuck consulting"" (keep in mind I'm smiling the whole time while she's legit getting pissed). Next thing you know, she's pathetically attempting to impress me with her job (all with a dead serious expression on her face). She even tells me that she's making $90k/year. At this point I'm just thinking ""wow this girl is so fucking insecure, she must hate her life"". I ask her (still smiling) ""are you trying to impress me?"" She gets pissed, says ""whatever, I don't even care what you think"", and walks off. 

I don't think I'll be applying for IT consulting at Ernst &amp; Young if a retarded life-sucking blonde like her can get a job there.

* On my walk home, the streets are empty except me and some Asian girl who's right behind me. At first I'm thinking ""whatever, it's 5am, she's not that hot, I don't want to scare her"". But then I'm like fuck it I'll be social/friendly, turn around, and say ""Good night?"" She's like ""meh"" without making eye contact so I turn back around and tell her my night was the same without looking at her. Then I stop at my apartment building and she happens to be in the exact same building (my building is small so this is rare). We're both kind of like ""woa"" and I ask ""are you a student here too?"" as I'm fumbling for me keys. She ignores me, unlocks the front door, and walks ahead of me. We both walk to our apartments and neither of us say ""bye"" or anything else.

Anyways I guess my point is, girls are cunts on Friday/Saturday nights. I understand that they get hit on all the time at bars/clubs, but this inflates their egos to the points where it's ridiculous and makes me want to turn gay. Seriously questioning the whole concept of nightgame. Doesn't even seem worth it unless you're shooting the shit with your buddies. /rant"

A couple months ago my company announced it would be moving its HQ to the parent companies location--I declined the invitation to move with the company and am now looking to break into finance.

Been together with my gf for 4 years (2008), this was during her last year of high school and my second. 
Been living together for 2 of theese. From september of 2010 when she had a year off from school and we both started college (she social studies and me economics).
Ever since we moved (to a new city, but only 1 hour drive/train away from original home town) we have had some problems. We were both young, moving directly from our parents house. 
In the beginning of the move, she went home like every weekend because she was home-sick. After like like ½ year she started going 2-3 times a month and after another ½ year she started being here (here as in our apartment). In our fourth semester that is currently on its last week, she had an internship in our old town and came here like 2-3 weekends a month. 
The thing is that we are now experience some problem...
We have never had that... ""big"" fight, but problems keep nagging at us. She feels that every time we argue, it stacks up on her consience and pile up. And I feel that since this she has been kinda ""depressed"", not so much, but she has not been very glad. And this has led to lack of, well, love from her side. Somthing I feel is kind of important. I have kind of a bad temper, but that I am aware of and working on. But when I try to be happy and show some love (hugs and kisses and things like that) i barley get any answer because of her light depression state. 
Today, we had a talk (which we havnt done, not about this anyways). 
We both agreed that we are kinda of unhappy with the current solution and something need to be done. We talked and the reason for all this we think is that we moved away ***from*** something, not *to* something. Well, we moved to study and living together. And also a reason is that we were young and we have evolved alot since we moved away from home, she because of her studies, and me because i left home (where I lived with a single dad, who was **always** right, and *never* wrong). Anyways, I think that a important part of why we are not as happy as we used to be, is because we dont do anything together. By that I mean on our spare time, exept cooking and eating and such.

What I ask you, reddit, is do you have any tips on how I can make this better for the both of us? 
Will try to answer questions if you have any. 

*EDIT Forgot the tl;dr:
Having problems with gf, want some help. We have maybe got stuck in bad habits. 
Pretty much sums it up..."

Overall, I like working there and I feel like I'm doing a really good job. 


The only problem is that my boss is making work a nightmare. She has enormous mood swings, is unbelievably high-strung and seems to make it her mission to take out her stress on others- namely, me. 


Before I started working there, it was the receptionist; a young, incredibly sweet and smart woman who everyone loves. My boss would order her around (although the receptionist was outside of her department), yell at her in front of everyone for the tiniest offense, and generally make her feel stupid and inadequate. 


Now that I'm the 'new girl', her attentions have turned to me. She seems to go out of her way to find things to criticize/take issue with. When she does, she is insulting, degrading, condescending, and makes it a point to do all this loudly enough so everyone can hear. She berates me for close to a half hour for a tiny mistake that is easily fixed. 


Because I help out multiple departments with different assignments, I know that I can't be doing as bad a job as she makes it seem. I get tons of compliments and appreciation from everyone else, including the company president. But my boss is sucking away my self-confidence and making me feel incompetent and stupid.


I'm not sure how to handle it- I want to keep my job, but I don't want to be treated this way anymore. I'm scared to make a scene/call her out on it because I fear that I may lose my job. Help!"

I am currently pursuing a M.S. in computer engineering and I have to choose between two 6 month internships. Neither are 'big' name companies so I will leave them anonymous .

**Company A**

* High speed fiber optics telecom hardware
* I would be working in the FPGA division
* Had 6 month internship there 2 years ago (was a great experience)
* ^ Worked in the board-level design division (schematic and layout work)
* Would end up making less money (10-20% less than Company B)
* ~60 employees (seems likely to hire after graduation)

**Company B**

* Board-level controllers for power electronics (*schematic only*)
* Start up company ~10 employees (seems *unlikely* to hire after graduation)
* I would be one of 2-3 engineers (i.e. lots of experience doing schematic digital design)
* Also be involved with the business aspect of starting a company
* Would end up making more money than Company A

**My personal thoughts**

* I am divided between chip-level (FPGA) and board-level (digital) design.
* I already have PCB design on my resume, should I expand to include FPGA (Company A)?
* If I do FPGA then it is at a company that I worked at before - bad? FPGA and PCB at the same company?
* If I do the Company B board-level position I will be doing something I've already done (doesn't expand resume) but it is at a start up where I would get tons of experience.
* I have a desire to start a company at some point in my life but that may just be fanciful thinking.
* Company A has a long commute ~1.25 hours, Company B is within walking distance.


**TL/DR : A - worked there before (not showing variety of employers?), expands resume OR B - start-up, lots of experience, doesn't expand resume just makes one skill stronger.**

Ask me any questions to help clarify. Thanks so much!"

16jowa,2,2013-01-14,6 months later still no use.,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/16jowa/6_months_later_still_no_use/,"First post here, I just feel I need to get some things off my chest. So we ended back at the end of july and now to this day things still do not seem to be any better. We had planned to move in together but I felt I wasn't ready yet and decided that she should go to college as it would be a great oppertunity for her and her career, however this would result in us going long distance to which after a week or two resulted in us ending.

Since then I have felt miserable. What makes things worse is that this year I am doing an internship with my Father's company which I despise and dread going into every single morning. The fact that it is not a college year were I would see my friends often is making this really really difficult .I also have no job or money as this internship (like many) is unpaid. So rarely do I have the money to go out, socialise, and meet new people.

For a while things did seem to get better. I joined MMA which I do three times a week and also jog 5km five and sometimes seven days a week. However for the past few weeks I've started to have dreams about her again and now it feels like im stuck back to were I was in the beginning. I also mistakenly went on to her friends facebook the other day to which I saw the usual dreaded pictures of her having an awesome time.

She has family were I live to which she came home to visit  a few weeks back. She did email me to my surprise however the email stated that she had been home and the reason she didn't want to see me was because she felt that I would have been a distraction from seeing her family and friends( i don't understand this part really). She then stated that we could meet up on a specific day and that if we didn't then it wasn't meant to be. Of course we didn't because I was busy at the time and just replied ""sorry im busy!"" giving the I dont give a shit approach which I regret now even though it may have been the best thing to do.

Anyways thats my story. 6 months later and still feel like shit. I just d'ont know what to do anymore especially not having money to go out and doing something i hate 5 days a week. Im sorry for the rant guys just felt like I needed to get this all out. Any advice or anything would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading and apologies in advance if my English was bad. "

DeviantArt has the mature filter on by default so I'll paste it the first one here

**GOHAN THE PAIGE BOY**

Another day, another internship. It was DC, bitches, and Gohan valued himself a yup and gup courier, so he knew he wouldn't be on his knees to face that twink, Trunks. ""What a liberal!"" Gohan thought. After all, Trunks's dad wasn't even FROM Earth and probably believed in some pagan bs where they dance around fires and slap their dicks on wood like beaver buddies. Gohan went to the door, looked at the knob, turned the knob, then opened the door and looked inside. The room was really boring, probably the site of some slutty library bitches, maybe get a handjob or two and screw somebody, who knows. ""Fuck bitches, get money!"" was Gohan's motto. Gohan just knew he had to get it, get it done and get HIM done.

Gohan strolled down the halls of Congress and high fived every conservative politician he saw. Go Gohan, you little slut! Rudy Giuliani even gave him a quick nod. Both of them were so happy, because they had just finished a major bill to show that America was founded on Christian values, and Gohan was a good Christian. Well, mostly. ;)

He made his way to John McCain's side of the aisle. In-between watching Nick Arcade reruns on his iPod Touch (which wasn't a very good video player and Gohan should have really returned it) Gohan was editing the bio for McCain on conservapedia, so he knew all about how handsome our John was in his early years. Honestly though he was still a little bit hot and Gohan saw the potential. He resisted.

It was only until McCain had to vote against the socialist health care bill that Gohan couldn't contain himself. Dickitude! McCain thought back to his Feingold days. He knew a bipartisan effort was necessary to get that thing through. And man, he really wanted to get it through. When he finished his final point, Gohan saw his own pubes going gold with Christian Saiyan horniness. All the middlin biddlin bits in his butt were going going going.

Right then and there, Gohan powered up to Super Saiyan 2, flew to John McCain and took him to an empty congressional office. ""What's goin' on here?!"" John asked. ""Mr. McCain, take this!"" Gohan reached out his pocket and gave McCain a Senzu bean. Suddenly McCain was just as hot as he was in his 20s. ""Oh my stars!"" John said in shock. ""I could run for president with these kind of looks!"" Gohan agreed. ""I'd vote for you,"" he said.

""You know, a good ol' boy like you could really use a favor..."" John seductively took of Gohan's gi. (oooooohhhh yeah) Gohan knew Piccolo would be proud, because he just finished reaching Super Saiyan 2 and he was strong enough to defeat even Osama Bin Laden. Brown things never turned Gohan on though even though Gohan owned the brown Android G1 becaus his iPod Touch sucked so much. McCain was white like an angel with a dick like Zeus. Gohan's body was rock hard, hot, and oiled with sweat. John's body was just as hot as it was when he was stuck in that gook box in 'nam. They were ready to FUCK!

Gohan's dick launched an all out war on John's sweet ass. First Gohan felt the rim of John's anus against his tip, then it slid in no problem, inch by inch until Gohan was balls deep inside McCain's bubble butt. ""Oh boy, it's in!"" shouted McCain. ""I've never felt anything like this."" Yeah you didn't John you hot little bitch, bc Gohan's dick is a 11.5 inch Saiyan monster. Gohan grabbed McCain's nice thighs with his hands and held him up in the air, fucking and fucking his ass as McCain screamed with glory each time. John's big American balls slapped against Gohan's dick with each thrust. Gohan dug his face into John's back, smearing the sweat all over his face, biting and sucking and licking each muscle, then he grabbed McCain's hard American cock and fap fap fapped McCain.

High up in the air McCain kept screaming. ""Oh my god! Oh my god!"" Yeah, you KNOW Gohan liked it, seein all of that massive Saiyan dick up in that deep conservative ass.

""Say I own your ass! Say it! Say it bitch!""

""AHHHH! GOHAN, YOU OWN MY ASS!""

""Now where should my cum be, you hot little slut?""

""D... DEEP IN MY AAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!""

It all exploded inside McCain. The hot, gold Saiyan cum filled his ass, gushed out of his anus and ran all down Gohan's dick. He knew all of the hot conservative boys in Congress were watching them fuck up in the air and he knew they couldn't get enough of it. They even opened their mouths to catch the cum drops falling out of John's ass. His fantasy finally happened: Gohan's cum had filled a true conservative's ass. He couldn't be happier. He felt like a hero. He WAS a hero.

[Do Microsoft employees use Internet Explorer and Bing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7w8yh8?context=5)|Yes most of them do. The practice is called dogfooding - all about using our own products to make them better. However there are no rules against using other browsers or search engines.
[Since you were at his residence I am assuming you have met the man.  He seems like a really nice guy.  Is he as nice as i think he is in real life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7w904e?context=5)|Yes this was at an intern event. He was quite down to earth and humble despite what he had achieved. All the interns mobbed him and started a barrage of questions so I couldn't get to ask any questions unfortunately. Although I have tremendous respect for Steve Jobs, I think Bill will leave a better legacy due to his charitable work in the past decade and going into the future.
[Didn't the last guy who did something like this get fired? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7w8syl?context=5)|Well this is like a dinner conversation with friends. I am not about to reveal corporate secrets!
[How many gates does he have?  I'd imagine that he does have a lot of gates...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7waza5?context=5)|Haha funny have an upvote! There was one large gate that I personally saw. His wife and two kids would add up to 3 more ...
[When an application on my computer crashes and I send an error report, where does it go?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7wdia4?context=5)|Jokes apart (no there is no hidden recycle bin) - its all collected as telemetry. We look at the most frequent crashes for OS issues and first party apps and fix them via Windows update. Third party developers can sign up to see issues and fix them as part of their update process:  [Link to msdn.microsoft.com](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb513641%28VS.85%29.aspx)
[I first want to say thank you to everyone there for putting backwards compatibility in win7. Many, many hours of joyous nostalgia were had.  Onto my question; as a die-hard custom tower builder who enjoys having the desktop function and who doesn't own any devices that would require the metro function (and honestly won't need to buy any\), what real incentives are there for me to upgrade my OS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7w9f1n?context=5)|There are a number of under the hood changes - lower memory consumption, faster boot times, faster resume, Defender is now built-in. WinRT apps are going to be fluid and beautiful for consumption and I think the start screen in Win8 is more productive that the start menu. For a desktop user these may not be compelling reasons to upgrade, but for a new PC I think the Win8 choice is obvious given that it is fully compatible with Windows 7.
[Dat boot time. It's like waking my computer up from sleep mode. Used to be like ""alright, I'll go get a snack and come back in a few minutes to see if it's done"".  Great job on Win 8.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7wc1g2?context=5)|Thank you. You made my day. We do so many little things to improve the system and it all adds up. Its humbling to see it have a positive impact.
[Is it really a positive impact, though?  Because now Lepryy doesn't have time to grab a snack.  Who's gonna grab that snack for him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7wdnvh?context=5)|Haha we can never keep everyone happy. One man's Bob is another man's Clippy. Also, wait for the Microsoft Personal Robot 2020. 
[I've heard rumors, that he has chips for his family, that have information stored on them, so when they go into a room the climate control automatically adjusts the temparature to the prefered temp. saven on those chips ?!  Does he have a lot of computers or screens around his house ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7w9635?context=5)|His garage was full of exotic cars - though I couldnt make out the models as it was a fleeting glimpse. I also caught a glimpse of the theater it was pretty huge. Yes there are automatic temperate controls and those that detect a person and adjusts settings and such. The event was held out in his lawns front of the house with a gorgeous view of Lake Washington. I don't recall seeing too many screens though.
[Are you provided with modern phones/tablets as an employee?  Does anyone carry iPhones around the office?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7wapho?context=5)|Yes every employee received a Surface RT tablet and a Windows Phone 8 (2 year contract not paid for). No devices are banned and no one is forced to use Microsoft products. However employees with iPhones do get friendly jibes for being so Apple-y :).
[Did you take a dump at Bill Gate's house?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7w9tlu?context=5)|Ok signed back in to answer this question. Unfortunately I did not. Now that I think about it I should have :(. I am somewhat like George (from Seinfeld) in regards to this. [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYVBRQ7t46g)
[Are there any things most people dont know about the job? Biggest perks for working at microsoft? How do you feel about Apple?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7wa6df?context=5)|Free soda, free coffee, free public transportation, you decide your hours, free to work on weekends/nights, great benefits. You do spend time on support and there is lot more design, discussions and documentation work - it is certainly not like Swordfish with a lone guy in a dark room typing out thousands of lines of code a day :).  biggest perk: ability to ship code that millions of people use. Its a humbling experience, that's what motivates me to get up in the morning and go to work. Apple is a great company and the source of the renaissance in the consumer tech industry. Focus is back on apps and devices, whereas for a time there it looked like Web was winning and Google wsas on its way to being the undisputed winner. Big big change and remarkable that all this happened in a matter of few years.
[I get what you're saying, but ""They let you work on nights and weekends"" doesn't exactly sound like a perk.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7wcc91?context=5)|Pretty much deciding your own hours as long as you attend meetings and get work done on time is what I was getting at. The world is at your fingertips - who knows the next brilliant idea may just be from a engineer thinking in his office on a quiet Sunday afternoon :). The biggest perk of working a bit on the weekend is no email or distractions - its so peaceful!
[Do the progress bars in Windows really work, or do they just semi-randomly fill up to give the user an impression that something is happening?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7wb7vk?context=5)|[Link to xkcd.com](http://xkcd.com/612/)
[What was your reaction when you first saw an iPhone years ago?  What was the reaction of your colleagues? Did you think ""we have to catch up to that""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7w9eky?context=5)|To be frank my reaction was the same as Steve Ballmer - for both iPhone and iPad. I thought they were overpriced products that most poeple won't buy - that it would remain a niche for the high end of the market. Boy was I wrong! But then it was apparent in a couple years that we have to catch up to that. I have great respect for Steve Jobs and Apple - they have shown the way, it is up to each one of us in the consumer tech industry to take that vision forward and give it wings.
[Does Bill Gates use an iPad?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7w8t88?context=5)|I am pretty confident he uses a Surface :). I recall watching an interview where he did say that he and his family use Microsoft products predominantly. 
[What is your opinion regarding GNU/Linux?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7w950v?context=5)|Great example of what can be achieved by collaborative software development that is spread geographically. Tremendous engineering. Linus Torvalds is one of my heroes. As is Dave Cutler. Respect!
[Your opinion on Windows 8? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7w9hpp?context=5)|Best version of Windows yet no doubt. Give it a honest try yourself and do not go by opinions on the Web. It lays the foundation for where the OS will go next.
[What percentage of your working hours do you spend browsing the Internet and being generally unproductive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7w92x6?context=5)|I'd say and hour or two on most days - sometimes more sometimes less - mostly reddit and browsing tech sites. Its not like there isn't work to do - each product at Microsoft is used by millions of people - and there are always things to fix or improve. So its a big responsibility but I think that letting off the steam occasionally is necessary for a developer. I'd say roughly I end up putting in around 60 hours a week most weeks including the goofing around.
[What can you say about Valves criticism on Win 8?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7w96bh?context=5)|I think steam runs better on Windows 8. They should make a Win8 version instead of cribbing :). How awesome would this be: [Link to thenextweb.com](http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2011/09/19/if-steam-was-remade-for-windows-8/)
[Have you ever put any secrets/Easter egg in an OS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7wboi0?context=5)|Nope. There is less tolerance for that kind of thing these days in all software companies. 
[What did bill smell like? Is it true that he's immortal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7wawfh?context=5)|If immortality is invented, I am sure he will be one of the first humans who get to decide whether they want it :).
[Why oh why did you guys decide to move the shutdown button? Now it's just effort to go into the settings sidebar to turn off.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7wajjp?context=5)|Shutdown has become a less frequent activity. Most laptops and desktops sleep when inactive. I agree its something new to learn even for a long time user. [Link to windows.microsoft.com](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/how-shut-down-turn-off-pc)
[Proof?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7w91qj?context=5)|Someone above claimed some guy got fired. I could send a morphed photo of my ID to a mod. Never done an AMA before so not sure about the mechanics.
[As  a 16 year old looking to become a programmer or some other job in the IT field, what kind of stuff do you reccomend I do before and during college to prepare myself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7wb83y?context=5)|Write and read code. Read good books on software development - there are threads on proggit for this. Keep brushing up on basics - data structures, algorithms. Know things inside out always know what a line of code would do and be inquisitive on how things work under the hood. Work hard while having fun and you will do well.
[*Read good books on software development.*  What is your favorite book on software development?  Thanks for the AMA btw.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7wdf7v?context=5)|Writing Solid Code, Programming Pearls, The C Programming Language, Algorithm Design (Kleinberg, Tardos) and many more. 
[Company lingo and slang terms are powerful agents to the unitiated...but we ARE initiated, aren't we megamsft?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7wde0z?context=5)|Members of the league of shadows ...
[Do you hear people say ""I will Bing it?"" ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7wblad?context=5)|Frequently in hallways and meetings :). Not outside Microsoft (at least yet :)).
[Yep. ""Eating your own dogfood"" is an industry term for using your own product.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7wahjn?context=5)|Well we its all the same folks who get around the industry. If you look at it I would say a sizeable portion of Google and Faceook would be ex-Microsoft employees. There is company specific lingo too - I believe there is a mini handbook of Microsoft slang terms hosted on the Intranet for the uninitiated :).
[OP is Bill Gates and he's drunk. We will get nothing any value from this. All PR and done poorly.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7w9b1x?context=5)|Haha I wish. My proof then would have a video being the badass jumping over a chair!
[Explain the problems with Vista.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7w9r31?context=5)|Its old and outdated! Upgrade to Windows 8 :). But honestly the issue there was mostly OEM's not releasing new drivers for their devices in time.

16jd22,37,2013-01-14,I'm a mediocre programmer. Do I have any chance of getting a summer internship in the SF Bay Area?,boringx100,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/16jd22/im_a_mediocre_programmer_do_i_have_any_chance_of/,"I'm finishing my final semester in community college before transferring to a 4 year university. I'm looking for a summer internship in the Bay Area. Nothing particularly fancy either. I just want some relevant industry experience. 

I've taken Calculus 1-3, Linear Algebra, about to take Discrete Mathematics, Java Programming, various C++ courses including OOP and Data Structures, an intro UNIX/Linux course, and Assembly Language Programming is planned for the upcoming semester. 

I'll be honest, I'm extremely mediocre at programming. Although I've worked hard in all my courses, my programming skills have been improving very very slowly. If I'm stuck with a problem, I'll spend a lot of time working out a solution and coming pretty close to it. But I always need help from a professor or intelligent colleague to get it 100%.  

In an academic setting I do alright with the programming labs, but I've looked at some standard interview questions and don't quite understand how to work with complicated brain twisters or algorithmic problems. I guess my programming knowledge is still weak.

I'm not sure what to do. I really want an internship, but I don't want to waste anybody's time by applying and then completely bombing the interview. Application deadlines are coming up in the next few months so I need to think of something. Any insight would be appreciated."
16j5s7,4,2013-01-13,I took a job right out of college last summer.  I am planning on relocating for personal reasons this spring. How should I handle the job search?,banitsa,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/16j5s7/i_took_a_job_right_out_of_college_last_summer_i/,"I took a software developer job at a prominent west coast tech company last summer. My girlfriend and I have been long distance since then.  We had hoped that she would be accepted into grad school in the city I am living in but that school turned her down.  It looks like she is very likely to be accepted into my Midwestern alma mater, however.  Because of this I am planning on relocating back there after I have been in my current position for a full year.

I had a strong academic record and strong experience with internships and research positions so when I was looking for jobs coming out of school I was in fairly high demand.  I imagine that leaving my current job after just a year may raise some red flags for recruiters and hiring managers though.


How should I handle the inevitable questions about why I am job searching again?  Should I acknowledge my situation in the cover letters I send with my resume?  For the recruiters out there, how much would you hold my situation against me looking for a new job?

And don't worry, I do plan to leave my current job gracefully and with proper notice."

The issue is that this internship is non-paid and I will have to eventually relocate. The type of web development I'm doing is something I'm good at but not what I want to be apart of for numerous reasons, one being the money. There is also the fact that they will expect 20-40hrs each week, which for unpaid web development is unheard of (Albeit an entry level programmer, I do know what I'm doing). I have one final interview this week. How should I approach this. Is it better to politely say I'm not interested or should I just go through with the interview.

I recently discovered data analysis and I want to go be a data scientist so I'm thinking about applying for PhD programs, so this stats class is important.  However, I'm not completely committed to it, and by GPA isn't that great.  I'm just starting the second semester of grad school.

So, what I'm asking is, is how did you know you definitely wanted to get a PhD, and what kinds of decisions did you have to make?  What sacrifices did you make, and what was your persuading factor in getting deciding to get your doctorate?

Also, I'm uncertain about whether or not I should take this class.  I'm interviewing for an amazing internship and the class is part of a software development subtrack at my school, and could be the difference between getting an offer after the internship or not.  What do you think?

Thank you all so much.  This is a great subreddit and I try to contribute more than I ask.  I really love seeing so many people of all age and experience levels going into the field and sharing my passion.  "
16n3t0,2,2013-01-15,"I continue to smoke pot out of boredom and I think it caused my ""depression""",throwawayforch,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/16n3t0/i_continue_to_smoke_pot_out_of_boredom_and_i/,"I don't want to say i'm clinically depressed or anything, but the past 3-4 months have been a bummer for me. In July I started smoking maybe once or twice a week. Classes started back up in August and after going to class in the morning, then working 8 hours at night, it was nice to come home at 10pm and smoke a bowl and get a nice little buzz. It was the same as drinking 3-4 beers to me, but didn't take an hour to do.

My work ended in October (seasonal job) and I kept smoking every evening, 8pm and after. At some point in November I started smoking every night at 5pm, and then a little earlier. I never went to class or work high, I never drove high, I never put myself or anyone in any real danger. An eighth was $50 and since I packed small bowls, it would last me a month or two. Cheaper than beer.

I finished all my weed right before exams in December. I knew I needed to buckle down and since I would be going home to live with my parents for the break, I needed to just let go of it for the month. While I was home I went ~3 weeks without smoking and felt fine. I bought a half oz to bring back up to school. I had a good hookup back home so I got it cheap while I could. Anyways, i've been back at college for a little over a week and all I've done is smoke pot.

Since I live with my 3 roommates/friends, and we always hang out, we usually only go to other peoples' apartments for weekends/parties/etc, since everyone is so busy during the week. I live in a really rainy area too, so it's been keeping me inside which hasn't helped with the smoking. I realized I haven't hung out with any of my other friends since November. I don't know if it's all a mutual thing, or if they just don't care that they haven't seen me. 

So now i'm in a rut where I think my friends don't really like me anymore, and i've convinced myself that my dog doesn't even like me (which I know isn't true). When i'm not high, I think ""man I don't need to smoke, why not save it for special occasions"", but then once i'm home I get bored and spark up. After about an hour I start to feel bad about smoking. I get the idea that my roommates hate me and think of me as a junkie even though I know that's not really true. They smoke with me once or twice a week but not everyday. 

To make it all worse, I've still got feelings for my ex who I dumped almost two years ago, and my relationship with my current girlfriend has been on the decline for a while. I've probably forgotten a lot of details but i'll add them if comments spark ideas as to why I started writing this.

**Edit**: When I started smoking, I liked it because I got buzzed and giggly. I actually felt emotions, which wasn't all that common for me (example: I've had close people die and rather than crying and mourning, i've always been like ""wow that's sad...but it's life and it happens""). Now when I smoke I just get cloudy-minded. I can't enjoy Reddit because I can't focus enough to make it through a paragraph. Only other options in the apartment are Netflix and video games, which don't entertain me much longer. I love taking my dog for long walks on nice sunny days, but they're few and far between where I live. I really enjoy snowboarding but this season has sucked and hasn't given me many days on the mountain.

**tl;dr**: I first liked smoking because it brought the emotions and feelings out of me, but now I feel like it's sucked the life out of me.

 It's hard to not smoke weed when it's sitting right in front of me. I would have no problem not smoking if I ran out, because I would be able to justify not buying anymore. I can't quite bring myself to throw it out though. My life feels so dull. All of my close friends have girlfriends which makes them less available to hang out. My hobbies are all useless right now (snowboarding: weather sucks, motorcycle: it's too cold, cars: can't work on cars in an apt complex). I need new hobbies but nothing else even sounds interesting. I'm going crazy in my apartment.

With all that said, i'm still finishing up my Junior year at a university, 3.4 GPA, secured an awesome internship for the summer."
16mxx6,1,2013-01-15,"I'm such a fucking slackass, and I don't know how to fix it.",fucking_slackass,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/16mxx6/im_such_a_fucking_slackass_and_i_dont_know_how_to/," I'm 29 and I live with my GF who I plan on marrying. We argue quite a bit, most of it stemming from me not having a job. Now, I've had jobs, I've had multiple jobs at once. But, I hit a serious low in my life a few years ago (similar to this) and decided to go back to school (for film). My parents, being the supportive parents they are, agreed to help me. 

Here's a little backstory about me and my parents:

I am adopted. They got me when I was 2 months old and informed me of it as soon as I could comprehend what it meant. They've always supported me, even probably when they shouldn't have. I suppose since they couldn't have children I was more *special* to them because of it. They always bailed me out of trouble, and I was in quite a bit as a teenager. My dad was strict, always punished me (sometimes too much IMO) but my mom always compensated by letting me walk all over her. 

So when I decided to go back to school, they agreed to help me (financially) get set up in a new city and all that jazz. Well, months go by and I'm so busy (school, partying, trying to get laid) that I don't get a job. That was over 2 years ago.

Now I have less than a year of school left and I hate it. I hate going to these classes knowing how much I'm paying for them vs. how much I'm actually learning. I'm completely unmotivated to do anything but the bare minimum. I'm going into a field where networking is key and I haven't done near the amount of projects outside of class as everyone else. The thing that kills me is I'm GOOD. I was voted best in quarter for a script I wrote my first year. My videos have been featured in the demo reels for our entire film department. I love being creative. But lately, I just sit on my couch, and smoke pot. 

Now please don't go blaming the pot. I'm not blaming the pot. I agree that if I would say, wait until the evening to smoke that I may have a bit more motivation. But even when I don't have any, I just wake up, and walk around like a zombie. I've withdrawn from classes this quarter in an attempt to pursue a job and an internship, but I haven't made one move. My GF is sick of it to the point where I know she can't take it much longer. The only reason she's still here is b/c she actually loves me. But that's not even enough for me to put my heart into looking for a job. And YES, I love her. I don't ever want anyone else, she's it for me. That's not the problem. 

Also, I'm fat. When I came to the film school I weighed 215 lbs standing at 5'11"". I'm kinda big all over (not just in the gut) so 215 fits me pretty well. I now weigh 255 lbs. and I feel like shit. I know exercising would make me feel 1000x better but I'm keeping myself from doing it, and I don't know why. 

I just want to escape my own brain for a while, or stop time and sleep for a month. I just want to cry over all this for a whole day while the earth waits for me. I don't know what direction to take, or what the first step to getting back to being me is, and even if I did, I'd probably be to slack to take it. Someone help.

**TL;DR**  Pathetic 29yo spoiled single child can't find motivation to do anything for himself even if it means his relationship with his future wife falling apart and not getting a film degree with 9 months left.

16mxpr,322,2013-01-15,My 1 year experience from internship to full time job.,viceflow,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/16mxpr/my_1_year_experience_from_internship_to_full_time/,"So here's my story :

When I was 25 back in 2008 I decided to get a bachelor degree in Computer Science. At that time I was working as a Front Desk clerk for a resort here in Cancun. So I managed to convince my boss to let me study in the mornings and work on the evening. So basically I was in school through the morning and then to work.

Four years passed and its 2012. Got my bachelor degree and really wanted to leave the front desk job and start taking advantage from my degree. My main goal since I started university was to learn to code, and to be honest... I learned almost nothing .. lol... See when you study and work it gets pretty hard to even coupe with homework even worse when you only have one day off so I learn some bits of C++ and Java here and there enough to pass terms.

So as I was saying , its 2012 and I need to get a job on IT , I really didn't wanted to work at Help Desk fixing printers, I wanted to code and build software, the only problems was that most companies needed at least 3 year experience... fuck my life.So I made a huge decision and started to look for a internship somewhere in Cancun... I started to send emails to a few companies (to my surprise there's around 8 software companies down here) . 1 week later I got an email back from one of them, they ask me if I could come over for an Interview. Feeling nervous and dumb there I went.. lol I remember they ask me to do two exercises... the first one was to take any kind of string and reverse it.. without using functions...(they use Java) the other I don't remember cause I fail miserably on both... I got to nervous and couldn't think of a solution...  bummer. They said....thank you.. we will call you, ouch.

A month pass by and suddenly I got another email. Another company , .NET developers, 10 minutes from home(holy shit) for an internship. You see from the few things I was able to learn in university was C#. My final project was made in it so that help me a lot. Ok so , they ask me to do online test's for basic and some advance C# features + TSQL. I didn't fail miserably but got enough basic concepts to got me another interview. 

The interview goes pretty good, they like the fact that I speak English since most of their clients are from Canada and the US. They offer me an internship position for 6 months. After that time I have to take a certification test to see how much I learned, plus they gonna paid me(around 500USD a month). So I said.... fuck it lets do this. The only downside... the job was from 9am to 6pm... shit... what I'm gonna do with the front desk job?? I talked to my boss in the resort and told him I need to work in the evening shift. He was OK with it, on the internship place I convince them to let me work from 9 to 2pm even without pay, they agree and still pay me. For 4 months I spend all day working like literally ,I started the internship at 9am then rush out at 2pm and start at 3pm at the resort were I leave at 11pm. 

This was from Monday to Friday. So as you can imagine I started to feel miserably.

On the other hand... I was learning a lot.

Right away I get my hands on books , courses and videos on everything .NET.

They put me on a MVC4 project that was going to start from zero. The project leader was kind enough to go easy on me and started to explain everything... so there I was learning Entity Framework, MVC, Repositories, Moq,SCRUM  .... at some point my brain almost explode from all that information.

One day I talk to the wife and decided to leave the front desk job. This was like 4 months into the internship , I really wanted to get that certification. 

As you can imagine I pass the certification and land me the full time job.

Its been almost 1 year since I decided to do a complete change on my life. I think it was a good decision.

So far I been working with ASP, SQL server, MVC, Jquery, JavaScript, Unit Test,Reporting Services  and hope to get a new certification in a couple of months in HTML 5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

So , thank you learnprogamming cause some of the stuff I studied / study comes from here !

My sincere apologies for my broken English, my mother language is Spanish : P .

**TL; DR I went from a Front desk clerk to Developer in 4 years and how perseverance land me an internship in a software company** 

** EDIT **

Thank you all for taking the time to read my story. I feel very humble reading everything here.

In my experience at least with C#/.NET this things help me a lot :

[Plural Sight](http://www.pluralsight.com/training)
Lots of videos of pretty much anything related with .NET with examples.

[Code School](http://www.codeschool.com)
This help me to learn HTML5,CSS3, Jquery,JavaScript... and they have great courses on other topics(Ruby,Git)

[MSDN] (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/)
The oficcial .ne documentation. Everything is here.

[Code Project] (http://www.codeproject.com)
Good examples of how to do this and that project

[DotNet Curry](http://www.dotnetcurry.com/)
Nice blog with examples

[Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
Always a starting point if you feel lost through a project or how to do x task.

Like I said previously you are never to old to learn and apply something new. Life is funny on how the decisions that you make change everything. Something that I realize now that I'm close to 30 is that you need to plan ahead, don't plan for today but for tomorrow. Save money, invest in your development , that steam game can wait. 

The rewards will come sooner or later but it's up to you.

16mxdm,1,2013-01-15,Software engineering interns in CA: is overtime required by law?,suta120391,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/16mxdm/software_engineering_interns_in_ca_is_overtime/,"According to the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE), [California law requires that employers pay eligible employees overtime](http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/faq_overtime.htm). There is [an exemption](
http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Glossary.asp?Button1=E#employee%20in%20the%20computer%20software%20field) for employees in the computer software industry meeting a fairly narrowing set of criteria. These criteria have several exceptions, two of which are as follows:

&gt;* The employee is a trainee or employee in an entry-level position who is learning to become proficient in the theoretical and practical application of highly specialized information to computer systems analysis, programming, and software engineering.

&gt; * The employee is in a computer-related occupation but has not attained the level of skill and expertise necessary to work independently and without close supervision.

To me, this sounds very much like an intern. If that's the case, shouldn't employers be required to pay their interns overtime? We all know that startup culture -- if not the employers directly -- encourages employees to work more than 8 hours per day or 40 hours per week. Interns are no exception. 

I feel as though I must be mistaken given that this is the status quo, but the legal facts seem pretty clear. Does anyone know if I'm missing something?

To be clear, I'm not an intern (anymore), and I have no interest in pursuing legal action. I'd just like to understand what's going on here."
16mvux,8,2013-01-15,Tell us your story!,stiverino,entrylevel,https://www.reddit.com/r/entrylevel/comments/16mvux/tell_us_your_story/,"A little background about myself:

I graduated in 2009 with a BS in Communications.

After graduation, I worked for a radio station as a promotions assistant and struggled to find my niche in a competitive job market.  As money grew tight, I switched to part time at the radio station and worked full time at a restaurant.

After months of pounding CareerBuilder and Monster.com listings with little success, I was able to obtain a part-time internship with a legal services website in June of 2010.  I was working upwards of 60-70 hours per week, including my hours at the restaurant.

I never stopped pursuing a true career job.  With what little personal time I had remaining with my long work days, I would send out 1-2 applications a day, customizing my resume and writing a new cover letter to fit each job description as best as I could.

6 months went by with not as much as a nibble.

Finally, I decided to cast a wider net.  I knew the economic downturn in my area (rural New England) had really taken its toll on the availability of jobs for people my age.  I turned my attention out of state.

My first interview offer was with a large Electronic Medical Record (EMR) company in Wisconsin.  They flew me out (as they did many young college grads) and subjected me to a pretty rigorous interview process.  I ended up not getting the position, but was not discouraged.  I knew now that employment opportunities were out there, and I knew I had the chops to be considered.  The only thing left was learning how to close.

I continued applying to jobs all over the country and was eventually given an interview thanks to a referral from an old friend, this time with a medical software startup in Southern California.

Again, it was a rigorous interview process.  This time, I came in and tried to reflect an air of confidence (but not arrogance) with firm ideas about how I would not only fulfill their requirements, but exceed their expectations.

After the interview, I asked for the business cards of everyone I sat with and emailed them individually a day later, thanking them for the opportunity for the interview.

I was hired a week later.

I am now two years into my employment as an Implementation Specialist for the same startup medical software company."

Just been prescribed citalopram.,yeebles,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/16mutt/thinks_started_getting_real_help_just_been/,"Hi. I'll keep this short. But over the past year, life has been pretty bad for me. I suffered a bad break-up, I graduated to a life of unemployment, was a burden on my parents, moved away from all my friends and have been rejected from countless of job applications. Which has had a pretty negative effect on me. I mean I'm was not exactly a happy person before but it definitely made it worse.

After eventually emotionally breaking down to my mum (who is a counsellor) she suggested I book to go to my GP to seek help for depression. So I went there talked about my feelings and mood. She suggested CBT and  a 20mg does of citalopram. 

Now I'm reading all this stuff about citalopram and am worrying a bit about the side effects. To top it off, I'm starting to re-assess whether I really am depressed and is it just the situation leading to this terrible mood.

A few days after booking my appointment I started getting offers for interviews for internships and got asked out on a date and starting feeling better. When I went to my GP I was noticeably in a better mood than when I booked and now I fear maybe I was keyhole-ing myself into what I felt before.

So I've taken the first tablet. And now I'm fearing becoming dependent on them (as they seem to be difficult to get off). I see my GP again next week. Should I continue, at the risk that maybe I'm better than she thinks I am.

Any thoughts would be appreciated."

Lied about it, invited me out to NM to visit her at her summer internship, meet the guy (unknowingly at the time), and then dump me.  A month later I found out from my roommate of all people that she had cheated on me and that's why she dumped me but didn't have the heart to tell me.  The fucked up thing is I had started seeing this girl after she dumped me.  When my ex came back I fucked up and slept with her again before I found out she cheated on me.  Basically I ended up cheating on my new girlfriend and did the exact same thing my ex did to me.  Cheat.  Ever since then I've been back and forth with both girls.  Not being completely honest about how I felt I used the new girl as a crutch to move past my cheating ex.  

Now I've been only talking some to my new girl.  We weren't dating officially, but talking.  Last week we had sex for the first time in weeks.  I freaked out b/c I still had feelings for my ex.  I ended up calling my ex later that week and tried to get back with her.  However I had waited to late.  She didn't want to be with me and said she had moved on from us.  After much crying by me and talking I could see in her face that she really didn't want to be in a relationship with me.  It really hurt and I felt like a dumbass.  Now the most fucked up thing is we ended up having sex again.  After she said she regretted it b/c she didn't want to give me hope and lead me on to thinking we could be together.  

Even though I'm not dating the other girl, I did have sex with her last week.  Now I have to tell her the truth that I basically cheated on her again.  I can't believe I did the same thing that hurt me extremely by my ex and left me in a deep depression for months. 

I have to stop blaming other people for my situation.  I've hurt both of the girls and I have to stop.  I have a serious mental health problem.  I need to be comfortable with myself before I can be with anyone.  I'm going to tell Mary I cheated on her yesterday with my ex.  It's going to destroy her but I have to tell her.  If there's any chance of us working out, the truth has to be told.  I'm not sure how this will work out, but I have to move on.  "

I've managed to stay in touch with him in hopes of one day fulfilling his shoes.

Sample Questions:

How important is knowing the business behind forming a LLC and knowing legalities in the realm of producing?

Could you shed some light on financing and distribution?

How did you accumulate so many important filmmakers as friends, and then collaborate with them?

What are the steps in becoming a big time indie film producer?

That was a time when we both were in high school (she on her last year, and me on second last). After graduation she spent a year off and worked some and just took a break from school. When I graduated I worked for about 6 months and she began to study social studies (in another city, about 1 hour drive/train away). She commuted for about 2 months and after that we found an apartment in the new city. I still worked in the old city, but quit in the beginning of december and waited for school to begin (I started studying on the college on the spring). Since we moved here (now over 2 years ago) she has became more distant. In the beginning she felt home-sick and commuted home every weekend and after a year, she did it every other weekend. But after this time, when she had accepted that we had moved and we still had close to home and so fourth, she still was at the same distant.  
This last semester (since september of 12) she has had an internship in our old town (living at her mom's place) and have been coming here like 3 weekends a month. 
The problem: We dont have any spark it seems like. We both realize that this isnt working. She feel (we had a talk yesterday) that because of her education she has became more aware of surroundings and human life and have trouble figure out who *she* is. And all this distance have led to lack of intimacy (last time we had sex was at my birthday in the end of october, and before that in the middle of august) and she almost never initiate a hug or a kiss or just some cuddleing. 
During the talk last night we figured out that we have been stuck in doing nothing on the weekends, ever since she left for home in the beginning to now we dont *do* anything. Sure we have went to places together, but I mean on a more regularly basis. She feels that every time we have an argue (we have not yet had any really big fight where I have had to sleep on the couch or something like that) it piles up and psychologically stressful for her, she feels that the relationship (as it is now) only depletes her psyche.
Things that came up during the talk last night were things like 
* Moving apart to ""figure out ourselves""
This is the last week of her internship so she will be moving back here by the weekend probably. 
I really need some help/tips beacuse I don't know what I would do without this wonderful women I can call girlfriend!
**tl;dr** No spark between us, and she wonders if we need to move apart to figure out ourselves to be able to be back together again"

I've been reading probably an hour a day on average.  Got an awesome job from an unpaid internship which resulted in getting hired full time with an under market salary, but I got my foot in the door.  I know people look down on jobs like that, but with this internship/job and working my ass off I've managed to get past an interview with a technical recruiter.  I've been given the go ahead by HR and have an in-person interview coming up where we will likely discuss an app I coded for them last week.

I don't have a college degree, but if I'm lucky enough to land this job I'll have at least one free class a semester at a top 25 school in the US (the job position is with a cancer research crew at a university's cancer research facility), putting me in a great position for my career goals (heck the job sounds cool enough who knows, it has the potential to be the last company I work for!).

Moral of the story is you don't need a college degree to get a coding job.  It certainly helps and will possibly be required to move up in the field, but to get started and to land a job that will pay for school, it isn't required, plus if you work hard at something you have the opportunity to find out if you enjoy something before you've invested a few years and a couple thousand dollars.

Anyways, I haven't been offered the job yet, but I've certainly made it far enough to prove it's possible to get a high-end entry level job without going to college.

Best of luck to all of you!"

",a_baby_coyote,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/16mbnr/help_with_the_outside_life_aspect_of_getting_a/,"I'm not sure if this is a commonly asked question, but I feel I should ask it so I can work to better shape my future to my goals. 

A little about where I'm at now, I just returned to college after a long break, my degree focus being Computer Science with a focus on math, and it's possible I'll go for a dual major depending on how things pan out. 

I'm a sophomore with credits, and currently use a 40 hour a week job to pay for my school with tuition reimbursement. Not having to pay a cent towards my undergrad education is a nice benefit but as you can imagine it may not be my best option. 

My current goal is to finish my undergrad in as little time as possible given my circumstances (40 hour a week job), which may be 3 more years minimum. I'm 26 years old and I think due to my makeup more than my age, I'm not someone who can continually sacrifice sleep without paying a heavy penalty for it, so to have enough time to study, decreasing my class load might be necessary. 


So this is a question more about life around schooling rather than specifics into schooling itself. Free education is awesome but I feel I'm at a disadvantage because there's no way I can do an internship which I would think is very important, unless I'm able to convince my work to let me intern a project. There's also limited time to do self education which I really would like to spend time on. 

I hope I'm not being too verbose in getting to the point. I know to go the PhD route, I need to begin focus now on working towards that goal, through study and gaining knowledge as much as I can outside of school. 

So how does a 26 year old that can't live at home, and is entirely dependent upon a full time job, pursue a PhD? Is this a path only suited for the really young/go getters that never missed a beat with education, or is strong determination a little later in life enough? 

You don't even really have to answer my specific question, this can just be a discussion about living the PhD life. "

My sub-discipline is more on the science side of things, but is not unrelated to industry.  I've won a prestigious national award or two, published a few papers in top journals, and have done a couple of research internships, including at my dream company.  It was really devastating then when I was not offered really even the possibility of a job at the end of the summer with my dream company, despite a stellar review.  Part of this, I think, is because my field, at least in industry, is shrinking.  After that rejection, I thought, ""I have made a huge mistake"" in picking this field.


I've been going to career fairs and scouting my school's job board, and it seems like for every job related to my field, or even in hardware in general, there are two, three, or more software jobs.  I've been programming since I was young, I minored in CS in grad school so I have a formal background in data structures, algorithms, and so on, and I constantly am writing tools in various languages to help analyze all of the data I have taken while in grad school.


Still, I'm realistic in that my software experience is just not impressive, especially for someone looking for graduate-level jobs, and I'm afraid the Ph.D and all the good science work is irrelevant or, worse, harmful when looking for software jobs.  My ideal job would be writing low-level software to control hardware, analyzing data coming from sensors, or something else that has a hardware component.  How do I convince employers to give me a chance?

Experiences making this kind of jump would be very helpful."
16m3bd,1,2013-01-15,Reddit gamers: i'm a 21 year old teacher and i need your help. Together with a TL:DR story that explains the situation. ,[deleted],gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/16m3bd/reddit_gamers_im_a_21_year_old_teacher_and_i_need/,"Hello, and first of all thank you for taking the time reading this.

Let me first introduce myself. I'm Wolf_SF, a 21 year old teacher in mechanics, physics and technology. I have only been a teacher for one year, but that year was amazing.. But to make it complete, i need help: and i cannot do it alone

You see, i have alot of classes. One of the classes was not as ""normal"" at the others.
The pupils here come from a poor home. These children do not know what it is to be even a bit wealthy. They cannot afford school materials such as books( but these are rented to reduce the price),pens,... these are children that have 1 pen, and that's it. They aren't motivated to go to school because.. why should they? the teachers hate them because they aren't motivated, and they are hungry, they are bored,..

I have to teach them in technology. Being young i'm still pretty nervous standing before a group sometimes, but this class respects me. And i respect them.

Seeing how few they have, i gave them €500 ( i think that's about $600) of my own money so they could buy school materials of their own. You might be wondering:"" did they bought games, or shit?""

The answer, is no.

They all bought what they really needed, nothing more, nothing less.
A calculator, a 4 in 1 pen, a pencil, and many more..they were geared up, and they enjoyed school once again. Alot of teachers disliked me for that, but in the end i changed those pupils. They started to love school again.

Now,i often noticed that this class often goes to the computer lab. Right there i noticed they have one thing in common: gaming.

They do not have a high end PC, nor a playstation 3 or xbox 360. In fact, these children have only a computer at home which the school gave them because the computers were going to be trown away otherwise.

What games do they play? Halo 1 demo and SOF2 DH demo. I once held a LAN party with them, they are amazingly good in gaming as well :D ( and yes, they know teabagging )

Ever since i learned that, i have been trying to save money to buy games for them. Unfortunatly i am only an intern, and my contract was broken. From that moment i have been pretty deep shit myself, but that doesn't matter.

From day to day, i see those pupils again. They ask me when i'll come back, when we'll play again,..

I want to give them something, but i can't. And here's where my question comes up.

If you have any games that you don't play anymore, feel free to send them to me. I only have a steam account and a profile on origin. Since i live in Belgium, i'm not going to ask for shipping or transportation. I will distribute them and share them with the pupils once i have enough so they can all enjoy something new. I know the computers they have are able to run some games, but don't expect them to run Battlefield 3 or other high ended games on ultra.

I am joining all the PIF and giveaways that i can find to get a chance on winning games for them, i already have 1 ( ignite) :D

Anything goes, personally i don't know if these kids have a steam account on their own, i should check that when i see any of them again.


TL:DR I want to help poor kids have different games but i can't do it alone and i'm asking to share games you don't play or use.

Oh, and one last thing.

Thank you in advance for your help, **and please if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all**. If i notice this post gets downvoted and i'm getting hated on to oblivion i'm just going to delete it. Don't make this worse...

If you are interested, feel free to send me a PM. I should have a picture of the class somewhere, but after i had to move out of my appartement i can't remember (for now) where i put it. when i find it i will definatly add it.

Any other questions: feel free to ask them, but do it on a polite way. ( i do feel kind of guilty and nervous posting this)

Edit:right now i'm looking into some electronics, but i'm on my computer so i should be able to respond asap"
16lwsd,0,2013-01-15,Job interview or at least a chance at one at major software company,justme89,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/16lwsd/job_interview_or_at_least_a_chance_at_one_at/,"I may have a major job interview at a major software company. I have tried many times for jobs like this or at least internships. 

I am still a freshman pretty much. Now from my experience, I am kinda fed up with these ""wonder"" offers. I mean I get a lot of pretentious videos describing the ""awesome"" experience that you can have at their company. Now my reaction to that was extremely skeptical. I have worked a bit in the software development field and 
sometimes I get the feeling that these big software companies just send tons and tons of spam. They may have interesting opportunities but the crap that I have seen in their videos is amazing.

I mean I ran into a lot of problems where I work currently and there are a lot of challenges that normally I wouldn't even begin to imagine. But when I see these big software companies with their amazing promises and concepts I tend to laugh at them because they seem so unrealistic. I see mostly ""nice talk"" but not any conclusive information and nothing about programming. I am kinda fed up with these.

So after all that I have said above, is it still worth trying for that job? Did anyone go through experiences like mine? Any tips?  Should I put any more effort into it or just let it go to chance and write every crazzy idea that comes into my head onto that CV and in the answers?"
16lns4,2,2013-01-15,"Something I wrote after talking to a friend, ""Dad""- 4084 words",alancop,shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/16lns4/something_i_wrote_after_talking_to_a_friend_dad/,"/	*click* No round. I eased off the ground and tried to stretch out my muscles which had been contorted painfully for the past 2 hours or so I had been laying in wait trying to hit leaves flying across the range at almost 1000 meters, the very edge of my M40’s effective range. I sigh and reach back for the box of ammunition we brought. 500 .308’s and not one left. Looking over at Earl slumped over unnaturally in the tattered green lawn chair. “Earl. Earl. EARL! It’s time to go, I’m out and you’re asleep!” I walk over to him and squat down “Earl? Are you ok? Hey, look at me!”

It was the first day of freshman year. I had two friends. Well it’s all past now; so to be realistic I had no friends. They were one-faceted friends, we formed a pack at school to fend off attacks but out of school we were lone wolves. I found companionship elsewhere, after my dad died in Afghanistan when I was 8, my mom finally finished her internships and got a job as a neurologist.  We moved into a big house with everything I could ever want, except a family, so I spent my time gaming. All of my time. The people online were my friends, my family, and I treated everyone else I met in kind. 

I was standing on the perfect white concrete curb looking over the perfect black asphalt road at the perfect brick houses dotting the road out for as far as I cared to look, waiting for the ugly bus to come and grind to a halt so it could drag me to yet another 8 hour interruption in my gaming. I was the only one waiting, not that it really mattered, day after day, year after year. Then, freshman year, things changed.

“Hey! Kid!” a graveled old voice striped my thoughts from their tracks; startling me, but I relaxed and made sure my shock didn’t show. 

“Yes?”

“When does your bus come?”

“Not for a while, Why?”

“Come help me move this.”

The command in his voice made my compliance almost instantaneous, almost. I looked up the driveway at him, a shorter robust man, he could defiantly do some damage.  For some reason I agreed. I was led around the back of his large garage to a small shed. Inside there was nothing much in the way of anything at all. But there was one thing that stood out, something I recognized very well from many hours of Battle Field 1; a BMW R12. Probably one of the most iconic motorcycles of WWII and there was a perfect one right in front of me. I lost all sense of where I was and who I was with and reached out to touch the seat.

“She’s a beauty, huh?”

“Oh. Um, yea. I just, well I haven’t ever seen one in person before”

“I got it in 1950, right after the third Reich fell and brought it here. I keep it 
running and tuned, but I’m just too old to ride it. Now come on, we need to move this rain barrel before you miss your bus.”

I didn’t forget that exchange, I probably never will. For the next few weeks I didn’t see that stock old man again, but every day I looked up at his house, I wondered if he was as alone as I was.

March 17, I was waiting for the bus when I head a stranger’s familiar voice.

“Hey! Kid!” So loud it was almost a roar I looked back up at that black brick house, so different from all the other perfect white picket fence, red brick houses dotting the landscape.

“Yes?”

“Come up here, youngblood.”

Annoyed, I decide, yet again to go help him out.

“Ok, but don’t call me youngblood, I’m in highschool”

“Kid, when you’re 81 years old, everyone is youngblood”

This time we walk past the shed and into the woods, about 40 feet in there is a large clearing with some construction equipment which appears to be digging a large hole.

“I’m not sure the construction guys would want us on their worksite” I argued
He doesn’t respond, he just lead me around tothe back of the excavator.

“Do you see that hydraulic hose under there? I’m too old to get under there and reconnect it, I need you to.”

“But there’s mud and stuff down there, I have to go to school in…”
The icy look of pure disregard took me by surprise, and I did what I was told. All was fine until I got out. I stood up, still clean as a whistle and adjusted my collar. Even as I did it, I knew that I had hydraulic fluid all over my hand and consequently all over my shirt now.

“I need to go change before I go to school”

“Well you had better get on that, your bus gets here in 2 minuets.”

“Shit!”

I didn’t make the bus, I changed in record time, but it was just an ugly yellow dot in the distance when I got back outside.

“Hey kid. You need a ride?”

“No... I can get my mom to come home give me a ride...”

“Na, you don’t need to bother your ma. Besides, I held you up, the least I can do is haul you to school. How old are you?”

“ Thanks. um, 15. Why?”

“Ah, Well you can’t drive then I suppose. Well follow me on up here.”
If I had been forced to call my mother for a ride to school because I missed the bus, I am fairly confident that I would have been skinned. He led me around to the side of the garage, pulled out an old brass key and opened the door. Once inside I quickly realised that there was only one car in this huge 4 stall garage, but about 20 motorcycles, all covered. He pulled the cover off of a bright red 1985 Porsche 944 turbo. At this point it just looked like an old sports car to me, I didn’t know there were only a few thousand left in the US, nor how much stupid power this one had. All I knew was it was old. 

“Hop in, it’s the only car I care to own.”

“Why?”

“Motorcycles, kid, motorcycles.”

In no time at all we were out of the driveway and out of the neighborhood. We rode in silence. There was no radio, no dash at all as it was. There was a speedometer, tachometer, fuel gage and boost gage and that is about the extent of the dash. The 5 point racing harnesses pinned me to the seat and the cold steel roll cage ominously hung above me. I didn’t see the purpose of any of this until we got on the rural highway that leads into town.

The harnesses that were so tight previously went slack with the amount of acceleration we pulled onto this road. The engine only growled in response, I dared to glance at the Jupiter sized speedometer, 135 and rising. The speed limit is 65, I couldn’t even think. We blasted past the bus in the oncoming lane like it was going to opposite direction on a highway.  Suddenly the town was almost upon us and he hit the brakes, actually, he slaughtered them. We decelerated smoothly and evenly but at an ungodly pace. It felt as though the racing harness I was wearing was going to tear me limb from limb. Then; suddenly, we were only going 30. We blended right in with the morning traffic amidst the minivans and family sedans.

“I haven’t done that in a long time.”

I didn’t respond, to this day I’m not sure there was a response in that situation. He didn’t say anything after that except to thank me for helping him out and bid me goodbye.

I got off the bus that afternoon and I wanted to go back. I wanted to talk to him, see those motorcycles that car... *knock* *knock* *knock* I waited *knock* and the garage door roared to life, it opened impossibly slow for the amount of sound it made. I just stood awkwardly by the front door with my hands in my pockets. Once open the old man stepped out and put out his hand for a handshake.

“I don’t think we have officially met yet, I’m Earl.”

“Oh, I’m um, I’m uh Mathew.”

“Well Mathew whadd’ya need?”

“I just wanted to see that car. It was pretty fast, what kind was it?”

Earl smiled kindly “ Sure, come on into the garage. She didn’t quite make it home after our escapade this morning, it’s been a long time since I have pushed her like that.”

“Oh, I’m sorry..”

“For what?! I haven’t had fun like that since the mid ‘90’s, she just couldn’t 
quite take that much abuse so soon.”

“Oh, Ok. What’s wrong? exactly?”

“I’m not quite sure, really. I lost oil pressure and coolant containment on the way back up this road here. ‘Be a head gasket or valve train seal, really ‘could be anything. I think I’m going to rebuild the whole drive line. I haven’t had a real project to work on for a long time.”

“How do you do that?”

That question brought about next 2 months of going to school and not looking forward to going home and gaming by myself, but to going home, changing into work clothes and going to Earls house. I would sit in french and write lists of things we had to do before we got the next part in and during physics I surfed Wikipedia, learning as much as I could about cars.  Within a week we had the entire drive train out and at the two month mark, he asked me something simple, but my answer changed my life.

Earl pulled his head out from the oil catch under the jugs and looked at me, I stopped wrestling with the valve spring I was trying desperately to get into the train and looked over at him.

“How abouts we go shooting?”

“Shooting?” I inquired

“Yah, take ma guns out to the backstop range over that big hill to the south and do some shootin.”

Even at this point I was still fairly skiddish about things so I asked “Is that even legal?”

“Does it matter?”

“I suppose not.”

“Well, then lets go! But clean your hands first, guns are expensive.”

After Earl grabbed a large black case from the garage, which he insisted that I not carry, we set off over the hill behind his house, away from the subdivisions, away from civilization. It was approximately a 15 minute walk to a large, natural ravine. On the side closest to us, there was a large dug out area and downrange about 1500m there was a immense backstop. Earl hauled the big black box off the small utility cart he was pulling up the hill and set it on the ground. He flipped open the latches and pulled out a tattered green chair. I would come to know that chair quite well over the next few years.
	Earl sat down and motioned to me while saying

“Alright kid,  pick your poison.”

Laid out under the first layer of foam in the box was a trove of guns, each with its own cut in the foam allowing it to stay securely in place. I grabbed the MP5, a stout but powerful 9mm submachine gun. I had never shot a real gun in my life, but at 15 years old I was not going to let that stop me. I picked it up, grabbed the box of ammunition underneath of it and fumbled a bit, finally getting the clip out and loaded. Earl just looked on in an interested but disconnected sort of way. Finally I got the clip filled and back in the gun, I looked downrange and found a tree to shoot at. 

I brought the gun to my shoulder and looked down the scope, I lined up the reticle with the tree, turned off the safety and pulled the trigger. 

“Nice shootin, Ace” I hear from behind me, I flip the safety back on and look at Earl who now has a sighting scope set up.

“When did you set that up?!”

“You were taking 100 years to line up, so I assumed you were trying to actually hit something and pulled out my sighting scope to confirm the shot, but all you did is prove you can hit a tree at 200m. Why don’t you just hand me my M40.”
I obliged him. He loaded a single round into the chamber, put the butt of the gun up to his shoulder and without ever even leaving his chair, he put a round downrange.

“What were you aiming for?”

Earl didn’t say anything, he just lined up the sighting scope and motioned for me to look through it. There was a metal plate that I hadn’t seen before and in the very center was a hole.

“Did you just do that? Sitting in your chair?”

“Yes.”

I came to find out that at one time, Earl was a sniper in the marines. As the months went by we worked on the 944 during the week and went shooting almost every weekend. I became a much better shot and the 944 really started to take shape. He gave me something I desired since I was 8.

I remember the day like it was yesterday. My 16th birthday, my mom was pulling a 36 hour shift at work, over my birthday. The real kicker was that it was a Saturday. All she had said was to pick a car that costed less than $10k and she would buy it for me. I was in no mood to look for cars and honestly just wanted to go shooting. I walked into the garage and saw the black covered car in the 4th stall. My dads car. I walked over to it slowly, I don’t know why we had never uncovered it before. I pull the cover aside and slowly reveled the body of a Laguna Seca blue 1998 BMW M3. The all black interior was perfect. The car had been my dad’s pride and joy, I don’t think my mother could have ever brought herself to sell it, no matter how little money we had.  It was that moment I knew what I wanted for my 16th birthday, I was going to take that $10k and turn this M3 into a street monster.

With this hair brained idea still fresh in my head I ran to Earls house and he met me at the door.

“What are you doing here? It’s your birthday, go be home with your mom.”

“She took a 36 hour shift. It ends tomorrow.”

“Oh” the transient pain in his voice was beyond obvious, it was almost tangible.

“Are you ok?” I inquired, concerned by this show of emotion I had never seen from him before.

“NO! I am not ok! I’m not your family, I’m just the old guy who lives down the street! This is a damn shame, a kid, alone on his birthday...” He would have gone on, but I cut him off.

“Earl! It’s ok, she gave me $10k to buy a car.”

“How does that make it ok?”

“Earl? Can we just ignore it and hang out here today? I have something you will be interested in.”

“Ok, but I aint happy about it.”

“Come on, I want to show you something.”

We walked to my house and I keyed the code into the keypad to open door number 4. The smooth aluminum door swiftly slid away, reveling my Dad’s M3.

“You already bought a car?”

“No, this used to be my Dads. The last time it ran was when we put it in this 
garage stall. 8 years ago. I want to use the money to rebuild the drive line and make it a street machine as a tribute to my dad.”

“And you want me to help?”

“I couldn’t do it on my own”

“I would be honored to help you remember your Dad.”

That is exactly what we did. It took about 6 months of work between working on the M3, finishing the 944 and shooting. There were days where I spent hours with a rag in one hand and degreaser in the other hand, trying to get all the grime out of the engine bay. Other days I sat with a sharpie and a box of ziplock bags, labeling every bolt. Then there were the days that made it all worth it, like the first time we flicked on the electrical system. Everything came to life without a hitch, the lights came on and the dash displayed all correct values. The day we finished the 944 is probably one of the most memorable days of my life.

Schweiziska banken UBS tyska dotterbolag är under utredning av lokala åklagare enligt uppgift till skattebedrägeri.
Bank arbetsgivare påstås hjälpt investerare att gömma pengar pass inkomster avdelningarnas myndigheterna genom att överföra det till Schweiz, säger Peter Lintz.Rapporterade undersökningen den 8 November 2012, sade Stuttgarter Nachrichten olagliga banköverföring som nått långt in 2012, pengar var osynligt flyttas via en intern clearingkonto på UBSS tyska filialen i Schweiz.

Elektroniska data och andra hundratusentals material som beslagtogs i UBS'S Frankfurt kontor som var razzia i maj analyseras för närvarande av Mannheim åklagare.
De rättsliga undersökningarna var avsedda för okänd företrädare för UBSS tysk division. Några av bankens kunder läggs bland mål, även Lintz.
Som ett resultat har schweiziska banker varit föremål för utredningar av skatteflykt i USA och Europa, kasta schweiziska banksekretessen, inskriven i republikens lagar och traditioner, i fara.
Bank vägrar att kommentera om frågan ganska sent onsdag samma år de mailade ett uttalande genom en talesman säger att banken redan ""samarbetar med myndigheterna"" men nekar till kommentar om pågående rättsliga förfaranden.
Ett antal franska kontor av UBS har sökt som en del av en sond till påstådda medhjälp av skatteflykt tidigare i år. I vissa andra frågor som berör UBS, de förnekar mediarapporter talar om rika tyskar att flytta medel till Singapore och andra pengar centers framåt av en schweizisk skatt itu av träda i kraft i januari.
Sedan 2009, UBS har noga undersökt ""villkor"" för företag med över 60 länder, däribland Tyskland och vidtagit åtgärder för att justera eller förbättra reglerna där så är nödvändigt, talesman sade.

16l5iw,0,2013-01-14,Considering the CMA Exam,gmshaw,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/16l5iw/considering_the_cma_exam/,"I am going to be starting a career as an audit associate at a Big 4 firm at the end of this summer and will be finished with grad school and the CPA exams by the beginning of May.  I am considering studying for and taking the CMA exam during that down time because I eventually want to transition to some sort of managerial/accounting role in the brewing industry and I think a CMA certification would make me more marketable for that type of job.  I also don't have much else to do between graduation and work, so I figure it would be one of the best times to get the exam out of the way if I decide it's the right choice for that career path.

My only concern is how I will be perceived in the firm if I have completed both the CPA and CMA exams before I start working for them.  I have a friend who started a year ahead of me in the same office who said that if someone gets their CMA certification within their first couple years, people at that firm usually anticipate that person will leave within their first two years.  Personally, I am trying to avoid the mentality that I'm going to leave that early because I think it will cheapen the value I get from working there, but judging from my internship experience with them, I think it would be hard to convince me to stay if an incredible opportunity came up in the right place.  

I've looked into the exam process and it would definitely be significantly cheaper for me to take it now with the student prices in effect.  I don't have any doubts about passing the exam if I could take it now while I'm still in academic/study mode, but if I were to take it a few years down the road and be that far removed from school, I think I'd have a lot harder time motivating myself to study and succeeding on the exam.  At the same time, I don't want to be perceived by my colleagues/firm that I'm going to bolt after two years and have a target on my head the whole time because I've passed both exams this early.  Does anyone know if this is a reasonable concern or is it common for people to get those two certifications this early (aside from the experience requirements obviously)?  If this is a reasonable concern, is there a way I can try to avoid it from giving me that reputation and becoming a distraction around the firm?"

16prop,5,2013-01-16,"[Request] Hey Reddit, I could really use some help...",[deleted],Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/16prop/request_hey_reddit_i_could_really_use_some_help/,"My name is Samantha and I currently live in Philadelphia, PA. I'm currently in a jam and I've gotten so desperate that I've come here, asking for some outside assistance. 

About two weeks ago my car died. I don't mean broke down on the side of the road and needed a tow - after reaching a little more than 200k miles, my poor Mitsubishi could drive no more. When it decided to kick the bucket, I was miles away from Philadelphia. I had driven down to VA to watch my kooky drunk grandfather and it broke down on the side of the capital beltway. With towing and taxi charges, I found myself in the hole of about $300. 

The thing is, I need a car. I'm currently working at a newspaper internship and it requires me to travel around my county.  So, with my mother’s help, I bought an old used car, using up my savings I had for the down payment.  

Normally, I use my student loans to help pay for my living expenses. I’m already 30k in debt (and I’m a sophomore) but I knew this was going to happen to me when I decided to go to college. I’m one of those unlucky middle-class kids who don’t appear to have ‘financial need’, therefore I don’t get much aid and I’m forced to take out a majority of tuition in student loans under my name. 

My disbursement date for the second half of my loan is at the end of the month. Until then, however, I have to make my rent, pay my car insurance and other bills, and pay my first car payment. This is totaling a little more then $900. 

It’s a lot of money, but I can’t ignore these expenses. So I sold my Xbox, the 3DS I got for Christmas, and some other little small things on Amazon, cutting the price down to about $500 (I was able to pay bills and car insurance!) and, sadly, I am not able to join the equestrian team at my university this semester (a club I became involved it while at school [I always wanted to ride horses!]). 

Again, I realize that this is still a considerable amount of money, and I hate to act so desperate, but if there is anyone out there who would be able to donate a few bucks, I would very much appreciate it. I’d also be happy with some loans as well; I can repay them come February. I’m going to try and pick up a second part-time job, since I’ve seen how nerve-wracking this situation can be, but I can’t just quit my internship. Journalism is all about experience and putting my foot in the door is key. So, I’m looking towards my future. I do have one Discover credit card, but I don’t want to go over my 500 spend limit (and I’m at about $495).

Thanks again. Once I don’t feel like I’m drowning so much, I’m more than willing to repay debits and spread help around.

16ouno,3,2013-01-16,Not sure how to make it up to her...,8npls,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/16ouno/not_sure_how_to_make_it_up_to_her/,"So... I'm in Asia visiting my parents and I decide to get a random internship to pass the time. There's this girl at work whom I've taken a liking to, let's call her Jenny. She's been around since late November but she has a busy schedule, so most of the time we've spent together has just been breaks (dinner, lunch, random half hour breaks during shifts). I asked her out on a date in early December; she replied with uncertainty and told me she'd have to see after her schedule was confirmed. Her hours were approved a couple days after that but she never got back to me.

I was originally planning to fly back to Canada on the 27th, however some family issues arose and I have thus changed my flight to end of February. My workplace is fairly small, so most of the people I worked with knew about my situation. One of my coworkers actually really kindly set up a dinner for a small group of us on the 21st.

However, due to some miscommunication I figured it was just another typical ""work break group dinner"" and it turns out I wasn't scheduled to go in that day... on top of that, Jenny had seemed pretty hot/cold during the time period between my asking her out and this dinner being planned. I figured she'd lost interest and had been casually dating another girl on the side.

I do make it clear to everyone though that I'm uncertain about being able to show on the 21st; I tell them I'll be there if I get scheduled for work and that I'll send my regrets if not. Turns out I got the day off, the other girl asks me out for dinner that day anyhow so I say sure why not and on the 19th I tell them I won't be able to make it.

Around 6pm on the day Jenny calls me and asks if I'm showing up, I reply with my sincerest apologies that I don't have work today and thus will not be going to dinner with them.

Fast forward to today. My internship originally ended on the 24th of December since I was leaving, but I returned last week because I can't really sit around and do nothing. My reappearance in the office catches Jenny off guard a bit and on the first day she seems rather jovial and pleasantly surprised that I'm back... next day, however, she is completely cold towards me and just entirely ignores me.

OK, I'm kinda rambling on with this story so here's essentially what's going on: I know I really really fucked up on the 21st. I found out after the fact that I made a huge mistake assuming it was just a typical dinner when Jenny had actually taken off the remainder of her shift that day, arrived at work dressed up... and the ""group"" comment was just her being too shy to directly ask me out on a date.

Truth is, I do really really like her a lot but I don't want her to get emotionally attached or whatever since I'm leaving so soon. That said, I genuinely do believe I owe her an apology because what I did was extremely inconsiderate and just a major dick move.

My question is... how can I make it up to her? I was thinking of apologizing to her for being a sod and standing her up, then treating her to dinner... or should I get her a small gift/write a note (on top of apologizing in person of course)/other suggestions? I'm not really good at this kind of thing. I'm not expecting to get anything out of this by the way; I just want to repent for hurting Jenny's feelings because it definitely wasn't my intention to do that. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated, and sorry for the long post! Thanks guys :)

**TL;DR: Stood up a girl unintentionally, now that I know I fucked up how can I make it up to her?**"

With the start of the year, I've had a few interviews, and have ultimately been placed in somewhat of a dilemma:

I've been offered a three month, paid internship contract in an industry that I'm interested in, with the possibility of a job arising in the future - they're hiring three interns and one gets picked at the end. They want me to get back to them as soon as possible, and I would start on Monday.

At the same time, I've made it to the second round for a permanent role, also in a relevant industry. They offer great pay, however, the interview is only scheduled for next week.

I've asked the company with the internship role if there is any flexibility and explained the situation, but they want all of the new interns to start at the same time.

Just wondering if anyone can give any insight - money and job now, albeit temporarily, or something more lucrative, but not actually been offered to me yet?

After being a completely healthy person for the last 22 years, something is happening to me that is scaring me beyond my wits.
First a little backstory: I moved to a new area in September for a full time, paid internship at an advertising agency. Around the end of November they decided to keep me on staff with a pay raise and will be giving me a full time salaried position within the next few months if all goes well. WHen i found that out, I decided to move in with my girlfriend since we were in a LDR for the past year. I took off a week between xmas and new years to go home to see my family and we moved in to our new place the day after New Years. Which is when this all started.
I just feel completely out of it Reddit, like I'm walking through life in a zombie-like state. The worst of it happens about 30 minutes after I eat a meal, and during that time I'm just a mess. Heart palpitations, worry, feeling like I'm going crazy, etc.
Now I know it can't be a coincidence that this all is happening right when I moved in to a new place with the girl who i've never spent more than a week at a time with, but this doesn't seem to be going away so I'm worried. It's been an adjustment living with her but we're doing well and making it work.
My job is also very stressful as I feel like i constantly need to perform my best and never make a mistake so as to get the salaried position in a couple months. I can't stop thinking about things at work. My clients, projects, due dates, co workers, etc. I cannot leave work at the office and that on top of adjusting to living with my girlfriend is just driving me in a tailspin I think.
I'm just worried that it's something more than stress and bad anxiety. Although all the signs point to that.
Some other symptoms I'm experiencing includes random memory loss for little things every now and then, muscle twitches causing me to drop things randomly (just like keys when locking the door), and occasionally not being able to get a word out during a conversation. I hope this is all just caused because there is a million things going on in my mind but I want to be sure.
Also, the only time i don't really feel any of these things is when I'm working out at the gym.
Please advise, Reddit."

I've got a tricky situation on my hands, and would love any advice I can get. At the moment, I'm very fortunate to be enrolled at a great school studying Computer Science with a solid GPA. Beyond that, however, my experience here has been nothing like what I had thought it would be upon entering, and not in a good way. I'll explain the situation as briefly as I can, then ask my question.

I initially entered college around seven years ago as a freshman, but not long after that I began to be dealt a tough hand of cards which ultimately forced me to take around three years away from school, and beyond that some time as only a part-time student. To make a very long story short, I had three friends die -- two by suicide -- within a span of just a few months. I initially took a medical leave to deal with this, and intended to be gone only for a short time. Shortly thereafter, however, my father's Parkinson's became so severe that he had to stop working and I, being home already, became the de facto caretaker (my parental situation is a bit irregular -- they were actually in their 50's when they had me). Our financial security was never good, but it got a lot worse after that and due to a few other factors I ended up staying out of school much longer to help manage his care. Though to be honest, I had become so depressed at that point that it wouldn't have been wise to return to school anyway. The situation with my father has been resolved, so to speak, and I have since returned to school to continue my degree.

As you may have guessed, I would like to know how I should best address my massive enrollment gap and lack of internship experience with companies during a job search. ""I took a medical leave"" or ""Family issues"" seem so cryptic and would probably only engender confusion. However, telling any considerable fraction of the full story would seem like suicide in a job interview. That said, I'd really like to be as truthful and honest as possible. I'm not going to back down, but I am extremely self-conscious about it and have been struggling to address all this to people in both a reasonable and truthful way.

Everything aside, I believe that I have the core software engineering and algorithms knowledge to do well at a reptuable company -- Palantir and Google are far and away my top choices (a man can dream, can't he?), but I'd certainly be happy with many other options as well. I'll be looking for full-time opportunities next year most likely, but am currently focused on finding a solid internship for this summer.

Thanks again for reading, and best of luck to all of you this job season --

16odfx,4,2013-01-16,"A note I wrote concerning questions about children I've been getting lately, though it fit in here.",SamiLMS1,childfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/16odfx/a_note_i_wrote_concerning_questions_about/,"I was motivated to write this after receiving many questions from people lately. This is because people know I'm childfree but seemed confused when I bonded strongly with my friend's nine month old and started an internship working with abused/neglected children. This is my response.

I felt the need to write this to clear the air surrounding some questions I’ve been getting lately. My bond with Jocelynne and my choice of internship, which I thoroughly enjoy, has caused some people some confusion due to my childfree status. Fair enough. 

For this to make sense I need to give some background on my views about societal obligations. I believe our society can be too individualistic at times. I understand I am not perfect and make individualistic decisions at times too. Of course at some level we must be individualistic for the sake of survival and these behaviors are expected considering the values of our society. I have two very strong beliefs that many of my life decisions stem from. The first is that love is invaluable, precious, and the core of the human experience. The second is that we have obligations to help our fellow humans and should live our lives in ways that better society for as a whole. I’ve been called naïve, overly romantic, and idealistic for feeling this way but that is okay – if that is the worst thing you can say about me I’ll feel pretty good about myself. 

It is no surprise to anybody I don’t want my own children, I’ve been very open about that for the past ten years now. The misconception that this equals some sort of hate towards children is understandable and partially my own fault. People aren’t always kind when you make a decision that goes against the norm. Hate and indifference are defense, they are the only things I’ve found to make people stop persistently attacking this decision. As I type it now it seems somewhat juvenile but the fact of the matter is it was – when I made the decision to use that defense I was a teenager angry at always being told I was wrong. It was bad enough people told me I was unnatural because I’m a lesbian and would change my mind about that, but then to have people tell me my decisions regarding children were wrong too was more than I wanted to deal with. 

Here are at the facts – I’m not the gush over kids type. I’m not the type who feels all warm inside when a baby laughs or thinks tiny shoes are somehow any different than adult shoes. The first time I met Jocelynne it wasn’t a total rush of hormonal love and maternal adoration. I love Jocelynne because I have spent time with her, cared for her, and bonded with her. It is the same sort of love I have developed for my friends who I care deeply for. There was no instant maternal instinct involved in it for me – the protective instincts did not develop for me until the caring did and it is the same protective instinct I have for my girlfriend or my cat. Part of why I was able to bond with Jocelynne is because she has a wonderful mother who completely understands my decision to have children and never forced Jocelynne on me. She gave me space to learn about her on my own time and interact with her as much or little as I felt comfortable. Because of that I almost never want to put her down. The kids I have met at my internship are some of the best kids I have met but again it was a process, I got to know them as individuals and spent time with them that led to bonds. It was not caring for the sake of them being kids, it was caring because they were people I got to know and spent time with. I thoroughly appreciate the time I get to spend with them and have learned a lot from them. But none of this has changed my beliefs about having my own children and I do not think these experiences clash with my beliefs at all. 

Let me return to my second belief for a moment, my belief that we need to help each other. Part of the reason we work as a society is because we all choose different jobs that fit different needs in society. We need doctors, teachers, construction works, police officers, firefighters, cashiers, cooks, and many others for the society we have created to run smoothly. For our society to continue we need children and we need people to care for those children. For a multitude of reasons the people who care for these children cannot always be the parents. Some parents are unequipped, some are harmful to their children and some end up leaving this earth much earlier than planned. That is the point in which others need to step in, people who possess no genetic bonds but still care about these children because they are people and a part of our society.  I have always been drawn to that role and honestly think I can contribute to society in a meaningful way. I don’t know if I believe in fate or destiny but I know this is something I have always been drawn to. I want to help people, to spread compassion, to heal people’s hearts to the best of my ability. 

I have been told I will never know a child’s love if I don’t have my own children. I am perfectly fine with never feeling the love of a child with my own DNA. When I walk into the room and Jocelynne looks at me with those happy eyes and arms outstretched I know she loves me. When the kids at my internship get excited to see me and ask me to play games with them I know they appreciate my company. That is enough for me. I believe the needs of those who lack love in their life is worth giving up one part of love in my life. And yes, I know having both is possible, but I’d rather not split my efforts. I cannot justify creating another human that would take my time and energy when I could use that time and energy for so many others who need it more. My life already has so much love in it. I have the love of my parents, of my beautiful girlfriend, my friends, Jocelynne, and many more. I have learned so many different types of love in my life, I am so blessed already. I am okay with missing out on one. I understand to some people this is the greatest love in their life but it won’t be in mine and that doesn’t make the love I have any less special or meaningful. 

My attachment to Jocelynne is not typical, and if you were to ask me why she is different I couldn’t offer much of a logical answer. I have many friends who have kids who I have not felt the same bond with. Perhaps it is the long-standing friendship with her mother, perhaps it is her mother’s acceptance of me as a person or maybe Jocelynne and I just have personalities that mesh well. I feel like people forget that babies are people and have their own personalities just like adults and sometimes personalities just do or don’t click really well. I do love Jocelynne, I love watching her progress and would be absolutely heartbroken if something would happen to her. I am grateful she is in my life. But I am also grateful she is not mine. I feel zero desire to have a little version of her all my own. 

I won’t discount the fact that more than a few of my other reasons for not wanting children are selfish. I think that is normal though, I think even parents who have unselfish reasons to have children also have a long list of reasons that begin with “I want”. I feel that if it meets my personal wants and benefits others at the same time it is win-win. I’ve been called selfish many times, and I’m sure I will be many more times before I do, but I can handle it. The older I become the more I realize it doesn’t matter if someone thinks I’m making the wrong choice, being selfish, or will change my mind. I don’t think I need to justify it either. Many of justifications are very private, sensitive information and I don’t think they are anyone’s business but mine and my love’s. 

There is not an ounce of doubt in my heart that my life decisions are right for me. There are some who do not understand this and are even disappointed by it. I’m not sure what more I can say about that except that I believe we can respect each other without understanding each other. I do believe we can co-exist and be happy and respect each other’s contributions to society’s future. I’m writing this in hopes of some peace and understanding, for an end to the forcing another way of life on each other and instead appreciating the people who have chosen to do different than us. If we all had the same passions and desires in life we would have more problems than solutions.

But new and stressful things- like job searching- are just terrible. I just sent in an application to be a phone fundraiser for my school and I'm kind of flipping out because I only have one real reference who I asked a long time ago and who I'm not sure remembers me, same for past employers (I have no real job experience) and all my previous job searches have failed.

I was on the verge of tears filling out that app because it just seems so terrible to me and it nearly took me covering my eyes and looking away to hit ""send.""

I also hate job searching because I need to be picky- I have no car, so far from campus is not applicable. I have a semi-long distance boyfriend who I only get to see on weekends and not being able to visit him would just ruin me, so I can't really apply for something that requires lots of weekend time. Most everything left is either Federal Work Study, which I don't qualify for, or an internship when I need money!

It often feels like no one will ever hire me. Hell, they haven't bothered before. I send out app after app and hear nothing back and I have no idea what I'm doing wrong!

I'm tired of borrowing money from my boyfriend and family and I'm old enough to do this on my own but for some reason I just plain can't."

Cannot leave him after years of physical and emotional fighting. ,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/16ns5i/24f_in_a_long_term_abusive_relationship_with_26m/,"Excruciatingly long story, and will try my best to keep this as short as possible.

Me and the boyfriend have been dating for 4 years. Things were amazing for 3; travelled the world together, lived together for most of the relationship, completely head over heels in love. 
I knew getting involved with him that he had a very intense personality (history of drugs and violence, extreme temper), but he is still to this day the most charismatic, charming man i have ever known. 
This year was a whirlwind. We moved to Hong Kong, I was to model and he was to intern at a bank. He ended up getting ''drugged'' with something one night we went out, and got angry that I was speaking to another man. He then punched me in the nose and was arrested for fist fighting in the streets of the club district. I broke it off, but one thing led to another and I eventually took him back. Things were horrible afterwards. He then quit his bank job and got a job as a club promoter; he was constantly flirting with gorgeous women and ignoring me all night, which led me to drink way too much and horrible physical fights between us, and always ended up with me crawling back to him no matter what he did to me. A couple months into this I completely went mental, cut my work contract and booked a flight home the next day. When he found out I was leaving, he told me he couldn't be with me anymore and that he was in love with someone else (that I called him out on previously but he denied it). 

As soon as I got off the plane I was hospitalised for being suicidal, depressed, etc. I had no idea how to live without him, and felt extremely unwanted. We were still speaking to each other every day, and even though we weren't together, we would Skype sex and act like we were. Total mind fuck. I told him to make a decision with whom he wanted to be with, and he couldn't. I went along with it, doing whatever he wanted and going out of my way for him. He was supposed to come home to visit in September, but got arrested at the airport for trying to leave Hong Kong after the whole fist fight/drugged night went down. After he got out of jail the second time, he told me he officially wanted to be with me. I obviously was ecstatic and accepted. We spoke twice a day, every day, and I put complete trust in him. Ever since then, I have been in intense therapy and have been trying to heal. On the other hand, he has been going out every night until six in the morning doing drugs and drinking like a fish. He sees no problem in this considering it's his ''job''. 

After 6 months, he finally comes home last week, to be visiting until he goes back at the end of January. I thought everything was going to be perfect.. Unfortunately, this is what has been happening:
He seems completely emotionally disconnected and distracted. At first I blamed it on the jet lag. We go out for a couple drinks and obviously go home and fuck. The next morning he is engrossed in his video games and reddit, won't pay any attention to me whatsoever. I get upset, and he tells me I'm too needy and I should just leave. That my emotions are complete bullshit (which he always says) and that I need to grow up. We sort of make up and he promises to have a day with me tomorrow. He doesn't call me and I can't get ahold of him until midnight, and says he will see me when it's convenient, that he's sorry for ignoring me. We meet up and do coke, I can't sleep and I figured that he must be cheating on me. I find a whole Skype conversation with this other woman that had been going on for weeks. Telling her he missed her so much, how he wishes she was here, etc. I confront him and he admits to crushing on her and watching movies and cuddling, but never having done anything because he has self control. That I was making a bigger deal about this than there actually was. His excuse was that I was being a bad girlfriend and that he didn't feel the need to tell me since nothing happened between them. After telling me this he gets angry that I woke him up, chokes me and throws me off the bed. Once again, I forgave him. I leave and he, once again, promises me he will call me that night. He doesn't. I finally call him the next day and he tells me I'm so annoying for calling him because he has a stomach ache and hangs up on me. He knew that I had a very important therapy session that he was supposed to be a part of that day, but did not even remember. He is also leaving back to Hong Kong in less than a week and I feel like he does not make any effort to see me. 

I wanted to ask Reddit's advice, as I was planning on moving there after my therapy is over. I feel he knows he can treat me like shit, and although I do realise this, I am so scared to leave him. I have abandonment issues and have also invested 4 years into this relationship. I do not feel valued or appreciated whatsoever, but I'm scared to think it's all my fault somehow, and that if I only got better then everything would resolve itself. Any advice would be so dear to me. 

TL;DR Boyfriend of 4 years moved to Hong Kong to be a model club promoter, he comes home after 6 months long distance and treats me like absolute shit and physically hurts me. Found evidence of other women, denies it as being important since he only had a ''crush'' on them and has self control. Cannot find the strength to leave him, wondering if I am the problem.

16nl9c,13,2013-01-15,Does this sound like Anxiety or something else?,ftwin,Health,https://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/16nl9c/does_this_sound_like_anxiety_or_something_else/,"Hi Reddit I need some help here.  After being a completely healthy person for the last 22 years, something is happening to me that is scaring me beyond my wits.

First a little backstory:  I moved to a new area in September for a full time, paid internship at an advertising agency.  Around the end of November they decided to keep me on staff with a pay raise and will be giving me a full time salaried position within the next few months if all goes well.  WHen i found that out, I decided to move in with my girlfriend since we were in a LDR for the past year.  I took off a week between xmas and new years to go home to see my family and we moved in to our new place the day after New Years. Which is when this all started. 

I just feel completely out of it Reddit, like I'm walking through life in a zombie-like state.  The worst of it happens about 30 minutes after I eat a meal, and during that time I'm just a mess.  Heart palpitations, worry, feeling like I'm going crazy, etc.  

Now I know it can't be a coincidence that this all is happening right when I moved in to a new place with the girl who i've never spent more than a week at a time with, but this doesn't seem to be going away so I'm worried.  It's been an adjustment living with her but we're doing well and making it work.  

My job is also very stressful as I feel like i constantly need to perform my best and never make a mistake so as to get the salaried position in a couple months.  I can't stop thinking about things at work.  My clients, projects, due dates, co workers, etc.  I cannot leave work at the office and that on top of adjusting to living with my girlfriend is just driving me in a tailspin I think.

I'm just worried that it's something more than stress and bad anxiety.  Although all the signs point to that.

Some other symptoms I'm experiencing includes random memory loss for little things every now and then, muscle twitches causing me to drop things randomly (just like keys when locking the door), and occasionally not being able to get a word out during a conversation.  I hope this is all just caused because there is a million things going on in my mind but I want to be sure.

Also, the only time i don't really feel any of these things is when I'm working out at the gym.

Please advise, Reddit.

I'm happy that they accepted me since unlike most developers I don't have a CS degree. The problem is the company is brand new, does not have investors yet, and the internship is unpaid (this would be fine if they weren't asking 20-40 hours a week). I feel like I can wait and find a better offer but this is based on my own instinct and not the reality of a web developer finding a job. 

My experience includes programming non-stop for the past 8 months, 8 hours a day, 7 days a week, along with numerous projects under my belt using Rails/Sinatra/NoSQL, etc etc. My question is, should this be something I'm grateful to take or should I find something else, at least one paid."

I did internship as a part of graduation program at a company for 6 months. I did apply for permanent position there. The GM-HR took my interview. After that I sent him a thank you email, and also kept a HR personnel in cc: with whom I was in touch. (They both work at head-office in different location to where I worked)

I called her back after a week to check on status. I followed it up 10 days later. I had a presentation on my internship pending at the time. So after finishing all my internship formalities, I followed it up again 10 days later with an SMS and called her the next day. At the time she said she was waiting for the feedback form from the plant I worked at and assured that they have my name in their mind for recruiting. She also said she'll take 3-4 days to look up for vacancies at one of their several plants, and also asked to mail her my project report. I sent the same to which she replied she'll get back soon. It's been 2 weeks since then and I don't know how to follow this up further.

Entering college I was hoping to have everything I'd need to know by this point, but right now I'm feeling hopeless.

I can program, I know that much. I know C++ and Java, and have been able to jump into other languages (C#, javascript, for example) easily. More complex things take a bit of time, but eventually after a lot of googling and tinkering I get it right.

Other than that though, I'm clueless. Despite taking hardware classes and other ""inner-workings"" courses, I still don't know much about computer specs. When my friends talk about their newest computers with their fancy parts, I just nod my head without really understanding. While others are making their own laptops, I don't even know how to make my own PC. I want to blame the Russian teacher, or the teacher with tenure who didn't really care, or the teacher who read the book word-for-word and eventually switched to a youtube tutorial to teach, but I know that most of my struggling is my own doing.

I have nothing to show for a portfolio. I have a Unity project that I've been toying with for a few months, but I haven't had much time to work on it and have only gotten a few simple functions on it (Creating stats for a player and enemy, and a functioning attack button). I did take a class, a game design course, where the entire class made a game together but the dropbox has already been deleted and no copies exist.

I want to get into the game industry so bad but I'm just at a loss of what to do or how to help myself. I'm afraid of letting people know that I only feel confident in programming and that everything else makes my head spin. I've applied for an internship with EA, and someone who worked there has agreed to put in a good word for me, but I'm afraid that if they accept me and I go that I'll just make a fool of myself. My university recently had a CS&amp;IS dept pizza party, and I had mentioned that one of their recommendations was to know multi-threaded processing and how I didn't have any experience in that as far as I knew. A kid overheard and said that if I didn't know that, then I had no business in EA. My confidence has reached an all-time low.

I feel like I'm just begging for ""Cheer up, it's ok!""s or that this is one of a billion similar posts, or if this is even in the right sub, but I really need advice, or direction, or something that could get me out of this horrifying rut. What can I do to help better prepare myself for what's out there?"

16rvse,89,2013-01-17,"""The printer keeps jamming, and I don't know why.""",jordan042,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/16rvse/the_printer_keeps_jamming_and_i_dont_know_why/,"Sorry if it's a bit long. I have a hard time telling stories without giving the play by play.

So today, I had gone up to the elementary school where my mom teaches, offering to help with computer-related issues. For background, I worked for this school district's technology department as an intern for my final semester of high school and four summers. This is just to say I know their setup pretty well, so I'm capable of doing a lot to fix their issues; I also know that the Technicians for the district are sorely understaffed, and that they rarely make it out to some of the elementary schools (and this one in particular*) since the middle and high schools are much larger and have more frequent and numerous issues.

The teacher in question asked me to take a look at her printer (an [HP Deskjet 1000](http://www.shopping.hp.com/en_US/home-office/-/products/Printers/HP-Deskjet/CH340A) for those interested in the particulars), and said that it had a tendency to jam. Luckily this was not compounded by software or driver issues. I opened up good old MSWord and typed a few words to print (""Test page, please ignore,"" in true Redditor fashion). I put a sheet of paper in the tray and hit print.

What came next wasn't unexpected; the paper scooted in about an inch, the printer made an odd noise, and on the monitor a ""printer out of paper - please insert more and press the printer's power button once"" message appeared. Well well well. I pulled the paper out relatively unscathed, and opened the printer door up to have a look inside. (This printer has a small door on the front that when opened, gives access to the ink cartridges.) This was of no help. I could see nothing out of order, and the door was too small to really allow me to get at anything that would be inside. However I was able to see that there was no other jammed paper inside, conveniently. 

At this point I close the printer up, hit the print button, and received the same result. Clearly I had missed something. I checked in the paper tray at the back, but still nothing. I proceeded to unplug the printer, and turn it upside down and listen for loose parts, to no avail. I tried printing again with no success, and decided to poke around once more before recommending the printer to the school district's printer guy. This is when I notice it. There's something red down in the paper tray. It turns out to be a [red felt-tip pen](http://i.imgur.com/dC13N.jpg), jammed down in the paper tray assembly.

After finally finding the issue, it took about 10 minutes of reaching and poking and stretching my fingers to actually remove it. It had gotten stuck in a location that seemed to be just slightly narrower than the width of the pen, and definitely narrower than my fingers.

I plugged it in, printed a test page successfully, and then gave the teacher the good news. ""I have not only fixed your printer, I found your pen too.""

^(*For example, several classroom computers still run Windows 2000 after there was a project 2 years ago to upgrade everything to at least XP.)

**TL;DR**: ""I not only fixed your printer, I found your pen too."""

Advice Needed.,WoodChopper,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/16rcb9/a_college_students_guide_to_making_his_money_work/,"Okay, for a little background, I am a 20 year old college student with two jobs, one that pays from my on-campus housing and meals, and the other that I am using for strickly saving the money that I earn from it. From this job, I earn about $100 bucks a week, which is pretty modest, but I really want to save up to 90% of the money that I make. All my life I have been educated by my father about personal finance, whether from being forced to listen to Clark Howard as a young kid, or him showing me how to open my own bank account and credit card.

Now that I'm finally into some extra money, I want to make my money work for me, rather than just let it sit in a low-interest savings account. So I kind of made up a game plan of what I want to do and when I want to do it. I am just asking for advice on whether these are good ideas, or if there are other options that might help me better!

So here is the plan:

* First, I plan on having $1500 dollars in my savings account (only earning .15%) by June 1.

* Then, I would like to put all $1500 in either a high interest savings account (about 1%), money market account, or mutual fund (I'm not really sure which? For this account, I want it to be very low risk, but make at much interest/return as possible).

* Continue to save money from my job and open up a Roth IRA, which would double as an emergency fund. (Yes, taking money out of an IRA seems like a big no-no, but it is actually a very viable emergency fund option). I'd like to contribute another $1000 to this account in the months following June 1.

* After I have both of those goals met, I'd like to try my hand at some moderate risk alternatives. My next additional $500 dollars that I save, I would like to invest in the stock market. Now this is where I am not sure what to do. I know I can put that money into some sort of diverse fund, or I can use it to trade myself. I will say I have been successful with stocks in the past (My dad gave me $500 to invest on my own in high school for him and I made 15% in 3 months). But I know I can't expect to get this lucky again.

* The next couple thousand that I make (I expect to make about $5000 as an intern over the summer) I think I would like to put in staggered CDs. This is a technique praised by Clark Howard that you can learn about here: http://www.clarkhoward.com/news/clark-howard/personal-finance-credit/maximize-higher-interest-rates-long-term-cds/nCKc2/.

Okay, Reddit! Thats my plan, what to y'all think. Honestly, I am open to absolutely anything. I feel like some more money could go into long term stocks, instead of some other areas that I listed, but I'd just like to here from some more experienced people! I know I'm not making that much money, and after all this work, I may not have a large return, but I just want a game plan that I can test out before I graduate! I'm still young, so I'd rather make all my mistakes now!

**EDIT:** I am completely debt free. I have absolutely no debt. Not a dime. My college tuition is paid for by scholarships, and my housing and meals are paid for with my Department of Housing job as a Resident Assistant. I have no credit card debt and only primarily use it for gas, snacks, or the occasional night out. So all my debt is already paid down. I'm pretty sure I'll graduate with zero debt.

**EDIT#2:** I also have had a credit card for about 3.5 years and use it for all of my general expenses (snacks, restaurants, gas, and nights out). I've never missed a payment and have zero debt on it. I checked my credit score for the first time a few weeks ago and its a 724. Which, for a 20 year old, I feel is pretty solid?

**EDIT#3:** I also have a car (a 1991 Honda Accord), which has 277,000 miles. It was my first car, and my dad is a mechanic so that's why it has lasted this long. I plan on driving it until it dies on me permanently (I love it so much). At that time, I would get a new car, but probably another used Honda. It would be great if it lasts another 5 years."

This is a technique praised by Clark Howard that you can learn about here: &lt;http://www.clarkhoward.com/news/clark-howard/personal-finance-credit/maximize-higher-interest-rates-long-term-cds/nCKc2/&gt;.

Okay, Reddit! Thats my plan, what to y'all think. Honestly, I am open to absolutely anything. I feel like some more money could go into long term stocks, instead of some other areas that I listed, but I'd just like to here from some more experienced people! I know I'm not making that much money, and after all this work, I may not have a large return, but I just want a game plan that I can test out before I graduate! I'm still young, so I'd rather make all my mistakes now!

**EDIT:** I am completely debt free. I have absolutely no debt. Not a dime. My college tuition is paid for by scholarships, and my housing and meals are paid for with my Department of Housing job as a Resident Assistant. I have no credit card debt and only primarily use it for gas, snacks, or the occasional night out. So all my debt is already paid down. I'm pretty sure I'll graduate with zero debt.

**EDIT#2:** I also have had a credit card for about 3.5 years and use it for all of my general expenses (snacks, restaurants, gas, and nights out). I've never missed a payment and have zero debt on it. I checked my credit score for the first time a few weeks ago and its a 724. Which, for a 20 year old, I feel is pretty solid?

**EDIT#3:** I also have a car (a 1991 Honda Accord), which has 277,000 miles. It was my first car, and my dad is a mechanic so that's why it has lasted this long. I plan on driving it until it dies on me permanently (I love it so much). At that time, I would get a new car, but probably another used Honda. It would be great if it lasts another 5 years."
16r9we,2,2013-01-17,Trying to figure out the term for what I'm interested in - is it board-level design?,AegisXLII,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/16r9we/trying_to_figure_out_the_term_for_what_im/,"Hi gang,

I'm internship hunting for this summer and am trying to figure out the buzzword to describe my interests to employers. 

* I want to know how all the electrical components are selected and interconnected on a mobile computer.

* I want to be able to crack open a smartphone/tablet, look at the pcb, and know what everything does

* If someone were to say ""build me a smartphone,"" I want to know everything that entails hardware-wise

Would this be ""system-level design"" or ""board-level design"" of mobile computing platforms? Maybe ""product development""?

In terms of depth I'm looking for a progression from

Circuits/VLSI &gt; Processor Core design/verificaton &gt; SoC design/verification &gt; ???

Let me know if you have an idea for how to put a label on this; I'm obviously stumbling around here. "
16r555,1,2013-01-17,[25/m] Was seeing a girl pretty exclusively then she told me she needed space,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/16r555/25m_was_seeing_a_girl_pretty_exclusively_then_she/,"Some background

It began last summer. We had been exchanging messages. She's 2-3 years younger, just graduated, and lived an hour and a half away. She graduated from my college and dated a friend of mine. She was looking for a job in the city so I thought I'd help her out since she was interested in the same industry I'm in. We spent the summer hanging out a lot with me visiting her, her visiting me, dinner, drinks, and eventually hooking up. Nothing too serious. I did meet her mom and brother and we kicked it off pretty well. It wasn't until later in the Fall/Winter where we got closer and emotionally invested in each other. We started calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend. We had small arguments with the majority of them being about my inability to communicate and open up to her but I definitely worked on it and texted/called her more regularly. Eventually she managed to score an internship in NJ, about 30 mins from her mom's house while working on the weekends at a small toy store in her hometown and thats when it began to change. The internship required her to move into her uncles for the weekdays and commuting back home on the weekends for her other job. We barely got to see each other but we still managed to see each other here and there.

It wasn't until New Years that I noticed she started to become more and more distant. She was originally going to come to NYC to party but ended up going to Rochester, Utica and Buffalo to party with her close friends from college. That's ok with me. She always talks about missing college, her friends, and stressing about her impending career so I thought nothing of it. I tried not to text her that often to avoid coming off as overbearing. But even when I did, she didn't really reply or replied late. I trust her so I'm assuming nothing happened but I could be dead wrong. Most of her friends are male, but then again, most of my friends are female. I'm trustworthy so she had nothing to worry about. I feel like these are things we ALL go through after college. We miss our friends and we're trying to find ourselves. No biggie, right? But it's like it became a priority for her. Fast forward to last week. Her friends (from H.S.) were supposed to come up last weekend to the city to party. She told me she thought she probably wouldn't be able to see me that weekend. That's fine with me. I'm pretty introverted and don't really like going out too often -- she knows about this. Regardless, they cancelled and rescheduled for this weekend. I had bought tix for her bday weeks ago for a dj set she wanted to see. She texted me, informing me her friends decided to celebrate her bday in the city and cancelled on me. She told me she really wanted to go but didn't want to bail on her friends that she hadn't seen in ages. I replied ""Whatever"" and told her I was bummed out, but she should go hang out with her friends. 

Fast forward to last Thursday, she called me because she said she couldn't hold it in anymore. She basically told me she felt she needed to take a step back to focus on herself, her career, etc. She knows her heart is not set on the city anymore and she wants to leave NJ. I feel the same about the city too but I don't talk about it that often. Me being understanding and having been there said I know what she's going through and I'm here for her. She knows I really like her, but I feel it's not reciprocated. Now I'm back where I started. We still text randomly but it's more of ""Hope you have a good week at work :)"" or things along those lines. I'm giving her space to get her shit together but it's frustrating to me. At this point, I disabled my facebook and told her I'm going to disappear for awhile to do the same. I've never been a confident person so I feel like this was an excuse/opportunity for me to indulge in myself and reexamine my life while she does the same.

Am I wasting my time waiting for her? "
16qyuu,0,2013-01-17,Hello r/frugal! Where my Schweizers at? Anyone have any frugal tips/side job experience in one of the most expensive countries in the world (Switzerland)?,smalrebelion,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/16qyuu/hello_rfrugal_where_my_schweizers_at_anyone_have/,"My story in a nut shell:

I'm a San Diegan who moved to Basel for a Masters in Biotechnology four months ago. My student visa doesn't allow me to work for the first 6 months I'm here and in that time I've blown through most of my savings (read: student loans). I'm looking to get back to budget neutral or even positive if it's possible. I've always alternated between 2 lifestyles: hemorrhaging cash or starving student so it would also be nice to hear advice on finding a comfortable medium.

Current Lifestyle:

Food:

Denner sells 1kg of pasta for ~$1  and pasta sauce for ~$1 so I don't eat much else. 1 of each is about 4,500 calories and lasts me about 2 days. A tube of 20 dissolvable multivitamin tablets costs ~$1 and lasts me about 2 weeks. About once a week I splurge and buy a kebab for ~$8. I know I should cut this out but there is only so much pasta I can handle and this is pretty much my only source of protein.

Income: 

I'm currently making &gt;$100 a week babysitting for two families. In 2 months I'll start looking for an internship and I'm currently looking into becoming a sperm donor thanks to another thread on r/frugal. I may also try to find work at a local scuba shop.

Fun:

I'm trying not to go to pubs as it's too easy to drop 40-50 dollars without even noticing it. Thepiratebay has been my best friend for entertainment. Who knew you could get Crisis 2 for Mac? I also visit my girlfriend in Göttingen every three weeks for ~$130 return. Carpooling hasn't proven to be very useful.

Living:

I found an incredibly good deal for my apartment ~$400 a month with internet, utilities etc.

The point:

Does anybody have any experience finding free entertainment and cheap food in Switzerland? Perhaps other high cost of living countries? Scandinavia comes to mind. Any commentary or advice on living cheaply is appreciated and if anyone is in Switzerland and wants to meet up for a session of oggling Swiss people jealously because they are so fucking rich and don't even know it I'm definitely in."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Do you know any lawyers that are like Saul Goodman on Breaking Bad? Sleazy and infomercial-type kinda lawyers? and what do you think of lawyers like that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3vus?context=5)|Sure. I read somewhere recently, I can't remember where exactly, that advertising is a tax you pay on not being very good at what you do. Obviously that's a pretty sweeping statement that isn't true in all cases, but it's true in a lot of instances in the legal field. I have met plenty of lawyers who I would never hire to represent me were I ever facing criminal charges.
[Should the average person have the number of a lawyer handy?  Do people go consult with a lawyer for free prior to any legal troubles, just so they know they have one available?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z75qd?context=5)|It's abnormal for someone to come to me prior to committing a crime, but it's not unheard of.
[I'm an attorney and I regularly deal with advertising with my firm. I would say that in personal injury you MUST advertise to survive. That said, in other legal fields advertising is just stupid (merger's and aquisitions for example\).  It's all context.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7zdm2z?context=5)|Oh, absolutely. My comment was related strictly to the criminal defense industry and not all lawyers. I'd agree with your assessment re PI lawyers.
[What do you think of those you are defending that you are sure have completed a heinous crime, but then are acquitted? Do you feel bad that a probably guilty, destructive person is out on the streets due* to your good work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3ien?context=5)|I can count on one hand, and I frankly don't need all my fingers, the number of times I've had someone who I believed was guilty of committing a heinous crime actually end up being acquitted of all charges.
[I have a friend who is a Criminal Defense Attorney, and we asked him the same question. He just responds by saying, ""I try to make sure they don't get the death penalty for robbing a gas station."" Is that similar to how you feel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z71q1?context=5)|That's a good way of putting it.
[*attempted manslaughter.*  Is that when you attempt to accidentally kill someone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z7l48?context=5)|Generally speaking attempted manslaughter results from injuring someone (short of murder) in the heat of passion.
[Perhaps not quite what you were expecting from the AMA but could you explain 'attempted manslaughter' please?  Also, do you enjoy your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z7c2j?context=5)|Attempted manslaughter is nearly universally borne out of self defense actions -- think A assaults B and B responds by shooting A but doesn't kill A. B is charged with attempted murder. B argues justification. Jury decides that B didn't intend to murder A, but overreacted to the threat A posed.
[Sorry to detract, but how exactly does someone get charged with 'attempted manslaughter'?  Isnt manslaughter accidentally killing someone? How can you attempt to accidentally kill someone?  Edit; nevermind, was answered below.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7zdvp9?context=5)|It's incredibly unlikely someone would get charged with attempted manslaughter. I've had one client convicted of attempted manslaughter. That case was a case where he was charged with two counts of attempted murder for shooting two people that were attacking him. I argued that he was justified in shooting them. The jury decided that he was justified in doing something, but that his actions were a bit of an overreaction, and they basically split the baby, so to speak, and ended up convicting him of attempted manslaughter.
[Maybe you aren't the best defense lawyer if all your clients go to jail??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z992f?context=5)|Your reading comprehension skills need work. Well, either that, or your inference skills.
 |Most of my clients avoid jail time.
[Most rewarding part of your job? Favorite kind of cases to work? Do you think drugs should be illegal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3ri3?context=5)|Most rewarding part of my job is an easy question to answer. A lot of people come to me after having made bad decisions that were borne out of desperation, be it familial, financial, or otherwise. Working through the system to ensure that these people's futures aren't horrifically damaged, and then seeing them come out on the other side of criminal charges with an opportunity to put a bad decision behind them and not have it limit their possibilities is a really rewarding scenario.
 |I don't know that I have a favorite type of case, because each case presents different obstacles and opportunities. I think generally my successes in drug cases make them interesting ones to take on.
 |I go back and forth on this question. What I never waiver on is that I think a lot of drugs should be legal in limited quantities. I also strongly believe that the system could do a better job dealing with those convicted of drug offenses to get them help and move them out of a system that can sometimes seem like a revolving door.
[How does it feel defending an obviously guilty person? Trying to get the scum of the earth off the hook? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z4jhe?context=5)|Legitimate question. I have control over what cases I take and what cases I pass on, so there's a bit of a slant to my answer that doesn't apply to the legal profession as a whole.
 |Most people know they're guilty if they're guilty. But most people I represent are guilty of something far short of what they're charged. I can point to numerous occasions when I've represented someone who was guilty of trespass but was charged with burglary. In a case like that, I don't feel bad representing someone who's obviously guilty of trespass and having them ultimately be acquitted of burglary.
[What is the weirdest case you have worked on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3isq?context=5)|Answered this in the last AMA, and I think it probably depends on your definition of weird.
 |The TL;DR version is that I represented an individual who hired an escort to come to his motel room and watch fetish pornography with him while he told her about his interests/fetishes, and then he paid her for her time with a combination of drugs and cash. Weird, weird fella, and weird, weird story.
[Why was he indicted?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3zui?context=5)|He gave drugs to someone as payment for services rendered. That's kind of sort of a no-no.
[How did he get caught? Did the prostitute just rock up to the police station one day and go ""hey hey, this guy paid me with some wack dope, yo. Put his ass in jail""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z6zwr?context=5)|Prostitute got scared by his fetishes and contacted the police.
[Which begs the question as to what it was.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7zclrm?context=5)|Not going to go into that much detail.
[Awww, you must be new here. That's kind of our thing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7zdq17?context=5)|The fetish? Or the detail? Ha.
 |Seriously though, it was some weird stuff.
[Everyone says law school is a horrible investment and there'\[in doing this for\]s no jobs these days, is there \[in doing this for\]still room for inexperienced people doing criminal defense?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3w5e?context=5)|I'd say law school is worth doing if you're absolutely certain you want to practice law and you aren't going to be coming out of school with an insane debt burden.
[How common are these for drug investigations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3w5e?context=5)|People gain experience doing criminal defense quickly. I know plenty of people who started out in a 2-3 person firm and after 12-24 months decided to go out on their own, and have made great careers for themselves.
[Just the kingpins making millions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3w5e?context=5)|Long-term wiretaps oftentimes get targeted at people the government thinks are kingpins, but often end up catching lower-level dealers and buyers, because a lot of the big players are smart enough not to get caught up in a lot of that, or they have other people doing their dirty work.
[Have they started using facebook very frequently for investigations yet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3w5e?context=5)|Generally speaking, I use facebook more often than the State, but I've absolutely seen cases where the State has facebook posts effectively.
[How much do prosecutors actually know about who's who in the drug game? Most genius/ dumbest schemes you have ever seen? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3zjl?context=5)|Most prosecutors know largely what the police tell them, and not much more. They don't have a ton of time to be investigating crime. A lot of the police officers that I've met are quite knowledgable at what's going on at the street level.
 |Most of the cases I take don't emanate from ""schemes"" per se, in that most of my clients are charged with one-time offenses that they didn't really plan out. I have seen some pretty elaborate schemes though -- such as clients replacing their phone every two-three weeks for fear of having it tapped (which is really annoying when you have to correspond with them).
[Definitely interested to hear how you use Facebook and how the State does.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z9g7h?context=5)|Research on witnesses' background of stories / testimony, basically. 
[Have you ever been threatened or come to physical harm?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z41py?context=5)|I've never had a client threaten me directly to the point where I was scared for my well-being. I fight hard for all of my clients, and I make it a point to treat each and every one of them like a human being and to respect them, and I think that results in a lot more courteous reaction from them. And I've never suffered any physical harm related to my job.
[What's the typical sentence for drug distributors? Do most snitch? How much does being an informant help peoples sentences? Do people still get in trouble for weed in Oregon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3mug?context=5)|The typical sentence varies based upon the person's criminal history, the type of drug, the amount of the drug, and other factors. I've seen drug sentences ranging from probation to multiple decades. For a first time offender, often drug offenses can result in probation sentences, and/or minimal jail time. It also depends on the jurisdiction you're in, and how common of a crime narcotics trafficking is.
 |A significant majority of my clients are not interested in being a snitch or an informant.
 |Being an informant can help if the client has actionable information that leads generally to multiple people far higher up on the food chain than themselves.
 |Large quantities of weed, yes.
[What's a large quantity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z72vo?context=5)|Depending on the jurisdiction something in excess of 50 pounds of MJ. Lesser weights for harder drugs.
[Have you handled cases involving the drug cartel of Mexico?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z40ks?context=5)|There are plenty of different cartels in Mexico, but yes, I've handled cases involving people involved with Mexican drug cartels.
[How dangerous are they?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z41mu?context=5)|In Mexico, they're ruthless, and I've heard horrific stories from past clients. In the United States, far less dangerous because of the fact that law enforcement here is frankly far better, and the threat of capture, prosecution, and imprisonment is far greater than the threat of a similar response in Mexico.
[What kind of stories did you hear?Any examples?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z42t4?context=5)|Nothing too terribly different from what gets reported in the mainstream media in the US -- kidnappings, mass killings, extortion, bribery of public officials, etc.
[Have you ever defended somebody you *knew* was innocent, but then lost the case?  What made you choose Criminal Defense over any other field of law? (currently in law school myself, trying to figure out where I want to end up\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z65pc?context=5)|Yes. It happened once, and the case got overturned thankfully on appeal. The year or so he spent in custody was pretty rough on him and his family, and me for that matter.
[What's the story on that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c805wll?context=5)|Guy and his wife live in a trailer, with a driveway and a fenced yard.
 |Guy's friend asks him if he can park a vehicle there for a month or so while he's away on business. Our guy says ""sure, no problem.""
 |The friend drives the car over and parks it in the yard. The friend hands our guy the keys and the friend takes off. Our guy puts the keys on a cork board in his entryway.
 |A couple of weeks later, cops are in the neighborhood on an unrelated matter, and end up running the plates on the car. The car comes back reported stolen out of a city about 250 miles away.
 |Lady who reported the vehicle stolen have a really weird story about leaving the keys in it, and then waited two days to report it.
 |Our guy's friend is nowhere to be found, and the cops can't track him down.
 |Our guy had a lock solid alibi for the day the car was stolen, and there was no communication (calls, emails, texts) between our guy and his friend immediately before or after the theft.
 |The car itself had no visible damage and it wasn't obvious from looking at the vehicle from the exterior that it was stolen.
 |Ultimately I argued that (1) the vehicle want ever really stolen, and that it was likely a case of fraud committed by the alleged victim and our guy's friend; (2) that even if the car was stolen, there was no evidence linking my guy to the theft; and (3) that when he took receipt of it, there was no indication it was stolen, and it wasn't unreasonable of him to keep it parked in the yard, because he honestly didn't know better.
 |At the conclusion of the trial, I moved for a directed verdict - which basically allows the judge to find the defendant not guilty before the case goes to the jury in an instance where the state hasn't proven every element of the crime. I was shocked when that was denied.
 |The case then went to the jury, and the jury found my guy guilty, which was equally shocking.
 |On appeal, the appellate court held that the trial judge should have granted my motion for a directed verdict and that there was no real evidence that my guy was guilty.
 |In the end, it all worked out, but it was really hairy there for a while.

 |There isn't enough space on the internet to answer your second questions. I could regale you with hundreds of instances where defendants were convicted or pled to an amended charge that resulted in a far more lenient sentence than the quantity of narcotics they were involved in trafficking merited.
[Have you ever been involved in a case where the jury clearly exercised Jury Nullification?  Even if prohibited from mentioning Nullification directly (as is the case in many courts, as I understand it\) have you ever tried to subtly hint to the jury that they can, indeed, return a finding based on their own moral beliefs about what is equitable, and not a strict adherence to the law as written?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z8td8?context=5)|Yea, a couple of times. I can remember one specific case where I had a client who was very likable and relatable, charged with DUI for ""driving"" a vehicle a few hundred feet in order to have her roommate, who was sober, drive them home.
[Do you often talk to jurors after a trial, to see what they were thinking and what influenced their decision one way or the other?

[What is the worst sentence one can receive for DUI?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z40eq?context=5)|Depends on the state, and on the person's record of previous DUIs. Assuming the defendant didn't hit anything/anyone and you didn't cause any injury/death, there are states that have such a thing as extreme, or super extreme DUI that can result in felony prison time.

[Thanks for the reply. As a follow up: Are you ever willing to concede on a ""technicality"" during a trial and allow a flawed process be ignored (I'm not saying made admissible\) for the fact s to emerge or do you just look for a way to get your client out of the hot seat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7zbdeb?context=5)|Sometimes you do avoid arguing a ""technicality."" I can think of numerous cases where my client's statement to police came in violation of Miranda, but helped the theory I was advancing, so I wanted to keep the statement in, and thus never challenged its admissibility under Miranda.
[Probably too late, but, serious question: What are you supposed to do when the cop asks the cliche question, ""Do you know how fast you were going?""...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7zkhwr?context=5)|My general rule of thumb is that any admission against your own interest is going to come back to bite you.

[I was a heroin addict living in Baltimore for years. I have been working on sobriety the past few years,  but I came out of everything with a few misdemeanor possession charges, and an intent to distrubute charge. A few of them are on probation before judgement, but what can I do to either make the rest go away, or at least make them invisible/harder to find for potential employers? Any tips?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z8yio?context=5)|Once you've completed all of your probation, find a lawyer who will work with you to get your convictions set aside. It'll cost you probably 1k or so, but it'll be worth every penny.
[I'm currently filling out my law school applications. For the character and fitness section, I need to disclose that I was arrested for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia quite a few years back. The charges were subsequently diverted and are completely off of my record, however from my research I still need to fully disclose any interactions with law enforcement.  My question to you is: what is the best way for me to word this encounter, that would look most favorable to the admissions council? I was considering: ""I was arrested for *suspicion* of possession of marijuana...of which the charges were subsequently diverted"" Is this dishonest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z753u?context=5)|I doubt something like simple possession + paraphernalia would have much of an adverse impact.

They're great lawyers now, and nobody cares, or frankly knows, that they didn't pass the first time (or second time) around.
[From what I understand, if pulled over for a DUI you can refuse a breathalyzer. The same source, (I think it was an ACLU video\) said that if you are arrested and brought back to the station, at that point refusing a breathalyzer may have consequences / charges. It seems odd that you can't be charged for refusing it out in the 'field', but you can if you're taken back to the station. Any idea why that is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z6mu2?context=5)|There's a difference between refusing a preliminary breath test (PBT) and refusing a breathalyzer (actual breath test).
[Also.. what is your impression of the Supreme Court case being heard now concerning warrantless blood tests in DUI cases?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z6mu2?context=5)|That supreme court case could have really far-ranging impacts on the criminal justice system.
[Ah, thank you for the clarification.  According to the reporting that came out when oral argument was heard, they seemed inclined to accept the argument that a warrantless blood test is a violation of the 4th amendment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7zdcc2?context=5)|Yea, that was my sense from reading the reports. That said, oftentimes the questioning at oral argument can lead one to conclude the court is leaning one way, when in fact they come down on the opposite side. The court's decision on the Affordable Healthcare Act is one instance of this.

I've since graduated, found a good job.  At this point, I'm obligated to stay with my current company till shortly after I turn 29.  I'm fairly confident that I could score as well, if not better on the LSAT, than I did when I was an irresponsible dumbass kid.

When I was in law school, the number of 30+ students was pretty close to that of the &lt; 30 students. 
[A friend of mine is a prosecutor and he tells me that for them they gauge a win to be where they get a conviction. For the public defenders in his area, they call it a win if they don't get the maximum sentence.

Whether he's legally culpable is another story. That said, the more I hear about his intense planning, the less I believe he was insane. 
[Thank you for your response. Most of what I read is on Wiki and believe he is guilty as well.  However, my wife and her friends are questioning things because apparently there is a conspiracy theory out there that he didn't act alone and that the government is attempting to cover some things up.

[I just had a question that I wondered if you knew the answer too. I heard this on Reddit a long time ago and so I wanted to see if it is true or not. A guy said that he owned a home and had his girlfriend living with him at the time. Eventually they had somewhat of a fallout and so he asked her to pack and leave before he got back home the next day from work. When he came back the next day he found out that all his locks were changed and that she basically invited her new boyfriend into his home and did not allow him to go in and kick them out. He spoke with the officials and for some odd reason, even though he had proof that he was the owner of the home, they said they couldn't help him out.  What I wanted to know is, is all of that possible? Can the police really do nothing, and if not what CAN you actually do legally?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z8ufz?context=5)|I'm not an expert in property law, but that sounds pretty fishy. 
[In my area, the judge states that he does not have to sentence you to your signed deal. Is this true? What happens if he decides on a different sentence?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7zfk4b?context=5)|Generally speaking, all standard pleas contain a provision that if the judge sentences you outside of the accepted range in the deal, you can withdraw from the plea immediately and it's as if you never plead to anything. 
[I got carjacked at gunpoint in November2011 one suspect testified against the other One got q 5 year jail sentence an the other is still waiting trial. Is there anyway I can get composition? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z8yy3?context=5)|Probably not likely. You can have restitution ordered through the sentencing judge, but collecting on that would be difficult.
[If the person you're defending tells you they're guilty, that they actually committed the crime, do you still defend them and act as though their innocent? Do your morals get in the way, will you drop a client?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z9eju?context=5)|Generally speaking, someone's own interpretation of their guilt is meaningless because they're not familiar with the statutes they're accused of violating. Morals do get in the way at times, and I've turned down plenty of cases because of how I felt about a client or a specific crime.
[Is the smell of marijuana probably cause for a search? What about rolling papers? Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z6n8b?context=5)|Depends on the jurisdiction. There are states where burnt marijuana smell can amount to PC to search, and there are states where fresh marijuana specifically doesn't amount to PC to search.
[Have you ever had someone that you knew was guilty and you considered throwing the case on purpose?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z6gbv?context=5)|No. Generally if they know they were guilty, they want a plea.

How do you react when someone you are defending asks you to act in a way thats manipulating the system?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7za3of?context=5)|I tell my clients that my reputation is frankly one of their biggest assets. I don't file frivolous motions for the sake of filing them or making the other side do work, and my clients understand that.
[E.g. asking you to make pointless motions (that they know are pointless\) in hopes the prosecutor will offer a better plea deal to avoid it or to cause issues relating to the right to a speedy trial.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7za3of?context=5)|If I lose my credibility, it hurts my client as much as it hurts me.
[I sat on a jury for a domestic violence case. After finding a not guilty verdict, we spoke with the prosecution who said these cases are usually very difficult to prosecute.  Similarly, Is there a type of case that is in general very difficult to defend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z7rg2?context=5)|Any case involving wiretap evidence is really difficult to defend because you can have multiple hundreds of hours of tapes to review to try to find something meaningful in defense of a client.

[How do you determine all that based on occupation and looking at the person? how much of it is a gut feeling?  In both cases, I noticed that teachers/educational professionals and doctors/medical people would be excluded. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7za7xg?context=5)|A lot of it is gut feeling, but there are specific indicators / answers we look for. Generally the more a prospective juror says, the more reasons I or the prosecutor have to strike them from the panel.
[I will be participating in a mock trial in Febuary and I will be a defense lawyer. Do you have ant tips on opening/ closing statements, cross examination, or anything in general I should know? ( This mock trial case will be a first degree murder by the way.\)  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z9fj9?context=5)|In your open, don't promise things you might not be able to deliver.
 |On cross, ask leading questions almost exclusively that will elicit the answers you need. Don't ask questions that aren't critical to your case because this will waste time and bore the judge/jury.
 |In close, be passionate, be an advocate, and be thorough. Have a theme.
[Hi. Thank you for doing an AMA.  Did you ever fall in love with one of  your clients?  Did you ever intentionally defend your client even though you knew they were guilty?  Do you think the prison term they get is appropriate for the crime they have committed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z9eof?context=5)|No. Yes. Defending doesn't mean ""trying to get an acquittal."" Often, my role is to find the best possible plea deal. More often than not, yes.
[If I commit a crime in Dallas Tx then commence a car chase to New York, New York, which results in my arrest there, where will I go to jail?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z9f52?context=5)|Initially New York, but you'll very likely be extradited quickly to Dallas. Assuming the crime is ""large"" enough to warrant extradition.
[How often do you represent people who you believe are 100% innocent of the charges against them? How often do such people end up being convicted?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z9act?context=5)|It happens with some regularity, and they're generally acquitted or their case ends up being dismissed in advance of trial.

[Hey, are you a fan of suits?  Also ever represented someone that you knew we're guilty but you're just doing your job?!  If so what was the most gruesome case?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z99c9?context=5)|Haven't ever watched suits. I answered your other questions elsewhere.
[Is there a definitive amount of marijuana that escalates the charges from misdemeanor intent to sell to felony trafficking, does it vary state to state?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z9bn9?context=5)|Varies state to state. And most states have a threshold amount that escalates the charge from a ""meh"" felony to a ""you're screwed"" felony.
[Why do judges allow so many cops to get away with lying on the stand, and so obviously? Why aren't these cops charged with perjury, as a real, regular citizen would be? Also, we all know cops tack on false charges, how do you prefer to deal with them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7zev6j?context=5)|Police officers get a bad rap in much the same way that lawyers do. 3-5% of the procession spoils it for the vast majority.

I am also working as an undergrad researcher. I research off-grid energy flow models. In short I use Simulink to model off-grid homes with solar panels and local battery storage.  Recently, I've applied for my dream job - internship at Tesla Motors. I have excellent grades, and I am good with electronics and programming. However I realize that I have a few downfalls. First, my university is not the most affluent in the area (CSU Sacramento). I also realize that hundreds of people apply online with similar amounts of skills and it usually comes down to the numbers game - years of relevant experience, GPA, connections, and luck. In short, I have grades and relevant experience(batteries and sensors), but I have no connections and I don't rely on luck. Thus, I realize that if I don't remind Tesla's recruiters or HR about my existence the chance of me getting to the interview stage is approaching 0. I have no contact information for any of the Tesla recruiters or HR, neither does my school's career department.

I have applied online. Now where your help might come in handy. Do you have any suggestion on what to do to increase my chances? Any tips, suggestions, or advise would be appreciated. If someone knows a way to get noticed by the Tesla's recruiters or any other Tesla's engineers - I am all ears(well, an eyes in this case). Also on the off beat chance that someone knows a Tesla recruiter...

16twvy,0,2013-01-18,Surface RT or Pro,swinebone,Surface,https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/16twvy/surface_rt_or_pro/,"I've had a very hard time choosing between the RT and Pro. I've also been considering the Thinkpad Tablet 2, but I'm partial to the Surface line because I want to support Microsoft directly and I feel like the build quality is head and shoulders above any other current Win8 tablet. 

My main uses will be in grad school and at my internship at a local psych hospital. Ideally, I'd like a tablet that has a digitizer pen, but that seems to kick the price up a few hundred dollars immediately. I've also heard many conflicting reports about Clover Trail tablets; I'm skittish about Atom anyway. 

Other than inking, I'd like access to a decent app catalogue and Office. I know the Surface has both of those, but are there any apps or workarounds for something like Zotero or Endnote? I use citation management software often and I'd like to have access on my tablet. 

Finally, I'd also be concerned that if I get the Pro it would be overkill. I already own a laptop that I don't intend to replace or sell and therefore I'm not too certain I'd like to pay for something with an i5. 

At the end of all my rambling, I guess it really comes down to the RT or the Thinkpad Tablet 2. The Surface has amazing build quality and is Microsoft hardware while the Tablet 2 has a digitizer and better docking support. "

The statistical benefits associated with the presence of a Doula:

However, I'm going to be at a natural birthing center, I don't even have the option for half that shit anyways. Am I missing something here? Do I really neeeeeeeeed a doula? To me it seems like just another person to have appointments with and that I have to get to know and more money and hassle.

16tjn8,3,2013-01-18,Question for those with Clover Trail tablets,swinebone,windows8,https://www.reddit.com/r/windows8/comments/16tjn8/question_for_those_with_clover_trail_tablets/,"I have been wanting a Win8 tablet since they were announced but I've forced myself to wait until at least the Surface Pro is released and is reviewed. I would *love* a Surface Pro, but I'm not sure if I could swing a $1000 device on my graduate student salary. I've been looking at other options, including the Thinkpad Tablet 2 and the Surface RT.

I imagine using my hypothetical Win8 tablet as a companion device, as I already have an X220 that I use as both a mobile powerhouse and a desktop of sorts. I'd like to use a tablet to pen notes in OneNote for both class, work, and my internship, so a digitizer stylus isn't 100 percent necessary but I would love to have one. Other than inking, I don't foresee using whatever I pick as anything more than what people use other tablets like the iPad for. But Win8 tablets have Office, so there we go.

For those of you with tablets that have Clover Trail processors, how does has it ended up running for you? I've heard conflicting reports about this latest iteration of Atom processors' performance, with some people saying they're really slow and others saying they're perfectly fine.

Again, in an ideal world I'd love a Surface Pro, but I'm beginning to believe that it'd be dumb for me to buy a Pro when I have a great laptop that I have no plans to sell, get rid of, or replace."

16sy6l,0,2013-01-18,The stare,KillTheKinderPS3,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/16sy6l/the_stare/,"I might as well start off by telling you who I am. I'm JJ. I live in a rural town with the population barely peaking over 500 people.  I'm unemployed living with my mother and my brother Ryan who is 8. I'm 18 and we get along just fine...until the night of December 18th through the 27th.
I am a heavy sleeper but my brother has insomnia and he just watches shitty cartoon reruns on the television. The night of December 18th, I was awoken by my brother telling me that he heard the sound of tiny pebbles being thrown at my window that points at my neighbor house across the street. ""JJ I'm scared, I think someone keeps hitting our window with rocks."" Pissed off, I said, ""Ryan you have school tomorrow, it's probably one of my friends trying to scare you."" He agreed and he finally fell asleep.

That was only the first night of these ""pebbles"" being thrown at my window. I know my friends would never do such a thing because I only have 1 best friend. 

I wake up mid morning on the 19th. Mom was at work and Ryan just left for school. As I was drinking my coffee, my curiosity kicks in. I thought to myself, ""My brother seemed terrified. I might as well go take a look outside."" As I open my front door I see my neighbor Dennis across the street. He is in his mid 60's and let me tell you, he is the strangest man I ever spoke to. ""Morning JJ"" He said to me smiling. I smiled and proceeded to my bedroom window. I get on my toes to see if there were any cracks in my window. Nothing. I laughed it off thinking my brother was too exhausted and heard things. To my amazement, I was wrong. Right in front of me were six pebbles about the size of my pinky nail. I looked behind me and saw Dennis smiling asking if I needed help. I shook my head no and went back inside.

Around 7 o'clock the in the evening everyone was settled in bed. I could hear my mom chatting with her boyfriend and the sound of Spongebob playing. Ryan asked me, ""JJ. You are tough. Will you fight off the bad guys who threw rocks at the window?"" ""Ryan!"" I yelled, ""there is no time for games. If you hear anything, wake me up."" He had no idea about the pebbles. 

Again, I woke up around 3 in the morning. ""JJ, I hear something outside. Please look, I'm scared."" I rolled out of bed to have a look. My vision is blurry, I didn't feel the need to put on my glasses. I faintly see Dennis watching television behind his faded curtains. Ryan creeps up behind me and whispers, ""No bad guys?"" ""No bad guys Ryan."" I went to the kitchen to start my coffee for the morning and all I hear are footsteps running towards me. ""JJ I LOOKED OUTSIDE AGAIN AND DENNIS LOOKED AT ME."" Ryan said in a quiet yell. I was still groggy and I held his hand and walked him to bed. 

""See? He is sleeping, no lights are on""
 ""But JJ I-""
 ""Ryan, Dennis is old. He probably wanted to see if it was raining.""

Ryan curls up in with his Spongebob blankets and passes out. (He is obsessed with Spongebob.) I stayed awake for the next hour wondering why Dennis up. This was not normal of him to be up this late. To sooth my thoughts I watched some television and went to bed.

The next day rolls by. I must have slept in. I heard my mother yell, ""Get up! I had dinner waiting an hour ago!"" I got up, threw on my glasses and ate some shitty T.V. dinner. Of course, nobody wanted to throw away the trash so I tied it up and left when I finished. Again, I see Dennis walking down the street. He smiled underneath the streetlight. He has this grin that makes his stick out like a sore thumb. Stained teeth with his wad of tobacco always in his lip with this grin that seemed to stare into my soul. I quickly went inside to play my video game.

I slowly started to pass out on the ancient couch. I finally passed out, but the last thought I had was about Dennis.

I was in mid dream and I heard someone fall. I look over at the Grandfather clock. I could only make out a 4. I glance over to see Ryan, nearly pale. ""Dude, you okay?"" He shakily answered, ""D-Dennis smiled at me through his window."" Hearing this made me think this had to be true. I told him to sleep with mommy while I talk to Dennis.

I open my front door and with a head of steam, marched across the vacant street. I knock. ""JJ my dear boy, you woke me up. What's the matter youngin'? Kids ding-dong ditchin' your house? Let me tell you the kids people do for entertainment nowadays."" I spoke about his voice and said, ""None of that sir. My brother keeps telling me you are looking at him through your window. Dennis looked extremely puzzled. ""Why no, I fell asleep hours ago. He shouldn't even be awake. It's Friday morning JJ. Doesn't he have a quiz tomorrow"" He smiled jokingly. I shook my head and told him I was going home.

Now nothing has happened for a few days. No noises, no Dennis. I cannot get him out of my mind. Is Ryan correct? He never does this. So the morning I call Aden, my best friend to tell him the situation. He tells to stop worrying about it and smoke more weed. Unfortunately, he is an pothead with barely any knowledge of anything at all but he does love my photos on my camera. He tells me I should try to be an intern for my paper. What a joke. He decided to stay over for the night for comfort. Again, no Ryan waking up. I now got Dennis out of my head.

I awaken on the 22st of December to the scrumptious smell of eggs and bacon. Of course, Aden ate most of it. I sat down with my mother and she tell me, ""Aden left. Sadly, I am going away for the weekend. However, I have a business meeting with my boss today about a promotion. We can move!"" I was relieved. ""But mom, what about Ryan? He is a ball of energy, how on Earth do I watch over him?"" She chuckled and said, ""Your  a big kid now. I need to go hunny. I love you."" She kisses me on the cheek and grabs her suitcase and off she went. For the remainder of the day I played video games with Ryan and talked about nonsense things with Aden over the phone.

As night comes along, I am exhausted. I guess smoking pot and staying up until 5 was a bad idea. I was about to go to bed but I went outside for some air and noticed Aden's can of chew was next to my window. I knew it was his because he always peeled off the wrappings around the Skoal can. Him and Dennis chew the same type of product, so they get along well. Dennis always talked about how Aden chews more than him, which is completely false. Dennis kills a can a day. I left Aden's chew where I found it and went inside for some shuteye. Again, no Ryan pushing me rapidly to wake me up. 

The next morning I took Ryan to the mall to see Santa and God damn was it annoying. Nothing annoys me more than little kids screaming for some imaginary figure. I told Ryan to go sit on his lap while I walk in to the tobacco shop for a cigar. Damn, 3.45 for this one cigar? Oh well. I went to purchased it. I got chills down my spine when I heard this old man's voice. ""My favorite type of cigar! Black and Mild!"" There he stood Dennis with a can of chew in his hand. I stuttered to get my words together. ""Yeah, I like this one."" I scrambled to find my brother getting his candy cane from Santa. He seemed so joyful.

 I took him home to play some Guitar Hero that Aden let me borrow. Out of randomness, he asked, ""JJ. What are you a-scared of?"" ""Getting any type of cancer."" He knew I smoked cigars on occasion. ""JJ. Stop smoking them then."" Pissed off, I responded. ""Time for bed. Mommy texted me."" Of course that was a lie. I took him to bed. Before I left the living room, he took my camera. ""Just in case I get scared at night, I will take a picture of Dennis' house."" Excitedly, I said, ""Hahaha, gonna be a photographer like me, eh?"" He smiled and went to bed. 

Nothing important happened the 26th; same shit, different day. The night of the 27th is where Ryan used my camera. I woke up to the sun beaming through my blinds. I know for a fact I did not put them down. I bump into my brother sleeping in my bed. He woke up with ease and said, ""JJ I heard something at the window. It was too scared to look so I took a picture. I don't know how to open the picture."" I grabbed it from him and turned it on. It died soon afterwards, which was strange because I charged it the day Aden left. I went to plug it into my computer in my mother's room, and the Sony camera program opened up. I clicked on the picture folder and Ryan did take a photo. After a minute and a large deep breath later, I forced myself to open it. I was in utter shock. Complete and utter shock. I saw I lip with chew packed in a lip with Aden's can. Etched on the top of the can said one word. Hello. It was Dennis. 

I cannot explain how much shock I am in now. I grabbed Ryan and took him in my car to Grandma's house. He loved it there so I know grandma will look after him for a few days until mom comes home. As soon I dropped him off, I quickly called Aden. It rang 4 times and went to voicemail. I called again and instantaneously he answered. One word was spoken over the phone. ""Hello."" Holy shit. That was Dennis and in the background I heard Aden's muffled voice. I could not make out a single word of his. I'm on my way to Dennis' house now. I will get back to you guys as soon as I can. Don't bother calling the cops. They are more worried about robberies and shootings."

I went into detox late November, but my treatment was costing me $320 a day out of pocket. I was only there for 5 &amp; half days and when my counselor mentioned keeping me another 21-30 I snapped. The combination of losing access to the internet, financial costs, and hellish withdraws made me miserable. 

I was addicted to alcohol and klonopin and was pretty bad with my addiction. After they did an assessment on me I was rated ""moderate to severe."" I could of died from the withdraws. I deteriorated the lining of my stomach so bad it got infected about a year ago. I was puking blood and spent a day in the hospital. 

The biggest reason for me not to go is the financial cost, and I'm still enrolled in college and the semester started this week. I know very well that most of my money goes towards drugs so I've probably spent anywhere from 4-6 grand just this year. I can make arrangements to get my schooling taken care of, or I can drop out and risk my completion rate. I'll also have to admit to all my family and friends that I've been lying about my drug use again, but I have lied about it for years so this shouldn't be an issue. 

I have done great things though while doing drugs. I got a great internship for a fortune 500 company my senior year in high school. My current and previous managers love me and compliment my work frequently. I had a 3.2 GPA and I was about to get into the honors society (last semester was rough.) Admittedly I've gotten progressively worse but I have always been powerless to drugs. 

Typing this out has really helped, but I know it's not a cure. I love drugs and I know I'm just going to get worse. I would be lying if I said I didn't want to die. Life just doesn't seem worth it most of the time. I don't really have anyone to talk to, and I think I've struggled with adversity most of my life. I was molested by my older cousin and my father till I was like 10 or so. I have memories of abuse happening in every house I lived in. I was in 1st-3rd grade when it ended. I don't have a good recollection of my childhood, in fact a lot of these memories were repressed. I remember nearly every Saturday morning well. My dad and step-mother would joke about how much I loved sleeping because they would have to get me out of bed at noon, but in reality it's the exact opposite. I have insomnia and have a very, very difficult time falling asleep without any drugs. I used to just lie in bed because I was safe there and to afraid to leave my room. My dad later told me he took medication for OCD and anger. He would become irate over the littlest things so I was constantly on edge. The custody was changed to where I only saw him when I wanted when I was 10-13 years old, so I didn't see him as much after that but the damage had already been done. I briefly tried moving in with them when I graduated high school, but he yelled to one of my young brothers ""I'm gonna kick your fucking ass"" because my brother was being too loud and I changed my mind. 

I haven't really talked to him much since June 2011. I'm happy about it but I get really, really depressed when I think about my two younger brothers. I miss them so much I'm nearly crying typing this out. I can't be there to protect them. They are obese and get picked on a lot. They are twins and I caught them giving each other handjobs once so I'm pretty sure they were molested by our father too. 

The last time I talked with my father he told me he has serious migraines now and spends a lot of time lying down. I couldn't be happier to hear it. I know that a lot of kids will sometimes say that they wished their parents were dead but I've never really been like that. I hope he lives a very long life and I'm happy knowing it's miserable.

My mother isn't a great person and makes mistakes. My mom started giving me drugs and I eventually gave her drugs too. She divorced my father when I was about 2. She was having an affair on my step-father while he was in Iraq and Kosovo (he's in the Marines), they divorced when he got back and I was maybe 12. My mom left me home alone a lot of nights. I remember I loved it because I could watch girls gone wild all night and later I could do dangerous drugs but in retrospect that wasn't good for me. I would be a lot harder on my mom, but I feel really bad for her because she has worked really hard for me and her boyfriend is abusive. We don't talk much. Most of our conversations end in arguments. To give you an idea of what my mom is like I'll provide a little story. I had a memory of seeing my dad in the door frame of my room one really late night. He asked me if I was awake and he was naked. When I first thought about how scared I was of him that moment I started having a panic attack. I told my mom about this memory and she tried to kick me out of the house. Her reasoning was that she is miserable being around me and didn't want me around her. I really, really want to move out, but I have no idea where to begin. 

I also live with the guilt of physically and mentally handicapping a toddler, but it's a long story. The tldr is that I was supposed to be watching him, but I was watching TV. So the 2 year old plummeted down a spiral metal staircase. 

I really wish I was stronger than this. I'm trying keep my chin up and be positive but it's getting difficult. I have thought about committing suicide often. Honestly the only thing that keeps me going are drugs. I sometimes wish I could be religious or spiritual, but I'm too bitter. The world seems so dark. I think it's very sad that I'm wasting my life because I have so many great opportunities.

If you took the time to read my life story I thank you. I know it's long and not particularly uplifting.

edit* I guess I should mention that my major is human services and I'd like to be a CPS agent or mental therapist. I want a job where I help people but I can't even help myself. I also posted this in r/depresson"

I'm 24 - working for a big company for 18 months now, making $58k. 

**Assets:**

* Roth IRA - I put 5k into this after an internship and it's managed by mum's financial advising company. Should I move it elsewhere? Leave it? It's at about 5,800 right now. I'm not actively contributing to it.

* 401 (k) - This is through my company. They match up to 6% and put in a base 4%. I originally was at the 6% minimum, then upped it to 10% and now I've increased it to 20% (this is the value you will see on the coming spreadsheet). This is at 13k.

* Emergency Fund - I have none. I know this will be the first thing people will tell me to fix.

* I have about $600 in a bank account, as I just got back from a trip and spent a good amount.

**Debts -**

* Car Loan - $11k, paying $266 a month - 3.74% APR - Blue book on the car is about 9k.

* Loan from Mother - $5.1k - was $9k, and I've been direct depositing 100 a week into her account. This is what I have instead of Student Loans.

* Credit Union Line of Credit - $1800 - 10% APR. I used this to pay down my Visa (26% APR) and Amex (13% APR) which are now both at 0

**Budget**

Right now, I'm having my paycheck be split into 3 places (after 401k and taxes are taken out)

* Credit Union - $200 a week - this is where i pay my Car loan and line of credit from

*Mom's account - $100 a week - this is where I pay her back from

*  Bank checking account - Remainder - this is where the rest goes

Here is my current budget:
http://i.imgur.com/8F6kh.png

My car insurance is very high. It actually just dropped by $80 a month because I moved to a lower risk city. That should drop when I hit 25, but for now I'm just driving safer.
I read in another thread someone suggesting cutting a Gym membership. I find the spending of the funds to be a strong incentive to get into the gym, and for right now, while I'm trying to get back in shape, I won't eliminate that.

**Retirement/Investment Help**

The 401k contribution is at 20%. I understand I should probably drop it, but something a friend said once stuck with me. If you just overload it in the first ten years, you can cut your contributions back drastically, as the gains on that nest egg will probably surpass what you can contribute at that time. Here are my options for a 401k funds. http://i.imgur.com/htUpi.png 
I would really appreciate it any input on these. I am currently contributing 

* 15% Hotchkis &amp; Wiley Diversified Val

* 15% Morgan Stanley Small Co Growth I

* 15% Dreyfus/The Boston Co Small Cap Value I

* 55% Custom Retirement Target Date 2055 Fund

My Roth IRA. Like I said before, I haven't touched that since the originally 5k deposit. I feel iffy about putting more money into the hands of a small city Financial Adviser. However, I think I should be contributing to this as well as my 401k, so I'm a bit stuck. Should I take it out of their control (can you do that?) or just open a different Roth IRA?

Index Funds - I approached a friend who has been earning more money since graduating from school about what he's been doing with it. I think, beyond a 401k, he's managing his personal money through a Vanguard account and is investing in Index Funds, which he says are a good bet if you don't want to toy around with stuff too much.

Thank you for reading and providing any feedback!"

We are very in love...but things are going to be changing soon. I am a senior in high school and he is a junior (we both started school late). I am applying for college and will more likely than not be out of state. He has said that he is ok with that and wants to stay together no matter what. We seem to talk more about him going to college than me...when I am the one leaving in 6 months. He seems less upset than me about my leaving. Sometimes I just think, what's the point of staying together? Another reason I am upset is that last week we went out with some friends and he told everyone that he was leaving in the summer for a month to do an internship across the country. I had to leave and started crying when I got home. I was upset because he didn't even think about telling me this privately first and also because he's leaving before me and doesn't seem to mind. He is still adamant that he will love me no matter how far apart we are... but I'm not quite as secure. Of course, I want to be supportive, but I think it will take time. I sometimes get into phases where I get really insecure, especially in our relationship. This may be one of those phases...but it feels different. I need advice. Am I blowing all this way out of proportion?





tldr; boyfriend and I will grow distant when I go to college and he goes to an internship. Is it worth staying together?"
16w0xb,5,2013-01-19,My Story,[deleted],stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/16w0xb/my_story/,"I'm new to this, and I'm looking for any kind of input, because I really want to get things under control.

When I was 16 I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and I was put on the highest possible dose of Cymbalta. I don't know if it's the Cymbalta or the way my body reacts to alcohol, but drinking has never gone very well for me. The first few times I got drunk in college I had crippling panic attacks or I would end up making out with a friend when I was already in a serious relationship. When I got a fake ID at 19, I found I didn't get as drunk because I didn't want to get caught and I found alcohol had lost it's appeal because it was easier to get. But then, one night I blacked out for the first time at a bar with some friends and ended up waking up in a hotel room of strangers downtown with no idea how I got there. I was raped when I had only been with one man my entire life and I planned on marrying him. It was devastating for me, and I definitely used alcohol to cope. I drank to the point of blacking out 4-5 times a week, I was always the drunkest person at parties, and I was that pathetic drunk girl making out with any guy who showed interest. I ended up in the hospital once and my roommates kicked me out after I brought a guy over who left after I passed out, but first puked in our living room and dug through my roommates drawers. When I turned 21 I started drinking to the point of urinating myself any time I passed out. This is really embarrassing for me, because it's happened in cabs, in stranger's beds, and it's ruined a mattress for me. I graduated college and waitressed at a sports bar and started drinking after 3am on a regular basis so I could unwind and sleep. Around this time I had a guy break up with me because he thought I was going to end up dead from drinking and he was sick of me peeing in his bed. A few months later I finally get my life together and meet an amazing guy who introduces me to weed, and I stop drinking altogether. I didn't need it anymore because I was happy and content, and if I wanted to unwind I'd smoke and go running. This fall I started grad school and I had to stop smoking to get an internship, so I turned to drinking again and it's all gone back to shit. I ended up in a threesome I didn't want, I pushed a friend into the sidewalk, I passed out in an alleyway, and I keep waking up on the floor covered in my own vomit and piss. My boyfriend is getting sick of me, I can tell. Last night we went to a wine and cheese party and once I realized everyone was getting drunk I proceeded to get wasted. I passed out in a chair and had to be carried to my boyfriend's car. I'm finally in the process of weaning off the Cymbalta, which I've been on for 6 years at the highest dose, so I'm hoping this Russian Roulette of getting black out whether I have one drink or ten.

I'm 22 now, and my life is good, but I want to learn how to control this. I don't want to lose the most amazing person I've ever met because I need some chemical escape. "
16vrw5,0,2013-01-19,To what point is it the responsibility for an SO to comfort and reassure their SO?,[deleted],AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/16vrw5/to_what_point_is_it_the_responsibility_for_an_so/,"Hi AskWomen! I would appreciate if you read my post. I follow this hread closely and really like the number of strong and independent women on this thread. Please tell me what you think -oh and I would live to hear from the men as well, as long as you clarify what gender you are!

I am 19F and just in the beginnings (3months) of the most serious relationship yet. I am very inexperienced with relationships, and I suspect that I may be having too-high expectations of my SO. Let me explain:

I have a lot of stress in my life due to family and financial issues, and I can be really upset or disappointed if I can't be the best I can be (eg being a good daughter, breadwinner of the family, taking care of my autistic brother, straight As, keeping up with internships, being a good and caring friend, etc...). I get pretty stressed if I fail myself or my friends or family. When ingot into a relationship with my SO, who I truly care for, I expected that he would automatically want to me feel better whenever I was extremely down (I would gladly do the same). However, it seems more like that he will listen, give a few half-hearted pieces of advice, then move onto the original topic of conversation or some jokes. 

I asked my friend about this, and she said that while it is essential that both people communicate their problems, it isnt mandatory for the person to always comfort their SO, because an SO isn't a therapist. She also suggested that maybe guys prefer to minimize problems rather than talk and discuss and comfort. 

This made me feel really sad and confused, because that means that whenever I need comfort or reassurance my friends are the better people to talk with, not my SO. And I guess I foolishly thought that an SO would be that one person in the world I could always share my insecurities and feelings with.

What are your thoughts on this? Am I being too immature to expect my SO to cheer me up during the times when things are difficult? I can understand he may not always want to cheer me up all the time, but the fact that my friends care more abou comforting me than him makes me a little sad. Or is it a gender thing like she suggested?

Lastly, could you give me any advice about being able to stay strong/not be gloomy whenever you face tough moments in your life?

Thank you!"
16vlfm,7,2013-01-19,Combining internship with freelance work (newbie web-developer)? Also: What exactly is an internship?,solid_steel,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/16vlfm/combining_internship_with_freelance_work_newbie/,"I want to break into the web-development field. I already made the first steps, I have a website, a portfolio of code, and I contribute to opensource a bit.

After looking for entry-level jobs on CS and a bunch of other sites, I see that entry-level means ""at least a year of this, this, that, and this"", which I don't exactly meet. So I started looking for internships and I have two interviews setup next week, which is pretty damn sweet.

I know this will sound funny to most of you but - what exactly is an internship? The ads only mentioned 15-20 hours of work per week, one mentioned a stipend and the other a ""daily rate"". How reliable are internships? What can I expect salary-wise?

My second set of questions pertain to freelance work. I have a goal amount of money I need to make in 7 months so I thought that in addition to an internship I could do freelance web-design/dev. I found that online freelancing services are flooded with workers from the near, middle, and far east so I was hoping to set up shop locally ie. cold call local businesses, present my offer, and maybe snag business. Does this seem viable in New York City?

Maybe I should ditch my dream job for now and go for steadier employment as a PC helpdesk/support as I already have some experience and certification in that field - I really need about 7k$ by August so I have to choose the best route?

I'd really appreciate any input on this as I'm pretty new to NYC and the US in general. Thank you very much!

edit: P.S I also thought of contacting HR people (or people involved in the company) directly with my resume and a cover letter as well as a solution I could supply to one of their problems. That way I could expand my job search from merely looking over CS/Monster/etc.. Is this sort of contact acceptable? Is it a good idea?"

16vhdt,6,2013-01-19,"Dear Reddit, I have almost $60k in student loans but I only make $31k.  I'm on IBR, but I still wake up in the middle of the night freaking out about my loans.",curlygirl507,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/16vhdt/dear_reddit_i_have_almost_60k_in_student_loans/,"So here's my situation.  I graduated from college in 2009, the very worst year ever to do so in terms of finding a job.  I decided to go through a one-year master's program in public administration, which is a professional degree (like an MBA but from the public sector viewpoint).  My plan was to get some type of federal job and have the loans forgiven after 10 years, therefore I was willing to borrow a bit over $40k for the degree.  That was THE ONLY reason I was willing to take out those loans.  

My program was very good, it was in the city with the second-largest number of federal jobs in the country after DC, and I went to all the networking events and had internships, etc.  However, I discovered the hard way that it is actually impossible to get a government job.  I believe I applied to something like 150 jobs by the time I graduated.  (I realize this doesn't sound like a lot, but these job applications take a few hours and I was in an accelerated master's program.  You have to write pages about your qualifications, provide supplemental documents, etc.)  I tried the feds, locals governments, state agencies, nonprofits, think tanks, and everything.  It's impossible.  

I had to move home, which is a second-tier city.  I started tutoring, which had been my college job, and for almost two years my income level was about $9k.  My loans were on IBR, but still building interest.  Then, last year, a miracle happened.  I was hired at a private company at the princely sum of $31k!!

I am very grateful for my job and I really like my company.  I'm doing extremely well and was recently assigned to a very high level client and to work on a big project for them at the same time; they requested me specifically.  I feel so happy that I've had this chance and it's working out.  But the thing is, now my loans aren't going to go away in 10 years - it's 25.  And also, my company has a reputation for not paying people that well and not giving large raises.  And there aren't any other similar companies that could steal me away in the area.  

So redditors familiar with the private sector, please give me your opinion.  If someone is doing really well in their job, do you think it's very likely that they will eventually reach a substantially higher income level?  Or do you think it's possible this place will keep me at $31k forever, no matter how great I'm doing?  Will I *have to* move to a larger city with more companies if I want to do well?

I'm wondering if I could fairly quickly get to a level where I could really start paying the loans off.  If they're going to keep me at the same lower level forever, then I feel like I might as well just keep doing the minimum IBR, but if my income is going to go up then I ought to really start buckling down on the loans.  I never planned on working in the private sector so I don't know how getting promoted and soforth works.  Any thoughts?"
16vaap,1,2013-01-19,I'm an inadequate shitbag,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/16vaap/im_an_inadequate_shitbag/,"No throwaway because fuck it, this is bullshit melodrama anyways that doesn't compare to some of the stuff on this subreddit.

I'm at that stage in life where it's more or less a giant breakpoint.  If I make the wrong decision, it'll have lasting emotional (and potentially other) consequences, and I'm just not in any state to deal with it right now.  College, freshman year, four-year school, prospective game design major.  I'm actually declared as a major in Animation (with a focus in 3D), but I've recently discovered that I really have zero passion to do anything related to animation beyond having a passing interest in it, hence my desire to change my major to something I already have a vast skill set in.

I'm from a rather well-to-do family, but I had a hard time in high school, and ended up here at this high-tier school which primarily specializes in visual fine arts--and before I continue, I have to ask that you please withhold your ""don't go to art school"" bullshit, because whether your degree says BFA, MD, or BS next to it, whether or not you get a job has far less to do with that and far more to do with the connections you make and the portfolio you build to demonstrate your skills.  The degree may as well be a fucking formality, from what I've seen.

Back on topic, my dad really wanted me to go to an Ivy League-tier school.  Obviously a 3.0 student (which is a C average in my home state) wasn't going to do that well, so I ended up here, which I'm generally pleased with--but I still take flak for it.  ""You go to an art school?  Have fun bartending for the next ten years.""  I've learned to tune those people out, but constantly hearing it from peers outside of school is starting to affect me, sometimes even belittling me.

Few people see the practicality in choosing game design as a major.  Explaining that I go to an art school is one thing, no matter how prestigious it is, but explaining that I'm a game design major?  Not a single damn adult I've met seems to take the idea seriously.  I guess I'm just throwing away four years by following a passion, nevermind that I plan to get a second degree (associates, tech school) in networking after I start working in case things don't work out.  Dear ol' Dad who wanted me to go to an ivy league school, he's one of those adults who doesn't take the idea seriously, and I am mortified of the idea of letting my parents down.

There's other things bothering me, too.  I'm hitting some speedbumps in my relationship at the moment--for example, she seems to want me to stand my ground more often and stop being a pacifist *all* the time (though she prefers that I not become hotheaded and arrogant, so I've been trying to find that sweet spot).  I did so tonight, and I either acted arrogant or failed to find the happy medium, because she was quite put off by it.  I felt like shit for letting her down because I love her dearly, so I recluded myself to my room in the condo to think on it and possibly separate her from the problem--me. (This is a family reunion for her family, and they've invited me--no, they didn't notice that she and I argued, so it stayed between she and I.)  She later came in to tell me how rude I was being to the family by being reclusive and antisocial.

Great, I let her down again.  I've been doing some rather trivial things to frustrate her lately, this included--and almost all of them preventable, but my own apathy as of late has kept me from intervening ahead of time.  We've been together for a year and a half, and I think I'm a pretty shitty significant other for upsetting her like this.  And yet she still holds out for me and cares for me, despite this.  Goddamn my stupid laziness and self-hatred.  If I wasn't such a pacifist fuck, maybe I wouldn't have been in this situation in the first place.

To top it off, I've hit a dry spell as far as inspiration goes.  Right now is a critical period for me if I have any desire to obtain an internship, and this means portfolio expansion.  I can't think of shit.  When I do, it's either too complicated to implement or a complete ripoff of a pre-existing work.  I'm a failure of an artist.

All of the above combined with trivial little things that I've done to prove to myself that *I'll always finish second, even when the challenge is between me and myself* has culminated into a self-hating spiral of depression.  The following outlines how I would currently address myself if I were to come face to face with a doppelgänger:

Fuck you and everything you stand for.  You're useless.  Half of your family is probably disappointed with you, you regularly frustate the one person you really love and try to find comfort in.  The thought of not having her tortures you.  Good.  Keep thinking about it, dirtbag. You can't finish that game you want to build.  You can't even play all the way through one right now, because you're so goddamn apathetic.  You might as well be committed, considering your borderline paranoia.  There's also how you'll just be standing alone, thinking about how shitty of a person you are, and then say something random like ""fuck you"" or even ""I love you"" (what the actual fuck?) because your brain is trying to get its bearings from reliving traumatizing past experiences.  What sane human being even fucking does that?  You, you cockmongering fuckwit.  You're probably going to die alone, and your regular masturbation habit will probably end up nuking whatever marriage you could have in the future, porn or no porn.  Don't even bother killing yourself, you deserve the pain you get for being such an inadequate bag of shit.

16v9tu,3,2013-01-19,Please give me advice,[deleted],stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/16v9tu/please_give_me_advice/,"I've been drinking heavily for about the past 10 years. I am now 28 years old and would like to just stop drinking altogether, as for the most part it's made me miserable.

I've made so many mistakes and lost a lot of friends and self respect while drinking.  When I get drunk it's now to the point of black out, yet as an experienced drinker I will not pass out or throw up, but continue on with the night, but of course the following morning I remember nothing.

I haven't had a serious relationship in about 5 years and believe drinking is in part to blame.

Anyway, enough ranting. I need advice on how I can stop drinking without killing my social life. The problem I face is that I currently work with interns who are all in their early 20's and want to go out and party. I feel pressure to go out and party with them, so that I do not seem like a boring guy.
I also think on some level, because I am craving for a serious relationship, I feel that if I don't go out I could be missing an opportunity to meet some one.

I just don't know if I can stay in my room on a Friday/Saturday and get an early night, but what are the alternatives? Thanks."

16v7s4,6,2013-01-19,Am I really depressed or just sad frequently?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/16v7s4/am_i_really_depressed_or_just_sad_frequently/,"This is my first post. I signed up for reddit just to here some other opinions and my family and friends have a tendency to overreact to this sort of thing. A nice anonymous discussion would be great. Also silly pictures. Those are nice.

I've been reading stories of others from this subreddit and my story pales in comparison. My home was stable (aside from a few scares and blips) and my grades have been decent. Grade and high school were a bit rough socially but I got through it and I'm a senior in college now getting ready to graduate. I remember seeing a therapist briefly in 6th grade in response to some anger issues that are well gone now and their were a few episodes in High school where I mentioned suicide outloud, and once Sophomore year of college, but I was drunk as hell and hardly remember it, I only learned of it from my friends later. I chalk that one up to excessive booze and have cut back significantly since then.

College for the most part has been fine, however second semester of Junior year, everything blew the fuck up. My fraternity was caught hazing, a practice I never supported for the record, and the school went through every effort to demonize and punish us, most of it deserved. Our officers were removed from the fraternity and fined. We needed a new president and I was picked for the job. Not five minutes after my election, I get a call from my dad saying that my cousin was in a DUI wreck and had lethal brain damage. The rest of the semester was hell trying to get the fraternity back on its feel, dealing with the grief of my family, and two seminar classes. I also kept getting rejected from internships which didn't help. I was exhausted and towards the end, I was ready to give up. Just leave school and do something else. I was miserable and felt a lot of guilt over the hazing thing and still do. Looking back, I'm not sure how I didn't have some kind of breakdown. (I may have, but I don't know how to tell if you are having one or what symptoms are).

But as I'm a senior and most of the stuff below has blown over, I still have this miserable feeling that I had during the worst of it all. I don't enjoy going out anymore, I've lost the desire to hang out with friends or hang out. Heck, even the improv troupe I'm a member of has lost a lot of it's fun. But what doesn't make sense is that I am still functioning fine. My grades are fine, I can make basic small talk with people, and as far as my friends are aware, I'm fine now. But I still have this lingering sadness and tiredness from before and it is eerily  similar to those feelings I had in grade school and high school. Although those were based primarily in anger. This is more based in sadness. 

But here is the thing, I have no idea if I have what could be called ""depression"" or if I'm just having trouble getting over what happened that semester. My family always held this belief that sadness was something you can power through. I can remember my dad saying to me in sixth grade ""Knock it off, you are not depressed or sad, stop using it as an excuse"" and that has always kind of stuck. So I've always kind of ascribed to that philosophy even if it isn't true for everyone. I read stories of people dealing with abuse and ridicule by the masses and I really don't have something to really compare with those stories. In addition, the symptoms they give are almost debilitating. I'm not debilitated in anything really. I guess I've always considered it, ""Oh, I'm not that bad, don't compare yourself.""

But I'm also concerned about getting it treated. I don't know if I can afford some kind of medication if needed and I don't want to put a financial burden on my family with therapy (I remember the therapy I had in sixth grade was a point of contention in my family because of cost) I'm also unsure if they will just say ""oh your just bummed out a bit. Go for a walk"" and I will just be wasting my time. 

and again there is the fact that my family does tend to over react a bit to me being sad about anything, perhaps back to those times in grade/high school. For example, I posted a less than happy facebook status that said I had a pretty awful homecoming and I was sick of school. I got a phone call from my grandparents asking if I was okay and if I needed help, My mom texted me suggesting I should probably transfer (As a senior one semester from graduating and with a brother who is struggling to finish school). I appreciate their concern, but I don't want them to panic about me. Hence why I'm asking here. 

I apologize for the wall of text and the incoherence of it all. It's been a complicated subject for me and I figured this was one of the better places on the internet to ask. I will be happy to clarify any questions you may have and any advice would be great. Thanks for reading.

16v13u,3,2013-01-18,"The First ""Hunt""",Keelan13,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/16v13u/the_first_hunt/,"Like many people, I’m a fan of the TV series *Supernatural*. I was actually fortunate enough to intern as a college student doing script coverage for Warner Bros. when Kripke was trying to get the pilot picked up and got to read a few early drafts of the first script; so it goes without saying I was a fan [technically] before there even was a series.

But people, please…stop with all the rock salt solutions to everyone’s problems. Yes, salt has its place among items to be used, but it isn’t a preventative measure and it certainly doesn’t apply to 90% of what the masses seem to think.

=ahem= Anyway, as I was starting to say: I have all the seasons on DVD, the comics, the novels (those that have been released, anyway; others I have pre-ordered), have worn a replica of Dean’s old amulet every day for the past 6 years, and even have the RPG books, though I’ve never played a session. So it should come as no surprise that, considering my fondness for the show plus my already lifelong interest in the paranormal and occult, I started to write my own Hunter Journal.

For the most part, this is filled with information on different topics, rather academically. Histories and theories behind different spirits and creatures, different ways in which to protect oneself, and basically anything that would come to be found as helpful should such things ever be encountered. Of course, it wouldn’t be complete without a few entries of personal experiences, so I’m going to share some of them with you, much like I started to with my previous entry (“A Childhood Memory” http://redd.it/15uiuk ). There’s an occasional use of colorful phrases (much like Dean, I’m a natural smartass and pretty great at it when it counts), so just roll with them when they happen.

When I was around 12 or 13, I met a kid named James, who very quickly became one of my best friends. We got along well right off the bat. It didn’t take me long to notice there was a little bit of unease to the dude (I’m definitely an introvert, and one thing we’re good at is noticing human behavior and picking up on patterns and other little things most don’t see), and at some point he started to talk to me about having seen things in the condo that he and his family were living in.

One thing he described was a pair of green eyes looking at him from through an air-vent high up on the wall in his bedroom. Now, knowing me, I probably made some smartass joke, but once James didn’t react I knew he was being serious. So we started talking about it all some more. He told me about a time he hopped over the back of the couch to land on it and watch TV… and the couch moving so he dropped to the floor instead in a reverse belly-flop. My mind started to analyze things (yes, even at that young age I was quite the nerd; learn to love it), trying to figure out what was scaring my new friend, and what I could do to stop it. I’ve always been a bit of a “Peter Parker” like that, so I always help someone who needs it if I can, and this seemed an important time that I happen to have that trait. Feeling that I needed a little more verification than “I think *this*,” James and I opted to get a little more information.

Without knowing it, Doc and I (“Doc” is a nickname I’ve called him for many years now, so just keep it in mind they’re the same person in case I switch back and forth during the rest of the story) were about to have a serious meeting with some *thing*.

His mother was alone at the condo watching a Godzilla marathon or something, so Doc and I seized the opportunity to go to the local library. We found a small selection there dealing with ghosts and spirits and hauntings and all other aspects of parapsychology. After looking through about half of them, one of us came across a book primarily about Poltergeists. A good deal of what was mentioned in the book regarding the behaviors of poltergeists and what Doc said was going on happened to fit almost perfectly. Add to that the fact that he had three younger sisters, and two of which were about to approach puberty; this coincided with the theory connecting energies of such developmental events and the spirits, so we felt we had enough evidence to make a positive ID.

Skimming through the book some more, we found a chapter talking about ways to confront and banish the spirit, mostly through equalizing the energies stored within the home environment. Armed with knowledge and now a means to strike, we decided to waste no time and went into action (what can I say but we were young and foolish).

We knew immediately that something was off when we got back to the condo.

For starters, the place was wide open. I mean the front door, gate to the back, garage door and the door from the garage to the kitchen, all open. Doc’s family had two huskies (Gambit and Wolvie) that would have been running around the area like crazy…but they were nowhere to be found. Inside, the condo was empty. No person was there, which caught us off guard as we expected his mother to still be there. Most electronics were on; lights, the microwave, the TV (which was picking up white noise but no sound) and a radio somewhere upstairs.

Doc went upstairs to turn off the radio, also closing the front door while he was at it. I opted to close up the garage area. Leaning in at the kitchen door, I pressed the switch to shut the rolling door and heard a thump! from next to me. One of the knives from a kitchen drawer (now open when it wasn’t before) was stuck in the door frame next to my hand; far enough not to have posed a risk, but close enough to send a clear message.

I just didn’t care what this thing had to say. “Honey badger don’t give a shit” mentality going on there.

When Dog got back and we turned everything off, we decided to look room-by-room, starting upstairs. Other than the silence of the place, nothing seemed off upstairs; not visually, anyway. So we proceeded to look downstairs, with the same result. James wanted to look into where the dogs may have been, so he opened the sliding door from the living room to the back (which was also the only door that remained shut when we first arrived) to find two dead sparrows on the mat outside, facing each other. This seriously had him freaked out, for a few reasons:

a)	The dogs would have chewed the shit out of the birds if they were around.
b)	There were two of us and two birds; symbolism is sorta in your face on that one.
c)	The way they were placed on the mat was too aligned for it to have been done any way but intentionally.

We braved the situation and looked about the back. Zero signs of what may have happened or where the dogs may have gone to.
Through the blinds of the room upstairs that doc and his uncle shared, he saw what looked like the silhouette of a person standing in the room looking down at us. I told him “don’t take your eyes off it” and bolted back into the house, up the stairs and into the room. Nothing was there, so I went to the window to open the blinds to see if James saw anything move. Nothing had, he told me.

James was so scared at this point that he just wanted to leave. We went back to my house so he could calm down and so we could figure out our next move. It took a while and some convincing, but he finally got himself together enough to go back. When we got there we were greeted by his mother, who apparently hadn’t left that day. In fact, she had been recording the movies on VHS and had to manually pause the recording to edit out the commercial breaks. The dogs were also present and just fine, for those wondering. :P

I don’t remember what it was Doc decided to try from the book in the end, but things sort of stopped after that. What I do remember is that shortly after Doc told his step-dad (who was a relatively faithful Jehova’s Witness), the family up and moved. Whatever it was didn’t follow them, and as far as I’ve been able to observe with my occasional trips through my hometown, hasn’t been active at the condo either.

Not sure if that means the first “hunt” was actually a success or not, but at least it didn’t turn into a total train wreck, right? Clusterfucks right out the door are sort of a bad way to start off your record.

Now at this point in time, we’ve obviously gotten older and acquired a fair deal more of knowledge. When first writing this entry into my journal, I started to look closer at all the events that happened. Looking back at the behaviors of what we encountered, I [finally] started looking at those that didn’t fit what poltergeists were known to do, rather than only giving attention to those that nearly perfectly fit…I’m no longer so convinced what we encountered was a poltergeist after all."

My grandma had suffered a stroke and had been placed in the hospital. Great.  Class started around the seventh and my funds were low because of unemployment, so I was unable to make it home (typical college broke-ass). Because of that, I endured about two weeks' worth the worry without seeing her. Though it was hard to come by, I finally scored some money around Wednesday and drove down. Since I arrived at the hospital she's gotten progressively worse (non-responsive, vegetative state). Since everything about her health went south, we decided to stop all treatment two days ago-- so I've just been here with my family watching one of my favorite people in this world die. It's been tearing me apart. It's been tearing all of us apart. 

My grandma supported me no matter what I did, but she was especially proud of me for going to college. Well, I  received a phone call earlier from one of my university's research centers... I scored a paid internship. The pay isn't great, mind you, but it will give me a huge leg up for grad school and a full time employment opportunity post-grad. Just told my mom, and she freaked. She's so happy. But I. Am. Stoked. 
SO STOKED.

By my grandma's bed right now, and all I can think about is how happy she'd be for me. I'm really going to miss that. God, she spoiled me rotten. And though this is super hard to watch, I'm staying with her until the end. 

Thanks for believing in me and giving me that push when no one else did, Grandma. I love you.

16y5dy,10,2013-01-20,"The need to feel autonomous, and the urgency of one-upping others",[deleted],infp,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/16y5dy/the_need_to_feel_autonomous_and_the_urgency_of/,"The premise of this post roughly follows the thread on [""missing out""](http://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/16rdp1/anyone_else_feel_like_theyre_missing_out/) also currently on the front page of this sub, but one thing I have trouble with is falling into periods where I feel as though I have to have the final word over my friends with regards to who's the most cognizant of what they're doing.

Sometimes I fall into this positive feedback loop of not knowing whether or not I actually enjoy something, or if it's just out of the pretense of acquiring prestige or impressing others. Many projects which I thought I started just for myself, sometimes reach a point where they interest other people and then I don't trust myself to continue, thinking that my original intention has been compromised and I'm just trying to please them now.

I also sometimes hate it when other people try and take too much of an interest in what I'm doing, because then I feel as if they think they know better - and maybe they do, but I know I ought not care what their opinion is on the matter. Sometimes they'll start doing similar things, and I feel as if I have to be critical of them or constantly talking big about my own experiences on the matter just to give a sense that I'm still relevant with regards to the topic at hand. A friend of mine recently started modding a game I've been modding, and I almost feel as if he's just enjoying this crude, voyeuristic mimicry for the sake of trying to impress me. And then I find mysel stressed out, seemingly working on my project less for myself and more to put him in his place.

In a slightly more relatable example, I hate when people make general observations which I've known for ages and feel have no reason to be stated aloud. From those kids in courses who ask questions that are really just clarifications/agreements with what the teacher said for the sake of talking to them, to people complaining about a current event when I've previously written entire rants about that event - then I feel as if I have to have my sentiments known as well, so that they know they aren't completely profound in their discoveries.

Similarly, I have interests in both art/design and writing. I find I emphasize artwork more around other writers, and around people who do artwork I like to exclude myself and present myself as more verbally-oriented, perhaps to avail myself that opportunity to continue presenting myself as a spectator and not a person to be scrutinized to the same standards as everybody else in the group.

I really hate doing stuff like that, as it's just another obstacle in my trying to be honest with what I want to work on. I generally am fairly easygoing and do not do this, but when I'm stressed out I seem to lean more towards this tendency for outspoken criticism and dismissiveness. I believe I've read before that INFPs can sometimes surrender themselves to their inferior functions (such as thinking), which generally does not bode well.

I think I do it due to a sense of lagging behind - that there are people who seem to think far less than we do, and have far less diverse interests, and yet seem to just be leisurely perambulating through life with girlfriends and internships whilst I still haven't figured out what I really want to be known by - or if perhaps I'm one of those people who revels in being well-rounded and never doing one thing for too long. I almost feel as though it's the only way to continue to make myself feel relevant in the eyes of others, by alluding to awareness of things that they don't and always being just out of reach from being understood or caught up to fully.

I'll end this little tirade here as I'm not entirely sure what I hope to get out of it, and it's somewhat disorganized. I just wanted to compose my thoughts. So I suppose the question I ask to the others on this subreddit is, do you also sometimes feel as though you have to always have an ""advantage"" over others, or find yourself annoyed with people trying to fully understand you? Perhaps it stems from a need for a sense that one always must do things their own innately unique way, but when the mentality arises that one is too fundamentally different from others to ever be understood, I know that to be unhealthy and self-deprecating."

So that was rough, i had infinite time to do whatever. There is a bench out on the fantail that I like to sit on and watch the flying fish do their thing. I can normally kill an hour or so out there at any given time. I also brought The Illiad and The Odyssey and I have been reading that. Every now and then I'll help launch a weather balloon.
 |But since we actually got to the buoy I have been relatively busy, taking samples and what not. And we are there to recover and replace the buoys, which takes about 10 hours so there are always parts of that process that are fun to watch.

One group is doing some aerosol work (the kinds of particulates in the air, how big they are, and to what abundance), another group is here to recover and replace an array if bouys that monitor basic weather conditions for the area, and I work with the group collecting water samples along the way.

I am not 100%, though. The crew is not international, but the buoys we are servicing are owned by the US, Brazil, and France. Or at least the program that put them out there is run by them.
[Im not sure how you are connected with the politics of the project, but do you think that research is getting more and more international with less problems due to it being several countries involved?  What I am trying to ask is: Earlier on there seemed to be a problem with countries using research as a power play. Is that something you guys see anything of now, or is the research shared?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c800fxd?context=5)|Well I can only give my very limited opinion. This array of buoys has been around for nearly a decade I think, so this particular venture is nothing new. The kinds of cruises like the one I am on don't typically have foreign scientists, but the hardware itself could be a multi-national thing. I don't think I really answered your question and I'm sorry, but I am not quite ""in the know"" on that one.

I've seen some squid, mahi-mahi, tuna, and this one gull that got stuck on our ship too far from land that I named Petree. Oh and dolphins, and someone said they saw a loggerhead turtle.

[Is it frightening at all? Is this your first time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c800ydi?context=5)|This is my first time (and I am the only one on board who hasn't been on a cruise before) and there have been a couple scary moments. About 3 hours after we left port, we ran fire, man overboard, and abandon ship drills. That was all well and good, but about 45 minutes later there was an actual fire! One of the 3 generators blew up! We almost turned around at that point, but they fixed it up.
 |And then just tonight, we have gotten into some higher winds and are we pitching pretty good. We had a series of strong pitches and I guess something got knocked loose, but the power went out on the whole ship. So that was terrifying. I had to remind myself that I wasn't on a plane and power did not necessarily equate to flotation. But we are up and running again, about 3 days from land!
[One of the biggest fears that I have is of being on a boat/ship out in a large body of water for an extended period of time.  The *idea of the* isolation and inability to leave the confines of whatever functioning piece of flotilla that would keep me above the vast depths of the ocean, without any land in site, almost sends me over the edge thinking about it.  Do you have any fears such as this?  Do any of the other crew?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c80237m?context=5)|I imagine the crew forgot those fears a long time ago, this isn't their first rodeo after all. I was certain I would be a little scared of the isolation and the night, but so far I have surprised myself. The ship is state of the art, and I trust the crew explicitly. Although, I did have a panic attach my first week because I was seasick and just could not escape it anywhere on the ship. I feared I would go crazy from not being able to get away from the churning for the next 5 weeks, but that too, has passed.
[Bonine.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c80evfy?context=5)|Huh, i've never heard of it but ill look into it. ive been taking meclizin and phenogrin.

There was a huge low pressure system that kicked up some nasty swells. This is my first cruise, so I got pretty seasick. Since then I've been on some good medication so I have come to really enjoy the ride. It is strange to wake up to the same horizon every day, but I enjoy the company of the crew and the other scientists so that helps. 
[Do you think that Gravol would work for suppressing seasickness?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c80648v?context=5)|I dont know what that is?
[What is your profession exactly that allowed you on the ship with the buoy guys? Do buoys ever get destroyed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c8013fu?context=5)|I am intern kind of thing, I'm a meteorology student at Texas A&amp;M. The other scientists though are research scientists at various labs and Universities around the country.
 |Buoys can get damaged, or even vandalized. We recovered one yesterday that had a crack down the side, probably from a boat running into it. And we recovered one today that had some missing instruments, likely stolen by fishermen.
[Why would fisherman want to steal weather monitoring instruments? Aside from the obvious ""to monitor the weather"", I'm assuming they are relatively hi-tech and require a special understanding to either operate or extract data, so yeah, why take them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c80c4cy?context=5)|Exactly, they may steal them to sell for parts. also, they could have just fallen off in inclement weather, but somehow i doubt that.
[How frustrating. Don't they know there's science happening?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c8059xj?context=5)|They must, they know it will get replaced in a year so they can come back and steal some more.
[Can you fish off the boat or is there generally not much to catch where you are?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c7zzztt?context=5)|Well these buoys that we are servicing develop there own little ecosystems. They are the only things out there for thousands of miles, so fish hang around them. It takes about 10 hours to recover and replace a buoy, so we fish off the side. So far we caught a few tuna and a baby mahi-mahi. The tuna we sent up to the cooks for dinner, the mahi we threw back.
[When you replace the buoy, what do you do with the stuff scraped off the old one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c806hf5?context=5)|Throw it overboard, normally its just barnacles and stuff.
[Next time eat it! mahi mahi is delicious and theyre beautiful fish.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c807l5y?context=5)|We had a little mahi-mahi the first week, but it wasn't freshly caught. I've heard it's great though!
[What kind of research are you doing that requires you to be at sea so long?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c7zzp00?context=5)|I am with a group of scientists that have a variety of jobs. One group is doing some aerosol work (the kinds of particulates in the air, how big they are, and to what abundance), another group is here to recover and replace an array if bouys that monitor basic weather conditions for the area, and I work with the group collecting water samples along the way.
[Do you ever see anything out of the ordinary out there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c7zzzg7?context=5)|Out of the ordinary for me or out of the ordinary for the ocean? A couple days ago we had the huuuge storm kick up in about an hour. Completely out of nowhere. We watched it roll in and right over us around sunset, made the water turn red and bloody looking. It was very cool. I'll upload a pic if I get time.
[Op will deliver.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c8084y9?context=5)|I updated with those pics.

[How's the food?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c7zzsty?context=5)|It is pretty good actually. It kind of has to be to keep morale up for this long of an operation.
[Who cooks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c80grj5?context=5)|We have 4 full time cooks on board.
[3 and a half weeks long?  Pfff. Try seven on a vessel where you eat nothing but pasta.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c803s65?context=5)|Well the whole thing is 5 weeks, but we have 3 left. and yeah that sounds rough.
[How do the scientists and crew get along?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c80gtqx?context=5)|Quite well, they keep to themselves and we keep to ourselves mostly. but we meet for meal times and such. no problems yet!

[How large is the vessel your on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c7zzsqs?context=5)|I believe it is 275ft.

That is an a-frame used to pulley up heavy things that we are recovering from the ocean. I think that is what you are talking about.
[I was referring to the shape of the bow. It's kind of upside-down.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c80gbx3?context=5)|I never posted a picture of the bow?
[How's the night sky? What's the best part of the trip? The worst? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c803fik?context=5)|The sky sky, when clear is amazing. so many stars! Best part of the trip so far has been the views, the sky is so big and you can just see all these storms develop without any obstruction. the worst was the seasickness i had the first week. suuucked!
[How much personal space and free time do you have?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c8001wb?context=5)|Well the first 10 days or so have been just transit. We have to get to where we are going before the science can happen, so I have had nothing BUT free time for awhile. I only just thought about doing this tonight. I have my own stateroom, but I share a bathroom. And there is always somewhere on deck I can sit quietly if I need some fresh air.
[I dated a girl who worked on one of these vessels years ago. She emailed me that she had written me a letter and would post it when they reached the ""mail buoy.""  I guess the crew was having fun at her expense. Is this a known joke on these vessels? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c803beh?context=5)|Not that i am aware of, a mail buoy sounds a little sketch.
[What are the various ways in which computers and applications help you study the ocean? Are they developed in-house or do you ask vendors to develop them (hardware and software\)? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c802xhj?context=5)|We have a room just dedicated to our mainframe, keeping our computers up and running, satellites and what not. I don't know anything terribly specific as far as what hardware we have, but we use computers in almost all the science we do. They track the weather balloons we launch, the probes we drop in the ocean, and buoys we are tracking down. Computers help us analyze and compile the data for later use. I pretty much don't understand how we did science without them.
[B-\)  You're welcome, CS Grad :-P.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c80dkno?context=5)|Haha i had a feeling.
[Why the Atlantic? Why in the middle? Why now? What's your average day like? What's for breakfast?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c808h4s?context=5)|Woah. The Atlantic because that is where the buoys we are servicing are at. Now, because that is when we got funding to go. My average day consists of browsing the web, doing homework, reading, and occasionally working. That will change in a couple days when I will have a 12 hour shift. And I never make it up for breakfast, so unfortunately nothing.
[What are you researching? where are you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c803210?context=5)|There are 3 groups here doing stuff and I am with a group taking water samples along the way. We analyze them for oxygen and salinity concentrations throughout the water column. We can use that to calibrate buoys in the area and the values goes online for other researchers to access for their projects. Can't say where I am exactly right now, just tropical Atlantic.
[Vary interesting are you also testing for plankton levles? hope you don't get seasick and look for turtles.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c818541?context=5)|No plankton levels on this cruise, but at night i can see their bioluminescence which is cool. I did get seasick the first week, but that has passed thankfully. No turtles as of yet, but I heard one person saw a loggarhead somewhere.
[Well may Neptune the god of the sea smile from under you and smooth sailing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c81tvbj?context=5)|I prefer Poseidon myself, but thanks all the same!

They are often used interchangeably, though. haha I am reading The Odyssey right now.
[What's the food situation like? Are you just packaged with food to last you that time or do you end up eating out of a can everyday? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c806epx?context=5)|Food has been pretty good and i've heard that is fairly typical ship-to-ship. Good food is good for morale while at sea for so long. I doubt anyone really does like lunchables every day anymore.
[Do you ever go star crazy? Being on that ship with the same people every day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c802v58?context=5)|There was one point where i didn't think i was gonna make it 5 weeks, but it passed. You just have to learn to keep your mind busy.

[What are you researching exactly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c80cedg?context=5)|There are 3 groups here doing stuff and I am with a group taking water samples along the way. We analyze them for oxygen and salinity concentrations throughout the water column. We can use that to calibrate buoys in the area and the values goes online for other researchers to access for their projects.
[That's pretty cool.

I am an undergrad in meteorology at Texas A&amp;M and this is an internship kind of thing.
[Oh...Will you be doing more things like this in the future.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c80cqdj?context=5)|I hope so, there are other students here (grad students) who have been on 4 or 5 cruises.
[How lonely and isolated does it feel in the middle of the ocean? Also, how insanely expensive is the internet? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c803nip?context=5)|Not terribly, there is a lot of people here to keep you company. and i dont have to pay for internet thank goodness.

I'm sure there are places you can apply to be crew or whatever, but I honestly don't know where to send you.
[Have you looked at the stars while you're out there?  Does the night sky viewed from the middle of the ocean look as awesome as I think it does?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c805gby?context=5)|Yes and hell yes, see about 2 shooting stars every clear night.
[What is your team studying? and how was the process for getting aboard? are you a deckhand who just happened aboard? student? etc? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c805i8n?context=5)|There are 3 groups here doing stuff and I am with a group taking water samples along the way.

 |I met a research scientist at a lab in Miami and he offered me a chance to get on board as an intern. So I am a student taking classes online while doing this.
[That is really awesome, man! and thanks for the response! sounds like a pretty amazing experience!  for water column samples, is there a set depth on which you guys are basing from? how deep do you guys read to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c80j325?context=5)|Well we sink our instrument and it gives us readings of temp, salinity, and oxygen. then based on those profiles we pick depths that look interesting or are stable enough to represent that area of the water column. we typically don't go deeper than 1500m.
[How do you and the other scientists on the ship balance work and play, so to speak? Is work around the clock or sporadic? What sort of activities are there when you're not working? Is the work itself any fun?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c807gu2?context=5)|Well the first 10 days have been just transit for us, there hasn't been a whole lot of work to do. So we have all the time in the world to ""play"". When we get to where we are going, then we will have 12 hour shifts that have intermittent spurts of free time every 4 hours or so that give us some free time. We have to do something besides work every now and then or we would go bat shit crazy!
 |When we aren't working, I typically stick to my computer and read a book. I'll sit outside and watch the flying fish do their thing every now and then. When we get to a buoy we fish off the side of the ship, which is fun. The work itself is fun to me! Very hands on and science-y so I like that kind of stuff.
[No proof?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c7zztgk?context=5)|Same question, how can I upload a picture? I am new here.

16xbkm,14,2013-01-20,"I [22] hooked up with a friend while my girlfriend [22] and I were broken up. This friend may be moving to my city, and my girlfriend is distressed at this thought.",throwitawaynow25,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/16xbkm/i_22_hooked_up_with_a_friend_while_my_girlfriend/,"M22, F22, 2.5 years.

My girlfriend and I started officially dating around June of 2010, during which time I was away on an internship. During this internship, I forged a friendship with another girl (let's call her Tricia), for whom I have honestly never had any feelings: romantic, sexual, or otherwise. Despite this, my girlfriend was somewhat paranoid about my relationship with Tricia, partially due to my girlfriend's romantic history and partly due to me awkwardly and stupidly navigating the first part of my first serious relationship from across the country.

Now, I didn't know about my girlfriend's paranoia until almost 7 months later. We talked about it several times, and I tried to reassure her nothing was up with Tricia. However, those feelings of dislike toward Tricia never fully went away, but they never caused a huge problem since I only saw Tricia once or twice a year at conferences.

Fast forward to June 2012. I have broken up with my girlfriend for various reasons, and I'm single for the first time in 2 years. During this summer, I had little to no contact with women, as I was just chilling at my hometown before moving for graduate school. I did, however, go on a trip to visit Tricia and a couple other mutual friends whom I did not often get a chance to see. One night during this trip, mostly due to alcohol, but partially due to loneliness (and possibly an attempt to convince myself that I was single, as my ex and I had still been talking), Tricia and I made out and performed oral sex on each other. I regretted it a bit, but it was no huge deal at the time.

My girlfriend and I got back together in September, and we're now in a long term long-distance relationship. She knows about what happened with Tricia. She is upset whenever Tricia is brought up, but she says she doesn't want me to have to stop being friends with Tricia since I didn't do anything wrong.

I could just stop being friends with Tricia, but a couple of things complicate that. One, we are both professionals in the same field with many mutual friends and contacts, so seeing and talking to each other at conferences will be inevitable. Second, Tricia is applying to my grad school. Should she get in, she will know not only me but a few mutual friends with whom I regularly hang out. She would also most likely work in my lab. Avoiding her would be impossible.

This has distressed my girlfriend, and she claims that she doesn't want to feel this way. However, she claims that she ""hates"" Tricia and that Tricia is ""sneaky,"" despite the fact that she only met her once at a loud bar for less than 20 minutes. She says that while she trusts me, she is afraid Tricia will flirt with me, despite her long-term boyfriend that she recently got back with. Whenever Tricia's name, or even the name of the city in which we did our internship, is brought up, my girlfriend gets silent and moody for several minutes. I know it's eating away at her, and I try to be as comforting and understanding as possible, which she appreciates. However, I also often feel like she's not trying hard enough to let this go, especially when she goes so far as to villainize someone she doesn't know.

So, I'm at a loss. Is there a way I can help her get over this? Tricia is going to be a part of my life for a while, professionally if not personally, and I just don't know what to do to make my girlfriend feel better. I don't want my girlfriend to be hurt every time Tricia's name is mentioned, and if she goes to school with me... I don't even want to think about it.

**TL;DR: My girlfriend was baselessly paranoid about my girl friend. We broke up for other reasons, and I drunkenly hooked up with my friend while single. My girlfriend and I got back together in a LDR, and she's upset whenever friend is mentioned. My friend might be moving to my city and working with me.**

EDIT: I made this post as concisely as possible assuming you would take me at my word. I want to reiterate that I did **not** have any sexual feelings for this girl. It was purely a regrettable drunken one-night stand fueled by alcohol and a sudden lack of female contact for 3 months. Speculation that it was anything else is just that. Frankly, I find her unattractive. Secondly, it **will** be hard to avoid her if she comes here. I know maybe in your work/social environment that may be different, but I cannot fully explain the social dynamics here without rambling. Please just understand that she will most likely infiltrate my friend group here, and please help me with that assumption in mind."
16xagg,3,2013-01-20,I am quitting my job because of my anxiety.,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/16xagg/i_am_quitting_my_job_because_of_my_anxiety/,"Just to give you a little background about me, I'm 28 and was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder in my teens.  My diagnosis eventually switched over to generalized anxiety disorder, but I still have OCD tendencies.  I believe I might have Asperger's syndrome but have not been assessed for it yet.  Last May, I completed my graduate coursework and became a certified school counselor.  During my graduate coursework, I was also a live-in resident director.  My life was very stressful but rewarding at the time, so I was able to keep pushing myself despite the anxiety I felt.  One of my professors, a psychologist, caught onto my self-esteem issues related to my anxiety and incorporated CBT into my internship evaluation.  It was very awkward and probably inappropriate, but he knew my anxiety was a roadblock to my success as a counselor.  As a school counseling intern, I struggled a lot to manage my anxiety, especially when meeting with students.  While I improved over time, I never felt comfortable.  I spent a lot of time sitting at a computer and did not reach out to students as I probably should have.

After I graduated, my anxiety spun out of control when I couldn't find a job.  I was able to get two interviews.  The first went well but I nearly suffered a panic attack during the second one.  I pretty much blacked out and my mind went completely blank.  This was a major blow to my already low self-esteem.  Eventually, I started applying for other jobs and landed one at a group home for adolescents.  It wasn't an ideal situation with excessive and odd hours, including overnights, but I took what I could get.  About a month ago, I was woken up (we are allowed to sleep during our shifts) to one of the residents pepper-spraying another right in front of me.  I had to call the police and have some really serious talks with both residents.  Then just a few days ago, when I was finally getting over the anxiety I felt from that incident, there were three incidents in a few hours.  All of them involved the residents screaming at one another and me.  My heart hasn't stopped beating fast since then and I made the decision that tonight will be my final shift.

To lessen my anxiety, I am simply quitting without notice and doing so by leaving a nicely-written, praise-filled letter with an explanation for my abrupt leave.  As much as it would be nice to have a recommendation, I am just too shakey to continue dealing with the residents.  I feel like one more incident will cause me to have a breakdown of some sort.  Still, I feel terrible having to leave like this, especially since I know coverage is minimal with one staff member on vacation and only two other counselors who already have 50-60 hour weeks.  But the thought of being here (even as I type this) is making me feel sick.  It is absolutely amazing how one day I can be fine and the next (after the most recent incidents) I am up all night and unable to sleep because the thoughts of something else happening are so worrisome.  So now I have to move out of my apartment, move back in with my parents, seek help (I have been struggling with ongoing depression that has only gotten worse with this anxiety), and start looking for jobs that are not related to counseling for the time being.  What a bummer to go through school and have massive debt just to learn I am not mentally capable of counseling.  Hopefully I can put the pieces back together and try again in this field, but I am unsure of what to do next.  Any advice is more than welcome."
16x0s9,9,2013-01-20,I can't control it anymore. My depression. My anxiety. My inevitable self-sabotage of relationships.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/16x0s9/i_cant_control_it_anymore_my_depression_my/,"How does everyone do it? From what I know, everyone experiences the same kind of reactions to situations I do but mine seems to be amplified. That or I just can't control it nearly as well.

I can't see a light at the end of the tunnel that is called life. I'm not talking about an afterlife. I am talking about life in general. The universe is entropic. Everything breaks down by randomness and chaos. Nature goes against entropy. When we are born, we are born into a struggle to go against entropy. But guess what? Eventually entropy wins. We die. Its over. There was no purpose. Or at least I can't see a purpose. I'm miserable, and its awful. Why should I work hard to get my engineering degree, apply for internships, stress out about how am I going to provide for myself for the rest of my life. All of this just so I can live a life like everyone else. Going to work, coming home. Being miserable.

Depression is awful. I am always extremely tired. Severely low on will power to do absolutely anything. I stop eating much. I am starting to stay in my room more and more. I get too anxious about leaving my bubble. I have always felt incredibly disconnected from my parents. I think it makes me want to latch onto other people for affection.

My social anxiety is awful. I feel incredibly insecure about myself. I feel detached from everyone. Most people can't see it. I can put on a pretty good face. I'm funny. I'm smart. I'm relatively likeable. But when I feel alone I just feel so incredibly and deeply alone. I feel like my brain kicks into an overdrive that amplifies my insecurities about everything. Why I am not getting as many girls in college as people portray college to be like. Why my roommate gets incredibly better grades than me, is extremely good looking, great with the guitar, better than me at video games, has a fantastically healthy relationship with a girl he loves.

So back to me. I have a girlfriend. Things were absolutely great the first few months. We spent most of the first semester in college together. We laughed, we spent hours talking, napping with each other. I took her on dates. I thought up very well done dates. She's amazing. I feel so lucky to be with her. I'm happy for once. Maybe I can stay that way. Hm.

 We go on winter break. She lives an hour away (a rather inconvenient distance). We hang out and she tells me how much she misses me. Eventually I have to leave with the family and go out of state. Once I get back she goes out of country with her family. Since I went out of state she has gotten worse and worse at texting. She's drifting away I can feel it. She gets back from her vacation. She's different. She still wants to be with me, and cares a lot about me. But I can tell her life has changed. Her priorities are different. I am lower, less impactful in her life. The percentage I have in her life is growing smaller and smaller. It pains me. I practically cry inside on a daily basis.

Damn it why do I have the need to be so attached to people. Im fucking worthless.

We talk it out and she just isn't interested in a relationship where we spend a lot of time together like I want. I understand that, but she is so flaky on things even like texting (like only text 4-5 times a day). It doesn't even feel like a relationship. We try and make a compromise. I know she's a great girl and when things go well I am really happy with her. But its not working out like I had hoped. When we stop hanging out my happiness with her begins to decrease. I slowly and slowly drip back into the festering of anxiety within my own mind. I can't take it. I want to release all my problems. I want to scream. I want to shatter a window. Just say fuck life and let it go to shit.

She's a good person, but... it's not just working out. I'm not asking for much. Just some attention. That's all. But the more I ask the more I feel insecure and I think she likes me less. Breaking up would just as awful. I think my depression would be too unbearable then.

It's already barely bearable. Life just ending seems so much better. I don't want to live life if this is how unhappy I am going to be for the rest of it. Don't worry. I know I need to keep at it before coping out and attempting suicide. I plan to schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist during the week. Hopefully I can get my life back on track.

I don't know. Is anyone out there? How do I become happy? I just want to be loved."

So the rest of us are debating between April and Aug. We're deciding between end of April-beginning of May after our school term ends or August. We feel like our pros and cons for each balance each other out. This has been like this for the past month and it's what's making us hesitate about buying our tickets. Please help us make our decision!

**April/May**

PROS:

* Weather will be nice
* cherry blossoms
* The trip won't be in the way of our possible internships

CONS:

* Golden Week (all the natives are out for break so everything's busy)
* We don't get to see our friends who are natives and has a lake house in Nojiri that we'd be able to chill at the last few days of our trip
* We'll have less time to save (not too worried about this though)

**August**

PROS:

* Festivals/Fireworks
* We'll have our native friends to take us around and give us the true Japan experience and to meet new people
* Lake house in Nojiri with native friends (mentioned in april/may cons)

CONS:

* Heat--The three of us are Asian and understand how crazy Asia is in the summer. The one that's set on Aug has been wanting to go to an Asian country (especially Japan) since she was a kid. We tried telling her how it is but to no avail. She also is riding on the fact that we'll have a good time regardless because we have our native friends (whom she is the closest to)
* Heat (So much humidity and heat we decided to put this here twice)
* 4 people means more hotel rooms because we heard they're small (+ sharing beds on a humid night...)

Thank you all for the quick responses, 

This is what the glass looked like,

It currently seems like ill have to wait till around May when the glasses are being distributed for the festival,  i have already apologized profusely to him and bought him lunch and he has been very easy going about it which almost makes me feel worse.  I'm going to read into all of your responses and hopefully figure out a way that isn't a headache for anyone to help me out and also a way to figure out shipping funds and funds for the glass.  I haven't told him i'm doing this yet but hopefully i can surprise him since he only brought back a couple things from Germany.  

Ill update you all with what i decide and thanks again so much for the help!"

170ohb,3,2013-01-21,"[X-post from /r/advice] Was already feeling very overwhelmed from having to balance school, work, and feeling like I have to figure everything out right now. And then I got broken up with yesterday. I don't know how to handle all of this.",throwaway_098765,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/170ohb/xpost_from_radvice_was_already_feeling_very/,"Sorry this is a bit long.

I made a post about the break-up in /r/breakups [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/16zfyv/my_now_ex_i_supposegirlfriend_just_ended_our/). I miss her like crazy and wish I didn't have to completely give her up. That there was some way we could still be friends, because I know we both want to. Some way to stop missing her, or feeling the way I do, so I could at least keep her as a friend.

But I guess that's not really the only point of this post...

I had already been feeling a little alone lately, because I just started  community college in the Fall, and I don't really have any friends that I actually see there. And I can't say I've really found anyone that I feel like I would actually ever hang out with outside of class, and since I'm going to school full time, and I'm working, I feel like I never have time to hang out with people anyways. And being with her always made me feel better. Even if I saw the break-up coming. She was my best friend, and the only person I was actually comfortable talking too. Having to cut her out completely makes me feel just so much more alone. And work is so mindless, all I ever end up doing is over thinking everything. Now I'm probably just going to end up thinking about her non-stop while I'm there.

I also feel like I have to figure everything out in my life right now. I'm in college, but I have absolutely no idea what I want to do. How do I even find out where to start? Hell, I'm only in school right now because I feel like I have to be. I have no over-all goal in being there. Maybe if I knew what I wanted to do, I'd at least have that to work towards. I hate all this pressure. What I really want right now, is figure out what I want to do, and just find an internship in it. Learn there on the job instead of going to school, because to be quite honest, I just kind of suck at school. 

I think the last thing that's really contributing to me feeling so overwhelmed is just time in general. I feel like I'm either at school, or at work. I never have time to myself, and when I do, it's either too late, or not enough time to really do anything with anyone. Plus they have different schedules than I do anyways. 

I honestly don't feel like I have any motivation to get up in the morning. If I didn't have to go to school or work, I probably wouldn't. I really have where my life has been, but I have no idea how to fix it. I feel powerless to really change anything, and incredibly alone, even though I know I have a few people I could talk to, I'm not really comfortable with anyone. I've always been such a closed person, I donno how to not be. I really just want someone to hold, and be together with through this.

I know the economy has been better and whatnot, but you can get a job right out of college if you're driven.  

The ""experience paradox"" as I like to call it is a huge barrier for entry to recent grads.  You can't get a job without experience, but you can't get experience without a job, now can you?  This is the unfortunate state of many industries right now.

There is a solution, however.  **Internships.** Some paid, most not.  If you're a student, you should be interning over the summer before your senior year, and if you can find an internship during the semester, go for it as well.  Gaining this experience as a student not only allows you to learn far more at a younger age, but it also makes you much more hireable than your peers right after graduation.

Recent grads are usually not OK with this. There are bills to pay, family keeps asking you what you're doing now, etc.  The last thing you want to do is take a job where you may not get paid.  And let's be honest, the word *intern* has a sort of stigma about it.

This is where you have to weigh your options.  If you get an internship and really kick ass, it should only take a few months before you're hired on (maybe 2-3 depending on if there's an opening).  If nothing else, you now have the experience to apply for a job job, henceforth referred to as a jerb.  You can work part time or weekends at another job to help with the cash flow.  You're young.  Live off of ramen and PB&amp;J for a while, sleep on your moms couch or find a place via craigslist.

Paid internships!  They exist! They are usually more competitive, so get your resume/portfolio etc together!  I'm in advertising, so an application for an internship might require me to make a short video, write an obscure essay or complete some weird task and document it.  Put in the effort to make a great application, because the internship will be worth it.

The bottom line - This is your future.  You can make it what you want.  Put in the grunt work now while you're young and can afford to, and you will have a much better chance at landing your dream job.  Don't wind up miserable for the rest of your life.

I guess it was because i never got an actual answer, so here i go again in the hopes that it works out.

Dear M,

The thing that bothers me the most is that even though i was your friend for 3 years, that we dated for almost 2, that i tried my hardest from the bottom of my heart to make you happy you just discarded me without a second thought. And you did it by sending me a long text, you never came and talked to me face to face, you didn't return my things, you never talked to me again. I am not sure i can come to terms with the fact that i loved you so much and you cared so little in the end. 

I always thought we were perfect for each other from the first day i saw you, we liked the same things, we were both family kids with the same upbringing and mentality, we wanted the same things for our future. Freshman year of college, but you were dating someone else and i didnt care, as long as i got to be your friend. You always used to joke that you would marry me someday, that i should wait for you. I never asked you to break up with her. And when she dumped you a year later i was there for you, but you moved on with someone else and i nearly lost it. But we stayed friends, i stayed by your side even though it hurt. And then we had our first class together and you asked me out, and i was beyond myself with happiness.
 I remember everywhere you took me, you used to show me off, how pretty i was, how in love we were. We could spend hours together just playing video games and watching netflix. I got into your games, your tv shows, i tried understanding all of the things you liked, i liked to spoil you because making you happy made me happy.
We were hopeless when we tried to study together for school, but i always made sure i made a study guide for you. You said there was no better way to study. Your mom used to say that was how she got your dad through college, that always made me so happy that she said we reminded them of themselves when they were in college. I miss them sometimes. We had our nerdyness together, we had a future planed. You even asked me to marry you before you left, when you left everything fell apart.  
You got that amazing job, but you had to leave for 5 months for training. I put on my big girl face and helped you through the application process, didn't cry when you left because you didn't want me to. I texted you every day and tried to act like you were still here. You were tired and being up there was stressful, i always tried to be supportive and cheer you on, not complain when you didn't call. And when you showed up after that first month at my door that weekend, i was sure i was imagining things. You had missed me, you hugged me and kissed me and i was so happy. You came down two times after that, i never felt that our relationship was failing. We called and texted all the time, you always said you loved me and missed me, you apologized for not calling me enough but that i still meant the world to you. 
And then one month before your graduation you came down without telling me, i saw a picture of you on facebook that said you were here. I called you the next day and you said you were here, you came over to see me before leaving again. I refused to argue and spoil what little time we had. We talked about your upcoming graduation, about me going up there with your parents, you said you loved me. 

And then two days later when i was still upset about you not telling me you had come down you answered with a long text saying that you were going through a time in your life you felt like you had to be alone, that your new job was going to be too much and i didnt deserve that. that i was amazing and i deserved someone better. I cried and begged, said i would carry the relationship on my shoulders if necessary, we only lived 5 minutes away from each other how hard could it be. But you said no to every single one of my pleas, that you had thought it over and you just wanted to be alone.

I had never felt so alone in my life. My world crashed, all of my summer plans gone. You texted me another 3 times saying the same things and saying you would give me my things back. You never did. You said we would talk in person when you came back down. We never did, not a phone call or email, nothing. I went to see a shrink for the rest of the summer. She helped me through it, to talk it out. Everyone expected me to move on easily, but you had been such a huge part of my life. I was so happy with you, i was madly in love with you i thought you were too; i mean that is what you acted like. I remember that day at the banquet hall when you saw me awkwardly dancing with your uncle, you took me aside and said i was perfect for you and that you loved me. But none of that mattered. School started again and i immersed myself in my new internship. I was so proud of that, i knew you were going to love that i got an internship with a big tech company; you said you were super proud of me when i had told you about it. 

3 months later i found out you had met someone new, that apparently she is perfect, you have plans to get married and buy a house. You told someone that i was just a nice girl to hang out with but not the type of girl you marry, because i didnt even make the bed after we had sex. I dont think anyone has said something like that about me, if anything i always pride myself on being the opposite. That hurt me more than you could ever imagine.

I never understood how you could discard me so easily, that i meant so little to you that in your head i didn't even deserve an explanation in person. It has been 7 months, and i am getting better.......but it still  haunts me. I need closure, i need you to give me truth. "

I am going to be following a bachelors degree program for computer science with an emphasis on game software development. I am super excited to start learning something I have always been passionate about but am slightly concerned that the medium through which I learn will not be adequate or that the school I go through won't be  'good enough' for employers. I realize that a portfolio that is diverse and shows understanding is important but what about where the degree comes from? I have to take all online classes due to being military and am concerned I won't be able to find internships in my area. I don't even know how to get an internship. "
16zoak,5,2013-01-21,[Intern] College student on a leave of absence in desperate need of an internship. ,CollegeIntern,chicagojobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagojobs/comments/16zoak/intern_college_student_on_a_leave_of_absence_in/,"The Great Wall of Text is coming. I'm so sorry. 

Hello all. I am CollegeIntern, (legal name), currently a Junior at DePaul majoring in Communications and Media. I would love to go into broadcasting, and am very interested in pursuing an internship in that field. 

A little background. 
I was cast in a play that was running out of state for an extended period of time this February. I took off the quarter to do so because there was no way I could miss as much class as I needed to. This past week I received word from one of the producers that the show has been rescheduled for summer 2013 and that we would no longer be going in February. Even though I'm happy to hear that the show is still going to be produced, the sudden change of plans left me in Chicago with no job, no classes to attend and incredibly frustrated. 

I know that this is a long shot because most companies have their winter and spring interns selected months before, but if there is anyone who could use one more intern, I'd be interested. I am available at any time, seeing as my only plans until March were just pushed back to August :(.

I have a strong theatre background and have no problem addressing large crowds or public speaking. Ideally I'd love to intern at a news station, but I also have experience in radio broadcasting both running the control board as well as time on the air. I'm not opposed to interning with a company that isn't a news or radio station - especially this late in January, but it is a huge interest of mine, and definitely a career path I'm interested in pursuing. 

If I sound like someone who would be of use to you or your company, I have a more extensive resume available for your viewing pleasure. 

It should also be noted that I realize there is a strong possibility of me not finding anything from this post. I am also interested in Summer 2013 internships as well. I planned on beginning my search for the summer month internships around this time anyway, so if someone thinks that they could use me down the line, I'd also love to hear from you. Lastly, if anyone even has some helpful advice about what to do in this last minute situation, I'd appreciate that as well. 

If you're still with me, thank you for reading all of that. I hope to hear from a few of you and really look forward speaking further. 

Take care, 
CollegeIntern"

I dealt with it by studying hard to focus myself on something more positive than how miserable I was. For the most part it worked, and I even graduated valedictorian and got into a great school to study towards a great degree. I've managed to keep my GPA quite high, and I should be graduating this term if all goes as planned. I never complained growing up, with the idea that the end rewards would make the suffering worth it.

But, it seems like no matter what I do outside of the classroom, I never feel like my efforts are worth anything. I managed to get an internship at Intel, my dream company, only to come away with the knowledge that I suck at what I was hired to do and was labeled as incompetent to boot, despite the total lack of training both on the school's side and on the company's side. I was literally brought on, given a cursory explanation of the job, and told to sink or swim while my boss all but admitted that schools don't teach that discipline and they themselves don't train for it. On my way to the office every day, I secretly hoped someone would veer into my lane and hit me head on.

I joined a fraternity, and have made several efforts to improve our standing on campus only to have my ideas laughed away, ignored, or half-assed on the rare chance that someone else steps up to help me implement them. There's always an excuse when I need someone's help, but as soon as the rare moment comes that I'm unable to help one of these ungrateful bastards, *I'M* the asshole.

I'm just tired of feeling like my efforts make no impact around me. I'm tired of getting no recognition when I try to help my friends or the people I work and study with. I'm tired of busting my ass for my fraternity only to be labeled as one of the reasons for its problems while half our members are lazy and on the verge of failing out of school because they'd rather smoke weed and drink all day. (Nothing against smoking or drinking, but all things in moderation, you know?)

I don't even really know what the main thing I'm pissed about is. Most of my waking time is spent feeling as though I'm just spinning my wheels, and the remainder is spent wondering when I'm finally going to start enjoying my life. I've tried to make changes; I moved from my original university to a different one, partially because I was equally miserable back then. I got more involved in charity work, thinking I needed to focus on others rather than my own problems. Looks good on a resume but I can't get my head on straight enough to feel good about it.

Some days, I just wake up wishing I saw someone else in the mirror, and I don't know what to do anymore besides blankly stare ahead and ignore the irony that for all the good things that are supposedly going on in my life, I can't enjoy them.

So, sorry for the long, vague rant, for those who for whatever reason decided to read this. I feel like my username is a pretty good descriptor for my issues. I shouldn't feel this way, and yet here I am. Anyway, thanks for listening/reading."

I am currently majoring in Computer Engineering and minoring in Economics at a top engineering school. I love working with technology and coming up with innovative solutions to problems. I currently have an on-going internship (co-op) at an IT department in a large law firm.

After graduation, I have two routes I could go. A strict technical route and try to get a job in Software Engineering at a tech company, or try my hand at consulting. I have done a few case competitions and I am a member of my school's consulting club, so I do have some knowledge of consulting. I enjoy that it requires the same level of analytical thinking that I like in computer science work.

So my question to you is, what are my possibilities in the field of consulting? I have read a lot about management consulting vs. IT consulting and although I think recruiters would look to me for IT, I think I would enjoy management more. What can I do now that will better prepare me for a job in consulting? What kind of opportunities are there for growth? What about MBA school?I am a sophomore, and after my current co-op, I will have a chance to apply for a summer internship in 2014. What companies should I look into?

Thanks, I would love to hear your input!"

How do I stop the pattern, or at least understand the root of it?",kafkaticking,ihaveissues,https://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/16yqci/i_22f_repeatedly_sabotage_my_relationships_and/,"There's a whole book here. I'm sorry in advance for the wall of text. Even if I don't get any response to this, I just needed to get this out on a page.
Hi. I'm a 22F who is experiencing heartbreak due to another self-sabotaged relationship. It was going so well - he [27M] treated me so well, we had a wonderful connection, and things could have been perfect if I hadn't ruined it... again.

I have casually dated many guys since I was 18, and I have always been the one dumping these boys for the same reason - I didn't want to be tied down; they wanted something more serious; I didn't feel 'ready' for a relationship. The idea of having a boyfriend made me feel uncomfortable and insecure. As though it would limit me in some way or bring me down. Usually a couple months later I was 'sorta' dating someone else again, and soon I was repeating my pattern.

The last two times I've done this, I've completely broken my own heart, twice, along with theirs. And I can't seem to learn from it, which makes me wonder if I'm insane. I'm going to see a counselor about this, but I could really use some objective (and harsh) advice from you as well, because you people seem to offer pragmatic, objective, and often insightful advice.
My pattern is rather uncanny because it has happened in the same timeline 3 times: meet the guy in the spring/summer, dump him in November, and by January desperately want him back again. And my heart is always broken by the end of all my crazy antics, and the guy I so desperately want to fix things with is just trying to get away from me.

I meet a guy who sparks interest in me, but at the beginning I'm generally indifferent and let him do the chasing. I usually express to him at the very beginning (and then keep telling him this as the relationship goes on) that I'm not looking for anything serious (the reasons have been: I'm graduating college and could be moving abroad; I plan to move abroad; or I'd like to focus on me).

Around month 5 or 6 into the relationship, things reach a high point. The guy is really into me, and willing to do anything for me. We've developed trust and attachment for each other. I'm quite happy, in spite of myself...
Then, I fall into my pattern: my doubts about myself, which I've kept at bay throughout the relationship, come spilling out due to a trigger. Sometimes the trigger is stress, or sometimes I feel completely annoyed by a minor thing the guy says. Sometimes it's an article I read, or something my brother says. Like ""That girl is too awesome to be caught up with a boyfriend."" In my mind: ""Am I not awesome? What am I doing wrong? What is wrong with me? THIS is why I've never reached my potential.. The only answer is to break up with so-and-so. Then maybe I can become awesome?""

I have never referred to any of these guys as ""boyfriend."" It makes me uncomfortable to have us ""In a relationship"" on facebook, so I never do it, often causing some insecurity in the guy. I usually never tell my family or friends that I have a boyfriend as it makes me feel... strange. Like I shouldn't be dating someone. Or that I have to hide it. For two reasons: 1) because I seem to be a serial 'casual dater' and this embarrasses me. Makes me feel fake, shallow, or flakey. and 2) because having a boyfriend is just distracting from focusing on me, and thus it is something 'bad'.
Family background: my mother has always been controlling, demanding, and overbearing. Throughout college, when I was home for the summers working, she would take my laptop and phone in order to force me to cut contact with the particular guy I was seeing. She would tell me I should focus on myself, that these guys were wrong for me (either they were ugly, or weird, or something else - there was always something bad about them), and scream at me if she found me talking to them. I eventually began to hate myself for dating a guy. Yet I kept doing it... and kept hating myself while I did it.

(Note: I'm not trying to blame my mom for my problems. I'm just throwing this in here so you can get a bigger picture of who I am. Ever since I was probably 10, I've always had this weird dichotomy of longing for companionship, yet having a natural fierce independence. So I've had many, many crushes growing up yet have never had a real serious relationship because I always break things off. And then start casually dating someone else. I had my first real ""love"" when I was 17. It was the same pattern - he was into me, I was disinterested, by November I'd detached myself. By late December/ January, I desperately wanted to be with him again. We got together but eventually he kept breaking up with me, on-and-off, and I was in love with him for 3+ years after that... Ever since, I've always been the one doing the breaking up.

When I was 18 and a freshman in college, I sorta had a brief, month-long romance with a long-haired, goofy-looking musician I'd met in my science lecture. I kept talking to him for the first few weeks of summer after I was back at home, working. My parents knew about him and tried to force me to stop skyping him or talking to him. This guy wasn't exactly the most handsome guy, but he was incredibly sweet and very talented, and we got along and liked each other. At one point my dad told me, ""You better not ever end up marrying an ugly fuck like [musician] and making fucking ugly babies."" I eventually detached myself from him and felt myself moving on.

From when I was 14, until I was about 20 or 21, my mother had access to and read through all my recorded internet conversations - gmail, gchat, facebook, everything - so she knew about who I was seeing and how I felt about them. She's seen most or all of my private conversations with friends and guys I've been seeing. I have only been able to begin disengaging myself from her emotional and psychological influence since I graduated college and have become financially independent.

My mother was also very demanding in other aspects of my life. I was never working enough or doing well enough. I had a total 17 different jobs throughout college but she was never satisfied. I worked in restaurants, freelanced, wrote for the school paper, had many internships, and usually worked 2 jobs at a time while being in school. Over the summers I typically worked 3 jobs (2 paying jobs + an unpaid internship). I worked many, many, many double shifts. It was never enough.

I could never be good enough, for myself or for my family. My brother is a highly successful computer programmer who shares my mother's mentality. Although I graduated from a well-known school with a high GPA, two majors, plenty of solid internships on my resume, good portfolios, and 2 full-time job offers, and am now financially independent, I still felt (and feel) far behind. That I never fully pursued my talents to their potential. That I could have done more with what I was given, had I not wasted my time on petty things like boys or Facebook, or sometimes giving into my depressive tendencies.

So these things come up and haunt me in any relationship I enter. During my senior year of college (last year), I entered a relationship again with the same symptoms (I had been single for about a year before this, and I had been very happy while single. I was scared and unwilling to give up that happiness of being single, yet I let myself date this guy with the same doubts and insecurities beginning to pop up more and more): I wasn't doing enough to focus on me. I didn't have time for a boyfriend, what was I doing. He was making me feel insecure and jealous, and I didn't like that. I wanted to be single for my senior year of college because I was in a transitional period and I saw no reason to be attached or in a relationship. We might move to different cities in 6 months and what would happen then? Why should we be so serious?

By November, finals were approaching and I just lost it and broke up with him. My stress level from taking 6 classes, working 2 jobs, and impending graduation took itself out in my usual pattern. I told him I didn't want a relationship. I was careless. He was heart-broken.

A month and a half later, I wanted him back. In January I asked him to meet with me and I explained to him: ""Hey D, I've thought about this and I realized being single doesn't make me any more happier than I was when I was with you. And you never distracted me from school like I automatically thought. My biggest distractions were my roommates and myself... I really like you and I'd like to enjoy the rest of our time in this city together, and we'll see what happens in May."" He agreed but unfortunately by then he'd mentally disconnected from me. How could he trust me again? How would he know if I'd just leave him again at the turn of a hat? Things were never the same. He ended up slowly detaching himself from me in the next 2 months. He cheated on me for a month, lied, and then we went through a messy break-up. I was rock-bottom, and blaming myself for it all...

Then bring in 27M. I met him during my time of heartbreak. I was graduating in a month then moving to Europe to work for the summer, with the possibility of staying there for the job. We had an instant connection, the first day we met. I told him I had just gotten out of a relationship; on top of that, I was just graduating; I had things to figure out; I was moving to Europe and possibly not coming back; I wasn't ready for a relationship... We just hung out and hooked up a few times. Then I left for the summer.

We kept in contact. He was naturally a very committed guy and he wanted something more, so he was waiting for me to return to the city. I was doing my own thing abroad, traveling alone, thinking of my career, and making new friends. But I still thought of him, never hooked up with another guy because I didn't want to jeopardize the potential I had with 27M, and knew I had to make a decision. Either I enter a period of independence after my heartbreak and focus on me; or I give it a shot with 27M because he was just such a gem. I chose to give it a shot with him. I told myself I wouldn't repeat my pattern of self-sabotage. That I would open up to him and trust him. That I wouldn't break things off when I felt that stress or my self-hatred/ self-doubt creep in again. That everything would be okay.

I returned to the States in the fall, to the city, and began working full-time. 5-6 months after meeting him, and things were flowing wonderfully. I was happy and so was he. He reduced my level of stress. We cooked together, treated one another with respect and care, and talked through any misunderstandings and conflicts. We were compatible.

When my fears that I wasn't doing well enough began sinking in again... I told myself that 27M didn't hold me back from pursuing my dreams. I shouldn't worry about that... When I spoke of pursuing an international career, he got excited and began thinking of ways to get a job overseas, too. He said he would travel with me and would support me in anything I did. He was ambitious, smart, and hard-working... albeit a homebody and a committed 'relationship guy.'

I was so stupid to throw it away.

But the fears and the doubts kept creeping back in. I began to feel like I was in a box: I didn't have as much freedom as I would if I were single... I couldn't just leave the city and travel the world without putting him into the equation. I was young, he would be 30 in 3 years. He wanted marriage and kids eventually (though not right now). I was finding it hard to see that in my future (it might change in 10 years).

On top of that: Why did I keep jumping from relationship to relationship? I hadn't been single in more than a year, and that was making me uncomfortable. Why did I have this pattern of dating so many guys? Was I really just insecure and unable to face myself, so I hid behind the comfort of a stable relationship and a stable guy like 27M? Was I just setting us both up for heartbreak? Didn't I really envy my friends who were 22 and 23, single and lighthearted, who weren't emotionally-exhausted or tied down like I was? Who were free to do what they pleased, without worrying about a boyfriend?

So then, one day (in November! surprise surprise), my stress got to a high point (I had been working 7 days a week for 2 months. A full-time job, and a weekend restaurant job). I said it: ""I see myself being single at some point in my 20's as I travel again... I'd like to focus on myself and figure things out.""

27M freaked out... he was of course hurt and upset. I e-mailed him a few days later hoping to clarify and reconcile things. ""I don't want to break up,"" I told him. ""I'm sorry for making a big deal out of that... I'm unhappy with myself and so I blame the relationship for it, but things are good between us and I'm happy with you... Let's try to keep it that way.""

A week later he broke up with me because he ""couldn't be in a relationship that he knows will end."" But we saw each other several more times in December, said ""I love you"" to each other, and cuddled in bed. I wanted to find a compromise. I wanted to find a way to have my independence within the context of a relationship, while learning how to make him feel more secure and not place an expiration date on the relationship. I wanted to tell him that he never limited me from pursuing my dreams, that it was an automatic pattern for me to say ""I want independence over a boyfriend,"" but I'd never truly thought it through. That I didn't want to repeat that pattern.

It was too late and by the time I'd finally had time to sort through what I wanted, he decided we should do No Contact. He never gave me a chance to talk to him.

There it was, I sabotaged things again... and I repeat my exhausting pattern yet again. I lost something wonderful. It's sinking in now... I have dreams about losing things I cherish, but the dreams are always about him. Why couldn't I make up my mind when I had the chance? Why was I always pouring my drink in the sink? Why did I throw away good things, sabotage my own happiness? Why couldn't I learn to take care of the things that deep down, I truly did cherish in spite of everything... I blew it, and broke both of our hearts.

Why do I do this and why do I never learn? What can I do to stop this? Please help.

TL;DR: I have a horrible and exhausting pattern of dating many guys, but always breaking things off because I want independence, or because I'm afraid of relationships, or because of my own self-doubt and self-hatred; then I want them back when it's too late. I've broken my own heart twice, and I can't seem to learn from my mistakes. Someone please illuminate my delusions..."

I don't get sick very often, but when I do it hits me like a ton of bricks. 

Two days ago I was [happy as a corgi on stilts](http://www.etsy.com/listing/93316391/reserved-for-wildhorse-inspirational?ref=af_circ_favitem), playing in the park with my SO. 

The next day I got up at 3:30am to be at work at 4am. I had a tickle in my throat, but I chalked it up to being dehydrated. As I rode my bike, I felt a chill in my chest and told myself not to get sick. I just can't get sick, I work 5 days a week to pay our bills and 2 days at an internship, needless to say, I don't have time for this shit. 

But, alas, as the day progressed it hit me. Before I knew it I had a fever of 102F. My whole body was achy and I had a migraine. I was coughing up a storm and I could not leave work early. 

FINALLY I was done with my shift, I today's shift covered and as I'm leaving, I realize my phone is missing. I go on a frantic search for about 20 minutes and being as I'm sick and feverish, I'm unable to deal with any of this like a normal person and I'm about to start screaming at everyone and blaming people for stealing my shit. Finally found it. I took a breath and apologized for my inability to deal with shit, at that time.

I got home and I laid in bed for about 6 hours unable to even cook for myself. I barely got up to go to the bathroom. Once my SO got here, he went to get me some meds and stuff for chicken soup. By the end of the night, I felt a lot better and even though I'm still at home sick, unable to do anything but rest and take care of myself, all I can think of is... **at least I don't have kids to take care of.**

TL;DR: I'm sick at home and my day was hell and I'm glad I don't have children who depend on me.

On another happy note, I finally have time to watch some [Classic Doctor Who](http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/). Any other Whovians here?

So I'm really interested in moving to Singapore for work. I am currently living in London and have a short experience working in an office. (Started as an intern Aug '12, Account Coordinator Oct '12, Accounts Assistant Dec'12 - Present, all within the same company). I have a degree in Accounting and Finance.

I am 22 yrs old and I am a Korean born British Citizen.


Taking all this into account, how easy would it be for me to move there find a job/get a visa?

My Aunt and Uncle are currently living there and so at the very least accommodation in the short term can be covered.

I've heard it is a great place for young professionals to springboard their career and as it stands right now, I am sick of living in London and would love to get to an East Asia country. (I've considered Korea but I would have to do my national service first, which is not something I'm interested in). I have also heard it is very easy for foreigners to get jobs in Singapore, how true is this? 

A lot of the Singaporeans I've met here in london have been super nice, are you all like that or can I expect some hostility as a foreigner? 

So far I've been sending out a few applications via jobsdb.com, is this the best site to find jobs in Singapore? Would it be reasonable to just go there without a job offer and expect to find something within a couple of weeks/months?


Edit: Jesus Christ guys, I don't know how to get it through to you. I have lived in the UK my whole life. I have never lived in Korea. I am a British citizen. I DO NOT HAVE TO DO THE NATIONAL SERVICE. If your advice is ""go do your service"" then please just pass over. Seems like a lot of guys in this thread butthurt over having to waste 2yrs of their life. "

I don't want to get ahead of myself here, but I have an interview with Accenture in about a week or so and I'm wondering if anyone here could tell me what working for the company is like?

I've read some small reviews on glassdoor.com and indeed.com but I want to know, specifically from someone in a software engineering role what day to day life is like with them.

At the moment I have a somewhat cushy job within the local government. Though I have a B.S degree in CS as of December, I'm still being paid an ""intern"" wage as there are currently no higher up roles.

I make about $35K a year and they are also willing to pay for me to get a masters degree (I've already been accepted, though I'm not sure if it's for me).

So, to cut to the chase, my questions are, if I were to pass the interview...

* From a salary point of view, would accepting the job be worth it?

* What is the work/life balance like at Accenture? I know a lot of people say the work overtime.

* What is this ""bench"" I hear about for consulting companies, do you get paid while on it, is there a danger in being there? 

* Is the job secure? (My current one does not pay much but I don't see them getting rid of me anytime soon).

* Any other advice/insights about the company are welcome.

Thanks."

Nothing is every that big. It's all the little things adding up.

I am at the age where you start to question your life decisions, so that could be a big part. I planned out my life when I was 8 and have been sticking to the plan pretty religiously since then. But I've been doing subsequently worse and worse in college as the years pass, my worst grades (a D and an F) being in classes that are vital to my future career. Of course, those grades didn't depress me. If anything, my depression and apathy caused the grades.

In September I discovered partying and for the first time in my entire life I had a social life instead of just being locked in my room on my computer. I became a bit of an alcoholic for a bit even. Those nights were incredibly manic. 

Another thing that makes me unbelievably happy is my boyfriend. We're long distance and I won't see him until the summer and then only for a couple days, but just thinking about him makes me feel like life is worth while.

Last quarter I considered my sorority my reason for living, but for 2013 it has taken a turn for the worst.

On to the little things that have pushed me into today's downward spiral

I need to to laundry but I don't feel like it

I'm fat but my room mate just gave me a chocolate bar

My sorority PR chair is being mean to me

I miss my cats

My physics homework is hard

I burned my tongue on hot cocoa

I'm on probation so I'm not allowed to go to any sorority events until spring

My bank account is empty, but it's totally my fault

My arms hurt from the gym

My period is really heavy

I need to shower

My room is a mess

My hair is a mess

I'm a mess

I want to up my prozac but I don't want to talk to anyone about it

My mom has no idea

My sister has no idea

My best friend has no idea

I just feel like dropping out of school and sleeping

I'm tired

People I follow on youtube haven't uploaded videos for like three hours

I lost my brush and don't like the one I bought to replace it

My nose is running from crying

My room mate hugged me to stop me crying and now I can't start again even though I feel like it

My sister continues to have everything work out for her

I'm ugly

Everyone else is able to manage so much better than me

I'm horrible at dancing

I can't find the pen I like

I can't find my better calculator

I can't find my favorite shirt

I ran out of yarn for the scarf I'm knitting

I don't know what to eat for dinner

I'm so behind on my reading for all of my classes

My eyes hurt

I'm out of perfume

My dad doesn't love me

I can't get people to donate money to cancer research

I can't get an internship

My banana opened backwards and is underripe

I'm out of water

It's hot even though it's january

I'm on the first floor

None of my clothes fit

I have nothing to wear tomorrow

I've told friends bits and pieces and then my therapist a few bits, but I'm mainly doing cbt which doesn't tackle issues in the past. Whenever I'd try to tell someone they either think it's not 'really that bad' or that I'm lying or they don't want to know at all. I hope it's ok that I just post everything on here, it's quite long.
I've been struggling with depression since I was about 12 years old, but it had never been as bad as in the past two years. I'm a student at the moment who has had to take out a year due to depression and anxiety already and I'm struggling so much to finish my degree and it breaks my heart. My degree is the most important thing in my life. Now the background to this, I will have to go back quite a bit. When my mother was a teenager her parents were alcoholics and when her dad got drunk he got violent and started raping my mum and her sister. My mum had to have an abortion as a consequence at the age of 14. Now this has obviously greatly impacted on her and her mental health. I remember that when I was a teenager she would suddenly get mad and start hating her own children, start locking me into rooms and beating me up and chasing me if I tried to escape. One of the worst times was when I was taking a bath, I felt so utterly vulnerable, since I was naked and had to be careful not to slip. My father knew about all this but he never did anything. I didn't grow up in the UK and my biggest dream was always to live and study in London and luckily I managed to get a place at a university and my dream seemed to have come true two years ago, when I did one of my favourite modules, had a total crush on my lecturer and he was at least also flattered. He took great care that I got to do something exceptional for an assignment. I put every effort in and hardly slept for those twelve weeks, was counting the hours till I got to see him again etc. The typical stuff you do when you're head over heels in love. And I genuinely believed he cared about me, at least about my grade and career. For another assignment I asked to speak to him for advise and went to his office. There was a note saying he'd be back in a couple of hours. Being the love-struck thing that I was I waited and waited and he never turned up. That little thing broke my heart. Before that day, I would never have cried in public. But back then I wasn't able to control myself and cried, or rather wailed on public transport. My lecturer apologised the same day via email, but that didn't help me at the time. Then summer came and I went back home to my dad. I wanted to show him everything I did that semester, it was the first time I was truly proud of myself. But he literally didn't care, he gave it a half-arsed attempt to look like he cared, but his mind was elsewhere. After a while I told him how much that hurt me, that he doesn't care about my life, he gives me money and when there's something that needs to be sorted he will help, but if I'm successful, happy or sad, he won't care. We had the biggest fight we have ever had and didn't speak for four months. I had to move back in with my mother, who is not violent anymore, but I'm still walking on egg-shells and need to be super careful that I don't do something to make her start hating me again. I was scared for my life sleeping at hers and heart-broken and deeply hurt by my father. During that time I did an internship and was desperate to be able to tell someone about my successes and failures at work. The only person who would listen was my ex-boyfriend, who has mental issues of his own, battles with addiction and raped me a couple of times during our relationship. When I finally came back to London it was only to move out of the flat share, a place that reminded me of happy, successful times, that was at least sort of my home. But I was unable to find a new affordable place, I was unable to find a job and on top of all people were starting to attack and destroy the only place that I ever called a home, the only place that I felt safe (London riots). We were quite close to the rioters and prepared to be able to leave in a matter of seconds. Then my sister got very sick and I had to return to my parents as I wasn't able to do anything anymore on my own and would just be crying all day long. That's about one and a half years ago and I still can't study. I have no energy and I'm trying so hard, but every day is a big struggle to just live, eat, shower etc. I don't want this anymore, I just want to be happy and be me again. I hope this isn't too long and I don't know why I'm posting this here, it just needs to get out of my mind and be heard."

What I learned: This is a lie.

Situation now: Living alone without worrying about scheming, asshole roommates.

How to be a godawful roommate. (True stories. Disclaimer: probably lots of grammatical errors but in a fit of anger, don't care)

1. Bring your 37 year old boyfriend with little notice when you told me that it would just be you and myself.

2. Bring your 37 year old boyfriend who just got his antidepressants.

3. Bring your 37 year old boyfriend who, on the day we had to unpack and move everything in the apartment, decided to go drinking and chat up the bartender instead.

4. Be the 37 year old boyfriend who decides to throw a fit at me for using the vacuum to clean the apartment when your girlfriend already ok'ed me using said vacuum.

5. Be the 37 year old boyfriend who decided to get trashed and came out to the living room in skimpy underwear when I had guests over. 

6. Be the 37 year old boyfriend who made my guests uncomfortable while wearing skimpy underwear in the living room.

7. Be the 37 year old boyfriend who has the balls to tell me that I live off other people when you're the one who lives off unemployment checks from California. You do remember you told me that you had the checks shipped to a PO box which was then shipped to NYC, remember? How was I the one who lived off others when I had a full-time internship which led to a full-time job?

8. Be the 37 year old boyfriend who got mad at me for touching your girlfriend's boobs (I'm a gay man and you know this). Storm into your room, tell me to ""FUCK OFF"" and then give me the silent treatment for 2 months after I apologized for hurting your feelings.

9. Be the 37 year old boyfriend who decides to get drunk then storm into my room while I'm not there, take your shoes off, then drinks a full can of beer on my bed and leave it there when you're done.

10. Be the 37 year old boyfriend who yells at me for asking your girlfriend to not let you go into my room anymore.

11. Be the girlfriend who gets mad at me for asking you to tell your boyfriend ONE thing after complaining to me all year about your boyfriend. Oh, that's right. You don't want to get involved, you dumb bitch.

12. Be the girlfriend and 37 year old boyfriend who tells me that management companies can only ship deposit checks to ONE address and they would rather have their address on it because ""Not that we don't trust you or anything, we'd just rather have it sent to us."" Aren't you the one who defaulted on all your credit cards and you're still living off your unemployment?
NOTE: I called the management company, they ship to multiple addresses. The look on your face when I told you this was PRICELESS.

13. Be the 37 year old boyfriend who loses their wallet and asks me to lend them money after ALL THIS SHIT HAPPENS.

14. Be my former coworker who asked me to move in with them because ""you trusted me.""

15. Be my former coworker roommate who asks me to buy a $1,000 couch after nixing all of the options I wanted. You ask me to get it first so we can split the costs. After I get said couch, you tell me ""You know, I think what you buy should just be yours and what I buy should just be mine.""

16. Be my former coworker roommate who then uses the couch way more often than I have ever used it.

17. Be my former coworker roommate who tells me that ""I bring very negative energy"" when I've never heard that from anyone in my entire life.

18. Be my former coworker roommate who when I told you the ballpark of what I make at the company we used to work for, tell me that ""they overpay me for what I do.""

19. Be my former coworker roommate who brings your boyfriend over and then have the boyfriend borrow my boots and don't return them until I ask them if they had it.

20. Be my former coworker roommate who walks in and anytime I'm cooking something, say to me, ""That smells disgusting/gross/bad."" Then when I'm done cooking, ask me ""Can I have some?""

21. Be my former coworker roommate who blames me for not finding someone quickly enough to take over my room when you told me that you would take the reins of finding someone.

22. Be my former coworker roommate who NEVER refills any of the paper towels/toilet paper. Get mad at me for when I ask you to refill it ONCE.

What’s a Growth Hacker you ask? Here’s the gist: you’re a tech-savvy superstar who loves a challenge. If there’s a problem that needs you to learn basic python to script a solution, you jump at the chance. If our servers are on the fritz and it takes ten minutes to get them back up, you’ll have done it in six. If we’re not populating spreadsheets efficiently enough, you step in with a solution.
Along the way you'll learn everything there is to know -- and more -- about email marketing and managing a hugely popular daily email list.

**Responsibilities:**

• Work 15-40 hours per week from our offices at 40 Berkeley Street in Boston's vibrant South End.

• Help design and implement the tools we need to keep us running smoothly.

• Manage and help design our website.

• Research and recommend ways to automate and streamline our operations.

• Work with a team of talented, passionate people to help fulfill our immense vision.

**Qualifications: (If the following descriptions apply to you, you will be enormously successful here!)**

• Scrappy: You're a GSD person - the type of person who Gets Sh*t Done, no matter what. You're scrappy, entrepreneurial, and highly execution-oriented. Once you're pointed in the right direction, you make things happen with gusto!

• Passionate: You're excited about our mission, a perfectionist in your work, and ready to work hard to help us succeed!

• Techie: You love everything about computers and technology. In your spare time you taught yourself a new scripting language just for fun and you never back down from a challenge.

**Specifically, we’re looking for someone who has experience with linux email servers, the latest scripting languages, PHP, MySQL, Javascript/Jquery, AJAX, creating database backups using Linux Terminal and parsing Excel files into an HTML format. Top notch Excel skills and great documentation habits are also highly desirable.**


Interested? To apply, send me a PM telling me about a problem that you solved and what technologies you implemented. What methods did you try that failed? What did you learn from the project?

1755nw,17,2013-01-23,"8 months unemployed, 3 years underemployed and counting.... And all I hear now is silence. And I'm tired of it.",Lady_Mel,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1755nw/8_months_unemployed_3_years_underemployed_and/,"Last May, I returned to the NYC area from a highly competitive DC internship. Networked in NY for several months. Got new contacts and whatnot. Volunteered at several different NYC tech events. Since early December, I have had several in-person interviews. I made sure that I sent thank you notes to the interviewers and follow up with them via email or by phone. 

Last week, I completed a freelance copywriting project for a local digital marketing agency... but all I hear is silence. The work that I have done for that agency was content for their new website and now I have emailed and left messages and no one wants to contact me. It's like they forgot we were under a contract.....

I've had two prominent in-person interviews and I was supposed to hear back from both parties last week. Nothing... If I did not get the job or second interview, that's fine. I'm used to rejection since I graduated from college in 2009. But at least tell me. I feel like this waiting around is not healthy and that I should be doing something more productive with my time but I can't because I have no source of income and my professional career hangs in the balance. 

I've been patient for over 3 years now, working my ass off. I'm tired of being on hiring managers' and potential employers' Standard Time. I hope daylight savings time comes around the corner so I can move 1 hour forward pass all the BS and lack of genuine concern for long-time underemployed and unemployed Americans who want to work.

Anyone else in the same boat?"
174zhr,37,2013-01-23,I[22m] just found out my gf[23f] of one year is still in love with and dreams of her ex-boyfriend and we live together. ,JustinLATFH,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/174zhr/i22m_just_found_out_my_gf23f_of_one_year_is_still/,"I know this is similar to other posts on r/relationships, but please bear with me. Should I stay or should I go folks? 

We entered into an intimate and exclusive relationship early last year and have been together ever since. I had just come out of an 8 month relationship and had no intention of dating or finding anyone else when I met her. She hadn't dated anyone or been in an official relationship in a long time and had a lot of issues with past boyfriends, including, but not limited to insecurity and trust issues. 

The first few months were amazing of course during the honeymoon phase, but right around 5 or six months things started to become more difficult as we transitioned to living together the beginning of August of last year. Living together made sense for financial reasons and practical reasons as she works insane hours in a paid internship as an assistant athletic trainer for the local university's football and gymnastics team. When we started living together many of the issues started to come out. She couldn't seperate the stress from her work and brought it into our relationship. 

We started having less and less sex, causing me to become insecure because our sex life used to be incredible. I tried everything I could to make her life easier and to regain her love and affection. Cooking all her meals, packing her lunches, driving her to work at 6 a.m., doing all of the cleaning and house chores, taking on a majority of our financial responsibilities, and sacrificing my school agenda to help her. Each of my roomates (male and female) see how much she abuses my love and kindness in the relationship, by picking petty fights with me and being controlling in a number of ways. I used to be fun, spontaneous, highly extroverted, and happy go lucky. Now this relationship has turned me into a shell of my former self. 

Recently, I've become paranoid and looked through her phone to find answers as to why she is no longer loving and affectionate towards me. I know this was an extreme breach of trust and unnacceptible on my part, but I was desperate to find answers. That's when I've come to find that she still dreams of and is still in love with her ex-boyfriend from Scottland in spite of her telling me she wants to marry me someday and how we've discussed a future together with kids. I'm at a loss, I love her so much but this pit in my stomache won't go away. Should I confront her, apologize for breaching her trust, and then suggest counseling or should I cut ties and focus on myself, my education, and the future?

TL;DR Confused of my girlfriends behavior and paranoid to find answers to the problems in our relationship I searched my girlfriends phone and found texts to one of her best friends describing how she's still in love with her ex and dreams of him in spite of her stating that she's in love with me and wants us to be married in the future.

I have an interview with a major bank as an intern for software engineering. I was wondering if they will just deny because I am not experienced with Java, C# or C++. I am a quick learner and can pick up things very fast once I am thrown into it, and as long as I have someone to ask questions. I was hoping for some words of wisdom, and things to look out for. Also, possible questions they would ask would be nice.

I was naive and stupid and made assumptions on student loans thinking my highest interest rate was 6.8% and I was excited to start a Roth IRA with the extra money I was making.  I donated 400 a month to it and put in $4000 before December.  After finally accepting a job offer I started to get serious about figuring out a budget and that included checking out the loans my parents got me so I was able to go to school.  I then realized my highest interest rate was 7.9% and that I had been accumulating interest on all my loans for the last 4 years of school.  I immediately wanted to pay down the interest that way it would not compound on me when I needed to start payment on my loans.  Thankfully I have a great job and the standard 6 months before I have to start paying off the loans.  I researched taking out an IRA early and discovered that you can take it out with no penalties if it is for educational costs.

My questions are:

1:  How do I take out the IRA without penalty to pay interest on my student loans?

2:  Is this indeed the correct way to proceed?  Seeing how it is very hard to make 7.9% in the market, and the way I see it, I would not borrow money to invest to begin with.

On a side note, I am an idiot for trying to start an IRA without taking a closer look at ALL of my student loans.  Through the course of college I just let my parents handle my loans since they got me parent plus loans."

173wvi,0,2013-01-23,Do you enjoy MegaMan? So do I.,J-dazzy,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/173wvi/do_you_enjoy_megaman_so_do_i/,"Hello everyone,


I'd like to ask a few questions regarding a project I am going to be beginning quite soon. I am hoping to receive some advice from more experienced developers and enthusiasts to aid me in a few decisions. First and foremost, let me introduce myself. My name is Jordan Curd. I am currently a senior at NCSU, majoring in Computer Science and concentrating in Game Development. Although I've spent much of my life dabbling in game development, I had the opportunity to work at an indie dev in the Raleigh, NC area last summer. They are called Mighty Rabbit Studios and are the creators of Saturday Morning RPG, a JRPG currently for the iOS, but soon to be available on Android and Steam. I developed in Unity3D, but in the past, I used mainly Digipen's in-house game engine called ProjectFUN. I attended their summer sessions when I was a teenager and received access to it, so I spent a number of years making small-scale games with it. I have spent most of my college career learning and using Java and C/C++. I learned to use C# at my internship (not a big leap from C++), and I also learned to use PHP, MySQL, and a little bit of Javascript. Also, I've used GameMaker before.


While working at Mighty Rabbit, I had the opportunity to represent them at a games expo in Philadelphia called Too Many Games. While there, I noticed an overwhelming theme of MegaMan. Everything was MegaMan. The name tags had Dr. Wily's castle as a backdrop. The DJ constantly played remixed MegaMan songs. Every booth had something to sell of MegaMan. And let me tell ya, I love MegaMan. It is, by far, my favorite video game series. I love everything about the series, and I feel that my enjoyment of the games doesn't require any explanation... everyone can appreciate MegaMan! Anyways, I had 9-10 hours of driving home after the Too Many Games expo where I couldn't get all of that MegaMan stuff out of my head. People love it. I love it. Why don't I make a fan game?


I concocted a game idea during that drive. When I returned, I started writing a game design doc. This thing turned out to be 30+ pages. I then created another document and wrote the entire storyline. I created a few more documents before I found myself swimming in a pool of documents with, what I think, are brilliant and unique ideas for a fan game. I have this thing entirely planned out, and it would work. By God it would work. I've played with the idea of ditching the MegaMan universe and creating something of my own, but I can't get that expo out of my mind. I feel that the market for a MegaMan game is huge. I'm not after money with this project, the money will come later in my career. This isn't about money, this is about sharing my idea and love for the series with everyone. 


I originally took my idea away with Unity. I am comfortable with Unity and I wanted the challenge of creating a 2D game with an engine made for 3D. I like challenge. I ended up getting a pretty decent MegaMan engine going. If you were to limit MegaMan to one room with enemies, my engine worked for that. I was on my way. Well, one busy semester and two hard-drive crashes later, my Unity project exists no more. With this misfortune, I am starting fresh, and I am not using Unity. Although I'm comfortable with Unity and I enjoy the challenge, I feel that using a different engine that is more catered to what I want to do would speed up development and would allow for a much more rapid iteration schedule.


Here are my questions:


* What are your thoughts about a MegaMan fan game? Would it be worth it? Would I receive the infamous ""Cease and Desist"" letter? I've heard that Capcom is lenient on fangames, but does anyone have experience with fangames?


* Are there any game engines that come to mind with my experiences and game concept? I know that GameMaker can be limiting, but I have experience with it and was therefore thinking of using it. What would you use instead?


* What is your opinion of the fangame vs. my own universe? As stated, money isn't my intention with this game. However, some of you may have experience with this and can shed some light on this subject.


* If you're interested, would you care to hear my game idea? :)


Thank you all ahead of time. This is my first time posting here, but I look forward to positing in the future! Also, I apologize if these types of posts are frequent. I searched a bit of /r/gamedev and didn't see anything too similar."

I am looking for suggestions on parts of town to live - I currently am looking at a place referred to me by the clinic that rents to students for $450/mo, but its even further south (near Pacific and 130th) from what I gather to be downtown. Ideally I'd like to find a place that is within walking/biking distances of things to do, so I'm going to look into other options too. I am also considering commuting in from Seattle, but I really don't think I want to deal with a commute like that. 

Also, if anyone on here happens to be looking for a short sublet or have a room open, I would be interested in hearing about it! I am a 25 year old guy, almost done with my degree, and should have weekends off while I'm out there to have fun, go hiking, etc.

I appreciate any tips on places, or places to avoid, or anything I shouldn't miss while I'm in Tacoma. Thanks!

177u1h,1,2013-01-24,Overworked Unpaid intern in Texas,arachnivore,legal,https://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/177u1h/overworked_unpaid_intern_in_texas/,"Short version: I was an unpaid intern at a lab. My boss had me work up to 100 hours a week on critical software, then fired me. Almost a year has passed. What should I do?


I worked as an unpaid intern writing code for a lab at a university for four months last year (Nov. 2011 - Feb. 2012). There was a student in charge of the lab who was attempting to spin off a start-up company. For the first month, I worked about 24 hours a week and held a part-time job. Then in December, my boss had the team go on a programming ""retreat"" out at his parents boat-house which was a week straight of 14-16 hours of non-stop programming. My boss had already mentioned that he could start paying me when he got funding (as early as March), but during the retreat he mentioned that he was working to get funding through the university sooner.

By the end of December I had received a job offer for a tech support company, but my boss told me that if I declined that job offer, he would start paying me out of pocket ($900/month) until he could pay me a full salary. I agreed to decline the job offer because I thought the work being done at the lab was a much more compelling career.

When January started, my boss had just completed the paperwork for his company and my workload quickly became overwhelming. I was working 80 hours a week until the last week of January when I pulled a 100 hour week. I was building and testing a key component of our product and we had to demonstrate our work by the end of the month. I was paid $600 for that month.

In the first two and a half weeks of February, I was assigned a research task. I was to write code and test a new motion segmentation technique. Then I was moved to re-factoring code, then I was assigned a new feature to code. In the last week of February, I was told that I was going to be classified as a ""visiting scholar"" so that I could be paid by the University (I was not enrolled at the university at this time). That never happened, though, because my boss fired me for inadequate performance. I worked about 60 hours a week in February. I was paid $800. The research I conducted was published, but I got no recognition for my work.

I was not in a good financial situation when i started the job and I was pretty much financially ruined afterward. I had to take a crappy job immediately after being fired to keep my head above water. Now I've recovered enough to start thinking about taking legal action.

I know Texas is a right to work state, but I'm pretty sure the laws regulating unpaid interns are Federal and that my employer violated them. Based on my (novice) interpretation of the law, my previous employer owes me ~$30,000. I'm not very keen on dragging the university into a legal battle, just my boss. What should I do?"
177sfs,1,2013-01-24,Badly need your guys' help with finding an editing job.,Kevin_0089,editors,https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/177sfs/badly_need_your_guys_help_with_finding_an_editing/,"Hello fellow editors, need some serious help with finding my first editing job and I feel that you guys might be able to give me excellent advice.  Some background info first:


Basically, I self taught myself video editing using Sony Vegas back in 2007 and have loved the software and the art of editing ever since. When I graduated high school in 2008, I decided to take my passion to the next level and study film editing in college. While in college, the schools I attended taught us Final Cut Pro and Avid Media Composer.  In 2010, I graduated from Pennsylvania College of Technology with a Associates Degree in Mass Media Communications and decided to continue my education for my Bachelor's in film.  I got into the School of Visual Arts in NYC in the fall of 2010 but unfortunately decided to leave once the first year came to an end because I felt that the tuition was too high for me right now (it was $40,000 a year to attend).  Not letting that get me down, I found through a friend a school in NYC (called Manhattan Edit Workshop) that allows you to get certified in Final Cut Pro and Avid Media Composer through a 6-week course.  I took the course from Nov. - Dec. 2011 and since graduating have been on the job hunt ever since...  Well, kind of.


If job hunting this past year has taught me anything, it's that more and more people are wanting you to know After Effects or Motion aside from knowing just how to edit.  I got basic experience with After Effects during MEWS 6-week course and I started to learn Motion during an internship in early 2010.  Truthfully (and I'm kicking myself now that I didn't do this last year), I should have kept up with the After Effects training once the 6-week course ended.  I didn't though and because of it, my confidence in looking for my first real editing job dropped and I automatically became nervous and diffident when I would see jobs on Craigslist and Mandy requiring it.  To put it bluntly, I really haven't applied to any post production jobs in the past year as I should have (I at least could have done it for the experience of the interview process and seeing what people want in terms of editing jobs).  I did temporarily last year do videography/editing for my local Remax Real Estate branch, which I'll explain below.


About 6 months ago, I found work at the local ReMax branch office near where I live through a friend of mine (they were looking for a videographer/editor to create house tour videos). When I got the job, I upgraded from a laptop to a new desktop when I found out they were using Vegas to cut their tours. I shot my first (and only) house in September and since then, they haven't really initiated any other projects and the job hasn't panned out as I had hoped it would. Basically, that puts us at the present.  I am still looking for my first real editing job and I have an almost brand new PC that is more than capable of tackling any editing work.


Where do I go from here? I should add that in the past year, I have tried posting on my area's Craigslist (Allentown, PA) a few times but have gotten nothing out of that.  Is it possible to actually get work with the limited knowledge of After Effects that I have?  A few days ago, I started to get acquainted to the interface again through tutorials on videocopilot.net and have been making decent progress.  In the jobs that do require After Effects experience, what about the program gets used most in the professional setting?  Also, is it even possible to make a living working from home because of my scenario with the new workstation I recently got?  I guess I'll fill you in on the details of the workstation since it's probably relevant.  It's simply a Dell XPS 8500 tower with a 1tb harddrive, 8gb of ram, and a NVIDIA 640 GT with 1 gb of DDR5 for the graphics card.  At this point, truthfully, I'll settle with anything (post-production house or working from home).  I'll also say that my editing skills are just slightly below the advanced level (definitely above intermediate).  Just wondering if you fellow editors could shed some light on my situation and who knows, maybe this could be a networking opportunity for me.  If anyone has any further questions with anything above, let me know and I'll be glad to answer them.

**TL;DR:  Self taught myself editing and went through some college for it, but still don't have a job after a year.  Any advice?  Is knowing alot of After Effects necessary?**"
177o7d,1,2013-01-24,"Nothing to do with atheism, more like a 'help an atheist brother out' thread.",[deleted],atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/177o7d/nothing_to_do_with_atheism_more_like_a_help_an/,"What you're going to read has little to do with atheism. This is basically me asking for advice. I chose to post in /r/atheism because it's the only subreddit I 'religiously' follow, and I've truly enjoyed the support given to people who post their stories, usually accompanied by brilliant pieces of advice. For privacy's sake, I've refrained from naming people and institutions.

I'm an Iranian, born and raised in a secular family. When I was a teenager I left Iran along with my mother and moved to Cyprus, while my father stayed in Iran to look after his business. There was absolutely no future for me in Iran; An atheist whose extended family had ties to Shah's regime. While we were not rich, we still managed to make ends meet.

When I graduated high school, I enrolled in the Biology programme at a university in Nicosia, Cyprus. A couple of years later I co-founded the Skeptics Society with a friend and helped set up the Biology Society, and was involved in organizing events for guest speakers for both societies. Academically, things were going very well.
My problems started at the beginning of my 3rd year. My family went bankrupt. Although, I was not told about any of that until my family had no choice but to sell everything back home and move in with relatives. To top things off, I also lost my part-time job as a waiter due to a new law that was passed, banning unskilled non-Europeans from working in restaurants and bars. I had absolutely no source of income left. Needless to say, my tuition debt to the university was building up.

I managed to score a part time job at the university library which helped with paying off a small portion of my debt. At the end of my 3rd year I had a 13,000-Euro debt to the university (and that's including my partial scholarship). The only reason I was allowed to attend my 4th year classes and do my B.Sc. thesis was because the head of my department had stepped in on my behalf, making a case for me by presenting the school counsel with my grades and my contribution to the societies as well as the Science Department (I was a regular article writer for the department magazine).

My plan was to finish my degree, and get a job as a skilled non-EU national to pay off my debt. The university had told me that while they will not grant me my degree until I settle my debt, they're willing to give me a letter  confirming that I've finished my degree to allow me to get a job. A couple of months before graduation I managed to get an internship at a pharmaceutical company. They said they would hire me once I graduated.
Just as I thought things were looking up, Cyprus passed a new law which pretty much killed all my chances of getting hired. The law basically said regardless of qualification, priority goes to EU nationals for skilled jobs. And that was it. My best chance of paying my debt was gone.

Later I found out that my university was hiring lab assistants, so I had a talk with the administration proposing that I could work for them to settle my debt. They refused, because ""getting me a work permit was too much hassle"". So I tried one last thing; tutoring. I put up fliers around the campus, only to get a call a few days later from the university saying that I was not allowed to put up fliers about tutoring because the university offers free tutoring. I asked them if they'd like to hire me as a tutor and I was turned down, again.


So that's basically it. I cannot work in Cyprus under any circumstance, and I cannot work anywhere else for that matter without my degree until I pay my 21,000-Euro debt. Going back to Iran is not an option. Not only will I be oppressed for the rest of my life with threat of death for apostasy hanging over my head, the highest paying job I'm certified to do in Iran is teaching English which pays around 450 Euros/month: that's only 100 euros less than what my Civil Engineer cousin earns in Iran. Only skilled, full-time jobs would allow me to earn enough money to settle my debt and earn my degree in 2-3 years.

To top everything off, my visa expires in less than 3 months, forcing me to go back to Iran.

What do you suggest I do? What would you do in my situation? I'm ashamed to say I was even thinking of organizing an online fundraiser, asking redditors to donate if they could. But I'm not sure how people would react to that.

Please help me. I'm at the end of my rope.

I really did. I liked it so much that in all my working life, I've only ever worked there. The last place I worked at was exceptionally great; a very understanding owner, good managers, fun coworkers who also got their fair share of work done.

And then there's the place I'm currently employed at. I left my last job to move to Tiny Town. Tiny Town has a population of less than 100,000. Compared to the town I left behind, this is tiny. I didn't want to move here. My boyfriend had gotten an internship through the university here; it pays well and it will do wonders for him after graduating. He asked me while still obtaining the internship to move out here, to which I was rebelliously declining at every opportunity. I knew I wouldn't be happy out here. And besides, what was I going to do once it was done and I need to go back to Town A? I couldn't live with my dad again. In my eyes, there was more benefit for him than me.

Eventually, I caved. Don't ask me why I did. I couldn't really tell you why other than I was kicked out of my dad's- well, not really kicked out; more like he asked me to move out so his girlfriend can move in (which never happened)- and I had nowhere else to go. Plus, my boyfriend was lonely out here. So out of a mix of pity and lack of other options, I moved here mid-July.

I found a job by the end of August. It was the same company; a night shift coffee serving job. It was a steady 40 hours a week at a higher pay rate than I was getting in Town A, so I couldn't really complain. Or so I thought at first.

On my first day there, I knew I made a mistake in taking the job. I was being trained- this is a misnomer; it was more like they were telling me what I'm supposed to do and not do as I've already worked the job before- by someone who doesn't even regularly work the night shift hours. And they've only worked it once. That's right; only once. They were also spraying for bugs that night. Gritting my teeth, I proceeded to work and show them what I could do. So ended my first night there.

The next day I was to work there, it only cemented my fears: I was told I was the ONLY person for the entire night shift staff- so 6 other people- who didn't call in sick. And it was a party weekend for the university. After talking to the supervisors and my new coworkers, I found this is a regular occurrence; their night shift staff are notoriously unreliable and sometimes don't even show up to work without prior notice. As such, my new coworkers lumped me in with that bunch as well as my lack of going to the local university. Their snobbish attitude alienated me from the start. In fact, it's only really recently they've been kinder to me.

Since that time, I've wanted to quit this job. My boyfriend even begged me at one point to do so, insisting he made enough to support me until I could find a new one. But my pride won out; I assured him I could last and everything would be okay. How wrong I was.

I have been working there for 5 months so far and it has gotten to the point I can't even muster the strength to go to work anymore. Because of my pride and my over-attention to detail, I am now labelled as the most reliable night shift person. Essentially, I get all the extra work and my options of scheduling days off has taken a turn for the worst. The added bonus for all of this is if I call in sick or if I don't do that extra cleaning, I get yelled at.

Minor story time: I was sick with a medium-grade fever. I called in sick and told them I would have a doctor's note. The manager told me I am now unreliable and essentially said that I better show up to my shifts coming up or else. Yet, my coworkers- my fellow night owls- can call in sick without any hassle whatsoever. Hell, there's a woman I work with that takes frequent extended leaves of absence for mental health reasons. I'm mindful of mental health as much as the next person, but this is getting ridiculous: she will say she can work, then call in sick that day. She needs to sort her self out and get real help, but she refuses. 

Because of this job, I lost sight of what's important in my life: happiness. My friends from Town A rarely speak to me now; either because I'm asleep when they're awake or because I'm conceived to be too much of a downer because I vent my work-related stress onto them. They also- from what I can see- are annoyed I work all the time and can't see them. 

You know where you work is bad when you spend about 2 hours crying to yourself about your job and how much joy it sucks out of your life. On that day, I have resolved to quit this job and find a new one; one where I can work and still have time to be happy. My boyfriend has mixed feelings on it; he feels I should try to last until June or find a new job first. But because of my job, that's not really an option. Plus, at this point, I don't care about the money. I just want to be happy again. 


So here's to finding true happiness again and to re-affirming friendships. Thanks for reading this and hearing about my messed up night shift job."

I sometimes travel to China for business and learning, I have an internship company that I've been working with for a few months. I'm a male, looking for clothes marketplaces that sell similar stuff to say American Eagle, Aeropostale, Hollister as well as more ""fashion"" like brand lines such as Zara, Burberry, etc. In the past I have been to the Pearl Market in Shanghai (the foreigners market) but the clothes seem of somewhat lower quality and not made with very good materials or design. I bought a knockoff American Eagle sweatshirt and it just isn't that same material and composition of actual American Eagle nor is the quality quite what I'm looking for.

Does anyone know of any higher quality markets? I'm not really looking for knockoffs, more like the styles that those companies sell. Quality is of importance, and obviously price as well but I'm willing to pay a bit more for the better stuff. These places can be located anywhere, I don't mind.

Thanks!"

I think I get it from my parents who are both self-described as extremely ""type A.""  Possibly they passed down their anxieties to me and created a person who is ""type A+."" ;)

But in all seriousness, it has really impeded my ability to well with schoolwork, internships, workplace activities, and personal relationships. Recently, I have been dropped from my undergraduate thesis project in the Sociology department here at college because of my inability to get through a pre-requisite with a B or higher.  That was a rather large blow to my pride, to say the least, and has really started my re-evaluation of my anxiety and if it is ""under control.""

I would say that my anxiety manifests itself throughout my day/night in a variety of ways.  I am a smoker again (quit for 3 months, have smoked for 4 years in the past), I chew the inside of my mouth, I pick at my face/nails/scalp/belly button, I pace my room, stay up until 5 or 6 in the morning and wake up at 8, have racing negative thoughts constantly, and have trouble staying on task for a variety of times.  I don't really know what's going on in my head and so usually I ignore it.

In the past, I have been bullied for being ""weird"" among other things, and so I become fearful of being public with the issues that are hurting me. I haven't sought professional help in years because of this and the fact that I cannot afford it at the moment (full time student and also work 30 hours a week).  I don't want to be labeled as somebody with a ""disorder"" even though I probably have a whole body full of them.

To deal with my anxiety, I have tried yoga, meditation, vegetarianism, veganism, exercise, deep breathing, becoming a part of new clubs, taking on new job responsibilities, changing my career path.  Nothing has seemed to work and I don't really know where to turn.

What is a good next step and what is going on with me? I feel pathetic turning towards reddit, but I suppose it is also comforting nobody knows me here and so there is minimal judgement.

Thank you in advance for your help :)

After reading some threads on this subreddit as well as a few others, I do feel like I'm unprepared compared to others here, despite feeling like I'm one of the most prepared at my local university.

My question is: what's expected of my knowledge for an entry job?

While I've taken plenty of classes and am familiar with how a good chunk of programming language work (js, java, php) I'm not sure I could just sit down and pump something out on the fly, let alone remember a ton of syntax.

I guess I'm just feeling a ton of pressure to build up a github with projects/apps before I start applying for jobs this winter.  I'm confident I can handle the work, but I just need to make sure I can get there first.  
  
**EDIT**  Sorry for being vague, was late when I wrote it.

I currently don't have any internships completed, althought I'm applying and plan on getting one this summer.

As for my goals, I would love to be a web developer starting out, and possibly get into software engineering once I get some experience under my belt."

From what I'm able to dig up, the only chance you have to transfer into Berkeley is when you are a rising junior, which is unfortunate. That said, I need to know what I should do for my sophomore year that will better my chances of acceptance.

I've applied to a ton of summer internships, and I'm looking at summer classes in the event that I don't get any of them (not much work out there for a freshman.)

I have done a 14 month co-op in Enterprise Architecture (somewhat related, did a little actual programming in it, but my real target is software development or web development)

I meet all the requirements to graduate with my Associates, just due to a hang up, it won't be official till May. In the meantime I'm taking a 2nd-level web course to keep academically relevant. Anyway...

I realize there are a LOT of positions that seem to insist on a 4-year degree regardless of experience, unless you can provide a wealth through some kind of portfolio or something, and with a 2-year degree, I'm wondering:

-is there any chance of getting any half decent employment until I get my 4-year, (I don't care too much the pay as long as it's somewhere around $15-20 an hour, I do have bills to pay - not looking for $50k+ and I know I can't get it)

-what would I expect? realize I'm targeting software/webdev so hopefully my only hope isn't some helpdesk job where I sit at a phone and fix someone's problems over a phone or something like that. Another co-op or internship that's more targeted on my degree goal would be great for experience points

what should I be looking for? What kinds of ""titles"" or job descriptions? It's hard to know what words to search for in a job board or something without getting 500 results that all say ""Senior XXXX"" or ""Junior XXXX (minimum 4-year degree + 2+ years experience)

I'd like to see if I can gain the 2+ years experience while still in school.

any suggestions?"

A bit about me: I do well in school (3.9 GPA) and have a STEM scholarship, but I really have no personal projects to speak of (other than my capstone project) as school keeps me fairly busy.  I also have no coding experience prior to school.  I did not get an internship. The nearest one I could find was over 50 miles away (I live in Oklahoma, so the software industry is not exactly booming in my neck of the woods) and I couldn't afford the daily commute.  It's just me and the wife, so I didn't have the luxury most students do of having their parents support them.  Another big potential problem for me is that my networking skills are absolutely deplorable.  However, I do love programming and am very passionate about it.  I'm hoping that and the fact that my academic performance is good will count for *something*. :-)  Suggestions about what I can do with the limited time I have left to maximize my opportunities?

17a9sd,13,2013-01-25,"Should I take any computer related job at this point, just for the experience?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/17a9sd/should_i_take_any_computer_related_job_at_this/,"It's been a month since I've graduated with a B.S in CS.  While pursuing that i did 1.5 years of help desk work at the same university.  I graduated with a 3.6 GPA and while I got good grades in programming classes, I never enjoyed programming that much.  I got into CS because I liked computers in general, and i was always fixing family and friends computers (software wise, not really hardware).  In the help desk position I had, besides phone support, we also did hands on support where we fixed students computers. (on a walk in bases, almost like geek squad.  However, software only, not hardware).  I also did an internship over the summer, but it wasn't really technical.  It was doing a lot of reports, and having weekly meetings with the boss and the developers to talk about various website features.  The most significant project I did for the internship was doing video editing for some videos we were producing.

I was never the one to program on my own time (tedious and boring).  I would say the most I learned was through the help desk job, because I ran in to a lot of different computer issues that I had to troubleshoot.

Halfway through the CS degree I realized it was catered more towards programming, but I decided to finish it because I felt that having a CS degree would be a good base, and allow me to go in many different directions.  The problem is at this point that I don't know which direction I want to go in.  

I always envisioned myself as some kind of computer administrator or in a desktop support role.  A friend of mine works as desktop support (software only) for a university and loves it.  This would be cool to do. However he doesn't live in the US.

Finding a job doesn't seem to be a problem as i have on average about 10 recruiters calling me weekly saying they have a position for me.  Most of these positions are help desk however.  One has been a QA testing role, and another one has been some kind of database role.  All have been within the 35k-45k range.

I have some siblings who are angry that I don't go for the 80-100k a year jobs.  They tell me that i should do this and that, but I know that money has never been a motivating factor for me.  I don't need that type of salary to live comfortably, and I try to never live my life for someone else.  Plus, I know that the higher the salary, the higher the stress.  I value my free time, and don't need a career where i'm going to be doing 60+ hours a week regularly. 40 hours M-F is fine with me.

At this point i'm not particularly picky, I just want a job that is computer related  (that is all I ever asked for).  I just don't know exactly which career path to eventually go towards.  My parents tell me to get any computer related job now just to have some more experience to put on my resume.  It's been a month after graduation and I feel like the longer I wait, the tougher it will be to break in.  Although I feel like i'm somewhat ahead of the curve as most kids graduate in May.

What advice would you give me?

[Have you ever seen a case of Munchhausen by proxy?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800orn?context=5)|Yes. Not a single one. Many. Last year there was this specific single mom early in her 30s that would go into WebMD and find a random disease. Then, she'd come up with a story and ask for her kid to have all scans possible (the kid was 5 years old and i was not going to strafe run his body with radiation from a CT and several xrays). The mom wanted us to believe that the kid had Osteogenisis Imperfecta (Glass-Bone Disease) and came up with some weird stories. The kid had bad hand-shaped bruises all over his leg (the mom actually tried to break his femur, the strongest bone in the body), and we called social service. Never heard from the mom or the kid again.
[How do you deal with the heartbreaking reality that occurs when a child dies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c8002qk?context=5)|The worst of seeing a kid dying on your supervision is that you're the one supposed to ask the parents to follow you to the social worker's office and there you have to say the same thing all the doctors say: ''We did everything we could. We followed the protocols but, unfortunatly, your son/daughter didn't survive. We are sorry for your loss and we will be here to help you in any way we can''. And then hear the relative scream: ""No, you didn't. If you did everything you could do, she'd be alive. I'm going to sue you/You are a monster/Is this because of my healthcare provider?"" This. THIS is a heartbreaker. Usually, they say that they are sorry, but this stays in your mind forever.
[Wow, that is harsh that most people resort immediately to pinning the cause of death on you.

[Wow seriously? Mind telling the full story?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800ktl?context=5)|Here we go then. Bad car crash on a highway, two deceased on scene (other car), other two badly injured (wife and kid), one person almost unharmed (the father). Kid was taken to the hospital by helicopter already bradicardic (his heart frequence was very low) and we were trying to stabilize it while giving him blood/ringer fluid (he had several injuries and could potentially bleed out). Then he crashed on a V-fib (ventricular fribilation, when the heart is beating abnormally and not providing the body enough blood, in this case we have to shock) then we started CPR. The whole team was very focusing on saving that life and you could hear the father crying at the ER entrance. We shocked the kid about three times or so, and he finally came back on a stable sinus rhythm. At this time, the mother was already stabilized and on her way to orthopedics to get her broken leg operated, but several minutes after, the kid entered a state of shock doing a CT scan and crashed again. We did everything we could but then we realized he had several deadly injuries inside his body (injuries that we were about to discover on the CT scan) and he didn't make it. We made the procedure of telling the father and all, and then he punched me when i said his kid died. He said he'd sue me for malpractice and neglygency because we didn't discover that his kid had splenic rupture and liver injuries. The thing is that we were busy making his child breathe again before we did a scan, and the kid crashed again mid-scan, so we couldnt know since the abdomen was not that swollen, and then he apologized.
[Wow. That is heartbreaking. I can't imagine being on his or your end of that.  What was your reaction when he punched you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800w5s?context=5)|I had a very deep breath and walked out of the room.

[Have you ever seen pretty much clear evidence of child abuse and if so, how does that play out?  Like on medical TV shows where they secretly call the police and have them just show up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800b7n?context=5)|If we are sure that a child is being abused, we ask the parents to follow us into the hospital's social worker's office. They wait there (alone and under vigilance) until we have a Tuteraly Council agent to talk to the parents. If the abuse is really irrefutable, the child is usually taken from the parents and we call the police. What happens next is only for the cops and the parents to know.
[How frequently does this happen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800xjs?context=5)|Not very often, because we work with poor, honest and humble people (the hospital is located on a poor neightborhood). But we are prepared to respond to this when it happens.
[What is your favourite part of your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c7zzp8n?context=5)|Walking out of the ER with good news for the parents.
[What is the worst case you have had to deal with on a young child?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c7zzyr1?context=5)|So... The boy (13 years old) was riding his bike down a hill and he horribly fell, broke a leg and an arm, and somehow stuck his neck into the bycicles chain. Needless to say he suffered severe trauma and had cardiac arrest on scene. EMTs tried to bring him back but he arrived into the hospital on a very poor state and after 15 minutes or so of continued CPR we called him deceased.

[Now that you are a doctor and have gone through all the hoops to get there, would you do it again? Do you feel you made the best career choice? I ask because I know it's not easy to be a doctor. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c7zzrh3?context=5)|Yes, i would. Being a doctor was my dream since i had like 4 years old. I never wanted to be a famous soccer player, an astronaut or something like that. I always wanted to be a medic. 85% of my toys when i was a kid were all about medicine. I had one birthday when i asked my mom for a cheapass stethoscope and she gave it to me.
[\[Edit: Also, what was your reaction the first time a child died under your care? I can't even imagine.\]](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800wla?context=5)|It depends. But we do have one or two deceased children per week that reach the hospital already dead or die in the ER, but like i said, i'm not always supervising the emergency room. There are other doctors.
[Wow. That is much more frequent than I would have thought. I edited my original question. When you have time, I would really appreciate you answering it as I am genuinely curious.  Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c8011u0?context=5)|My reaction was ''i killed this kid''. I was on my first days after residency and i was helping a more experienced doctor. This doctor was a very cool guy (he was an old man, like 60) and he told me that sometimes people die and we have to let go. I felt amazingly better.
[How are you able to balance your career and your outside life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c8013bs?context=5)|I'm young so i live alone, i don't have a wife or kids (i'm 31) but i do have an amazing girlfriend who's always there for me. My job is the greatest thing in my life (after her, of course) and i love it. I usually don't talk much about my job with friends unless they are fellow doctors, and i live a normal life. It's not a big deal.
[What is your opinion on the current standards of pain management during painful tests such as VCUGs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800zau?context=5)|The pain management is fine, but the more psychologic appeal the test has (like VCUGs, no 5 year old is ready to have a tube inside his private parts), the more preocupied the parents get and the more painful it is for the child. Pain management on painful tests is deeply studied so the kid feels little to nothing, but sometimes they see what is going to happen and they think that they WILL feel pain and they end up crying and actually making the pain a big deal.
[I missed getting one of my kids a flu shot this year.

Better safe than sorry.
[About how many children do you attend to a day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c8000ny?context=5)|There are three pediatricians everyday on the ER (Clinic), so i attend about 15 kids on a calm day and 30 when the ER's Clinic is filled with sick people (my shifts go 6AM-6PM). On the Emergency Room itself, about two to seven a day, if no big accidents happen. I do attend other emergency calls that don't involve kids.
[That shift seems harsh.. How do you keep a social life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c8011ke?context=5)|My shift is not daily (but i'm going to work tomorrow and it's already midnight on my country so i should get some sleep, lol) and some doctors cover my place, but i do make friends inside the hospital as well. The interns, nurses and more experienced physicians have some cool stories.

 |Yes, i did. TL;DR: Crazy mom, tried to break the kids femur because she wanted to make him look like he had Osteogenisis Imperfecta (glass bone disease), we called social service and the kid had to go onto psychiatric care and had tons of bruises all over her body due to the mom attempting to break a bone and make us believe that the kid had the disease. Kid had no other symptoms, muscular tone was k, and i never heard from the mom again.
[Will you prescribe me medical marijuana?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800fyh?context=5)|No.

But i know some stories about the EMTs (they are the ones who see what happened), when they arrive at the scene and the kid has just lost both the parents. It's sad.

There is nothing ok on giving medicine to someone sick without a doctor prescribing it.

179okv,5,2013-01-25,Am I (21f) wasting my time with m22?,psstsecret,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/179okv/am_i_21f_wasting_my_time_with_m22/,"The income wall of text comes with the exciting bonus of a crapton of parentheses. I apologize in advance.

My SO (we’ll call him M) and I met this summer at a bonfire. I was about three months off of a year and a half long relationship wherein my partner and I lived together. I ended the relationship primarily due to a desire to be young and single and not tied down. In hindsight, my relationship with my ex was very stressful and suffered from other issues as well.

M and I started seeing one another (casually, no-expectations) almost immediately. We took things slowly at first, but eventually developed an intimate, albeit NSA relationship.

This continued for two months, but we decided to make things official and try our hand at long distance when I headed back to school again this Fall (I’m only an hour away, but there are complicating details). The chemistry between us is insane, the sex is incredible and I had a feeling that the relationship was at least worth a shot. We’ve now been officially a couple for five months, but since the beginning, there have been.. issues.

When we were still casual, he was often distant or disinclined to make plans. I had to chase after him. I attributed this to his being more emotionally involved in the relationship at that point in time than I was (which was true), and assumed it would change once we’d gone official (it hasn’t). He has a general trend of not acting in a way that proves he cares about me (though I know without a doubt that he does). He has said, and I understand, that he’s much more physically than verbally affectionate, but with only seeing one another a few times a month, it gets emotionally trying. As a side note, this is only his second relationship and both of our first times being a partner in a long distance arrangement. I understand that part of this is just ironing out “remembering how to be a good partner”.

Our communication has also been thus far kind of dismal. He tends to get passive aggressive, defensive and (I believe, unintentionally) manipulative when I bring up a problem, leading us to discuss (argue about) his communication style rather than the actual issue at hand. We recently had a long talk about this (mostly me talking, him listening), and I think we both agreed to compromise and meet in the middle regarding communication. No situation has come up since to test this agreement.

On the few occasions thus far that I’ve brought up problems and we’ve been able to discuss them, he’s made an effort to adjust accordingly.

These are just some of the current issues with the relationship. It’s all stuff that I’m totally willing to talk to him about and work around in order to make us work as a couple. In light of the “bigger picture”, though, I’m wondering if it’s even worth our time to try.

I am a full time college student, varsity athlete and work the maximum amount of time allowed by my on-campus employer. My parents pay for my tuition, but I cover all my day-to-day living expenses. I’m on track, at the moment, to graduate a semester early after a completing an exciting internship in my field of study. I do not have a car (complicating detail), but plan on saving my internship wages to buy one.

My SO is a high school graduate (barely), and employed part time (30ish hours a week) at a retail behemoth. He pays his own rent and lives in an apartment with his brother and ex-stepfather. He does not have his driver’s license (further complicating the LDR), and owes $900 to a collections agency from a community college he chickened out before attending. He is, essentially, a textbook loser.

But he’s also a great guy. He’s funny and sexy and sweet and charming and confident and a hundred other great things. But I’ve done the whole “boys going nowhere” thing before, and it’s just a bad situation for both parties. He has such potential, but seems totally apathetic to moving forward with his life. Part of this stems from him mom being a kinda shit parent when he was growing up, but at some point, you’ve got to rise above whatever crappy hand you’ve been dealt. He doesn’t have a plan for his life, nor any real idea of how to function as an adult. I may not have a specific plan for me, either, but I know I’m going places, and I want him with me as an equal, contributing partner, not a tag-along.

Reddit, what do I do? Facing all these small problems in our relationship, in light of the bigger picture, makes me super depressed about our future potential. But I love this man, and the thought of breaking up with him is so upsetting. I could easily see us together long term, but sometimes, the situation now seems hopeless that it might be better to cut our losses before we’re both even more invested.

Sorry if this is too much of a jumble, I haven't had an opportunity to get all my thoughts out on this yet. I'm happy to clarify anything y'all have questions about.

**tl;dr 21f with a 22m for 5 months. Great potential and awesome chemistry, but a ton of extenuating circumstances, both small (communication issues, relationship expectations), and large (totally different places in our lives). Is it worth trying, or should I accept that there are too many issues and end things now, before we’re both more invested?** "
179jra,20,2013-01-25,"A thank you, and last call for the dating-wtf self-improvement group",dating-wtf,faimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/179jra/a_thank_you_and_last_call_for_the_datingwtf/,"Hey people, thanks for all the support with the AMA last week. My comment about social anxiety that shakedown submitted to bestof made the front page of reddit, wtf?! If you sent me a message or email and haven't heard back, you're not alone. School started this week and I haven't had time to do much with the blog/responding to people at all. I'll try to do more this weekend. 

Anyway, I just wanted to write a reminder that today is technically the last day to send me a message about the online improvement group. I'm going to extend that until Sunday evening since I likely won't be able to do anything for the group until then anyway. I've had a few responses, but the geographic locations of those interested might make it hard to run a weekly group because of the time differences. I'll definitely do 1-on-1 chats with interested participants at this point, and if it works out that we can all come together online as a group, even a few times, then great. If not, I'm happy to link people together who are in the same time zones and maybe we can have mini-groups.

If you don't know what I'm talking about, here is a repost from the AMA: 

I like this forum quite a bit because I find that most of the people who post here are generally not whiners who blame everyone else for their problems. They genuinely want to make positive changes in their lives, but often don't know how. Not knowing ""how"" is okay - there are many things one can do in order to learn. It's the attitude that is important to start off with.

My favorite types of people to work with when I do therapy and mentoring are the people who have self-awareness. They understand the impact of their own decisions, often recognize why these decisions are not positively influencing their lives, but don't know how to enact change. Make sense? I can help you if you want to help yourself.

The types of people I don't enjoy working with are the people who complain a lot about their lives, have excuses for everything, and don't recognize or take any responsibility for their own actions.
I've been thinking in the last few days how else I can try to support the people who read this forum. I read in another post that some people are interested in doing a men's group. I have an idea that may or may not work, but if people are interested, I'd be willing to explore it. I'd like to find 4-5 guys on this forum who would be interested in being part of a group. I would help to lead/facilitate this group to begin with (running groups is something I do at work, so I do have some experience with it). 

It would involve weekly group meetings, at a set time and day, in an online chat. I would also have one-on-one online chats with each of the members to help them identify their problems and help them set goals. After that, I can act as a ""personal trainer"" of sorts - someone who will check in and see how the goals are going, push them when they're feeling poorly about meeting goals, offer encouragement, etc.
In order for this to work, the members really need to be the self-aware, non-complainer types I mention above. I would be tailoring exercises for each person, and checking in to see if they are doing these exercises. E.g. For someone who has social anxiety and really doesn't like to leave the house, I might tell them to walk around the block once as a starting goal. Then we would check in about that, see how they felt, and set bigger goals for them to accomplish if that worked out. That's just an example, and it will be different for each person in the group. Once a week, you will all come together online, talk about what's been happening, and support each other.

If anyone is interested in this, send me a message on reddit or email me at datingwtf@gmail.com by Friday, Jan 25th with a paragraph describing yourself with the subject line ""Improvement Group"". I am interested in 3 things: 1) A brief history of issues you have, 2) Why you would benefit from being in this group, and 3) Anything you feel like telling me about your age, occupation, level of education, interests like favorite movies, music, etc. If you have an OKCupid profile, you could link me to that if you'd prefer. The purpose of 3) is to help match people. A group is not going to work out well if you have nothing in common. Most importantly, in your message, be honest and open. I will be able to tell if you're just telling me things you think I want to hear. [Edit: It is actually pretty important for me to know your age and location, so please do include that.]

If people are interested, and we form a group, I'd check in with the group members to see if they'd be willing to share their progress on this forum with everyone else.

PS. Just to clarify, I am not a therapist (just an intern) and if you need serious help, or have suicidal thoughts, please see a licensed therapist and/or call a suicide hotline. Info can be found here: http://www.suicidehotlines.com/"
179g60,0,2013-01-25,LinkedIn: Why you should sign up! « URBANDECKCHAIR,natssadler,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/179g60/linkedin_why_you_should_sign_up_urbandeckchair/,"Recently, on my way to Lake Windermere for a conference (see my “the importance of being online” post) I met other interns like myself. We all varied in age from as young as 19 (me!) to 26 and all held a range of different positions in our current organisations.

After I had left the conference, we had been given a sheet with names of who attended and I was shocked at how incredibly difficult to find some, not all I add, of the interns on a professional network I.e on LinkedIn!

I one, think more and more companies should follow the trend of including tweet addresses, find me on such and such on delegate lists and name tags as social media is a great way to connect.

Anyway, my point being GET ON LINKEDIN!

I say this to many of my friends some who work in an admin post, some work in sports and some in accounts, eventhough we may be young… That is no reason why we shouldn’t be on LinkedIn.

I personally find it a massive confidence booster, having to speak to new people and also have the guts to connect with people, write a summary that does sell yourself! LinkedIn can offer a wide range of opportunities to you locally and much further afield, through job listings, following your favourite company or public figure and by introducing yourself and your skills to the big leagues in these organisations! Who knows what you could get from it!

The network is a huge information pool of resources, facts, statistics and opinions. By joining groups which are dedicated to set topics you can interact with like minded individuals and also learn new things with others.

I think it is a great tool “pre-interview” to “prep” yourself on your key skills and interests and also by using it as a basis for your cv. I love seeing the 100% all star profile rating on my page and I feel confident if someone looked at it they would get a good idea of me professionally. You can draw from recommendations and endorsements potential references and also skills and expertise you might not of thought of to add to your cv.

LinkedIn is an online community just like Facebook and Twitter with a professional focus and I don’t think age should play any factor in holding you back from joining!"

* Met on Tumblr at the beginning of November
* Both 19, I'm in Europe, he's in Chile
* obvious feelings from the start
* about 2 months in he started having doubts and became distant
* neither of us wants a LDR, so I said let's be friends, no pressure
* ever since then we've both cooled down a bit, though i still harbour strong feelings for him
* I've been working on finding an internship in Chile for 6 months (as part of my studies) this year. I have thought it through and made up my mind, knowing that I want to pull through with this even if there is a possibility of us ending this in the meantime.
* We HAVE NOT Skyped so far. I know, it's crazy. I've been trying, and begging, and keep saying it. I've randomly called him but he's just too shy. About all the comments I've gotten over how he could be fake, etc. he definitely isn't fake...that's for sure.

Recently, he acted quite distant, so I confronted him. I got frustrated, and asked him if he even still had feelings for me, and he said, unfortunately no. We had a lengthy conversation I can't really go into detail, but I was mostly worried that he didn't really like me any more after learning something about me , or i dont know. So he reasurred me that he still does like me as a person and wants to continue being friends with me. I asked him if he still wants to meet in real life and he said yes, but he was very nervous about it 

Essentially I think that, we had this connection at some point, and he just started pulling away because he has issues that lead him to believe that it's not going work out, although I do believe firmly in it. Besides being physically distant he is also challenging as a person and I don't know whether I should continue. The hope of someday being together, living our everyday lives with the other next to our sides and no worries is enough to keep me going through the day, and I personally feel like I have enough strength to keep both of us going that giving up now is no longer an option.

**update**

I plan on waiting a year to apply.

_________________________________

Hello, 

I'm currently studying to take the MCAT on april 4th. 
I'm a senior, graduation in may.

**current GPA:**

cGPA: 3.64
sGPA: 3.485

My ECs aren't stellar by any means. 

**Performance choir** - 9 years

Member of a few **clubs** on campus (chem club, bio club, etc.)

**Research Intern** - San Diego Zoo (paid - 400 hours, with powerpoint presentation of findings)

**Clinical Quality Intern** - Safe Surgery Auditing (paid - 400 hours - with presentation of findings to lead hospital staff)

Starting to participate in a **homeless ministry**.

After graduation I'm hoping to get a **Scribe position** I've applied and been called back for an interview for at a local hospital at home. 

**I haven't done any clinical volunteering. One question i have is do you think the paid internship at a hospital along with my coming scribe job would be sufficient?**

I'm already taking at least a year off if I apply this cycle, but I'm wondering if my lack of volunteer experience and community outreach (which i'm working on this semester) would seriously affect my chances. 

My top school is **University of Minnesota** (my state school, while i'm at undergrad in california). 

**Options:**

* If i do well on MCAT - apply anyway, if i don't get in work on community outreach portion of my app for next cycle.

* If i do poorly on my MCAT, don't apply - work on both bettering my MCAT score and improving my community outreach portion of my app.

I will be graduating this semester with a bachelors in computer science from a state university (~3.86 GPA). My only experience...

* An android app (somewhat trivial-ish, ~350 users, ~4.5/5 rating)
* A summer research project I did at a larger university pertaining to software defined networking on Android. Relatively substantial, coding intensive, and the whitepaper was accepted to a conference.
* Worked as a TA for a semester
* One undergrad project with neural networks and image recognition, which was not entirely successful. However, the vast majority of it was functional (including the neural net for basic data), we just couldn't get it to recognize the images in the specific context.
* Another about watermarking biometric images (implementation of someone else's research). 

**No actual company experience** (ignoring ~6 years of low wage work in the service industry)

Hoping to go into software development, preferably related to science (health, technology, anything that isn't banking or video games basically). I turned down an offer for grad school (well, haven't taken them up on it, anyway) because I was overly eager to start working. I may go back one day, but I'm desperate to find substantive employment in the short term.

So, what do? Every time I find an internship at a major software company, they seem to exclude recent graduates. Every entry level job requires experience. Do I even have a shot at any major companies without actual experience? And as much as I dislike it, I am not above abandoning software development for IT. However, they are going to care even less about the experience I have, so maybe that's even less likely.

I guess my question is, how screwed am I? And where should I be looking? What should I be emphasizing to compensate?"

I'm currently a CCNA II student at my local vocational center studying Routing and routing protocols. Last year I took Cisco's IT Essentials course and went to Illinois' Skills USA Competition for Computer Maintenance Technology. I placed 16th out of 44 contestants.

I recently got hired on as a ""Network Intern"" at my high school and I work under the Director of Technology there with another intern. My internship, or job as I like to call if, consists of acting as a help desk technician throughout the school near the end of the day, shipping and receiving equipment, inventory, deploying hardware and software, performing minor software and hardware fixes, etc. The list goes on, trust me. I'm sure that most of us have been there or will be. I had an internship at a local hospital over the summer that consisted of most of the same criteria, just heavily supervised, for obvious reasons.

My question for you all is... What's next? 

I'll be attending a junior college in a neighboring town next year after I graduate HS this year. I'll be continuing the internship next year, and hopefully the year after that while still attending JuCo.

I need some advice on what exactly is prime real estate for IT jobs right now. I see most acronyms on here and couldn't tell you what the hell they mean. I'm wanting a job in a small to medium sized company.. big enough to have some work to do, small enough to know everyone and their children's names.

Is it best to start from an entry level position and gain knowledge as you go in the company? Or is it best to come in straight out of the gate as an expert in a certain entity?

I'm really interested to hear some feedback, and if you're willing, a small story on how you got where you are. 

Thanks!"

1788o6,2,2013-01-24,I was an overworked unpaid intern,arachnivore,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1788o6/i_was_an_overworked_unpaid_intern/,"Short version: I was an unpaid intern at a lab. My boss had me work up to 100 hours a week on critical software, then fired me. Almost a year has passed. What should I do?

Long version:
I worked as an unpaid intern writing code for a lab at a university for four months last year (Nov. 2011 - Feb. 2012). There was a student in charge of the lab who was attempting to spin it off as a start-up company.

For the first month, I worked about 24 hours a week and held a part-time job. Then in December, my boss had the team go on a programming ""retreat"" out at his parents boat-house which was a week straight of 14-16 hour days of non-stop programming. My boss had already mentioned that he could start paying me when he got funding (as early as March), but during the retreat he mentioned that he was working to get funding through the university sooner.

By the end of December I had received a job offer for a tech support company, but my boss told me that if I declined that job offer, he would start paying me out of pocket (""$900/month"") until he could pay me a full salary. I agreed to decline the job offer because I thought the work I was doing at the lab was a much more compelling.

When January started, my boss had just completed the paperwork for his company and my workload quickly became overwhelming. I was working 80 hours a week until the last week of January when I pulled a 100 hour week. I was building and testing a key component of our product and we had to demonstrate our work by the end of the month. I was paid $600 for that month.

In the first two and a half weeks of February, I was assigned a research task. I was to write code and test a new motion segmentation technique. When I finished my work on that, I was assigned a new feature to code. In the last week of February I was told that I was going to be classified as a ""visiting scholar"" so that I could be paid by the University (I was not enrolled at the university at this time). That never happened though, because my boss fired me for ""inadequate performance"". I worked about 60 hours a week in February. I was paid $800. The research I conducted was published, but I got no recognition for my work.

I was not in a good financial situation when I started the job and I was pretty much financially ruined afterward. I had to take a crappy job immediately after being fired to keep my head above water. Now I've recovered enough to start thinking about taking legal action.

I know Texas is a right to work state, but I'm pretty sure the laws regulating unpaid interns are Federal and that my employer violated them. Based on my (novice) interpretation of the law, my previous employer owes me ~$30,000. I'm not very keen on dragging the university into a legal battle, just my boss. What should I do?"

So here's my sob story - transferred twice before ending up at UB (transferred for a girl, didn't work out, I'm a dumbass). I had a great GPA at my previous two schools (Syracuse University and Hofstra University) studying Electrical and Computer Engineering double major. 

Grades dropped as trouble with the girl started, but I managed to get an internship at a local manufacturer where I still work. 

While I was interning there, I lost my license. I couldn't take the bus from work to school and back to work as was needed, and with no job I'd be SOL. My work offered my a full time position and I took it. I've been working there 3.5 years now, 2.5 years since I stopped going to UB.

I want to go back, and work is really encouraging me to finish up my degree. I've got 96 credit hours complete, so I'm almost there. I've tried talking to the advisors but they're not much help. I'd have to re-apply to the department and they haven't been much help in that regard, I'm guessing because my GPA was pretty poor while at UB. 

I was hoping to talk to someone else in the school that might be more help; I'm sure the school would like to improve their graduation rate, and the department would like to have another alumni. I already have the job; I work with other engineers on the same level that have their bachelors and masters. I just need the piece of paper! It's starting to hold back my career. 

Does anyone know of anyone I could talk to other than the engineering advisors? "

Mainly, I've gotten stuck in a position that's more system administration than programming. I have one phone interview lined up, and HR recruiters have contacted me over LinkedIn, but in general, technical recruiters at career fairs have been ambivalent and sometimes confused about my background.

My background:

* BS in computer science from a top Institute of Technology about 10 years ago, good GPA. Did a couple of projects.
* A summer internship in a software engineering startup.
* Two years working on a small business making a tool to help people building web pages. Didn't really get anywhere.
* Programming and IT for the next 7 years at my current job. I maintain legacy software in C and have designed new software in C++ and developed some PHP web pages. I also administrate about 10 Linux servers. I frequently write small programs in Perl or shell scripts to help administration, and I also frequently do maintenance on the legacy programs. However, most of my time is administration -- configuring software and making sure it runs. Most of my software involves getting things out of a relational database or putting them back in. 
* Started an online Masters program. Did well in the classes I took but didn't continue the program. Was lead dev on a group project.
* Only started doing side projects recently. Have gotten familiar with Python, which I occasionally use at work as well, and Google AppEngine. I've done some work with Ruby on Rails, but not enough to actually build anything from scratch with it unless I get much more practice.
* Took several free online classes. That's where I got my RoR experience. Also learned MongoDB and have some familiarity with AI and machine learning."

Sorry for block of text:

I know it’s only been 3 weeks since I told you all that I broke up with my boyfriend. I’m just excited to tell you that I’m doing very well. I’ve decided that I should give you a little more information since I was very short with you in my post. More information may explain why I’m doing better than I (and most people) thought I would do. 

My (ex)boyfriend first punched me after 8 months, since then it developed to every 2 months or so. It wasn’t always punching. It was shoving, head-butting, and hitting. I forgave it since I convinced myself it was my fault. My (ex)boyfriend lived with me for over a year (over half of our relationship). During this time, he did not have a car (so I drove him everywhere), did not pay for a single utility, and didn’t pay rent. I took care of his every need, and all I asked him to do was get some kind of job. This is where most of our issues developed. He graduated with a great degree but didn’t bother getting a job with it, so I slowly became very irritated and resentful toward him. I sat down multiple times and told him that I didn’t think we were going to work out, and that I couldn’t do it anymore, but told myself that all of our issues, all of the anger, and all of the problems would just disappear when he got a job. 

Anyway, the first two days were very hard and I broke no contact both days. I texted him my sincerest apologizes and told him how much I wanted him back (I’m sorry 2x…). He didn’t once apologize for attacking me and told me that everything was my fault. The next day I asked him to skype with me, and he told me that he could spare me “a couple minutes”. I asked him if we were getting back together sometime, and he told me that we might in the future. I got upset and told him that if he tells me that, then I’ll sit around and wait for him. I asked him to tell me that we will not get back together, that he doesn’t want to hear or see me anymore, and such. He didn’t sound bothered by saying that to me at all while I cried on the other line. 
 
So my roommate and her boyfriend took me out to a bar so we could have some fun. She invited a friend of hers, who I ended up getting with while I was trashed. Even though it was clearly a one night stand, he still cuddled me, and kissed me while we just laid there in the morning. You might think that this was a horrible idea, but I think it was the best thing that could have happened. I had an epiphany that my (ex)boyfriend isn’t the ONLY person who can ever make me feel cared about or special. There are actually other guys out there. My (ex)boyfriend contacted me a couple days ago in possibly the rudest way possible. He asked me for a job where I intern. When I didn’t respond, he then proclaimed that if I didn’t respond, that he would never want to talk to me again. – keep in mind he didn’t once apologize for attacking me, but still finds it ok to ask me for a job. I think it finally sank in that my ex isn’t the great guy that I had convinced myself that he was. 

I’m moving on, and I’m moving on fast. I don’t need to be hung up on some guy who physically hurts me. I need to be single, find myself again, and be happy with myself. In the meantime, I’ll just enjoy meeting new guys and seeing where the future brings me. I’m going to focus on all the things I want to do and experience, not how to make my boyfriend the happiest.

2X, you have been such a great help, and such a great community. It’s funny, a couple of you told me I would feel relieved, and I do, - I feel so happy. Thank you for all your support.

Hopefully he reads it and I don't come off as a crazy person.

The text:

***


As a life long Democratic voter and a long time viewer of the Daily Show, I was very disappointed by Jon Stewart's firearms segments, and hope that the rest of this letter is read by him, or at least dictated by an intern to him:

First, while I am aware that the Daily Show is a comedy show and repeatedly states that it isn't to be taken as a real news show, having two entire episodes dedicated to firearms/2A/gun control shows that you are shedding his normal position of sideline commentary in favor of a advocacy. He must be aware that many young people in this country trust him as a news source more than they trust any other television news source. Those one-sided advocacy segments are an abuse of that trust.

To fall back on the claim that The Daily Show ""isn't real news and shouldn't be taken as such"" as a defense at this point is literally the same snake-in-the-grass tactic utilized by the likes of Bill O'Reilly and Fox'N'Friends. 

With my preamble out of the way, on to my actual problems with your treatment of firearms on the show. First, you did start out some segments by correctly noting that the NRA is not representative of all gun owners in America as a homogenous group. However the entirety of the segments then went on to slam the NRA and take any position it held (good or bad) and use the connection of some good ideas to the NRA as a way to smear those ideas. Your push for gun control ideas is relying on attacks against a segment of the gun owning population that is easy satire pickings that your target audience would instantly laugh at without looking at the ideas. It was much like doing a segment on the Westboro Batist Church and using them to support banning free speech. 

Your use of props and characterization of gun owners as essentially rednecks was, frankly, very insulting. You were perpetuating a stereotype that I think, many anti-gun people wished was what all gun owners were like. I'm a California born son of an immigrant (see: My unpronounceable last name) and I've traveled the world and seen many peoples and ways of life. MY experiences of living in an expanded world have strengthened, not weakened my support of firearms rights.

Your prop M16 (I presume it was a rubber training rifle) an an example of an absurd gun was ridiculous. First, I am still amazed that we live in 2013 and people are falling for the absurd idea that fully automatic weapons are easily obtainable by civilians. Fully automatic weapons are already highly regulated and none of the currently proposed AWB type laws deal with automatic weapons. Aside from magazine capacity, the proposed AWB laws on the table ban weapons and weapon types based on cosmetic features that might increase ergonomics, but certainly wouldn't affect deadliness in a civilian shooting scenario. For example, the civilian legal mirco-UZI pistol is on the list of specifically banned weapons in Diane Feinstein's bill. The civilian legal micro-UZI is a semi-automatic copy (that can not be easily converted to full automatic without a dedicated machine shop) of the military firearm, and it fires the extremely common pistol caliber of 9x19mm. Stripped away of it's scary facade, it functions identically to the hundreds of legal 9mm handguns that would remain legal if the AWB were to pass. Many more examples exist in the form of the Hi-Point Carbine being banned or of the mini-14 tactical being banned. 

It's like the writers of the AWB looked at 'Call of Duty' and decided to ban everything in it specifically. 

If you think that it is a perfectly rational ban list at this point and after all the arguments made by firearms enthusiasts, then I must only presume it is because you think all guns are bad and must be banned. If that is indeed the case, then the gun control proponents should be brave enough to stand up and say that instead of chipping away at existing gun rights and calling every tiny bite they take out of legal gun ownership rights a ""compromise"". The word ""compromise"" implies that both sides gain something, when in fact it is always gun owners who stand to lose something.

On a related couple of notes, I'll just leave three final short thoughts:

One. New York state just passed a magazine capacity law reducing their legal state capacity from 10 bullets to 7 bullets. Does anyone really think that is going to reduce crime?

Two. Diane Feinstein (as quoted in a recent Bloomberg.com article) has stated that she intends to argue for a national AWB by using pictures of the dead Newtown children. I truly hope you think this is a disgusting tactic designed to elicit an emotional response and a shaming effect to garner votes. 

Three. When looked at logically, ""assault weapons"" account for fewer than 2% of murders, the 1994 AWB did not affect crime (FBI statistics), and gun crime in this country has been declining overall since 2004, when the last AWB expired. "

I'm a sophomore at a large private university in the Midwest. I'm studying Math and Computer Science and am basically finished with all of the core requirements (programming, data structures, systems) I'm faced with deciding where I want to take this. After dabbling in some philosophy for the past year I think I want to pursue studies in Artificial Intelligence. I think that the scientific goals of this field are extremely exciting and don't think there needs to be much more to it except that I want to study it more. I don't know if I want to work or study after that, please trust me it's not trying to be lazy I just haven't determined it yet. The point is I want to have a rewarding experience/land some sort of exciting position, in research or in tech.

At first, I wanted to apply to software development internships this summer, then I got rejected from one, and lost confidence that I had the skill set/interest level to do that. Then I got really turned on to REU's, found some programs I was really interested in, but am having trouble bringing myself to pretend that I have the academic preparation or work/research experience to be competitive for them. I have not made any promising relationships with my professors because I haven't had that good of professors. Basically I have high hopes and large aspirations but I consistently feel like I am hopeless when really all I have been doing is taking my major requirements. And I've gotten good grades in those. 

I am NOT trying to fish for bs compliments by posting this. What I'm wondering is if anybody more studied, experienced, or successful than I can tell me what the next step might look like. Has anybody here ever been in my situation? Thank you, this has really been bothering me."

Is this considered legit internship or just some project?",justonequestion22,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/17b3ur/got_a_remote_internship_is_this_considered_legit/,"I'm finishing my last semester in community college, and will be transferring to a 4 year university in the Fall. My plan for the summer is to mostly relax and clear my mind before going to university, while possibly working on a relatively low-commitment internship, if that makes sense. 

I found a start-up working on a project that's very interesting to me. Unfortunately they don't have enough funding, so there's no physical office, and all the work being done on it is remote. The guy in charge of the project requested that potential workers should commit at least 4 hours of work per day. This seemed perfect because I could definitely put in that much time without having to leave the house.

I contacted the lead guy and asked if I could hop on board. He asked me a few questions (puzzle type questions and how much programming I know), and said that I seem like a good fit. I'm welcome to join the team for the summer.

I didn't ask about a salary, and it wasn't mentioned either. I mean, I don't mind working for free. I'm just looking to get my hands dirty working on some actual projects. I'm just not sure if something like this could legitimately be called an internship, since I'm not really being trained by anyone. Would this be more of a personal project or something along those lines? 

Apparently a few of the people working on the project are Stanford students, and since I live in the Bay Area I could contact them to see if they want to get together. But still, I'm not sure how remote programming works. Any insight would be appreciated.

The first position is with a plastics/chemicals company in their research center working on process development, simulation and modeling. I'd be working with several PhD's and it seems like a very technical position.

The second offer is from a major energy company in the pipeline integrity division. Would be working with engineers in a subdivision (maybe something along the lines of cathodic/anodic protection or corrosion prevention). Salary is about 10% more.

Thoughts: 
I feel it would be better for my development as an engineer to take the first position, but it's very tempting to take the second  because of the better pay and getting to work downtown in a highrise. It's very likely I end up working in the energy industry when I graduate (because of where I live), so experience in the industry would be valuable. There would be several other interns at the energy company, while I would be the only intern at the research center.

Questions:
Am I burning bridges with a company by rejecting their offer?
Would taking the first position make me less employable in the energy industry after graduation?

17atz9,2,2013-01-25,Somebody made me feel absolutely worthless today.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/17atz9/somebody_made_me_feel_absolutely_worthless_today/,"I know I can't really compare my troubles to those of some others, but something someone said really shook me up, and I just really need a place to let it all out.

When I was in high school, I was really depressed. Senior year had just started, but at the time I had no aspirations to do anything past graduation, and I felt... stuck. I don't know how I got to that point, but I felt that I had nowhere to go, and I didn't know how to get myself out. Sure, I kept busy;I played hockey, did some music here and there, but with the pressure of getting into college (I'm Asian, and my parents weren't helping to relieve the pressure, or willing to push me along in a direction... they simply told me to just figure it out, and fast) I felt as if I was at a crossroads with a million different connecting paths, but I simply couldn't make a choice, and frankly I didn't want to. At one point, I contemplated suicide, but with the help of some very close friends (and a TON of patience on their part) I was able to think at least a little bit about the future. It was at this juncture that I discovered several things, and all by chance:

Someone pointed me to this lecture that a man named Randy Pausch gave as he was dying of pancreatic cancer:
[Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=ji5_MqicxSo)

And I discovered my love for classical music, particularly through this piece:
[Feel free to turn the volume up to 11 for this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rECVyN5D60I)

As I mentioned before, I played music here and there (I played the euphonium all through high school), and with the skill level I was at, there was a SLIM SLIM chance that I could turn something that I truly felt connected to into reality. Naturally, my parents were against this idea, and made little effort to help me realize this dream. So I saved my weekly allowance to get music lessons from someone who taught at a local university (and he did it out of pure generosity, too. Private lessons can cost a lot of money, but he let me pay what I could, when I could), and I worked my freaking butt off for three months, and then applied for some auditions at various colleges. After a nerve-wracking audition season, I finally got an admission letter (and from a good school, too!), and started my path in becoming a music teacher. 

A lot of truly amazing things have happened since then. I began cultivating my pedagogy, and through teaching private lessons, marching band, and my student-teaching internship, I discovered the formative power of music, and how it can be used to teach young people how to feel *powerful* through performance, and also how to feel truly relevant in their respective spheres of influence. I take Benjamin Zander's teachings to heart:

&gt; My power lies in my ability to make others **powerful**.

Lately I've felt so good about my life, about how far I've come, and about how I've been able to affect the lives of so many young musicians (and they've affected me in profound ways as well) but today, it took ONE person to say something nasty to me at work to make me feel worthless. I get it, I fucked up (one, we're human, and two, it really shouldn't have been as big of a deal as it should have been), but she embarrassed me in front of a client, and just kept screaming bloody murder. I'm not going to go into detail with what she said exactly, but with one sentence she managed to make everything I've worked for, everything that I've been teaching to my students about relevance seem worthless, and I haven't felt this depressed in several years. It just brought back memories of the kind of shit my mother used to say to me, and I thought I had moved past that point in my life. Also, today was the first day since I started working at this place that I hated being there. I know it took a while to get to this point, and I really don't know what I want from this rant. I think, maybe, I just want someone to tell me to ""hang in there,"" or maybe I just want the knowledge that someone, somewhere is reading this and thinking about me, even if it is for the minute or so that they read this. I really don't know.

Mostly, I just ~~want~~ need a hug."
17atsv,14,2013-01-25,"I hate myself sometimes, and I'm not sure why",throwawaylotion,sad,https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/17atsv/i_hate_myself_sometimes_and_im_not_sure_why/,"I hate myself. Not all the time. Right now I do. And even when I don't, there is something in the back of my mind telling me how horrible I am. People put up with me. Nobody really, honestly, likes me. They listen to me out of courtesy. And all of that is okay because I hate most of them too.

I am a good student. I have a 4.0 right now and have an amazing internship lined up for this summer (4th semester CS student). I have a full life ahead of me, if I stick through with everything. I probably will. I almost always manage to do so. I am so hard on myself yet I think I am doing everything I'm supposed to in life. I'm nice to the people around me. I try not to let anybody feel left out. I am smart and can be funny. But I still think I am a horrible person. Sometimes I think about how I would commit suicide. Not seriously. I wouldn't ever do it, I still like being alive. But I do think about it.

I have had no patience with anyone lately, in my mind at least. I don't think I show it outwardly. I'm good at hiding my feelings from others. I can find a flaws about everyone I know. When I feel like I do now, I let my negative thoughts about them fester in my mind. I am cheerful with them, yet I don't really care about them and I think it might show when I am talking to them. Maybe that's why I don't have any friends. I guess I have friends, but none of them are very close. I don't like them very much anyways, so I guess it doesn't matter. I don't feel like anybody is really interested in what I am up to besides my Mom and my girlfriend. Maybe I am just so negative all of the time lately that I don't notice it when people take a geniune interest in me.

My girlfriend loves me so much it scares me. She has told me she would like to marry me. If I asked her she would say yes. But I am afraid that I am pushing her away by being so moody and out of whack lately. I guess its not a big deal though. I don't want to marry her. She cannot handle me emotionally and does not know how to deal with me getting so depressed. I love her, but I don't think I want to marry someone who doesn't understand me emotionally very well. She is super motivated and is a go-getter. Tomorrow she is running an event to for high-school girls at our university. She is coordinating over 100 people. She works three part time jobs, is an engineering student, and still manages put aside a ton of time to spend with me. When I feel happy things are wonderful with her. But when I am sad it is horrible. She does not know what to do. I am way more emotional than her and comforting me doesn't come naturally to her. She just asks me what she can do for me but I don't want to tell her what to do. I just want her to hold me and love me and ask me what is wrong sincerely. Instead she treads lightly around me when I am emotional because in her eyes I can be so unpredictable in that state. I guess not just in her eyes because I think I am unpredictable as well. Usually it just ends with her crying because when I'm sad it makes her sad. Or she gets frustrated with me because nothing she or does changes my horrible attitude. Neither of these options solve anything.

I can't control my impulses. It's been getting worse. I need to write an essay. I am pretty good at essays but it takes me a long time to write them. Every time I sit down I put it off by playing a video game or something. I have been eating too much. I exercised regularly for about two months but that stopped because my schedule doesn't work well with it. And it is so cold right now. I just can't bring myself to get up and go to the gym. It is so sad how lazy and demotivated I have become. Sometimes I get bored and I'll watch too much porn. My girlfriend and I don't have sex because she is Mormon. I am as well but I don't really believe. I'm not on a mission, obviously. But my parents (or mom at least) still think I might go. I guess I might. If I believed in Mormonism I would love to go on a Mission. It would let me to get away for a long time and devote myself entirely to a cause that would be noble in my eyes. I think that would help me. But then again I think I would just be running from my problems. That wouldn't solve a thing. So right now I'm in this position where my family and church leaders think I'm still giving the Mormon church an honest chance. I'm still going to church. But that's about it. I don't believe in it whatsoever. And I don't think that I ever will, although it would be nice to believe because it would solve some problems of mine. I wish I could just believe or come out to everybody and say that I don't believe (my girlfriend, family, and a few others do know that I don't really believe). Right now I'm just stuck in the middle. It's horrible not knowing what your place in life is. I don't know who I can turn to and be completely honest with myself besides the internet. How sad is that?

I went into a plasma donation center for the first time yesterday. I probably going to need some cash by the end of the semester before my internship starts. I have a little under $700 dollars to last me until the summer. Relistically I can only spend about $300 of that, because of bills and other large purchases I have to make. So anyways I went to the plasma center to donate. You get $55 if you donate twice in a week, and I figured if I donated for three or four weeks it will be enough to last me through the semester. On your first visit they have to give you an intesive physical to make sure you are fit to donate. When I was almost done with the physical they listened to my heart. Bad news. I have arrhythmia. Arrhythmia is an irregular heartbeat. My heart is beating regularly in an irregular pattern. I had no idea. Talking with the medical staff at the center and doing some of my own research, I don't think it will be a big problem. It is fairly common and is usually not a big deal. But still... it could be bad. I am getting it checked Tuesday afternoon. I'm only 19. I'm too young for this to be happening. Even though I will probably be okay, it is kind of a wake-up call to the fragility of life. It makes you think.

In short, I think I am a horrible person. I have no real good friends besides my girlfriend. But I don't feel comfortable confiding in her about some things becuase of our religious differences and because she isn't too good with my emotions and feelings. I dislike most people I meet. I have trouble controlling my desires. I don't know what to do about my religion. I just discovered I have a potentially serious heart problem (but probably not a huge deal). I just don't like myself, and I can't figure out why. I have little self confidence. I put myself down. I am really negative about myself. I hate myself sometimes, yet I think I am a pretty good guy. I wouldn't consider trading lives with anybody else - I understand that many others have things far worse off than I do. My life needs some more order and discipline. I understand that. But I don't think things in my life are really that bad. So why am I so hard on myself?

So, internet stranger, if you have made it this far I commend you. This is a long block of text. If you think you have anything to say that might help me out or give me some perspective I'd appreciate it. If you don't have anything to say, that's alright. Thanks for reading.

EDIT: I'm doing quite a bit better. Putting this all into words helped me quite a bit. Thanks again for reading."
17asre,3,2013-01-25,Internship to Job,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/17asre/internship_to_job/,"Hello r/Jobs, here's a quick summary about me: 

I'm 23 years old, a part time Information Systems student (junior) with a full time paid (no benefits) IT/help desk/sysadmin internship. When I first started interning (November 19th 2012), my contract was until December 31st 2012, to see if I fit in and was capable of the internship. The internship then got extended to March 31st 2013, so that's where I stand right now. I'm 110% positive that once March 31st comes around, my contract will be extended another 3 months if I agree to it. 

What I want to know is the correct way of going about asking my boss whether or not a permanent non-intern position may be available in the future.

My boss is the offices System Administrator/all around head of IT in our New York office, so I suppose the role I would want would be Junior Systems Administrator. I should also mention that they already rely on me a little bit. For example, this past week my boss was on vacation, so I had to take care of his responsibilities for the week because no one else in the office had the knowledge or access to.

I was thinking about asking him mid-March if there was a possibility of a position like that opening up or being created, not necessarily for when my contract ends on March 31st, but just in general, even if it's in say another 3 months after that.

Is it too bold to ask that after only 4 months interning at the company? I'm just worried they'll think I'm disposable and hire a new intern, so I don't know if I should wait 6+ months before asking, so it would be a hassle for them to train a new intern."

I hate seeing these kinds of threads, but I'm really curious as to what I'm worth.

I'm 18 years old, I graduated from a Vocational high school in 2012. My vocation in high school was Information Technology. I learned about computer hardware, networking, and very little web development (although I had been learning web coding since middle school).

I'm currently taking online courses from my local community college that goes towards a web design certificate. I also have a... (either internship or job, not sure what my status is right now) as a ""Junior front end developer"" at a web development company. We make Wordpress sites and social networks. I get paid $8/hr.

I know HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, PHP, SQL, and I'm very familiar with Wordpress. I also have a sexy resume, and a ~40 page portfolio that I should really update sometime soon.

So, how am I doing? Anything I should do or learn to improve myself? Suggestions? Anything? I'd love feedback.
Thanks /webdev/"
17alts,2,2013-01-25,The Adventures of Sparton192,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/17alts/the_adventures_of_sparton192/,"Since so many people ask for advice and never report back I thought I'd do so. 

I had my skype interview at 11:00 my time, but 10:00 their time. So when 11 rolled around and I'm sitting in my bedroom with a white wall behind me all dressed in my suit and tie, I'm freaking out a little bit. 

11:01 ""Okay maybe I should call them..."" 

11:01:35 ""Maybe I should send them an e-mail...""

11:01:36 Skype rings ... ""Okay buddy you can do this. Act cool act cool.""

11:01 HEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY How are you.

Interview starts I get asked a bunch of the most common interview questions I ask questions they smile I smile it ends after like 30 minutes I made sure to ask when they would respond they said ""by the end of the week"". 

I take my final for my 1 class that meets 3 hours a day for 3 weeks. And I head back home on my 12 hour drive to FL (did I mention driving sucks?) I stop circa Georgia for some Subway and gas whip out that I-phone pull the screen down and my e-mail loads. 


And there that sucker is. Waiting to be pressed just waiting for me to look at it. 

So I open it. And I read it. Anddddddd *drum-roll* I didn't get the accounting internship.





**Just kidding** I got it! and I'll be there from May to August this summer!


Lil bit about me if you aren't familiar with my real life.

Who? Male, 20 years old Sophomore from small semi-target private Southern University.

What? Summer Internship

Where? At a theme park!

When?  This summer!

Why? Because it's an accounting internship? Duh.

Thank you /r/accounting ! Because of all of you I'm on the road to success.

My advice to others? Start networking ASAP I got this in a completely different state because I've been hassling them since last summer!

Best,

17e370,1,2013-01-27,Life is going to shit,[deleted],askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/17e370/life_is_going_to_shit/,"So a little backstory, last semester life was looking wonderful. I had an internship, I became president of a club, and vice-president of another, I got a boyfriend and life was pretty awesome.

Right now, that has all aught to none. My parents became very passive aggressive to me and long story short there, they didn't enjoy my ""lifestyle choice"" and made it so that I couldn't get any of my scholarships and I can't return until I pay off my past due balance. My boyfriend is on this ""no-talking"" thing where he is unsure if he still wants to stay with me. I have no job and I've been trying and if I do not find one soon my landlord is kicking me out in two weeks. 

Never once through this have I thought my life is over, it just sucks right now. I feel completely abandoned and I have a hole in my being that I feel only my boyfriend could fill right now. He told me that I could count on him that I should share my burden and now when I finally said I would let him help me with my burdens, he left. It's been almost three weeks since I really talked to him, but last night he got mad at me because I didn't tell him I was in classes when I said I was going to. I thought I was, I really did, I was presumptuous and said I would, but I found out I couldn't and he said no talking. He got a new job and had car troubles and he didn't tell me. I figured big things weren't going to be discussed. He says it's a ""small job"" and he said it's not like he was keeping it a secret as it was on facebook, but I told him that he did not explicitly tell me. 

I'm just scared and lonely and feel like shit.   "
17e2kc,10,2013-01-27,Relationship that may have an expiration date- looking for advice,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/17e2kc/relationship_that_may_have_an_expiration_date/,"I'm currently 22 and have been with most amazing guy I've ever met for the past two years. We love talking about the same things, teach each other, enjoy doing the same things with our spare time, have similar humor. I love his friends, and he loves mine. If we ever have a small argument, we can calmly talk things over. He supports me so much and advises me in everything I do. I'm pretty shy, and he makes a point to help me come out of my shell without making me feel embarrassed, and I've been able to share insecurities that I have- things I'd never thought I'd tell anybody. He makes me special presents and does cute things for me all the time. We have the same hopes for the future (travelling, number of kids, where/how to live, etc). Its the best relationship I can imagine, and its been consistent for 2 years. 

However, he leaving for a PhD program in May on the other side of the country (its the very best one in the country, and includes an internship at his dream company). For other reasons, I have to stay here for at least 2-3 years. We love each other very much, but committing to a 3 year relationship of seeing each other every 4 months for the next 3 years is rough; especially considering that we don't even know where we'll be with our careers at that point. 

Idk, I don't really have a question. Just wanted to rant, because I don't know how I'll be able to handle him leaving in May :( I just feel like no other guy is going to compare, ever. I'm going to compare every other guy to him and its never going to work. "
17dybi,3,2013-01-27,I am stuck,Noisebot,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/17dybi/i_am_stuck/,"I think I'm broken. I need to go to the dentist, go to the doctor. I was told I should get a shrink. I can't find work. I'm going to college for what reason? I don't enjoy anything anymore. Leaving my room is a challenge. I have obligations and responsibilities that I don't care about, don't want to meet, don't matter. Typing this out is hard. I keep taking breaks to do other little things.

I live at home and go to school 4 days a week, full time student. I was going to major in engineering but I don't enjoy the math enough to go through with the years and years of education and internships and competition in the field, and shouldn't I major in something that I enjoy and want to do rather than something that will be potentially profitable in the future? Isn't it better to be poor but love what you do? I've been pushed into a major since middle school and I haven't had any chance to explore other options, so now I'm going to throw it all out the window and try new things next semester. I'll be letting down my mother, my mentor, my advisors, and everyone I talk to, right? Everyone expects big things from me, but I want to do things that are big to *me*. They'll understand, won't they? 

Sex. The sex is getting better. We're finally communicating about our desires and wants on a whole new level and she's very accepting of everything. The sex is good. It's never good afterwards though. I don't want to see her or talk to her or have anything to do with her after the sex, and I don't know why. I love her. I don't want to feel that way after feeling good with her, through her. I'm kept awake at night by fear of pregnancy, even with usage of birth control and condoms. I'm considering a vasectomy at a young age because I view children as the end. I don't want to give up my dreams, my future, my hopes, for someone else. I would never love that child. Sex makes me anxious because of this. But I don't have any hopes and dreams or future to give up right now. 

I don't have any aspirations or drive, aside from obligation to those around me. I have a scholarship, so I should go to college. I have to do things because I'm awake and present and they see me and they expect me to. Why can't I want to do things? I remember I used to have dreams. I was passionate about things when I was younger, but now I'm so cynical and jaded that I can't see anything as more than fleeting. I want to be in love with life again. I want to find what makes me happy and hold on to it forever. Not someone. I can't let myself be reliant on others for happiness. I'm not even happy with others, usually. 

My friendships are all crumbling away before my eyes because I barely have the energy to keep in contact with my friends, let alone go out with them. I never contact them first. When they do get in touch with me, our conversations are one sided and reluctant because I don't know what to say or how to respond or even if I should if I'm not going to be engaged in the conversation. I like my friends. I don't dislike my friends. Even through all this I crave human interaction and find it through semi-anonymous online interactions on chatrooms and forums, where people know me through my username and only my username. People can't read my facial expressions or try to find my true feelings there. 

I've worked so hard since 2007 to build up this facade of stoicism and strength. A silent observer with novel insight when prodded. People come to me for help all the time -- school help, romance help, relationship help, self-help, life help -- and I eagerly help them. I like helping them. I like helping other people. But the more I help them, the less I feel like I'll ever be able to help myself. I don't want to rely on someone else to get me through my slumps and lift me up from these down periods, why can't I do it myself? Why can't I be self reliant?

Because I can't find a job. I live in chain-store suburban hell. Where am I supposed to go when Wal-Mart and the major grocery chain both turn me down? A job that was practically janitorial only gave me a ""We have reviewed your application and regret to inform you..."" message. What can I do if I'm not even qualified to mop floors and take out the garbage? What am I supposed to do? I feel like if I don't find work soon, my relationship will fall apart. She thinks I'm a deadbeat, doesn't she? Wouldn't anyone? I live at home, no job. Isn't that the definition of a deadbeat? I did well in school, I have community service behind me, years in ROTC, awards and recommendations, encouragement and sources, but I can't even get an interview. I haven't heard back from a single real person. Maybe they aren't real. 

Sometimes I think my grasp on reality is slipping. I'll see pictures of other people and wonder why I'm looking at them and try to figure where I integrate those events into my life. I can't. Why would I? Those people aren't me. That never happened to me. I can't remember what I never did. My empathy only goes so far as to allow me to connect with people who come to me for help, I'm paranoid about everyone else. I don't think my friends actually like me. I'm sure it's all just an act. Mom says it's okay to live with her as long as I'm going to school or working, but I know that's not true. I need to leave. I need to branch off and start my own life. I should have left a long time ago. I can't be a real person until I'm independent. I remember my dreams as memories and it has gotten to the point that I have difficulty differentiating the two. When I wake up I don't know what day it is until I check a calendar. I know something terrible is going to happen. Something awful. Crippling. It sits in the back of my mind, nagging me, an awful dread of nothing in particular. So I sit and worry and panic and fidget and twitch and think and think and think.

I could see someone for help, but won't they just drug me up? I don't want to be medicated. I don't want to gain 30lbs and be drooling and complacent all the time. I don't want to lose this part of me, even if it's a part of me that's holding me back. Is it holding me back? Can't I integrate these little bits of me into myself and move forward? What's holding me back? Self-help books and internet philosophers will say that the only thing holding me back is me. Is that true? Who can I ask?

I can't ask anyone. I don't talk to anyone. I keep people at a distance, because I *know* that I have to deal with my problems myself. If I can't help myself, how can I help others? How can I make other people feel safe and content if I can never feel that way? I can't be reliant on other people. I have to figure this out. I can't tell other people. They always treat me differently when I tell them everything, they act like I'm damaged goods, so vaguely condescending and piteous towards me and that makes me resent them. They don't take me seriously anymore. 

No one takes me seriously because I've never done anything worth taking seriously, and I don't know how I could. And I don't know where to go from here. My physical health is slowly deteriorating. I rarely drink water, or anything, anymore. There's something loose in my knees that pops out when I bend them. No matter how clean my mouth is, an awful stench rises from inside me. I see dark spots and bright flashes of light in the peripheral of my vision more and more frequently. I can only stay awake for a few hours at a time before falling back to sleep. I feel like I'm losing my ability to talk, everything is slowly becoming more and more muted muttering and stumbling over words where I used to be able to dictate properly. I don't smile very often. I only laugh when I'm tired. I would like to properly feel excitement, joy, sorrow, anger, anything besides this frustration. I miss feeling. 

I'm probably going to delete this after I post it because I'm so uncomfortable sharing this. I'm not posting this from a throwaway because it is probably a plea for help, but I don't know help with what. Thank you for your time, sorry for your time. Maybe I'll feel better now."

17djll,3,2013-01-27,"Edmontonian potentially moving to Calgary, found an ad for apartment but I don't know if it's too good to be true.",Noonecanfindmenow,Calgary,https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/17djll/edmontonian_potentially_moving_to_calgary_found/,"Hi, so I might be moving to Calgary for an 8 month internship when I stumbled [across this](http://calgary.rentspot.com/details/17471/index.html).

I don't exactly know the rates in Calgary, but most of the 2 bedrooms I have seen typically range from 1300-2000.

This one, this one is in downtown, has 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, nice decor/furnishing for only $1000/month with a whole load of utilities included.

I'm a little bit skeptical about this whole thing as it seems way too good to be true. So does anyone who have any sort of experience with this be willing to shed some light?

Thanks

Edit: Here is the reply that they gave me after I told them I was planning to move in at may

""Thanks for your prompt reply, i am very happy to read from you and i am willing and wish to rent my property to you.Actually, all i and my wife care about is just a good tenant to take better care of the place for us and i am putting all my trust in you. The rent fee includes all utilities such as :
Phone/Internet/Cable/Dishwasher/Microwave and so on.Damage deposit is $700 but note that the damage deposit is refundable after your tenancy. I am staying here in Louisville, KY, United State for 2 years and when i return i am planning to get another place. We will require the first month and damage deposit to be send to us here and the other rent fee will be monthly basis.I want you to fill the rent application form below and send it back to me.""

Thought it was too good to be true.

edit 2: asked for a phone number, got this one "" (502) 230-3601"", at this point this is pretty much a confirmed scam and i'm gonna have some fun

I'm a recent graduate, with a B.A. in Philosophy, specializing in Logic. Currently, I'm taking a year-long break in Taiwan teaching English, and the goal is to find web development work in California.  
My predicament is essentially that my SO needs to be in California next year, and I'm from Texas (and not even in the states at the moment)...I'll be in Taiwan through September, teaching, working on my portfolio, and reviewing my data structures/algorithms/etc; is there any hope of finding an entry level position in California, given my situation? At this point I'd even be willing to take something lower, like an internship, or part-time computer science related work."
17d6bn,1,2013-01-27,"My boyfriend (26M) won't stand up for me (23F), and I really don't know how to deal with this. Am I overreacting? Please help me shed some light on this situation.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/17d6bn/my_boyfriend_26m_wont_stand_up_for_me_23f_and_i/,"My SO and I have been together for about a year, and we have been good friends for almost 10 years before we started dating. He is absolutely wonderful, he makes me laugh and I really love him. There's just this one thing that keeps bugging me, and I just can't seem to let it go. 



**Some back story for context:** My teen years weren't all that easy. My parents divorced when I was 11, and after that my father started to become abusive towards me and me sister. Nothing sexual, but physical and mental abuse. We found out that he had been abusive towards our mother this entire time, and when they divorced he had done something illegal and absolutely appalling to her. I still, to this day, can not understand that he actually did this. I have friends and family here on reddit, so I won't go into detail, because I wish to remain anonymous. (Sorry, guys!)


Anyway, because of my father and his ways I started drinking heavily at the age of 15, and when I was 17 I turned to drugs. On my 18th birthday, I was raped and that fueled my drug abuse even further. I was slipping further and further down this spiral, and didn't give a shit about myself or anything else. Eventually, a year and a half ago, I started getting these reaaaally bad panic attacks, and just went around with anxiety 24/7. I developed a deep social phobia due to the drugs. I just stopped functioning. Hid in my apartment and got high all day long.


One day I just had enough. The thing is, when I commit to something 100%, there is no other option. I quit cold turkey, said goodbye to all my friends who were using (which was 98% of them), and gave up that life completely. Even though I was all alone, I at least didn't do drugs anymore. I started counselling and working through all the shit I had been through. 


In the midst of getting clean, I reconnected with my friend, who is now my boyfriend. He was a tremendous help to me, without even knowing it. He pushed me to do things and get out of my comfort zone. I honestly don't know where I'd be today without him. I eventually told him a lot of what has been going on, not revealing too much at once, because I don't want to freak him out. He doesn't know about the rape yet, but he knows my father was abusive (not all the details) and he knows about my drug/alcohol abuse. He has been my rock, and every time I have a bit of a breakdown he is right there consoling me and making it all better. 

**Now to the issue at hand:** I have been unemployed for over a year. My social phobia and anxiety, even though it has improved, is still hanging over me like a dark cloud, and the thought of someone telling me I have to be in one place from 8-5 every day just makes it all worse. I have to take babysteps. I am starting an internship in just a few weeks, where I will start off with two days a week, and then I will gradually increase the amount of time I spend at the office and away from home (my comfort zone). Eventually I will be at ease with the thought of working 5 days a week. My therapist has been very involved in all of this, and I have complete faith in him. I am actually really looking forward to it.


My boyfriend is aware of all this, and very understanding. He accepts that it will take some time before I can start working again. The thing is, his family is not so understanding. To them I am a lazy ass girl, who just spends all her days doing absolutely nothing. They are friendly when I'm around, but always brings up ""the work situation"", roll their eyes when I give them my answer. Since I don't want to tell them everything that I've just told you, because honestly it's none of their business, and it's not something I like to share, I have to just keep making up lies as to why I don't work. We live in a small town and work is generally hard to find, so I have just told them I've applied for this and that job, but didn't get it. The past few months, the lying has been eating away at me, and I realize that they are starting to think more and more that I just don't want to work. They have confronted my boyfriend, and he just affirms my story at the time. I have asked him several times to just say to them to lay off me, and that I have a good reason for not working right now, and that they should just respect that. But he just doesn't do it. He says he will, but when push comes to shove, he doesn't do a god damned thing.

Another problem is the alcohol. This family and their alcohol. They drink all the time. They talk about alcohol all the time. They take trips just to try out new beers. They are bordering on alcoholics. And they just refuse to accept that I don't drink. Even though I politely turn down the glass of wine, beer or whatever, they just pour it up anyway and place it in front of me. I just leave the glass sitting there the entire night, and ask for a glass of water instead. They get so pissed off. The dad takes it as an insult. He even corks up expensive wine bottles JUST because I'm coming over. Even though I've explained to him OVER AND OVER that I do not drink. And my boyfriend doesn't say a word. Is it so hard to just say: ""Hey dad, she doesn't want a beer. Okay? Lay off her."" If the roles were reversed, I wouldn't hesitate to tell my family to leave him alone and respect his choices. 


I am at a point where I'm ready to blow with this family. I want to just stand up at the dinner table and scream at them and tell them everything that has happened just to get them to shut up. But that is in the heat of the moment. I don't want them to know. I want them to respect my/our boundaries. I want my boyfriend to just stick up for me and tell them to stop butting in and just accept that I will work when I work, and I will never want a beer. 

Am I unreasonable? I just keep thinking if the roles were reversed and he had had a substance abuse problem, and my family pestered him to drink, I would be furious at them. My boyfriend says he isn't scared of confrontation, but I don't know. It feels like he is. 

Please, fellow redditors, help me handle this situation before it gets out of hand. I love my boyfriend, and I don't want to be forced to tell my story to these people.

Sorry if there are any spelling/grammar mistakes. English is not my first language. And sorry for the wall of text. Thank you for reading, those of you who do!

**TL;DR: I was addicted to drugs/alcohol for 5 years, got clean a year ago after i developed extreme social phobia and anxiety. Haven't worked this year, and boyfriends family won't lay off me about working and also they are bordering on alcoholics who won't accept that I don't drink. I don't want to tell them anything about why I don't work at the moment, or why I don't drink. My boyfriend won't stick up for me, just let's it go on.**"

17fwc0,27,2013-01-28,Sometimes They Crawl Back...,MyNeihborTim,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17fwc0/sometimes_they_crawl_back/,"Kara didn’t know what to make of it. In fact, she thought she might be going crazy. 

But the fact that Sebastian was back, lounging on the couch, and purring away was enough to make her either laugh hysterically or start screaming at the top of her lungs.


Sebastian had been dead for over three months.

And now he was here, licking his dirt mottled hair, as the exposed tendons and bone from one of his ravaged paws lay stretched out on the couch – leaving behind a dusty residue on the black leather.
Kara opened up the blinds and let the sun peek through, the shaft of yellow-white light crisscrossed Sebastian’s body, as the cat, with only one milky white eye left, curled the remainder of its tail and meowed.

The meow came out as a gurgle – but it was a meow just the same.

Her cat was back, and Kara didn’t know what to make of it.

Three months earlier, when Sebastian had entered his eighteenth year, she knew that their remaining time would be short. Of course, she had no idea how short this time would be.

Two days after Sebastian’s birthday on April 15th – the cat had left his usual sleeping spot (under the bed) and jumped onto Kara sometime after four in the morning.

The cat was having trouble breathing and the sound of the harsh respiration woke Kara from a deep sleep.

She had enough time to turn on the light, and watch as Sebastian rolled over on his side, take one more breath and then the cat was gone.

Kara was heart-broken; Sebastian had been with her through so much.

When Kara first came to Los Angeles, in hopes of becoming a radio DJ, she had found the city to be an incredible tide of loneliness. People lived in a bubble, whether it was in their apartments, or cars - Kara noted that she could go for weeks without talking to a single person.

Being from the Midwest, she had never experienced a place where the defense mechanisms of millions of people could have the unpleasant after-effect of repelling all human interaction.

You could eat in silence, sleep in silence, travel in silence and work in silence – depending on where you were employed.

And for Kara, who had been very outgoing in college, this level of silence was not just overwhelming, but incredibly debilitating.

It was at her mother’s urging that Kara decided to get a cat.  

At first, she thought adopting an older cat would the best way to go. Nobody wants to adopt an older cat, and Kara wanted to improve the life of a pet, a life that may be taken away by an injection or gas.
She had chosen a larger, orange tabby that she named, Gremlin.

He was a pleasant, if not cranky, old sot – but he was low maintenance, had a good disposition and knew how to use a litter box.

But Gremlin wasn’t destined for a long life with his new owner. After returning from work as an intern at a popular radio station, Kara found Gremlin lifeless and stiff on her bathroom floor.

Picking up the cat was the hardest part. There was something so alien about a once malleable and cuddly ball of fur, which now dead, was stretched out – and felt like a heavy stuffed animal.

Kara wasn’t very squeamish, and although it really bothered her, she scooped the cat in to a plastic bag and dumped him unceremoniously into the trash.

She didn’t have a yard in her apartment complex, and the last thing she wanted was her neighbors or landlord to see her burying her tabby in a space reserved water-resistant succulents.

It also bothered her that Gremlin had decided to go out on a Wednesday, which meant the refuse pick up wouldn’t happen till the following week. And she had to ignore the smattering of comments from other neighbors about that “horrible trash smell.”

If she ever got another cat, she would bury it – even if it meant she had to abscond to the park in the middle of the night.

Kara was not dissuaded from adopting another cat, but having an older one would not do. She decided that a kitten would probably have the best chance for both parties.

It was a Sunday, nearly two and a half weeks after Gremlin passed, that she met Sebastian at a Pet Smart on Pico blvd.

He was the runt of the litter, incredibly vocal, and down right ornery. But she loved him from the second she filled out the paperwork.

This particular cat just felt right and she believed that Gremlin had only served as a dress rehearsal.

Sebastian flourished in his new home, and made it apparent that he would rule this house and not the other way around.

And thus the friendship between the two bloomed.

And as the year passed, Kara rose in the ranks. Starting with her internship, to answering calls, to producing shows and finally becoming a host – Sebastian was there every step of the way.

He wasn’t fond of the various boyfriends that Kara brought home over the years, and being that she was committed to her work more than relationships, Sebastian seemed to be fine with that.

Though, Sebastian would make himself known if he didn’t like a certain guy that Kara was spending her time with. More than once, Sebastian would take a pee on his favorite leather jacket, or abscond with his keys.

He was a little shit, but he was Kara’s little shit and she wouldn’t have it any other way.

Kara often wondered on those many nights when Sebastian would lie on her chest, and stare at with half-closed eyes, purring – if they had known each other in another life?

There was this deep soul connection between the two of them.

Were they lovers in the past? Were they mother and child? Was it the other way around?

The bond between the two was almost telepathic – for there were times when she was feeling anxious or upset, that Sebastian would gravitate towards her and plop himself into the middle of her lap.

When Kara was chosen as a DJ for one of LA’s biggest alternative-rock stations, her excitement must have been transported across town. When she returned home from winning the gig, and a celebratory drink with friends – her apartment was in shambles.

No, there hadn’t been an earthquake and it most certainly wasn’t a robbery.

Pictures, vases, drink coasters, pillows, half-full water glasses and plants had been knocked to the floor.
At first Kara thought it was an earthquake, but that seismic output was the cat that was running from room to room like a wild man.

He was a leaping, twirling ball of fur that shot out from the bathroom, blazing through the hallway into the living room – sliding across the coffee table, scattering the remaining magazines and remote control and then jumping effortlessly to the top of Kara’s head, where he sat, like a Russian hat, and meowed.

Kara could only laugh – yes, they would now be able to afford a house. At the mere thought of this, Sebastian jumped from her head and landed on the recliner, and flopped over, and began to groom his chest.

And here he was now, grooming himself – even though patches of his fur were gone, his skin, covered in mud and the muscles and internal organs clearly visible underneath.

When Sebastian died, Kara had made good on her promise and dug a very deep hole next to the rosemary bush.

Sebastian loved to rub himself against the rosemary, and it gave him such a sweet scent when he was in the house, that the plant was a constant reminder of him.

It was only fitting that his final resting place should be there.

There would be no more adoptions of other cats. Not for a while at least.

Kara planned to travel – since a soulless corporation purchased the radio station. The new owners believed that radio DJ’s should be replaced by an iPod, with the voice tracking done a world away.
For the first time in Kara’s life – she was free.

And having booked her trip to Europe, Kara was now having trouble sleeping. Always such a sound sleeper before, insomnia was something new for her.

Maybe it was the excitement of heading into the great unknown? Or maybe now that Sebastian was gone threw off her biological rhythms.

Strange dreams plagued her; dreams about suffocating, dreams about being stuck in a corner. The lack of sleep wreaked havoc on her blood pressure and diet. She found that she was forgetting things, and isolating herself.

Kara felt unmotivated, uninspired, and for the first time in a long, long time – lonely.

That LA bubble was making itself known again, and one day she realized that she hadn’t said a word out loud in twenty-four hours.

So it was one night, three months after Sebastian had passed, when she woke from another bad dream, where she felt like she was losing her mind that she got up and walked out to Sebastian’s grave, and cried.

She hadn’t cried when he died, in fact her own stoic sense of “this is the circle of life” kept her from any emotional outpour.

Shaking off the dream that she could no longer remember, she walked outside to the rosemary bush, and sat down – where it all came out.

It felt good to cry, and better to accept that she missed her old friend.

She slept soundlessly after that.

And the next morning, when she was brewing a cup of coffee, she heard a tapping on the sliding glass door.

She had screamed when she saw him.

Sebastian tapped on the window with a skeletal paw.

He tapped again.

And then he gurgled – and she couldn’t stop herself – she was moving quickly to the door.

Sebastian walked in and made a figure eight around her legs – rubbing his rotted fur against her ankles.
And that’s when Kara fainted.

But he was there when she awoke and he has been there ever since.

And now here he was grooming himself and Kara didn’t feel so scared anymore, because she wasn’t the only one who was experiencing this.

Shortly after Sebastian appeared, there were other reports of pet owners who were experiencing visitations from old friends.

The same morning Sebastian crawled back, she heard her next door neighbor scream “Why? Oh my God! Why?”

His long-dead Labrador retriever named, Bud, had crawled out of the ground and wanted to play ball with his master.

Bud was only a skeleton now, no fur, muscles, eyes or ears – but somehow his bones stayed together, and as Bud ran, the dog’s phalanges scraped along the ground with a puppy’s glee.

Around the neighborhood, people were reporting that their dogs, hamsters, parrots and cats were coming back from the dead.

If they had maintained some semblance of their bodies, they were soon poking their snouts out of the ground.

Some wondered if heaven was full? 

And others said that these returning animals didn’t have souls and were merely being reanimated by some new type of bacteria.

But none of it mattered to Kara, who finally had her Sebastian back.

She’d have to get used to the smell, though.

Sebastian smelled awful, as did all of the reanimated pets.

But everyone would have to get used to it, because sometimes they crawl back, and Kara wouldn’t have it any other way.

I'm pursuing my second BS in Computer Science, and interested in obtaining internships. As of yet, I've not completed Data Structures/Algos. However, I understand that these are key courses that are sought after. The fact that I'm a non-traditional student puts me in an odd situation. So, I have a couple of questions:

After what courses should I begin applying for internships?

What internships would be unavailable to me as a non-traditional student? 

Thanks

What should I do? I'm genuinely seeking advice here. 

An older (about 14 yrs older), very wealthy man has offered me $2500 for sex, for several sessions over the next two weeks and I'm conflicted as to whether or not I should accept his offer.
I'm a young, attractive female and aspiring creative in a major city. I'm also desperately poor and I'm about to lose my apartment and the close friend I rent it from due to financial destitution. I had to drop out of college, with just two semesters remaining, due to lack of money, which means my best-paying options right now are in food service.

I lost my pervious serving job in October because I started a very prestigious internship in my career field. I gave up my paying job without a second thought because the internship was was such a huge opportunity, and I had enough savings that I figured I had a few months to find a new service position. I didn't have any time to look, however, and had no luck when applying. I just landed a new service position but I don't start for two more weeks. At this point I'm so deep in the hole and terrified that I can't climb out without a miracle. So many problems in my life would be solved if I could just get my finances in order, and this ""older man"" can make all these problems disappear in an instant.

I want to just go for it, but I'm scared of how it will affect my emotional health. I was raped when I was 20 (two years ago) and sex and intimacy have at times been challenging. I've only slept with one guy before, in college my only long-term boyfriend, and I've only ""fooled around"" with a handful more. I'm scared that doing this will complicate my sex life even further and create an even greater barrier to intimacy. I'm also afraid of someone finding out, or that he may have diseases (though he said he show me test results), or that he might use the money to coerce me into something I'm not comfortable with.

I'm nervous that the rather coercive nature of this type of relationship will trigger the feelings from my rape and trigger a similar deep depression. But then again, it might not, and I could REALLY use the money. I'm very happy these days and I have a great support network of friends, and though they have no money to lend and I would never tell them about this explicitly, I wouldn't feel alone like I did when I was raped. This could even be fun! He appeared to be a nice guy when we met in person, and he seems to respect me as more than an object (I don't find him attractive at all however, which makes me uncomfortable.) I'm a confident person and I've always wanted to own my sexuality - part of the reason sex is still tough for me is because I avoid it completely. Maybe this could be therapeutic?
I'm so conflicted. Literally 50/50 for or against. I'm meeting him this week, and if I decline then the offer will be permanently off the table. Anyone have any advice?"
17f3as,42,2013-01-28,Wish I could timetravel this letter from me now to me from three months ago. 32m.,duggo_throwaway,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/17f3as/wish_i_could_timetravel_this_letter_from_me_now/,"Dude.  Hugs.  You did your best.  Right now, while the rational part of your brain knew all along that it was probably gonna end, that's cold comfort to the emotional part of you, the part of you that worked so damn hard to make it work.

You're likely in a puddle on the bedroom floor right now, having cut class or the internship; it's all good, man, let it out.  Right now, there's nothing else you can compare these feelings to except for when Dad died.  It's all good, dude, you really, *really* loved her, like no other woman.  And that's okay.

Three-and-a-half months from now, it'll all be gravy, dude.  Yeah, she's still the first thing that I think of when I get up in the morning, but it's just merely annoying now, not this crushing burden that you're dealing with.

You, duggo, need to know that your opinion of her is about to drop.  Her behavior in the next few weeks, taken into consideration with the hoops she had no problem making you jump through during in the relationship, will leave her as someone you're just unimpressed by.  Yes, the me *now* totally remembers the good times, but they've *been* over.  Oh, and she's about to piss off our cousin ""Fay"".  Forgive her for it.  The relationship's over.

Another big thing you *need* to know:  she *left* you, and that means you now owe her nothing; stop worrying about her, because you have only yourself to worry about now.  You'll be taking good care of yourself in the coming weeks.  I'm proud of you, man; you make me proud of myself.

And good on ya for cutting out the alcohol during the most intense part of all this!  And for exercising a lot.  You'll soon come to recognize in hindsight why this was so important.

Spoiler alert duggo!  Your intern evals are gonna be solid, your grades will actually improve, you're gonna be in pretty badass shape soon, you're gonna get your garden up and going again, and ""Darren"" is gonna ask you to work the film festival red carpet and you're gonna interview celebrities!  You'll get to where I'm at soon enough, but like boot camp, it'll get better but it's about to get worse.  The insomnia and the heartache are the worst.

**EDIT:**  You're gonna ruin the song ""Breathe Me"" by Sia for both of us.

**EDIT:**  People!  Don't be hard on yourselves because you're not doing everything ""perfectly."" You're operating at a reduced capacity!

Yes, I've been taking care of myself and generally improving everything since the breakup, but know that I did go through a couple of two-week phases where I just didn't give a shit.

I did a five-mile standup paddle race a week into my vacation, and after that, I let myself goooooooo.

I wasn't trying to impress anyone, and enjoyed not having to. I was single (still am), and *enjoying* it.  To me, those empty beer cans, pizza boxes and ice cream containers in my room were decorations commemorating how few fucks I gave. *And it was nice.*

Batteries: recharged.  I'm back in school, and back on the healthy, fit, responsible wagon now.  And my room's clean.

I regret nothing."
17f0zo,16,2013-01-28,Amazing grace (getting something good off my chest),OneHasLepers,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/17f0zo/amazing_grace_getting_something_good_off_my_chest/,"Today in church we sang Amazing Grace.  This wasn't any surprise to me; as the intern pastor, I've been choosing all the music.

What totally surprised me is what our worship leader added to it.  Normally, we just go straight into the song.  Today, she started talking about her grandmother, and her grandmother's willingness to welcome everyone, and how her grandmother taught her this song.  She said that probably everyone in the room had a story to go along with this song, and encouraged us to think about it while we sang.

Part of me was a little disapproving of this kind of interlude -- we'd just had the sermon, which was really good, and I felt like this sudden veer into ""remember the good times you've had with this old hymn!"" was a distraction.  But, this is what happens at our church:  we offer what we've got, and sometimes it means something to someone else.  It's one of the many reasons I love being there.

The thing that knocked me completely for a loop was that I remembered something I'd forgotten for years:

*I sang Amazing Grace the night I tried to kill myself.*

It was ten and a half years ago.  I was 17.  I was gay, and almost too smart for school, and the girl I thought I loved was so very straight, and I felt so very alone.  And I was starting to realize that while my family and my congregation did not care that I was gay, the wider church and the whole world definitely did.  I had thought I was called to be a pastor.  How was I going to find a way to do that?

I OD'd on painkillers -- some brand of Tylenol.  I remember laying down on the bathroom floor, listening to my father drinking and watching TV in the room down the hall, and thinking about how much I did not want to die, and yet I didn't have the energy to get up.

To this day, I don't know what got me on my feet.  But I somehow got out the door, and talked to my dad, and he yelled for my mom, and they got me into the car.

It was really dark out, and Mom was driving, and my dad was near tears.  Mom was terrified; I don't know how she managed to drive.  They asked me to talk on the way, so that they'd know I was still awake.  We all knew if I fell asleep, I'd be dead.

I didn't know what to say, so my dad said, ""Sing.""  And Amazing Grace is what came out of my mouth.

*Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me*

It was ridiculously ironic, of course.  I wonder now if it put a bitter taste in my parents' throat, to hear those words out of the mouth of their only daughter who was trying to live after she'd tried to die.

*I once was lost, but now am found; was blind, but now I see*

I kept singing, all the way.  God, I can feel my stomach clenching as I write this.  I was so scared.  I so badly wanted to live.

*Through many dangers, toils, and snares, I have already come*

We got to the hospital.  I got neutralizer, and a stomach pump (*horrible* experience), and an IV, and potassium pills because I'd dehydrated myself.  I was put on 72-hour hold until a psychiatrist could see me.

*'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far, and grace will lead me home*

I did die that night, in a way.  The part of me that wanted to die.  The part of me that thought I would feel better if I didn't hurt any more; the part of me that thought the only way to change my life was to end it.

*The Lord has promised good to me; his word my hope secures*

But the rest of me lived.  My mind, and my heart, and the best parts of myself made it through.  I got serious about fighting my depression and anxiety.  I let go of the girl I thought I loved.  I focused on the things that made me happy:  classes I liked, a church where I felt welcome, music that made me feel at peace.

I went to college.  I made new friends, who loved me, who challenged me, who called me out of the darkness whenever I was less myself.  

I started studying religion.  I met the woman who would become my partner.

I graduated.  Got a good job.  Got an apartment with my girlfriend.  Got a cat.  Found a new church, where we were welcomed just as we were.  

Got scholarships to seminary.  Got all A's my first semester.  Got more friends, who loved me and my partner and welcomed us into their churches.  Got an internship where I am loved and supported.

I got my life.

*He will my shield and portion be as long as life endures*

It's not always easy.  I chose to follow a call into a profession where I have to daily argue for my right to exist.  But I get to be with people when they are open, and loving, and broken, and vulnerable, and *damn* it is a good life.

Ten and a half years ago, I had no idea just how much my life could get better.  I'm so glad I found out.

**To all my fellow Redditors:  I wish you peace.  I wish you love.  I wish you everything you need.  I wish you, in whatever form you need it, amazing grace.**"

17emiy,0,2013-01-27,Thinking of transferring out of Tech.,ColdCaulkCraig,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/17emiy/thinking_of_transferring_out_of_tech/,"The following paragraphs are a quote from a post I found in another thread. I'm posting this because it describes exactly how I feel:

I know this is an old thread, but I wanted to respond since I go to Tech. I'm a senior ISyE major (used to be CmpE) at Tech, and I have always regretted going here. In Georgia, you pretty much have 2 choices for tradtional colleges: UGA for liberal arts, and GT for engineering. There's also Emory and some other small colleges, but UGA and GT are the most popular. If you want to do engineering and you don't have money to go out of state, then you are stuck with Tech (or Southern Polytechnic, which is horrible). 

It's true that Tech has ""great"" academic programs. The reason why they are highly regarded is not because of the professors or facilities or anything like that. It's basically because Tech is so difficult that it teaches students how to solve problems on their own with little or no help. Tech students are pretty much thrown in the water and it's up to them not to drown; if you survive, then you will have skills to be a hard worker in a job. You will learn to be a good worker if you go here; I've worked for Disney as an intern and found it to be quite easy compared with school. 

What Tech lacks the most is a social life. If you like programming and talking about computers 24/7, you will like it here. If you would rather play videogames than anything else with your freetime, you will like it here. If you are socially inept and awkward, you will fit in well. There are 27% girls here last I checked, and out of those, a small percentage are ""normal,"" and a small percentage of that are attractive (physically and otherwise). It's not just girls either, the guys are also strange. It's hard for me to make friends here because I don't like many of the people, and I was even considered nerdy in high school. If academics are your main concern, Tech would be great for you. If you want to have some kind of life or enjoy college the way most people do, you will hate your existence while you are at Tech. 

This is a little off-topic, but I am actually taking a philosophy class here that shows how schools (among other sources) shape people to want money and to buy stuff, and how institutions like Tech are used to create people who are hard workers and are primarily concerned with consumption of products. Over the years I've thought about my life more and more, and really thought about why I chose this school and what I really want my life to be like. I picked CmpE in the beginning because I thought I liked computers and that major makes a lot of money. A lot of people pick schools because they want to be proud of their accomplishments, they want prestige, and mostly, they want to get that degree so they can make a lot of money and buy a lot of stuff. Recently I've realized that I don't find that moving to the suburbs, working 60+ hours a week, and buying a lot of products is the life I want, but that's what you are typically headed for with an engineering degree. 

Anyway, if you want to go here so you can get a good job that pays a lot of money so you can buy more TVs and an expensive car and whatever, then go for it. Personally, I wish I had looked for something I would actually be interested in rather than what is highly-rated or is known for making a lot of money. I also would have rather spent these years enjoying my life as well as earning a degree instead of spending it in constant depression at Tech."

[I may never again have a chance to interact with anyone from my favorite show. So I will tell you that I love The Daily Show so very much, and that joke has run itself into the ground and is digging. Please stop.  I'm making it worse, huh? *sigh*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84geqv?context=5)|Well, since you said ""please"". although tonight's (monday's) guest is bob costas so there's an off chance it'll come up again. we ask your forgiveness in advance.

""mr. stewart.""  (almost lost my job there.)  as for the time we have, please refer to the name of the show.
[How did you get the job? I've always wanted to get a job writing jokes but don't know where to start.  What's the writing process like in the Daily Show's offices? Is it a collaboration?  Is Jon involved in the process?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84feha?context=5)|Thanks for the questions - [here you go](http://www.waywire.com/v/efa3ebca95ef3ebc31e522eb184649b9)
[More and more young people get their knowledge of the news and current events from comedians like you and Jon Stewart. How do you think this impacts (and will impact longer-term\) culture around news and politics for future generations?  Is it a good thing to rely primarily on comedy for news about the world?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fkx2?context=5)|1 - my dearest toby, i think that if people rely on TDS for their actual news the future will be here soon and will be similar to that will smith movie where he has a dog and fights his way through manhattan. 2 - no. but it's probably not terrible either. as long as you are aware of a few more details about the world.
[What is Jon Stewart like behind the scenes? Any funny stories?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fxcs?context=5)|Nope. not one.
[Former Colbert intern here, from his 2008 PA primary coverage.

[*usually the one's we're not making fun of seem to have a better sense of humor.*  So, democrats then?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84g7fn?context=5)|Yes. because we ONLY make fun of republicans. you've got us pegged. please don't tell the non-mainstream-and-yet-ratings-leading-media.

[Who is funnier in real life. Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84g1wy?context=5)|Hard to say since they are both trappist monks who never speak off camera.

[How many picks for the moment of zen do you get on an average day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84g5ok?context=5)|As you might imagine we have an almost endless supply of ""moments of zen"" to choose from so we usually go with whatever we find most jarring though it is also sometimes influenced by whether or not it goes along with the content of that day's show.
[Can you describe the writing process for the show? Does John lead the charge or is it more fluid? When do you start planning the next show? What kind of deadlines do you deal with?

[How often, if at all, do you write a script/skit/line and then test out with others to see if it is funny? Also, what was the most recent joke you wrote that went over everyone's head?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84g5sj?context=5)|We are all constantly working off each other at the show and we all enjoy doing that and respect each others opinions. there are few if any jokes that anyone on staff can tell that ""go over everyone else's head"" but we all tell plenty of jokes that are immediately recognized as ""not suitable for air"". that's just part of the creative process.
[Any advice for young, aspiring comedy writers? Do standup? Improv? Write and shop specs? ??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84gbb0?context=5)|All of those are good things to do. and honestly, this is exacly what my podcast is about. listen to it and feel free to let me know if you agree. writersblocpodcast.com.
[For the interviews, how much of the book/ movie in question has Jon read? Is there someone whose job it is to read the book and give Jon some interesting questions to ask? And do they have a rehearsal interview before, or is it done cold?  Do writers get to meet the guests? If so, who has been your favorite to meet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84g0yv?context=5)|Jon is very prepared for ALL the interviews. we help a little, but i honestly don't know how he does it. interviews aren't rehearsed. we're discouraged from asking to meet the guests because it would just get out of hand, but i asked to meet joe montana (many years ago) and jerry rice (when he did dancing with the stars) because i grew up in the bay area in the 80's and was a HUGE fan.  GO NINERS!!!
[What are your feelings on the Emmy writing category being televised only every second year now?

What's the process for that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84g0bv?context=5)|Great question -- [here's my response](http://www.waywire.com/v/2c21db110d375b2b585f3bf394e6c4e6)

[Whats the best stuff that never aired or an idea of yours that got scrapped that you would like to share? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fpjt?context=5)|We only really cover 1 or 2 stories a day so ideas get cut ALL the time simply because there's no time for them. it's just a matter of making choices. most recently, i really wanted to cover the recent developments in redistricting and the awarding of electoral votes but other stories trumped it. but that doesn't mean we won't address this issue later. and by that time i will, of course, have become a noted expert on the subject.
[Do you watch fox news all day looking for material? I am honestly amazed at how witty and thoughtful some of the smallest jokes on the daily show can be...Something that will take me a month to come up with you guys do daily..its truly amazing. Are you guys up all night researching and writing these jokes? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84g1pe?context=5)|We do watch foxnews a lot but we also watch msnbc and cnn and we read from many different sources. fortunately our hours are not as bad as you think. in fact, the writers ""work"" from basically 9 to 6.  but we ""think"" almost all the time. unless we're sleeping. then we don't think.  i think hard to say.
[Did you ever worry that Romney would be President? Would the writers be depressed if that had transpired?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84h0dd?context=5)|Speaking only for myself i'm not sure my main concern would have been for our show. but if he had won the election we would have continued on the same way we always do - seeking out absurdities that we have a legitimate reason to address. now, president cain... that would have been hilarious!
[What is the best little-known fact about Jon that you can tell us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84gj4v?context=5)|He wears almost the exact same ""outfit"" to work everyday - khakis, a gray t-shirt over a white long sleeve waffle shirt, and extremely well-worn doc martin boots.
[How much media--books, news, stuff on the Internet--do you have to *consume* on a daily or weekly basis in order to stay relevant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84ga0h?context=5)|It's not like there's a set amount. in other words my answer isn't ""296 pages"". we all just consume what we're capable of consuming in a given amount of time... which is just one of the things working at the daily show has in common with competing in a hot dog eating contest.
[What was it like working with Craig Kilborn? I hear he wasn't easy to work with.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84g8gl?context=5)|That depends on who you are i guess. i don't know ANYBODY who gets along with EVERYBODY. i liked craig. he was cool to me and he totally helped us get the show off the ground. he was also very easy to write for since he wasn't a big script doctor. (understatement) we used to get a lot of stuff on verbatim back then but if you go back and look at some of it it honestly could probably have done with a bit of massaging.
[HOW did you get into comedy writing? What made the daily show choose you? What would you tell someone who wants to do EXACTLY what you do?

[A few years ago Fox tried to compete with you with The 1/2 Hour News Hour.. It was cancelled after 17 episodes. Why do you think that, even after decades of trying, ""conservative humor"" is still an oxymoron? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84gipy?context=5)|TheLuminousEgg (below) is probably right.

Thanks for the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84gde9?context=5)|No.  but i also don't know how many people actually believe that.  and i would assume that anybody who does believe that also probably wonders where the sun goes every night.
[This is really great - thanks so much for doing this. I'm trying to gain a foothold as a comedic writer/storyteller as well, and this is fascinating. I saw you do a set at Kabin shortly before Christmas, too, and I was really impressed by how well you handled a heckler who turned out to be a mentally ill, possibly homeless person. You did it with grace and compassion, but without taking any shit.  I've always wondered: when a writer ""submits"" to a TV show, whether it's the Daily Show or Colbert or Totally Biased - what do they submit, exactly? What exactly goes into a ""packet?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c8540ac?context=5)|Wow! that kabin gig was totally unexpected. i wasn't ""on the show"", i just walked in and they put me on, which was nice but it caught me by surprise a bit. then the weird guy caught me by surprise. then the friend i hadn't seen for years but suddenly was seeing everywhere ALSO caught me by surprise. quite a night. thanks for the kind words. for answers to your questions i can honestly recommend listening to my podcast - i address this in almost every episode.

[How do The Daily Show and The Colbert Report make sure they don't do the same jokes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84lxuh?context=5)|We don't really check in that much anymore ""day of"" and it usually works out particularly since we have such a different take on the stories. we also watch each other's shows so that we don't cross over too much on any stories that we might do a day or two later. oh, and there's also an elaborate warning system similar to the emergency broadcasting system that sets off an alarm in our offices whenever we have similar thoughts.
[How did you get started as a writer? Was it all from standup?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fqw7?context=5)|This is a long answer but if you're really interested my full story is on this podcast (not my own podcast) that i did with a friend - [Link to bit.ly](http://bit.ly/Vjca5s)

[Well honestly people are people, and this guy makes jokes. You can't just change him without ruining his thought process to fit the mold you give him, which would really bring down the actual depth and quality of his answers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84i8oy?context=5)|Right on brother!

[I'm sure this is at least part of the answer, and it's pretty much what I always assumed.

A little bit about my history and myself. I live in eastern Canada, 29yrs old, female, I live with my mother (totally different story there all together) Within the past two years I have gone from clearing all my debts too barely even being able to afford milk. 

Here's what been happening:

I graduated from a graphic design course in Feb of last year. That resulted in a 15,000$ student loan. I decided that I would start a freelance business over the summer through a $3000 SEED grant. (I have 15 years experience in Graphic &amp; Web design, which is why I decided on a summer business) From there I would go to school in the fall to take, ""Web &amp; Development &amp; Programming"" (I'm super nerdy with web stuff.. nerdy in general).

Unfortunately, in late June is when things started to go bad. Nothing was coming in, I was doing all that I could to drum up business, I had to find work within my field (I didn't take a 15,000$ loan to end back up in a call center) to help pay bills. 

I received an offer from a local business who would train me from the ground up (cracker-jack entry level). I said that I wanted to go back in school in the fall to do my course because I am very interested in learning back-end development. They said, ""No, we want to train you. We don't want you going back to school, don't work on your business, we'll hire you full time; health benefits everything. Just work with us, you're awesome."" So, I weighed my options and said yes and was super excited to work for this business. Cancelled my schooling for the fall and went to work for them. 

Things were going ok, not great, but better I had a little hope for once. Then in October tension around office started happening, they would run to mail box for cheques to come in, internet was getting cut off, and turned into jerks. Then they me called in the office and let me go. No warning. nothing. Crushed. 

Immediately, I call the school I was planning to go, call student loan, call EI. Covering everything I needed to get myself on track I was planning on doing.

The ex-employers then decided to go on a wild goose chase with my ROE, and lie on it (false amounts). That resulted in my EI claim amount having a deduction. (I'm still waiting for an amended EI through an Investigation Control Officer, since October)

Two weeks later my cat had HUGE health complications and ended up passing away. That resulted in a $400 vet bill. 

Week after that my cell phone was cut off, resulted in a HUGE bill (contract).
Week after that my school says I need to pay my balance off owed to them: $1500
Week after that the bank, I got my grant from, wants their money $3000.
BAM! Xmas happens.  can't afford anything, so nothing there.

Now, its the new year. I received a job offer with a new company, a really awesome place, love it there, but I had to agree to a brief non-paying internship. It was the only opportunity I had, I had to take it and in the meantime continue looking for paying-jobs in my field until this internship is over. While on EI.

So, currently. I have $25 in my bank account. 
My bills are currently: 
Cell phone: 1200$
Credit Card: 750$
School tuition balance: 1500$
Bank Grant: 3000$
Vet Bill: 400$

As I said earlier, I live with my mother, her health is deteriorating, disabled and is only on a pension. So all her money goes towards her bills (90% of her pension is bills, its sickening) We live literally ""pay check"" to ""pay check"" and I'm sick of it! I help where ever I can with my mother bills, forfeiting my own bills because I hate seeing my mother depressed. We're late on power, water, cable, credit card, loans (those are hers).

I've been trying to start my business again, start a business for her (not going much of anywhere), selling stuff I don't really need to bring in money.

I don't know whom to talk to, or where to begin digging myself out of this financial hole I've found myself in again. How the hell can I get myself out of this and start saving money, ANY advice would be great; from saving money too how should I disperse my money to pay my bills, what to tell collection agencies to make them understand my current situation.

I'm totally at a loss where to begin, all I know is that I want to be in the green for my bills, my mothers bills and be able to not worry about where money for gas is going to come from.

**EDIT://**  some people may find this post, like I'm spilling my guts rather than getting right to the point. I had to explain a lot in order to receive advice that is applicable in my situation."
17imv1,5,2013-01-29,At a Crossroad and need to know the next step,jacker2011,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/17imv1/at_a_crossroad_and_need_to_know_the_next_step/,"I need to get something off my chest and hopefully i get some advices from the community here.

so first of all, I am a MechE student that is about to graduate in 10 weeks or so. And I am on the fence between graduate school and jobs. 

 I started off college as an above average high school kid. my arrogance got the best of me by the end of freshman year and I got my butt kicked in my sophomore year. I was really lucky and grateful that i still had an internship by the end of my sophomore year. 
 As I move on in my undergraduate studies(core classes), I got more exposure(through coursework) to ME and I find myself to foster an interest in controls and thermodynamics. I am even currently auditing a graduate level course in Robotics.

so my current situations is that I have a ~3.0 major gpa and a 2.94 Overall gpa, passed the EIT,  and I've had two internship with the same company. (a fortune 100 company). But I didn't like the work because it was all CAD modeling with little analysis. I did, however, enjoy the hands-on prototype building and some of the light research work that I did. So they mentioned that they would like to have me back.
 I've been mass applying for jobs and luckily I've been selected to interview with companies like Chevron, Microsoft, PGE, General Mills, Lam's Research and etc but I just clutched on my interviews or my background is weak so I didn't get any offers.



 From my mistakes and failures I realized that I am not ""the shit"" as I thought I was and I also realized that through helping other understand or helping them with hw or even doing a lot of practices, I can learn better. People begin to perceived that I was smart because I was able to understand some of the material and help others with their understanding as well. by the end of my 4th year, I was very honored and glad that I met with a group of hardworking people through my classes and projects.
  With that said, I still do mediocre on exams(except thermo, controls, circuits, fluids, and FEA), while my project grades and hw grades were my lifesavers. i realized i suck at taking tests.
  Currently, I work at the computer lab as IT support on campus. But this is a dead-end job but I keep it because I need the money for rent and food.

 I am interest in doing some control related research or simulation research with 2 of the professors in my department. But I wonder if they would pay me as an undergraduate researcher. My plan is to probably join a design team for spring and summer while doing research with a professor if they are willing to 1.)hire me, 2.) pay me. 

 lastly, I also wonder if grad school is the right place for me or is it an escape if I don't have a job. I am certain that I don't want to go back to my internship place. i love the people and the culture but the line of work isn't for me. I really like alternative energy and defense industry.

Sorry for the long post. i don't know whether people will read this or not. but it did help me get some pressure off my chest.

17if1f,15,2013-01-29,Stories about my senior year in high school...,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/17if1f/stories_about_my_senior_year_in_high_school/,"I apologize for the massive wall of text being dropped here.  I hope you enjoy a story from my senior year of high school in a small town of 4000 people.  Graduating class size was 175 people. 

Growing up in Grand Rapids, MI area; it was the summer of 2006 and the trees were being smoked daily.  The group of friends I had in high school were the ""stoner jock"" type.  We all played sports throughout the years in school, but we all smoked trees often.  Before school, at lunch, after, on the weekends, etc.. Typical high school stoner kid.  

The beginning of my senior year started and I had begun an internship at a local car dealership as a mechanic.  Things were going great for the first few weeks.  Went to the internship everyday I was supposed to and things were going well.  Meanwhile, I decided one day that I was going to just skip it and go over to my buddies house to smoke a joint.  Nothing happened.  I got away with it.  I was the type of kid who would get away with something one time and then continue to do it until I get caught.  Not so much anymore, but definitely was that way in high school. 

So one day I get called down to the principal's office and I have no clue why.  He sits me down and asks me how the internship is going, how the other mechanics are, etc... Little did I know that he was letting me dig a deeper hole.  He then proceeds to tell me about every single day that I wasn't there and that they have known for about 2 weeks, thinking I would eventually show back up. He tells me that I'm kicked out of the internship program and that I'm going to have to clean the lunch room for the remainder of the semester. (almost 3 months left in the semester)

I was livid that I had to clean the lunch room after all the fucking messy kids eat their lunch.  I thought it was going to be living hell for 3 months.  I had to be with the janitor cleaning from 12:30pm until the end of the day, 3:30pm.  ""How the hell was I going to make it through this nightmare?!"", I thought to myself for the first couple of days.  Little did I know, the janitor I had to work with everyday had something perculiar about her.  I knew there was something there that we had in common... Come to find out, she fancied herself some fine herb as well.  

Fast forward two weeks to a Friday afternoon.  We were cleaning the lunch room and all the kids were gone to their classes for the afternoon.  I thought that it was a perfect time to bring up smoking bud.  I was right! We started talking about weed and whatnot, next thing I know I'm in her Ford Expedition leaving the parking lot and she's sparking up a joint.  ""This is the best punishment ever!!!"", I thought to myself.  I get kicked out of my internship for smoking weed and not going showing up and my punishment is to vacuum for a bit then roll around with the janitor and get stoned.  Score!! I'm down with that...

A few weeks later the janitor starts bringing me in brownies, cookies, etc.. All sorts of edibles that her husband and her were making.  It was literally like I had died and went to heaven.  The first time I had ever eaten a edible was on a Monday afternoon in my high schools janitor office.  

I didn't tell my friends until after we graduated 6 months later.  I didn't want any of them to get either of us in trouble by blabbing their mouth to the wrong person.  So it was my little secret the rest of my senior year.  I would see the janitor occasionally throughout the halls and she would smile at me and I could tell where she was going.  

Needless to say. I had a phenomenal start to my senior year in HIGH school.  If only I could go back there now... Wouldn't change a thing! :)

I hope you all enjoyed the story of smoking ganja with the school janitor. Toke on fellow Ents!

TL;DR - got in trouble for skipping internship to smoke weed with friends in high school.  Punishment was smoking weed with the school janitor.  "
17i9hb,1,2013-01-29,"[Progress] For being a Mod here so long, it's shameful I haven't done one of these before",[deleted],gainit,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/17i9hb/progress_for_being_a_mod_here_so_long_its/,"[used to be a skinny kid. I'm talking real skinny. 6'6"" 160 lbs skinny.](http://i.imgur.com/YhqUOR1.png)

I fit every stereo type out there. I flew away in the wind. I turned to the side and disappeared. I had twigs for arms and legs. The list goes on.

The problem though, was I could not dedicate myself to getting bigger. Whenever I would visit the gym I would get discouraged (intimidated) by all the bigger people. Once I was able to get over that fear, my next issue was dedication. It's hard being weak and trying to work out, real fucking hard. Going in and trying and failing to press 75 lbs on the bench press will beat your psyche down real quick. Before I gave my self a chance to see progress, I'd quit. But being in high school, there were a lot of other skinny people too, so it wasn't much of an issue.

Then came college. After getting settled in my first semester and making friends, we teamed up and made a pact to hit the gym all spring. It worked great. We were lifting, getting stronger, looking good, I even managed to get up to 173 lbs. Awesome. Then summer hit.

Stopped lifting. No set schedule due to going home over the summer and not having a gym available. However, school started back up, but my lifting didn't. I was too far away from the University gym and I had no motivation to go. I was still comfortable with being skinny. I had a girlfriend now, I had my set friends, I was complacent and I would continue to be for the next two years.

Two summers I stayed at school for my internship and so did this new friend I made. He was an avid gym goer who convinced me to go. What the heck, I had nothing to do once I got off work everyday. So we started going regularly, and for the first time in my exercise career I was consuming whey protein shakes. These helped me tremendously when it came to gaining weight. By the end of the summer I had hit 185 lbs (on a good day). That'a solid 10 lbs in one summer. ""This is easy!"" I thought, so I was set on continuing to lift once school started.

SYKE!

Same shit happened again. I was still working and classes were a lot harder and time consuming than they used to be, so at 185 lbs I stayed...for another two years.

[about 185](http://i.imgur.com/Ee909AA.png)

Half way through my 5th year at university (yeah I know 5 yrs) my buddy who helped me reach 185 lbs approached me and introduced me to a new friend of his and his new lifting buddy. Upon meeting the new guy, I was invited (pressured) to come and lift with them, and I agreed. Even though they were outlifting me, I didn't want to seem like a bitch, so I kept up the best I could. Credit it to them for giving me a chance to take a break because I haven't lifted in awhile, but I did not heed that advice.

I couldn't move for the next week. I was so sore, my muscles were so tight, I was not ready to go back to the gym. But there they were, blowing my phone up, trying to set up lifting times, and there I was being flaky, not committing to anything. Then came the tough love.

The next time we were together they laid into me. Telling me I was unhealthy skinny with my rib cage visible, my chicken legs, and my thin wrists. That I didn't intimidate anyone, that's why I got pushed around at the bar and on the basketball court. That I could be huge, all I had to do was commit myself. I took all this to heart. I knew what they said was true. I was weak and frail. I was unhelpful when it came to moving heavy things (as was necessary every year when I moved apts) and I was having medical problems from my lack of muscle. My doctor looked me straight in the face and told me my lower back issue was because my core was to weak to support my upper half.

That's when I decided to get serious. Fuck being weak, fuck being skinny, fuck looking like a walking skeleton. I'm going to get big. I'm going to gain weight. I'm going to get strong. I'm going to look good.

Now where do I start?

First thing I needed to do was see what problems were inhibiting me.


1) I didn't eat enough.

* Yeah, I though I could eat a lot, and so did everyone else my whole life. It's easy to eat a ton of food for dinner when you don't eat breakfast and occasionally skip lunch.

2) I didn't eat healthy enough.

* Sure, eating a whole pizza in one sitting is a lot of calories, but they're shit calories. Your body would much rather have 2 lbs of chicken (and use it more efficiently, too).

3) When I did lift, I didn't follow a plan.

* Lifting willy nilly and doing whatever exercise you feel like doing at the time is not very effective.

4) My form was shit.

* Quarter squats, half bench presses, and swinging curls aren't going to get you very far.

Now that I got that out of the way. Let's get serious.


For the next year, I was serious. I ate 4000 kcal a day of good, lean food. Chicken, fish, veggies, potatoes  rice, eggs, protein shakes. 5 meals a day I was constantly shoving my face. Even supplementing my food intake with a half a gallon of (whole) milk a day for a couple months during that period. I lifted 4 to 5 times a week, sometimes 6. I was benching, and squatting  and deadlifting, and pressing. With good form, too. I spent so much time looking up lifting form on the internet, I feel like I can give beneficial information to anyone in the gym.


And you know what, it fucking worked. From January 2011 to January 2012 I went from 185 to 215 lbs. By March I was 230 lbs (unfortunately I was eating out too much at my new job and got pudgy from consuming almost 5000 kcal/day).

[Comparison](http://i.imgur.com/DWC9pdf.jpg)

So I was able to gain 30 lbs in year just by getting serious. I wanted that weight so I earned it. Currently, I'm sitting at 215 again (a stronger 215 than January) after cutting/slimming down from 230 lbs.


You may be wondering about my lifts. I'm going to use my lift numbers from when I started my serious lifting (January '11) to present. You can just assume the numbers before that were negligible. These are all one rep maxes.


Bench: 155 -&gt; 255 lbs
Squat: 135 -&gt; 315 lbs
Deadlift: 185 -&gt; 415 lbs
Overhead press: 65 -&gt; 185 lbs

1) I'm in my first semester of my sophomore year with a 3.7 major GPA (will be around a 3.88 or so after this semester) and a 2.92 cumulative GPA (soon to be a 3.1-3.2, but regardless I've never had lower than a C in any class and lower than an A- in a programming class) at a good university. I have taken 2 algorithms classes that are done in C++ and I'm currently taking a UI class (in Java), a Computer Organization class (which doesn't involve much programming, but it does use some C and assembly) and another Data Structures and Algorithms class (again in C++). I started off with Java about 5 years ago and continue to use it for side projects (I have 3 Android apps on the market and create games and videos with/over LibGDX). I would love to get an internship this summer but most places require that you have your sophomore year finished and have a 3.0 (which I will have by the end of this semester), when I'll only be halfway through. Would I have any chances at landing an internship based on my history of past projects and taking a few CS classes early and high major GPA (even though my cumulative is less than stellar? Also, being in Ohio, what could an intern be expected to have thrown their way in terms of compensation?

2) I currently work as a TA for my university's intro programming lab. Someone in the lab asked me to tutor them on the side and offered to pay. A) How do I charge? By the hour? By the session? B) How much do I charge? I know if I was a tutor through my school I'd be getting paid at least $9/hr (pay is dependent on the total and level of classes you can tutor for).

3) Now that I've been doing C++ for a short while (and Java for 5 years), I still don't feel very confident. I can do all of the basic tests that people have posted regarding job interviews (FizzBuzz, check if a string starts with an uppercase, check if a string is a palindrome, etc.) but I feel that's over-simplistic and once I passed that I'd be overwhelmed once I started working. What do companies really expect an intern to know and how much are they willing to teach you if you don't know it?

If you read through all of that, thank you! You're awesome."
17hsek,280,2013-01-29,Knock knock,regularcappuccino,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/17hsek/knock_knock/,"I'm renting a studio apartment in the big city while I have an internship. It's in an old building with one other apartment, and we both share a hallway with a locked door to the outside world at the end of it.

When I first got here, I arrived pretty late, so the landlord left a key for me in the letterbox and texted me the combination. The next day, when I came home from work, the key wouldn't work in the lock any more.

I was pretty puzzled, since it had worked perfectly before, so I called a locksmith to see if he could let me in. He told me the lock had failed, and it would have to be replaced completely, including with a new key. It cost me $300 all up, but I was tired and hungry and glad to be back inside, and I thought I could show the receipt to the landlord and be reimbursed.

Being the absent-minded person I am, every time I got home late from work I would see the receipt on the table and think ""That's right, I need to tell the landlord, and give them the new key."" But I never got around to it.

Then, a few weeks ago, I was lying in bed watching TV on a low volume before I fell asleep. I was just starting to doze off when I heard a sound that jerked me awake.

The sound of a key being inserted into my door.

I immediately jerked up in bed and gathered the covers around me, going through the list of people in my head who it might be. Not my parents, they're 5 hours away. Not a friend, none of them know this address. And besides, how would they get into the secure hallway?

Aside from me, the only person with a key was the landlord. And why the fuck would he let himself in unannounced at midnight? While I was sleeping? In the nude?

I sat there frozen, staring at the door in horror and waiting for it to open.

Except it didn't. I changed the locks.

As I sat there paralysed with fear, that fact slowly sank in. I changed the fucking lock when I moved in. They couldn't get in, because the lock screwed up and I was too flaky to tell anyone about it.

I slipped out of bed and pulled on my work clothes, then kind of just stood there in the middle of the room, with my phone in my hand, waiting for them to leave. I was way too scared to breathe too loud or even turn off the TV, in case they realised someone was inside. My door doesn't have a peep hole, but even if it did, I probably would've been too much of a coward to cross my room and stand that close to it. I felt like I was having a mini heart-attack.

The lock was audibly being manipulated at this point. Whoever was on the other side was loudly jiggling the key and shaking the knob, and I heard the door creak as though someone was leaning on it.

I was still ready to crap my pants, but my mind bizarrely wandered to how I would tell my parents about this. I clearly imagined my mum saying 'Well, did you tell them to go away?' and making up an excuse that it was just someone lost, or they got the wrong apartment. It sounds ridiculous, but I needed to prove that I wasn't an irrational person. I needed to prove that this wasn't just some silly mistake I was blowing out of proportion.

So I cleared my throat and let out a feeble: ""Hello?""

The shaking stopped immediately. This was almost worse than the noise from before. Every muscle in my body tensed listening for a sound, and I quickly decided to turn off my TV, since they already knew I was here. Then it was just me, the silence, and my mind working in overtime to try to explain who the hell this person was.

Until they knocked on the door. 
I stood dead still in the middle of the room, but my stomach gave an involuntary jolt at the sound.

He knocked again. 
A muffled voice came through the door, and it creaked again, like someone was leaning on it. 

""Hey, let me in.""

This might be the part of the horror movie where the dumb girl opens the door, just to satisfy her curiosity. But every cell in my body simultaneously screamed ""Oh, hell naw"". I decided I would continue with my currently plan: to stand tense and frozen in the middle of the room. Except I backed towards the kitchenette and grabbed the biggest knife I could find.

In the absence of my response, knock became a loud bang. First it sounded like someone was insistently pounding their closed fists on the door, but soon the whole door frame and wall shook from the impact. I realised the person was throwing their body weight against it.

At this point, I called the police.

I can't even remember what I said to them, I was so filled with white-hot panic. I was later told I screamed 'HURRY, SEND EVERYONE', which is a bit embarrassing. I had trouble remembering my address, but luckily it was still on the locksmith receipt still sitting on the table. (I owe that fucking guy a beer).

When I was talking to the operator, she said she could hear the guy trying to get in, and I should lock myself in the bathroom if I could. I guess he overheard me on the phone, because the banging abruptly stopped. Suddenly I was in the Jaws situation again, where the shark is gone but you know it's just under the water. I held onto the knife so tightly that my nails made a mark in the palm of my hand where they wrapped around it, and I kept asking the operator: ""What if he comes back?""

Luckily I didn't have to worry about that. The next people to knock on my door were the cops. They were able to get into the hallway because someone left the shared access door wide open. Of course the perpetrator was long gone.

I still don't know who knocked on my door that night, and I'm not sure I want to know. My New Year's Resolution was to stop putting things off, but now I know that good things come to those who wait (to talk about their new key).


tl;dr: Changed my locks, didn't end up knockin' on heaven's door."

This person was buried in full clown costume with makeup and all. The whole family was clowns, all the friends were clowns. And at the familys request, the funeral directors were clowns too. They supplied costume and did our makeup. Family and friends had 1 tear drop painted on near the eye. Definitely my strangest.

It was the most interesting funeral service to date. At first we didn't want to do the whole makeup and costume thing but the family insisted. I'm glad we did, we had a lot of fun; which is something you don't want to do during a service but this one was completely different and had a totally different vibe than a regular funeral service.

One time I had prepped this man. I came into the prep room to do some laundry and things. As I walked passed him, I noticed a small piece of lint in his ear from the towel I used to dry him off. I took my gloved pinky and kinda swiped it out. I proceeded to fold some towels. The next thing I know I felt something touch my ear, near the ear opening. It felt just like someone stuck their finger in my ear but there was noone around. The next day I was looking through the obituaries (i read the obituaries of the cases i work on) and sure enough this man had one. It mentioned how much of a prankster and fun he was. I guess I was his last prank.

When I came out, I heard what sounded like a girl sobbing and the sound of feet shuffling around on the floor. The floor was kinda gravely and had a distinct sound if you scooted your feet on it. The sound was coming from around a corner that led into a small room where we would store embalmed bodies ready to be delivered to their respective funeral home. I figured someone was upset and crying. So I kinda snuck in, still hearing the sobbing. When I peaked around the corner, the room was empty. No living person in there. I noticed that there was only one body in there as well. A young girl. She shot herself in the side of the head. I wasn't scared per say, but I'm pretty sure you could audibly hear my heart beat.
[Have you ever been physically attracted to one of the bodies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c858foo?context=5)|I've never been attracted to a dead body.
[Have you ever killed anyone in order to increase your own business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c858foo?context=5)|Never killed anyone but some funeral homes joke when it's slow. ""better take my pillow to the nursing home""
[Have you ever had to handle a body that was so disfigured/decomposed/etc that it made you sick? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c858foo?context=5)|The odors associated with decomposition will irritate your system. if you are around it long enough you can feel sick to your stomach and vomit. I have felt sick around it, but never vomited. I have a pretty strong stomach.
[Have you ever seen the show Six Feet Under? If so, how realistic do you think their portrayal of funeral homes is?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85aa42?context=5)|I have seen every episode. I think they did a good job making it look real.
[Would you say you're a fan?

The stories were good and their portrayal of the business is fairly accurate.
[Related to this show, what did you think of the ""green burial?"" I realize that it probably takes a cut in your business, but after seeing that, I kept thinking about how unnatural it is to fill a dead body with chemicals, put them in a casket, then bury them in a sealed cement box. Do you think that there is a trend toward the green burials?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85gxwi?context=5)|I see a definite rise in the demand for green burials. There are alternative funeral homes that specialize in them, usually small firms with low overhead so they still make money.

The lady was dead a while. On the couch all bloated as hell. When we started moving her, the abdomen busted. I had goo and maggots all over my leg.
[Are there usually maggots if the person has been dead for just a day or 2? Under what circumstances does that occur?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c86wdfe?context=5)|Once the body starts decomposing, flies can sense that. And where there are flies, the maggots will come.
[Omg did you throw up?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85bwgp?context=5)|No, but I threw my suit away.

So happy you are doing this AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85d454?context=5)|Use a real high index and watch those little fuckers put some pep in their step. they don't like the chems at all.
[Have you ever had to deal with children? What was it like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85eogt?context=5)|Yes, I have embalmed many children from babies to toddlers and up. It never really bothered me. Probably because I didn't have kids at the time. I've seen people get in this business with kids and absolutely cannot embalm or even attempt a child. I now have a 3 year old, but it hasn't changed my ability to effectively prep a child.
[IF your child, by any given circumstance would die, would you prefer to prepare the body or someone else to do it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85h2h0?context=5)|I would not allow anyone else to touch her.
[How is saved by the bell related to the funeral service? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c858wlh?context=5)|Back in the early days it was a huge fear to be buried alive. This has to do with the fact that medical science was shit at the time. Some people were just comotose, they couldn't tell if you were dead or not. That's why there was a 'wake' service where they would lay you out in state to see if you would 'wake' up. So these caskets were developed with a hole through the top, a string was placed in the deceased's hands and ran up out of the hole, through a tube to the top of the ground. The string was attached to a bell. So if you weren't actually dead, you could ring the bell. You would in fact be, 'saved by the bell'.

[I just did my first head autopsy today! But in the future, what are some things us ME people can do to better prepare the bodies for the mortuary?  Ninja edit: morgue -&gt; mortuary.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85bvza?context=5)|Wow! You mean one of you actually care about the mortician? The most frustrating thing for an embalmer with a posted case is that when you guys remove the throat, tongue sometimes the carotids are cut or nicked so high up it becomes a very difficult challenge to get the head injected. And the head is the most important part. Whenever this happens we say, ""must've been training day"". I would say try your best to preserve the arteries, especially the carotids. Veins don't matter in a posted case.
[When you say farewell to somebody in public and shake their hand do you say ""I'll be seeing you""?  If so, what is their reaction?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85er8s?context=5)|I've said it to elderly family members. ""see ya soon!"" I usually get a chuckle. Another fun thing is to carry a tailoring tape measure. If someone ever tries some stupid stunt or something, bust it out and start taking their measurements. Gets a laugh every time.
[Did you ever bring in a hot plate and cut off a slice because you had *the hunger*?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c859v62?context=5)|No, but one time I was working on an autopsy.

[Were you, at any point, disgusted with/by your job? If so, how did you get over it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c858fe8?context=5)|When you are new in this business, there will be a time when you step back and say, ""what the fuck am I doing"". Mine was at mortuary school during embalming lab. The county would have their cases embalmed at the school for practice. The deceased was an autopsy and had no legs. I was just looking at her, autopsy incisions open, the empty cavity inside. Her hands looked as if to be gripping the edge of the table. Her mouth wide open because we haden't closed it yet. She looked like she was screaming silently in pain. That was my wtf moment, you get over it.
[I work in eye tissue donation. I've had people refuse because ""They need them to see their loved ones when they get to heaven."" What exactly happens to the eyes during an embalming? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85b9nq?context=5)|The eyes usually start to flatten after death. Think of an old grape. They do, however, remain with the decedent. We don't remove them. You can use what is called an eye cap to put over the flattened eyeball to recreate the natural curvature of the eye. You can also inject tissue builder directly into the eyeball and fill it up. And sometimes, the embalming fluid will fill the eye to normal size.
[Is the same true for when business is good? Pretty dead in the shop?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c858ge6?context=5)|It will always be a dead end job.
[Did you go into the business by choice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c858b9x?context=5)|Yes I did. I was fascinated by the industry as a kid. When I was 12, there was a bad head on collision near my house. A man in a truck didn't make it. My family and I were standing around with all the other neighbors when the coroner arrived. He pronounced, then they took him out and put him on a stretcher, his head turned to the side looking straight at me. I remember being curious as to what happens to people when they die, as far as the physical body.
[Are women creeped out by your career choice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85d4a3?context=5)|Some are. I like to date other morticians or nurses. They seem to understand and are over the whole novelty of it all.

Can I have a weekend at morts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c861bzq?context=5)|I've never heard of one but that's a good idea for a dating website. Another good dating website would be for people who work the night shift. I've worked the nightshift before and it's hell on your dating life.
[Other than the Clown Funeral, any other ""funny"" funerals that stand out in your memory? By funny I mean something memorable or humorous happened, or the attendees did something that you recall as being unusual in the context of normal funeral behavior.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85b9fc?context=5)|One time we had a person who did some acting and modeling in California. A hand model. The family came in early for the visitation to set up pictures and things. I show them in, help them get started then leave them so they can do their thing. I come back in about 10 min to check on them and just about every picture they put up was this persons hands from the various ads they did. There were some family photos, but most were a pair of hands. It was funny to me because most people will put up whole pictures.
[When you cremate someone, how often do the ashes from previous customers make it into the current customer's mix?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85cod3?context=5)|There is some co-mingling involved, although very minimal. It is unavoidable, you can't get every single grain out. As long as you sweep it properly after each person, it is very minimal.
[The funeral home that took care of my husband let me come back with him and see how clean it was and called me back when it was finished.   I felt certain this was a strange request, but my husband asked me to make sure I brought him home and not some bag of dust.  I am still amazed by the compassion and sensitivity we were given.  Is this taught?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85gv4t?context=5)|Not really. Good, caring people usually gravitate to this career and excel at it. I'm glad you had a positive experience.
[That's really interesting. It'd be easy to assume that, seeing as you're dealing with dead people, only empathetic, cold people would be drawn to the career.  Have you ever had problems with people thinking that?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85la1v?context=5)|Not really, but they do exist in this business.

[Would you be embalmed yourself? Or would you want to be cremated?  Do you do cremations? Which is more common, cremations or embalming? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c859jmg?context=5)|I'm ok with being embalmed and buried. I'm also ok with being cremated. I will let my family choose the method which best suits them at the time. We do cremations also, yes. The cremation rate is on the rise, big time. Our firm is 60% cremation.

I embalmed a man that was found dead, leaning over a balcony in the front of his house. It was October and with all his decorations, neighbors thought he also was a decoration. He was there for days.
[Who would you recommend this job to? Like what kind of person would make a good mortician?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85bkea?context=5)|It's funny. I was a waiter for many years in my younger days. I always say, If you can be a successful waiter, you can be a successful funeral director. They are similar in ways. They both wait on families, both provide what should be excellent customer service. Just that one puts a pizza in the oven, the other puts a body in the oven. But really anyone who is good with people and customer service should do well.
[Hey Mortician. I've worked with the dead for a few years in my life. One time I picked up a woman who OD'd and I believe had been ruled dead for over a day. When I put her in the body bag, I started talking to the coroner. While my attention was distracted, the bag started rubbing against my leg. I could feel the blood flush out of me like a tidal wave and literally turned bone white. I was told this was caused by the gases escaping the body. Do you see this phenomenon often or at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85ewiq?context=5)|So the bag filled with gas and pressed against your leg? I've never seen that. Sometimes when you move them, air escapes the throat and they make noises. Sounds like a snore.
[I am an ICU nurse. Do you guys really appreciate when we leave the central lines in?  I was told it saves you a step,  but I always wondered if was true. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85f0un?context=5)|I appreciate it due to the fact that dead blood doesn't coagulate and leaving the lines in saves a lot of leakage on my stretcher and in the vehicle. I can see where it would save an embalmer a step in that they just leave it in. But such an embalmer would be lazy. All medical tubes, IV lines, etc should be removed during embalming and the holes left behind are sutured and glued.
[Do they teach you in school how to pull various lines? I've sent people to the funeral home with urinary catheters in for various reasons (mostly I forget about them\). Am I making a mortician somewhere swear at me? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85ieke?context=5)|No, it's all very easy for us to remove.

This all seems ridiculous and disrespectful to me. Especially if the deceased did not request it. I say I would refuse to do this to someone but who knows. I mean if the family really wants it.
[Mouth closure: what do you prefer? Dental tie? Mandible suture?

Mandibular suture for no teeth. I have perfected my technique. I never have a visible divet under the chin.
[What's an average day on the job like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c858v3f?context=5)|It depends on what's going on. an average day you might have a funeral service, meet with a family for arrangements, run death certificates to the doctors that are not online, pick up a body from a hospital.
[So a mortician is the person who prepares bodies for funerals then?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c859jb2?context=5)|Yes. Mortician is a term that applies to a person who is both funeral director and embalmer. In my state, not every funeral director is an embalmer, but every embalmer is a funeral director. The embalmers will prepare a body for burial.
[I'm from Ireland. Is a mortician the same thing as we would call an undertaker over here?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c869w7y?context=5)|Yes, they're pretty much synonomous terms: funeral director, undertaker, mortician.
[What's the pay like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85ajym?context=5)|Depends on the funeral home. Large corporate funeral homes will low ball you. Independent's will usually pay more.

Is this true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85berr?context=5)|No! But that would be awesome! j/k. It's funny to me about exactly how little the general public knows about this industry. It's a myth. People are embalmed on their backs. Another myth is that we cut off the legs of tall people so they fit in the casket. Our secret: put something uner the legs so that the knees are bent.
[This might have already been asked, but what is the most common thing that the public thinks about the industry that isn't true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85brok?context=5)|The misconception that every funeral director is filthy rich. you might make a decent living, but only the owners get rich.

You can then move into a 'student' or 'intern' position at a funeral home.
[Awhile back, a firefighter posted a photo of the..erm...cork used to hold internal organs in.

They do make anal plugs that 'screw' in to prevent leakage. The anus and vagina are usually packed with surface embalming chems and cotton to help prevent leakage. Not everyone will leak from these areas though.
[Hi. First of all: Thanks for your service.  What does a dead body smell like? - What exactly, as a mortician, do you do? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c859eeg?context=5)|Depends on what happend to it. Burned bodies smell like burned meat, no different than if you burnt a steak. Electrocuted bodies have a sweet scent to them, reminds me of roasted marshmallow. Decomps can be really horrible to be around and if you're around the long enough it will make you sick. -I am a licensed funeral director and embalmer. I make arrangements with families, I work on funeral services, I embalm all our bodies at the funeral home. I run errands, I take clergymen, hospice people out to lunch sometimes. There's a lot to do.
[What's the weirdest thing you have found on a body?  Also we need proof.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c8591o3?context=5)|I added proof. One time we made a house call. The deceased lady was over 500 pounds. We just wrapped her up in the sheets and blankets she was on and dragged her out. When we eventually got her on the prep table and started taking the sheets off, all this debris started coming out. Potato chip bags, candy wrappings, 2-liter coke bottles. Then I hear a clang on the ground, the lady had a locked &amp; loaded glock.
[How do you think the hospice movement has affected the funeral business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c858cr9?context=5)|We actually work very closely with hospice organizations. They can't refer business to you but they're good to have on your side.
[Hey! Thanks so much for this. I think this is my first time actually asking a question on r/IAmA, actually.  Anyway, I live in New Orleans. And if you've ever been there, you'd know that we pretty much put our dead on display. Because of that, and the inordinate amount of funerals that I've attended in my 19 years on earth, I've found that I have a fascination with death. More specifically, the traditions that are synonymous. I've put serious thought into becoming a Mortician, but as of now, I don't think that it's the right choice for me. I thank you for your service.  I have to know, can you give me one singular moment when you sat back, perhaps after a funeral, and thought: wow. I did a good thing today?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85dhc5?context=5)|When a family member hugs and thanks me for whatever. It makes it so worth it. It can be a thankless career path. You gotta pat yourself on the back and say attaboy because noone else is gonna tell you. But when it comes from the family you served, it is very rewarding.

I always slice the back of tshirts, shirts, and jackets. It just makes it easier to dress. I don't like jostling around with the body incase they purge some fluids. You can get the pants on without cutting unless they are too small. I work with a guy that cuts nothing, I chuckle as he struggles with a body.

There are Jewish funeral homes here. They typically bury the next day. No embalming, if they do embalm you have to save the blood in jars to bury with them. Orthodox Jewish believe that part of your soul resides in the blood. That's why the body is usually intact. Typically in a wood casket, all wood, no metal parts. That's about all I recall without looking it up.
[Do you ever get weird requests about the body from family members? I went to a funeral where they had the (open\) coffin propped up so the dude was standing up, it was bizarre.

17hmb5,5,2013-01-29,Career advice anyone?,secret-user,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/17hmb5/career_advice_anyone/,"**Hello Reddit.**

First I want to say that I'm sorry about bad writing in this post. It's just a subject that is really close too my hart. And I'm not super good at english grammar. 

Let me introduce myself. I'm 19 years old. I've been in love with games since I was a young one. And I figured out early that I some day wanted to work with games. But I didn't think it was possible for a normal human being. So I started taking computers apart, and setting them back together to better try to understand how it all fit together. When I understood the aspect of computer parts, and their role. I quickly got bored of just doing hardware. Thats when I started exploring web applications.

I guess I was about 14-15 years old when I started exploring the different web technologies. I started learning html and css. It was a lot of fun. But everything I made looked like crap. I remember one day I got into my classroom, And I saw a lot of people standing in front of the one computer in the room. I heard them laughing, So I walked up to check out what they where laughing about. And it was my website. It was a rough time to get though. But after some time, I decided it wouldn't break my spirit. And thats when I started learning Photoshop, JavaScript and PHP. It took some time to get it all down. But It was god damn worth it. Now I'm one of the two interns in town. Actually in this whole region! And i'm proud of that. 

Here is where the game development comes in. I started learning c++ and java after work hours the last year. And I feel like I'm starting to get a ok grasp of the basics. I guess what I'm asking is:

- Do my web development work make me more valuable in the game development industry? 

- If I keep up doing what I do here as an intern, I have quite the opportunity to have a good stable income. Is their any chance to get a good paying job in a game development office for one like me? 

- And does anyone have any solid advice for how I should go about my career? I want to one day become a good game programmer.


**TL;DR**

- Do my web development work make me more valuable in the game development industry? 
- If I keep up doing what I do here as an web dev / design intern, I have quite the opportunity to have a good stable income. Is their any chance to get a good paying job in a game development office for one like me? 
- And does anyone have any solid advice for how I should go about my career? I want to one day become a good game programmer.

17hmah,5,2013-01-29,Who am I and what happened to me?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/17hmah/who_am_i_and_what_happened_to_me/,"My fingers on the keyboard. My mind floating around somewhere. I don’t know exactly when or how it happened. I just realized how miserable I am, how sad and lame my life has become. Who am I? What happened to me? I miss myself, where did I go? How did I become like this? I am depressed, I know it. I know what I have to do to change everything. I’m way too depressed to do anything other than spending all day by myself, inside my mind talking to myself staring at some screen. It’s become so fucking lonely, darn it, I hate feeling lonely. I have been alone for the past two years, not literally. I have grown so much, mentally. I have loved and I have hurt over the past two years. I think I’ve hurt more. I am a fucking coward, so fucking miserable. Ocassional suicidal thoughts go through my mind every single day. I imagine how a bullet to the heart or the head would end my suffering, instantly. On a second thought I think I don’t deserve that right. I’ve been given absolutely everything. I have never had to complain about money, my parents have been generous enough to support me until today, my last college semester. I have loved and been loved back. I have travelled. I have true friends who are there if I need them. Yet, it feels like I am the last man standing on earth, with no one to talk to, no one that I can be myself with. There are so many people who would perform brilliantly, become great people, and do good to the world if they ever had what I have. I honestly feel like I am turning into a crazy guy, slowly but surely. I clench my teeth and tighten my fists because I feel an undescribable desperation a combination of anger, sadness, and anxiety. What the fuck is wrong with me???? 


About myself: I spent a year abroad in Germany from July-2010-July2011. As soon as I got there I realized there was this girl who was really into me. I was driven to promising her some sort of relationship for when I got back (for some odd reason, I wasn’t thinking as you will see, that happens a lot). Then I met Ana, she was from Montenegro, she was really friendly and also beautiful. We started hanging out with a bunch of other people. I liked her, but it turned out so did one of my “friends”, Luis (a guy I had met pretty much at the same time I met her) and I was “dating” the other girl on Messenger Video Chat. Luis and Ana made out one night when we were partying in Frankfurt, I got kind of jealous but nothing out of the ordinary. I kept hanging out with them (and other people) because we always had so much fun. One day, we were supposed to go out all together. I ended up alone with Ana. I didn’t plan anything. We kissed a lot that night. It was really romantic actually. I had to tell the other girl that it wasn’t going to work out, but didn’t want to mention about Ana because I didn’t want to make her feel worse (I never had any sort of physical contact with that girl). So I stayed with Ana, for three more weeks. My exchange program was designed so that I would spend only five weeks in Frankfurt, then move to another city for a whole semester. Ana’s program intended her to stay for a few weeks more in Germany after I left Frankfurt and then go back to Montenegro. Since I am a coward, I didn’t want to tell Luis that I was dating Ana. By the end of the three weeks I was feeling really crazy about her. She had her first sexual experience with me, but we didn’t have sex (I think this is relevant). So I moved out, and I had to say goodbye to this awesome woman. Two weeks later I woke up in the room of a Russian exchange student. We were celebrating the Mexican independence day in Germany, there was this huge party thrown by Mexican students. Things got crazy during the night, we clicked, kissed, and had an awesome night. For some reason, my not-thinking part of the brain kicked in and thought it would be best to date this girl. I want to think that choice was either the best or the worse I’ve made in my life, because it defines me. It was easy at first, but shortly after, really tough. I don’t know why I was persistent in staying with her when she was giving me a hard time. When I had decided I had to break up with her. After 5 months I was going to break up, I was so sure about it. I knew I didn’t want to be with this person, even if I had feelings of love for her, there was no future in that relationship. She went on a ski trip to the Italian alps at the end of the semester. I stayed and partied with my buddies. Then I get a call. She had an accident and dislocated her hip. She must walk with the aid of crutches for two months. There was no way in the world I was going to break up with her after such horrible thing happened. So I supported her and took care of her for  a month. Hip dislocation is one of the less common injuries, so it’s pretty bad. After that I had to move out again. The semester was over and I had found an internship in a city close from where I was (40-50 min train ride). That month brought us closer together and I totally forgot about my feelings from a month ago. So I just kept going, not thinking, for more than a year. During my internship we would only meet during weekends and we wouldn’t always have the best time. I got invited to her sister’s wedding in Paris and met her family, pretty big deal huh? So, during my stay in Germany I applied for a master’s program in the US. Got accepted so here I come USA. At the end of my stay in Germany, she came home with me to meet my parents. She spent a little over a month with us. After that, time to go to the US. Long distance relationship is tough! Fastforward a lot of problems and skype days later and she’s back home with me to spend xmas and new years with my family. Next semester starts, and problems continue to escalate, things become more and more complicated and apparently everything I do is wrong and I screw everything up. I was amazed of how much pain I was causing being so fucking far away. That semester I made a friend, from my own country, let’s call her Mary. So Mary and I became really good friends, and I seem to enjoy a lot spending time with Mary. My Russian girlfriend is giving me a hardtime over everything I do (I can be more detailed if you want), so in order to avoid problems I purposefully decided not to tell her about my meetings with Mary, because for me they were honest friendly encounters. FFW a few months, end of second semester in the US and Mary tells me how much she likes me. I just bought tickets to go to Russia and try to make things up and see how I feel, by being around her and her family. I was so lonely during that month in Russia. Tried to break up with her, she wouldn’t let me. Decided that if she was so sure and stubborn about us being together, I should keep trying to make things better and not be an asshole trying to finish things the easy way. I came back to the US to finish my last couple of months. I meet Mary, she’s not happy that I’m still with Russian, tries to say goodbye, then wants to be friends again literally five minutes later. Couple of weeks later I cannot be with Russian anymore, so I break up for good. One of the worst nights of my whole life, cried like baby, and not something I want to remember much, but something that is worth remembering because on the impact it had on my life. A few days later I kissed Mary.


Sorry it’s late. I feel a little better now that I wrote all of this. I will finish my story tomorrow. Thank you for reading, and for any support.

17hgk6,1,2013-01-29,Tune your tiny violins now...,Throwaway_to_vent,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/17hgk6/tune_your_tiny_violins_now/,"I just had a bit of a breakdown tonight after a culmination of things. I really need to get my thoughts down in words and hoped I might get some guidance from my fellow redditors.  Not sure where to start so I'll just go...

*Pre-High School*

I was a quiet, nerdy boy raised in a small town. My mother was/is a teacher and both sides of my family were very well known in town. As such, I was a do-gooder. I rarely got in trouble. When I was about 10 my parents told my sister and I they were getting a divorce. Strangely, this never bothered me. The night they told us I cried, but really it was only because everyone else was. I was put in a divorced kids support group in school, but didn't really need it as it made sense to me for them to separate if they didn't love one another anymore. In 8th grade my first ""relationship"" with a female consisted of ""being together"" for 2 days. When she broke up with me I was devastated. In my sadness I coined a phrase that has stuck with me (and apparently my father as he mentioned it a few months ago): ""There may be plenty of fish in the sea, but I don't want a fish, I want a mermaid.""

*High School*

I was still a nerd. My ""varsity jacket"" consisted of Marching Band, Symphonic Band, and Bowling.  I was still quiet but started to come out of my shell in a 6 month long relationship my sophomore year. Again I was devastated upon being broken up with. She was in the marching band with me and, therefore, I had to see her every day. Not 2 weeks after the end of it, one of my good friends at the time started dating her. This hurt me bad. I began suffering from depression. At this time I began trying to draw attention to myself, preying off of sympathy. I would (for lack of a better word) ""bounce"" a knife blade on my arm to leave marks that didn't really hurt, but looked like they did. On a band trip to Disney World I was stuck in the same group as my ex and friend. To get attention I decided to bash my head on a table multiple times to get a good sized lump and then feigned a concussion. I have never told anyone that I was faking it. I even went as far as to claim I had lost control of my eyes and was rushed, via ambulance from the park, to the hospital. My father was there as a chaperon and to this day I regret making him go through all of this. 

I then started dating another girl. It helped my emotional state at first but it didn't last. We were together for 2 years. We lost our virginity to one another. It took me a year to realize that I didn't actually like her, and another year to get the courage to end it. I've always been a ""nice guy"" and didn't have the heart to hurt her.

*College*

This girl and I were still together when I started college. She was 1 year younger than me and was therefore still in high school. After a week of being at school I made the decision to end the relationship. However, I could not justify ending it any other way but face-to-face and had no plans to return home for another week. That week was the one of the most difficult of my life. We spoke every day and with each ""You're going to love me forever, right?"" a part of me died as I had to say ""Yes"" without meaning it. I ended it that weekend when I went home and, while sad for what I had done, felt free.  I mean, I'm now single college student at a school with a 2-to-1 girl to guy ratio! Time to let loose, have some random sex, drink alcohol (my first drink was 2nd semester of freshman year) and live a college life. Well, that didn't happen. I had a new, amazing group of friends that, while they were more the ""rebel"" types (smoked weed, were promiscuous, etc) they cared about me more than any friend ever had. I realized all my high school friends were just people I hung out with and played video games with. They were not there for me emotionally. That entire first year I never even kissed a girl outside of a game of spin-the-bottle. I was happy, but at the same time, felt empty. (Now is a good time, I guess, to mention that I am a lover; I love to love and I love to be loved. Being single is not my preference.)  

My sophomore year I began dating another girl. She was amazing. She was funny, zany (as most art majors are) and (as I later found out) completely incompatible with me. We had fun together and I did love her. However, upon hanging out with her group of friends, I noticed... *something* between her and another guy. I don't believe anything happened between them, but I could just tell: this guy is going to end up with my girl. I was right. A few months ago they got engaged. When she broke up with me, I was lost again (see a trend?), but recovered much faster than before. This is most likely because I found a rebound. However, this rebound (I will call her K) made me even happier than my ex.    

It was about this time I began doing 2 things that made a huge impact on my relationships: I began smoking weed and I began playing World of Warcraft. At first, neither one caused issues; K was fine with my late night raids and would even join me in toking up now and again. I eventually dropped the smoking of weed as I was due to find an internship for my degree. However, I found the desire of inhalation of smoke to be too strong and began smoking cigarettes. I did my best to hide this from K (and to this day, don't know if she ever knew) as I wasn't sure if she'd have been okay with me being a regular smoker. I wasn't a heavy smoker by any means, maybe 3 cigs a day max. The WoW, on the other hand, began to cause problems. I began to play it much more than I should have, skipping classes and turning down sex (I know, I had a problem) to play a game with people I had never met. I'm not saying I don't have plenty of fond memories from the game, I'm just not sure they were worth it. 

In the summer after my 4th year (I was on a 5 year plan due to a change in majors and my being too lazy to take more than the minimum number of classes) and her 3rd year (she was on track for a 3 1/2 year degreee; she was an overachiever) K went on a study abroad to Australia. While she was gone, I had promised to try my damnedest to find an internship. While I did try, I didn't try hard. I spent the summer working for around 5-8 hours a day and playing WoW for around 12-14. Upon returning home, K broke up with me after 2 1/2 years of being together. Looking back, I don't blame her. I was a useless piece of shit. I was unmotivated, wasn't taking care of myself (reached my peak weight of 265lbs (I'm 5'8)) and was just wasting oxygen. This one was the hardest for me as I had intended on proposing to her that Christmas. It took me weeks to be able to get out into society without breaking down at the sight of any minute thing that made me think of her. 

I would love to say that this jolted me into a better man. It did not. My smoking of cigarettes increased threefold and I began smoking weed again because I gave zero fucks about an internship at that point. I slept around a bit (5-6 partners, nothing crazy, but still more than I had ever before) and began doing worse in my classes. Then I made the best move of my college career: I joined a fraternity. Now, this is not some ""get drunk, degrade women, beat pledges"" fraternity that you see in the movies. The fraternity I joined (Phi Mu Alpha) is a music fraternity. This essentially means we ware all music nerds who gathered together with the aim of advancing music. This was a group of guys I related to more than anyone I had ever met. I love my brothers. Because of this group of guys, I began doing better in my classes and generally had a better outlook on life. I was happy.

*Post-College*

Nearing the end of that final year, I still had yet to find an internship. This was required for my degree so essentially I was going to be going into my 6th year to finish it. I was still pretty unmotivated to find one, but lucked out when, on a whim, I asked the technology director at the school system in my home town if they could use an intern. As luck would have it, they just had someone leave and needed help. I began working part-time as an intern (decent hourly wage) and worked as a server for additional money (around 70 hours a week total). I moved in with my grandparents (my parents moved out of town) to save on rent and food. Now, my home town is boring and devoid of people my own age. When I wasn't working, I was (still) playing WoW.  At the end of the summer (and my internship) they began taking applicants for the position in the tech dept. I applied and succeeded in getting the full-time position. This was great, a good entry level job to start building my resume and begin saving money. I eventually (finally) quit playing WoW (telling my guildmates I was quitting was about as bad as breaking up with someone) and dropped the hours working at the restaurant.

*One year later*

That brings me to today. I'm now almost 25, still smokin. I've found a good group of equally nerdy guys to hang out with. While I love my new (most are actually old) friends, I miss my brothers in the fraternity. I have now been single for just over 2 years, the longest amount of time I have been single since I first started dating. I haven't had sex in over a year, the longest amount of time since sophomore year of college. I've asked 1 girl out and she accepted(!), but then canceled and told me she was interested in someone else. Being a bad saver, I have managed to stockpile zero extra money. Last week, my car died. I just accepted a role in a play in the local theatre. This role requires me to kiss another man. The man in this role is gay, which does not bother me in the slightest. However, tonight I was overwhelmed with the thought that this man would be the first person I will have kissed in almost a year and, if things keep going the way they are, might be the last I kiss for another year. I lost it. I'm so lonely. And now I'm about to reach the 10k letter limit. Any kind words would be appreciated."

I have past work experience, however, it's complicated.

As part of an honor's program at my high school, all students were required to work an internship one summer, I managed to score an internship at a small independent game company, and managed to even get hired back after my internship was completed. But then things got rough. Eventually, I ended up walking out.

Now, I'm unsure about whether or not I want to put this job on my resume. I feel I grew a lot as a person from my time working, and I feel like having past experience gives me a huge leg up on the competition.

17gy48,1,2013-01-28,Civil v Environmental ,qwerbyman1,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/17gy48/civil_v_environmental/,"Hi all, 

I'm a sophomore in my engineering program and am having a hard time choosing a declared major between civil and environmental engineering. I was hoping to get some input and advice from engineers working in either field. 

As I said, I am a sophomore and I'm doing very well in the program so far: 3.9 major GPA, involved in ASCE, EWB, etc, and I've begun looking for internships. There are a few more internship opportunities at my school for civils, which is one of the draws for that major, but I'm still drawn to environmental, especially as I'm told that the job prospects are supposed to be better in the coming years. I'm obviously still learning, but I think I'm more interested in water systems and water resource engineering than say structural engineering, and I'm told that environmental is a better path for that. However, I've also been told that as a civil I can take classes on these subjects, get my emphasis in them, but still be more employable in the long run since it is a broader degree.

I realize you probably get asked these kinds of questions often, so I apologize for that. But any advice as to the job outlook in either field, what you think the future holds, or suggestions on what to emphasize in would be much appreciated. Thanks!"
17grri,0,2013-01-28,MFA! I am desperate for help with my hair.,[deleted],malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/17grri/mfa_i_am_desperate_for_help_with_my_hair/,"[Here](http://imgur.com/a/81sTL) is an album of my hair.  

That is as it naturally decided to be today, its untapped potential, if you will. The second to last one is how I used to wear it for my internship.  The last one is how I used to wear it in high school.  I wanted to include it because it gives the full gamut of my hair.

So, despite the last picture, I'm actually a complete noob when it comes to hair.  I feel like I can dress myself fine and look good in a wide variety of outfits (I'm tall, sort of thin).  But I am never happy with my hair and face.  I feel like most of my attempts at styling it have been disastrous, I'm not very familiar with how to maintain a look, or what products I can use. 

I looked over the hairstyle thread, but didn't feel comfortable that any of the ones I'd like would work for me.  Although that may be my lack of confidence about my hair peeking through.  My hair is thin (always has been), wavy, soft like a baby's, and unruly even with product (from my experience). I'm not sure if that is because of the wrong haircut, the wrong product, or my misapplication of it.

I'm at a loss. Any advice on how I should cut and style my hair?"
17goc4,8,2013-01-28,How far can unpaid internships go?,Duendes,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/17goc4/how_far_can_unpaid_internships_go/,"I've been doing unpaid internships for the past 4 years, and I can't get a real paying job. During my first internship as an athletic trainer, I wasn't allowed to get paid according to my school, and yet I managed to personally work with athletes until they turned pro. One internship, I was a test cook, and I did many of the projects for my supervisors, coming in before everybody arrives and leaving after everybody leaves. I even taught one of my supervisors how to perform certain methods that he never heard/thought of as well as basic math &amp; statistics skills. When interning as a research assistant, I found the appropriate enzyme and bacteria to use to create real vegan cheese, the french classical way. Another internship had me in the kitchen for 15 hours a day, 7 days a week, and I never gained recognition. My current unpaid internship had me in the office until 8pm last Friday, while my supervisor left early, and they're having me create an algorithm for their website (something that isn't remotely close to what I was supposed to be doing), but at least they started paying me with a bus/subway pass. 

Despite all of these internships being unpaid, people keep telling me, ""Oh, it's a great opportunity, you'll gain experience and you'll be given a job in no time!"", and I've gotten zilch. Just yesterday, after applying for a job as a receptionist with a salary, the CEO emailed me back saying that I was ""over qualified"" and offered me an unpaid freakin' internship. When can one actually get a real decent job, without flipping burgers, that pays something? How can these companies get away with these unpaid ""internships"" even when I'm putting more work than the people that they're paying?! Has anybody else experienced this? Is this normal?"
17ldhk,0,2013-01-30,"Permabanned, in the most ridiculous tribunal case I have ever encountered (please read before pitchforking)",[deleted],leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17ldhk/permabanned_in_the_most_ridiculous_tribunal_case/,"Hey guys, I'm not here to appeal any ban or anything of that nature, all I want as my final request is for you guys to read this and learn from my mistakes.  **I'm certain your time spent reading this will be worth it**

(MANDATORY) FOR THE ~~LAZY~~ FOOLISH:  Link to tribunal case at bottom

Two week ago I got banned for 2 weeks for games that were all ranked, and yea, at 1800 ELO (or any elo that takes semi skill to achieve) when you have a singed who is 1-7 and rushes frozen fists before boots...you get a little upset.  I was set to be unbanned today, was looking at a bright future and setting goals to never get back to the tribunal; this all came to an end when I was permabanned before my other ban had even finished.

I'm not here to say I shouldn't get permabanned, I'm not here to say I think riot is corrupt.  I have said my share of cruel things to people.  In fact everytime I have been banned is for language, never feeding or AFKing etc.

The reason I am here, posting this, is because I would like to see change.  The largest problem with the tribunal and the way players are punished is that it never takes into account good behavior, acts of kindness, sticking up for the little guy.  In all of my case games from my suspensions over the one year I have been playing, they were all, with the exception of maybe 2-3 individual games, ranked solo queue (never duo).  When I am playing with friends, duoqueing, ranked 5s, I say almost nothing ever in chat, honestly, the records would show this.  I consider everything that is not solo queue to be the most leisure and ""fun"" type of league.  I am constantly calming down flamers and ending arguments between players.  I see no reason to EVER under ANY circumstance, be an asshole in anything other than solo queue, and i NEVER am.

So is it ok to be an asshole in solo queue?  Sure, its OK to be, but probably not ideal.  We all have those players who join and do nothing, build like they have never played the game, and refuse to listen to the team.  I get upset when I am playing, busting my ASS, and some other guy just doing nothing and trying to lose the game for us.  There is a DISTINCT difference between someone who is getting killed in lane versus someone who is killing themselves in lane.  I will never call out some guy if he's 0-8 and is CLEARLY playing his heart out.  I will get upset though if I see someone on my team going out of their way to be a bad player.  An example would be when I had a fiddlesticks jungler and every person on our team was incredibly pissed at him, yet I was permabanned over it.  The fiddles made a serious effort to never ult or use his zhonyas.  If I had to guess I would say he went over 20 minutes without actually pressing R.  It was clear to me and the other three players on my team that this fiddlesticks was just being terrible for the sole purpose of wanting to be terrible, he would never respond when we asked him what he was doing.

I think of Solo queue as I would any other competitive sport.  Non ranked is kind of liked a pickup basketball game or w.e other sport you would like to insert there.  In normal games, your goal should be to have fun, there is no penalty for losing so just go out and have a blast!  Ranked however, you are punished, you lose ELO, you lose something that is supposed to be a measure of how good of a player you are.  It has been said over and over again that good players will always win in the long run, and I agree 100% with this statement.  It's like a group project where everyone gets the same grade.  If some dude in your group is just a terrible presenter or has a hard time working with other people, you don't flame at him/her, you help them.  This is who I am, that is what I am all about.  If that same kid in your group decides that instead he wants to bail on everyone on the presentation day...well hes a fucking asshole, and now everyone is gonna suffer because hes an asshole.  

One last thing before I want to share with you guys before I put the final nail in the LoL coffin is a little story.  

I'm down at college, my freshman year.  Had just hit level 30 a few weeks before a tournament was coming up, riot sponsored.  I was extremely excited because I was hoping to find better players than myself and learn and meet people etc.  Well the tournament was run horribly, and it resulted in one person from my school being in a room by himself (this was a LAN event and riots official rules state you must be there in person to be eligible).  So here are like 30 people chilling in a room watching a big screen of the game going on, and I notice something...something was off... The Miss Fortune was literally killing the other team 1v5.  I had someone check up the ELO and sure as shit this guy is 2K, and he is playing a team with people who are not even level 30.  The situation became more troublesome when we all discovered it was from the team with the one kid sitting in a room, locked, by himself.  The tournament organizers were stupid and told the kid he was allowed to have people play who weren't there.  Well TL/DR this kid posted ""free rp"" on some forum, got 4 players to agree to it, they all registered fake names and none of them went to our school (this is not a rule but he claimed in his email that they all attended the school and were gone on break (lol)).  The kid was kicked out by a group vote and he was literally standing outside in tears.  He then rushed to his room and posted this entire thing on reddit and the forums saying his team was kicked from a tournament for being ""too good"".  So here I am, barely level 30, no idea what I'm doing, never HEARD of reddit before, never posted ANYTHING on the forums...and I realized at that point that I needed to do something for the good of the game that I love and will always love; I stepped in.  The team who won had been practicing for hours a day and you could tell, they won without losing a single match.  After the tournament ended they were informed that the kid had posted to /r/leagueoflegends and rioters were getting involved and they would not receive anything for winning.  Needless to say, they were PISSED OFF.  I can't blame them for being angry, you could just tell how much they had practiced to win, you could see it in their eyes (and under them hehe).  So I am just standing here with these tournament organizers and I tell them all, ""Let me handle this"".  And that is exactly what happened.  walking back to my dorm I had no idea how I would fix this problem.  I went online and saw the forum exploding with rage, siding with this fucking asshole kid who is trying to get free stuff.  I'm horrified at all the lies he is posting.  So back at the tournament, the 2K ringer player was streaming while he played.  We hopped on his stream and he had a single viewer, I bet we made his day.  In between a match he went to his facebook and I was able to catch a glimpse of his real name.  Now back in my dorm, through some miracle, I am able to clearly see his facebook name even though it was for only an instant while he was streaming.  I take his name and cross-check it with the registered list of players.  Sure enough, while they planned this whole scam to destory some scrubs at league and pick up their free champion ryze skin and hecarim bundle and free rp, they didn't bother to enter with their real names.  I immediatly took all of this and posted it while waiting for a response.  Sure enough, within no time at all, someone responds to my post confirming everything and the tides immediatly turn.  The Scumbag kid behind the entire thing INSTANTLY deletes all of his posts (edits them all so you can't see what the whole thing was about), and he changes his summoner name.

That day I truly felt like batman.  No one thanked me, no one gave me RP, I wasn't recognized for anything.  But to those five awesome guys who won the tournament, they deserved everything and if I could do ANYTHING AT ALL to help them I made sure to do it.  Eventually they all later contacted me that they got their prizes and thanked me and it felt good, but I explained to them that all I did was untie a knot that shouldn't have been tied in the first place.  (I also did it because I wanted to keep a high reputation for my school because that one kid's attitude and bullshit should not reflect the rest of us).  

*Because he's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So, we'll hunt him, because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a silent guardian. A watchful protector. A Dark Knight.*

Good luck to everyone on the fields of justice.  If there is one thing I want you to take from all of this it is to stand up for what you believe in, go the extra mile to help your fellow man, and never let assholes stand in the way of your dreams.  My time is up in league, I can never return, my hopes of getting into an undergrad intern at riot has been mutilated.  But for you guys?

17km39,0,2013-01-30,A College Student's Guide to Making His Money Work for Him: Revised Edition. More Advice Needed!,WoodChopper,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17km39/a_college_students_guide_to_making_his_money_work/,"Hello r/investing! I'm not sure if you remember me, but I posted here a few weeks ago about my money-saving strategies and since then I have read y'all's responses and revised my plan! I really appreciate all the original advice! If you didn't catch the original post, you can find it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/16rcb9/a_college_students_guide_to_making_his_money_work/). Background: I am a 20 year old college student with two jobs, one that pays from my on-campus housing and meals, and the other that I am using for strictly saving the money that I earn from it. From this job, I earn about $100 bucks a week, which is pretty modest, but I really want to save up to 90% of the money that I make. All my life I have been educated by my father about personal finance, whether from being forced to listen to Clark Howard as a young kid, or him showing me how to open my own bank account and credit card. I am completely debt free. I have absolutely no debt. Not a dime. My college tuition is paid for by scholarships, and my housing and meals are paid for with my Department of Housing job as a Resident Assistant. I have no credit card debt and only primarily use it for gas, snacks, or the occasional night out. So all my debt is already paid down. I'm pretty sure I'll graduate with zero debt. I also have had a credit card for about 3.5 years and use it for all of my general expenses (snacks, restaurants, gas, and nights out). I've never missed a payment and have zero debt on it. I checked my credit score for the first time a few weeks ago and its a 724. Which, for a 20 year old, I feel is pretty solid? Now that I'm finally into some extra money, I want to make my money work for me, rather than just let it sit in a low-interest savings account. So I kind of made up a game plan of what I want to do and when I want to do it. I am just asking for advice on whether these are good ideas, or if there are other options that might help me better!

So here is my plan:

* From my current job and the money that I already have saved, I know that I will have at least $1500 saved up by May. I plan on putting all of this money into a high interest savings account (with a rate of about 1%(Ally Bank), as opposed the the .15% that I am currently making). My purpose for this is to have a good chunk of virtually no-risk liquid cash that I can use for general spending purchases and to serve as my general savings account.

* Luckily, I just found out I landed an internship this summer and I will make about $8500 over the course of 10 weeks, in addition to my other $100 dollar a week job. I want to put at least $5000 of this money into a Roth IRA, which would double as an emergency fund. Yes, taking money out of an IRA seems like a big no-no, but it is actually a very viable emergency fund option.

* And this next step is one that I feel like you guys helped me with the most on my last post. I want to spend a little bit of money on myself as a reward. I have always been an extremely frugal person, but I feel like I need a little reward for all of my hard work. I am looking into buying a used Kawasaki KLR 650, which will run me about $3000. I've never owned my own vehicle, so I'd love to use this reward as a step toward financial independence from my parents.

Okay, Reddit! That's my plan, what to y'all think. Honestly, I am open to absolutely anything. I feel like some more money could go into long term stocks, instead of some other areas that I listed, but I'd just like to here from some more experienced people! I know I'm not making that much money, and after all this work, I may not have a large return, but I just want a game plan that I can test out before I graduate! I'm still young, so I'd rather make all my mistakes now!"

17kj1j,1,2013-01-30,"How I lost $20, but saved a few hundred",[deleted],talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/17kj1j/how_i_lost_20_but_saved_a_few_hundred/,"	So, I had a brief stint about 2 years ago as an assistant ITC at my old high school. The county bought a couple hundred iPads and quickly learned that iPads work best with Macs. So like the poorly budgeted morons they are, the county went out and bought a couple hundred iMacs. I’m good with macs, I was good with macs in high school, and I got hired to teach the other ITC how to administrate macs and fix most issues.  Anyway, a few months into the year, one of the teachers reported that some his keyboards and mice weren’t working. I went in after school and took a look at his room. All of the computers were fine. Keyboards and mice were working fine, so I told him this and let him know that if it happened again, let me know. The next day, he told me that all of the computers weren’t working, I went in after school and took a look. Every thing was fine, so I came back the next day during class. Sure enough none of the computer’s mice and keyboards were working. 
	I took one of the computers into my office and plugged it in. Still broken. I waited until after school, when the computers started working again, and started testing things on it. All of the USB ports worked, cables weren’t frayed, etc. Then I noticed that wifi was on. This was odd since I had set it so that you needed administrative rights to turn wifi on. I tried logging in as root(root password never changed I had to change the administrative password every month) and I got back the most confusing error. It said the password was wrong. I tried it a few more times and asked my boss if he had changed it. Nope. So I logged into my account and checked it out. I changed the root password back to the old one and went back to the classroom. Sure enough, the root password was changed on all of them. I changed all of them back and told the teacher about it and told him that that should fix it. The next day, all of the machines were back to being broken. I told the teacher that I’ll have to send them all in since I’m out of ideas. Just then, a note popped up on the computer I was sitting at. It said “Be in your office at 12:30”. Since I really wanted to figure out what was going on, and I had lunch that period anyway, I decided that it would be a good idea to be in my office. 
	At exactly 12:35, a student, lets call him Dave, walked into my office, sat down in the chair next to my desk and pulled out his laptop. I asked him flat out, “Are you the reason why (Teacher)’s computers haven’t been working?” His response, being quite cocky I might add, “Yup, and I’m going to show you exactly how I did it, two more ways to do it, and how you can fix it.” 
	At that point, I just stared at him for a few moments, confused as hell. He broke the awkward silence with, “I heard you say that you were going to send the computers in for repair. I didn’t want to cause you that much of a headache and this was getting boring anyway.” I told him okay.
	He pulled out his laptop, opened Apple Remote Desktop and showed me how he was disabling the keyboard and mouse. He also showed me quite a few other things you could do with it and I wrote myself a note to ask the school to buy a copy. 
	The next puzzle is why the root password was changed. I asked him about it and said nothing, stood up, and gestured for me to follow him. He went into (Teacher)’s room and sat down at an iMac. True to his word, he showed me the way he did it and two other ways to do it, all of which could be done in under 90 seconds. (The methods he used are openly available and can be found with a little bit of google, so I’m not going to post them here. If you really want to know, send me a message.)
I was so impressed that he could do this the I bought him lunch in exchange for him telling me everything else he could do and him agreeing not to change the passwords again and not to tell any of the other students about this. Over lunch, I asked him if he’d be okay being an intern with the ITC and me. He said yes, and now he has my job as part time Mac guru for the school.

TL;DR: Defaults are evil, some students are smart, and there are good people left in the world.

I've been learning C++ pretty much since high school but I do not feel I'm all that good. The only things I really did was coursework and anything really advanced feels too much for me.  I also do not know what to even look for when I get out, in other words I do not know what I like because I have only gotten a small flavor from my classes.  When I am coding on something I really know about I do enjoy myself and have a fun time figuring out how to solve the problem.  Recently I started using codeacademy and have done some script and later move on to things like html and python.

My main problem is I'm bad a starting something on my own and even if I want to start it I don't know where to go.  Is there a place where I can at least get an idea of what I'll be able to do with my CS degree and somehow study for that field?  Is it bad that if I only know C++ and feel very insecure about my skills to still look for an internship?  What do you guys advise I do if you were in my position?

I'm thinking I'd have better chances in the job market if I simply omitted this information from my resume and cover letter so that I can have an unbiased response from companies. My only hesitation in doing this is that I lack experience in industry-related internships because I was involved in military training for the last two summers of my college career.

Should I keep the reserve status on my resume and keep trying? Or would it be better to leave it off and cover my inexperience with skills/programs I've learned over the past 4 years?"

**Mission Goal**:  Land unkerballed probe(s) on Eve.  Collect data to facilitate planning a Land-And-Return mission to Eve.

**Pilot**: Loshea

**Vehicle Name**: KSS Oregon carrying Pathfinder probes Alpha - Delta

**Mission Launch:** Year 2, Day 158 12h, 34m

**Mission End**: 30th January,Approx 09:03 GMT

&lt;hr&gt;

*Mission Report**:

When the decision was made to begin sending exploratory probes to Eve, our engineering folks quickly devised mission payloads and delivery vehicles
capable of completing their tasks quite efficiently.  L028 was no different. Engineering had decided on an unguided probe, outfitted with only a set of landing legs, a parachute, each type of scientific equipment we had available, solar panels to keep it
running during the day, a batter to give it some time during the night, an antenna, and enough structural bits to hold it all together.  All in all, a very compact, light weight model.  Two weeks before our scheduled launch, Engineering delivered the specs for our Pathfinder probe and it's launch vehicle.  The rocket was nothing fancy.  It carried enough fuel to provide sufficient Delta-V to get to Eve
(with a gravity assit from the Mun), with nothing to spare.  Early specs looked good, tests looked good.

Then we received a herd of interns.  

They were tasked with making some final preparations to the mission vehicle, checking the math, dotting t's and crossing i's.  One of the interns, probably a relative for someone in mission control,
asked if it were ok to make some small modifications to improve the efficiency of the launch vehicle, and their supervisor said ""Sure, as long as you don't screw with the probe"".  To their credit, the 
intern did as he was instructed, and did not mess with the probe.

However, we were all very surprised on launch day to find that the mission craft was not carrying 1 pathfinder probe, as ordered, but 4 of them!  Once we in control got over the shock of seeing 4 probes on the
launch vehicle, we had time to get a drink of coffee.  Then the bigger picture hit us.  We ran back outside to look at the monstrosity our simple little rocket had metamorphosed into in the hands
of this lunatic intern.  It resembled little more than a radio tower with four probes and enough fuel to get a small space station into orbit.

Our launch deadline approached, and we had not time to rebuild the rocket.  As the saying goes, the show must go on.

That's when we found out the mission planners had been using inters as well.  We had a horible phase angle for our Eve approach, and no one in mission control thought we stood a chance of hitting our target.  We were going to scrub
when someone said ""oops"".  A great rumble announced the launch of the ship, the Oregon.  Reluctantly, we all went to our posts to try to do anything we could to keep this mission from ruining our careers.

Liftoff went surprisingly well.  Solid boosters fell away smoothly as their fuel was spent.  Then, at about 10KM, the first liquid fuel tanks separated.  The second set followed about 20KM later, during the gravity turn.  Things looked a little shaky as
the tanks came away, but the craft held together.  LKO was achieved with about 1/3 of the lift-stage fuel remaining.

We let the craft orbit for the better part of a day while waiting for the Mun to reach the correct position.  However, a computer error ignited the main engine again hours early.  While the rocket did manage a slingshot around the Mun, it exited Kerbin's SOI with more
velocity than intended.  It took some time, but we were able to regain control of the craft and jettison the now-empty fuel cell.  Our mission control team ran the numbers, and found that our best bet for achieving mission success was to allow the craft to orbit between Kerbin and eve for several months.

Months later, the interplanetary engines were lit.  Surprisingly, they fired up right away.  Half of the craft's on-board liquid fuel was spent in a corrective burn that set up a very nice intercept with Eve's SOI.  The only downside was that the approach would be a little high (about 65GM).  

Once the Oregon entered Eve's SOI, the crafts attitude was adjusted to align for the orbital burn.  16 hours later, the engines were lit, and the remaining fuel brought the craft into a rather steep 65GM x 19GM orbit of Eve.

At this point, the craft switched to using its ion engines.  over the course of a couple of burns (several days apart as the craft orbited high above Eve), Oregon's periapsis was brought to just within Eve's outer atmosphere.

As aerobraking began on the first pass, the first.  One probe was deployed during each subsequent aerobraking pass.

The third and forth were deployed during the second pass.  Pleasantly, 3 of 4 probes survived their fall to the planets surface (sans legs, which broke off during aerobraking).  Score one for our engineering team.

The interns had hoped the Oregon would have sufficient fuel to return to Kerbin for reuse, but the combination of bad phase angle and computer glitches made this impossible, and the decision was made to scuttle her.  Our mission controller cackled maniacly as he sent the destruct signal to the Oregon as she made one final aerobraking pass thorugh
Eve's atmosphere.

I have helped him get through his medical school stuff by helping to feed him and give him day-to-day supplies as he lives of his loan money and has no family to support him.  If you are not familiar with the high costs of med school and the time is requires, it is like having a job in that is occupies most of your time but it costs an insane amount of money.  We live in Utah (though we are NOT Mormon).  He is almost done with school.  He has worked very hard and now is getting rewarded for it by having well-recognized residency programs match with him.  He pretty much knows he will get into his top place.  The two places he is going to choose from are in California.  One is UCSF and the other is Stanford.  He also may choose to stay in Utah, but that won't be as good for his future.  He will finally have a salary as a resident which will be nice for him.  However, California is notoriously expensive to live in and hard to move to.  These places are even more so.  He has been a very good boyfriend to me and I hope to marry him someday since we have a good relationship that I can see being even better over time.

I live with family right now because I was got my masters in 2011 and was unfortunately unemployed after getting no offers from internships and no other jobs would take me on while I was in school with internships anyway.  I finally got a job in May, though it is not high-paying.  It is paying the bills so far though I still can't get out of my parents' house at this point.  I had a lot of debt pile up from not being employed.  I tried to help him as best as I could though as he definitely needed it.  I tried to do odd jobs and use the tiny bit of money I inherited.  Is still didn't change the fact that I was in deep debt though.  For now though, I am getting paid and I have started paying on the student loans I have deferred for so long.  I need a car where I live since our transit is pathetic if you don't live in our downtown area.  That of course adds up.  Overall, I now work hard to pay for a car, student loans, the loan I had to take up while unemployed, and then helping him.  I have so much debt it isn't funny.  I can't ask family for help because they already helped me as much as they could.  It doesn't make things any better after being in a major accident like I was Xmas eve and having to get another car and deal with insurance going way up.  I know my boyfriend appreciates my help though and he has been there for me in other ways.  I have lightly told him that I have to be careful about how I am helping him since my financial situation is not good. 

With all this background information in mind, I am now in a tight place.  He wants me to move to California with him but I have no idea how it can happen.  Utah's pay and costs of living are low compared to the rest of the nation, let alone Cali.  He will go out there and will have pay from his residency and may be gone a bit obviously from having to commit to it.  For those unfamiliar with medicine, residency does not pay that much.  I have been trying to scope out work around there and it isn't looking good.  I went to school in a field that is very hard to break into and this looks tough.  It will probably be better than where we are in the long term aspect.  I still need a job one way or the other if I go out there.  I know to move somewhere you have to have money saved up but I have nothing to save.  I am trying to get a side job to help with this but I still have no idea how this can happen.  

My boyfriend keep asking me where I think he should go and naturally, I want  what's best for him but I tell him that I am not sure.  I don't know what to do though as far as telling him no matter how much I want to go with him to California, I have no idea how I am going to be able to.  I want to continue our relationship and move with him as I do love him but with no money and no job where we will go, it isn't looking optimistic.  I work hard to help fix my finances and am already trying to do even more to help but it may not be enough to get there.  How do I tell him this?  I would do a LDR with him if I had to wait but those are so hard to do when you are not sure how you are going to be able to get to where they are one day.  I just am upset that I may risk this relationship over my finances.  If you could please advise me, that would be great.  Sorry if this seemed repetitive, it just has been weighing on my mind for a long time and after seeing how much I am trapped with money and how difficult it is to move and live in California and also realizing the time where he has to make a decision is soon, I finally had to do something.  Where do I even begin?"

More Advice Needed!,WoodChopper,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/17jjhq/a_college_students_guide_to_making_his_money_work/,"Hello r/personalfinance! I'm not sure if you remember me, but I posted here a few weeks ago about my money-saving strategies and since then I have read y'all's responses and revised my plan! I really appreciate all the original advice! If you didn't catch the original post, you can find it [here.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/16rasa/a_college_students_guide_to_making_his_money_work/)
Background:I am a 20 year old college student with two jobs, one that pays from my on-campus housing and meals, and the other that I am using for strictly saving the money that I earn from it. From this job, I earn about $100 bucks a week, which is pretty modest, but I really want to save up to 90% of the money that I make. All my life I have been educated by my father about personal finance, whether from being forced to listen to Clark Howard as a young kid, or him showing me how to open my own bank account and credit card.  I am completely debt free. I have absolutely no debt. Not a dime. My college tuition is paid for by scholarships, and my housing and meals are paid for with my Department of Housing job as a Resident Assistant. I have no credit card debt and only primarily use it for gas, snacks, or the occasional night out. So all my debt is already paid down. I'm pretty sure I'll graduate with zero debt. I also have had a credit card for about 3.5 years and use it for all of my general expenses (snacks, restaurants, gas, and nights out). I've never missed a payment and have zero debt on it. I checked my credit score for the first time a few weeks ago and its a 724. Which, for a 20 year old, I feel is pretty solid?
Now that I'm finally into some extra money, I want to make my money work for me, rather than just let it sit in a low-interest savings account. So I kind of made up a game plan of what I want to do and when I want to do it. I am just asking for advice on whether these are good ideas, or if there are other options that might help me better!

So here is my plan:

* From my current job and the money that I already have saved, I know that I will have at least $1500 saved up by May. I plan on putting all of this money into a high interest savings account (with a rate of about 1%([Ally Bank](http://www.ally.com/bank/online-savings-account/?INTCMPID=HP_NAV_SVG#tabs=rates)), as opposed the the .15% that I am currently making). My purpose for this is to have a good chunk of virtually no-risk liquid cash that I can use for general spending purchases and to serve as my general savings account.

* Luckily, I just found out I landed an internship this summer and I will make about $8500 over the course of 10 weeks, in addition to my other $100 dollar a week job. I want to put at least $5000 of this money into a Roth IRA, which would double as an emergency fund. Yes, taking money out of an IRA seems like a big no-no, but it is actually a very viable emergency fund option.

* And this next step is one that I feel like you guys helped me with the most on my last post. I want to spend a little bit of money on myself as a reward. I have always been an extremely frugal person, but I feel like I need a little reward for all of my hard work. I am looking into buying a used [Kawasaki KLR 650](http://www.totalmotorcycle.com/photos/2009models/2009-Kawasaki-KLR650e.jpg), which will run me about $3000. I've never owned my own vehicle, so I'd love to use this reward as a step toward financial independence from my parents.

Okay, Reddit! Thats my plan, what to y'all think. Honestly, I am open to absolutely anything. I feel like some more money could go into long term stocks, instead of some other areas that I listed, but I'd just like to here from some more experienced people! I know I'm not making that much money, and after all this work, I may not have a large return, but I just want a game plan that I can test out before I graduate! I'm still young, so I'd rather make all my mistakes now!"

Then, during a lunch meeting with a banker, my period drenched through my freshly changed tampon, sanitary pad AND even soaked my underwear. Then last night, my 13 year old dog that I had since I was 9 years old died while I was stroking her in her sleep. I had to call a vet to come collect her body because there was nowhere I could bury her. I had to watch as he lifted her broken looking body and stuff her into a black garbage bag. He promised that he would bury her somewhere near the clinic but the sight of her in the black bag was just too much for me. Both my siblings are abroad, so I fell asleep crying alone last night, then this morning I woke up crying again. Now I'm huddled in the office bathroom crying my eyes out and I can't stop. I don't even have the choice of taking the day off because I'm only an intern and interns aren't given leave days. Nobody in the office knows what happened and they think my eyes are swollen thanks to the infection and not from crying. My phone and computer's wallpaper is a picture of my dog and every time I look at it, I start to cry again. I can't do my work today and I'm afraid they might cancel my internship because of this. I did try to hold it in and sit at my table to work but I would run back to the bathroom to cry every time I thought about my dog, which is about every 15-30 minutes. I have another 6 hours of work to get through before I can go home. How do I make the tears stop??"

I get a ticket that seems easy enough. ""Not able to load access database."" Probably user error so I put it in my queue and head to the user's desk. 

Apparently, all new hires to the engineering department have to go through training. This curriculum was put together quite a few years ago and was built on top of Access forms for reasons that either nobody could explain or nobody would own up to. They had been around so long, in fact, that nobody actually knew where they came from or who made them. But at the time, I did not know this. 

When I got to the desk, I saw that the user was running Win 7 and Office 2010 on a brand new laptop. I asked them what the problem was and they said that Access threw up an error when trying to load the file. So I ask them to show me how they would load the file. They correctly browse to the file and try to open, and lo and behold, an error. 
""This database was saved in the Microsoft Access 2.0 file format."" Oh ok...wait, what?? 

This critical company training, without which a new employee could not continue to work in the company, was done in Access 2.0 and never updated. 

Well, no problem. Naive me makes a copy of the mdb(!) file and tries to do an import. Doesn't work. Not even a little bit. 

So, I spend the next two hours installing XP Compatibility mode, installing access 2.0 in that (which doesn't have an installer...just a dll file!) and running that in Windows 95 compatibility inside of the XP vm. 

TL;DR Old business processes die hard, and make my life harder than any user ever has.

17ncoo,0,2013-01-31,I hope reddit still likes cats,verbose_man,Jokes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/17ncoo/i_hope_reddit_still_likes_cats/,"A family of tabby cats walks into a talent agency run by a bulldog and his intern. The family -- a tomcat, his visibly pregnant mate, and two younger cats -- all take a bow, and the tomcat introduces his family to the bulldog.

""We're a travelling variety show looking for some representation. Do you think your agency could help us?""

The intern, a chihuahua, begins to nod and speak, but the bulldog cuts her off, chomping on a smoldering cigar.

""We only represent the best here. We'll need to see a performance of your act before we can take you as a client.""

""We don't have a videotape prepared,"" says the tomcat, ""but we're prepared to demonstrate the big number at the end of our show for you here in this office, if you'd like.""

The bulldog and chihuahua exchange a glance, and the bulldog sighs, puffing a cloud of tobacco smoke to one side.

""Okay, okay. You get one take. This had better be good.""

The family of tabby cats rearrange themselves, and look expectantly at the tomcat, as though waiting for his cue. He nods quickly and the two kittens run at each other. The male extends his front paws as his sister vaults into a handstand on top of them, spreading her rear to expose her glistening vulva. This display of gymnastics attracts the attention of the tomcat, who sticks his nose and mouth firmly between her legs, while the pregnant cat begins to wail a few bars of a vaudeville song that the intern is unfamiliar with, but the bulldog has heard once or twice. The tomcat screeches, spraying urine and pheromones all over the pregnant mother before displaying his now-erect penis, bristling with sharp spines. Both the bulldog and chihuahua are speechless at this jowl-dropping display, and the cigar falls to the floor.

On a downbeat in the mother's wailed song, the tomcat opens the door as the two kittens scramble to the side of their mother, singing harmony on the line ""everybody wants to be a cat."" A larger-than-average doberman comes through the open door and sits in the middle of the scene. The tomcat bends forward, caressing the tip of his tumescent, barbed penis and sucking with his mouth at the crotch of the doberman. Meanwhile, the two kittens grab the distending walls of the pregnant cat's cervix as she gives birth to a litter of four kittens, one after the other, right on the floor of the talent agency. The doberman, seeing the sudden shock of birth on the mother's face, licks his chops as his turgid penis bursts out of its sheath, shiny and red as a tomato. With this, the chihuahua intern shivers a little as the bulldog tries to regain his composure while fighting a small twinge of jealousy at the size of the doberman's member.

The doberman approaches the mother, while the tomcat begins to hump the placenta like a horny teenager on a dirty sofa cushion. The two kittens who'd assisted with the birth back away, making wide gestures with their paws at their postpartum mother's gaping vagina. The doberman rocks his hips back and forth, rolling his swelling penis against the umblical cords like violin strings to the beat of the winded mother's song. The two oldest kittens pick up the tune for their mother as she picks each of the newborns up and sucks the fluids from their fur. The bulldog behind his desk leans over and whispers to his intern, ""that part makes sense, at least.""

The tomcat breaks away from the placenta as the mother finishes cleaning her infants, then begins raking the barbs on his twitching penis against several boils on the back of his mate's flank. One of them bursts, spilling pus down her coat and onto the floor. The doberman scoops up the male kitten from the side of the room and shoves his giant cock through the cat's virgin rectum and all the way out through his mouth. With the head of his penis dripping and exposed, the doberman takes aim at one of the newborn cats and penetrates its tiny vulva, making her seconds-old eyes pop open and roll back in her head. With this, the doberman comes hard, biting the head off the infant and dripping semen down to the ground. The bulldog and intern are aghast, recoiling back into their chairs.

The oldest female holds the exposed esophagus of the deceased infant, defecating lumps into the wound and puffing the body up like a balloon. The mother cat snatches the body up, licking the fur, and slowly sliding the body in and out of her still-gaping snatch. The other newborns instinctively begin to lap up the mixture of pus and semen on the floor like milk from a saucer, trading with each other in a show of generosity. The tomcat, still erect and pulsing with excitement, grabs the chihuahua from her seat by the back of the neck, and begins penetrating her unaroused mound while singing about making pussies purr. The bulldog is frozen with shock and horror as his intern's body betrays her.

Finally, the mother's masturbatory lump becomes too much for her and she shudders, coming hard and squeezing the feces from the decapitated body of her child. The tomcat, the mother, and the doberman all harmonize on the last note of the song as the tomcat climaxes inside the chihuahua. As the tomcat pulls his spined phallus from the raw and bloody canine sex, the chihuahua's guilty orgasm adds one more note to the song as the group finishes together.

Everything is silent, except for the low licking of the three surviving infants against the sticky texture on the floor. The group takes a bow as the chihuahua passes out. With this, the bulldog gasps, reaching a trembling paw for the dropped cigar. He replaces the stogie in his mouth, not seeming to notice the dark dribble of blood-darkened interspecies semen on the tip.

Finally, after what seems like an eternity, the bulldog is finally able to force some words from his mouth.

""Well, what the hell do you call that act?""

The tomcat's eyes sparkle.

Self-post please upvote for awareness!",[deleted],guns,https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/17n9vj/the_rules_of_rguns_change_tomorrow_so_lets_make/,"Hello, 

  The mods of /r/guns are going back to a less political environment in less than 24 hours and I feel we should use this time to make one last plea to the community to contact their reps and make a difference in this political climate. 

First, the AWB is getting [pounded](http://blog.sfgate.com/nov05election/2013/01/30/senate-judiciary-chair-rejects-dianne-feinstein%E2%80%99s-assault-weapons-ban/) harder then a freshmen during Greek week and we need to keep up the pressure.

Second, the gun grabbers seem to be focusing in on that magical magazine limit of ten and have several bills that seek to limit capacity to ten. 

Third, currently, the registration bills only have one sponsor a piece, but it's good to mention them during this operation. 

So, here is what you can do! We will be using this site:

http://www.congress.org/congressorg/mail/?alertid=61046526&amp;amp;type=ML

To send this email (or a similar of your own design) to your reps:

Hello, 

I am writing you to urge you to OPPOSE magazine capacity restrictions, weapons registration and the assault weapons ban. 

Thank you, 

(Your name)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why so short? Well, because there is really no need to go into detail as an intern is likely to see your message and make marks accordingly for what you want your rep to oppose. 

Secondly, we MUST take to the phones. Only this time, we will be pushing the Senate Judiciary committee who recently debated gun violence only yesterday.

Partrick Leahy (Chair, D-Vermont) (202) 224-4242

Chuck Schumer (D - New York) (202) 224-6542

17n62o,1,2013-01-31,I (23/f) got into a stupid argument with boyfriend's best friend (25/m) on facebook. ,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/17n62o/i_23f_got_into_a_stupid_argument_with_boyfriends/,"So, my boyfriend's best friend loves to talk shit for fun. We proverbially bust each other's balls quite frequently and sometimes the stuff that is said is kind of mean if not viewed as being a joke.

Yesterday we got into an argument on facebook where we started talking shit to each other and when he said my ""quip"" took too long, I remarked that I was ""busy being a productive member of society"". The joke continued from there, him attacking me for being an intern, and I attacked him for being a janitor at a really nice historical site. 

He got extremely offended and basically called me a stuck up cunt and said some other harsh things. I was stunned at the time because I sincerely did not think he would take me seriously, but apparently I hit a sore spot with him. As soon as I realized it, I FB-messaged him (since he was at work at the time) and apologized and told him I didn't know it would upset him and I was just busting his balls. He promptly told me to go fuck myself.

After about an hour or two I texted him, thinking that calling would be a bad idea since he was mad, and apologized repeatedly -- I told him I was sorry and that I don't think less of him or his job in any way and that I actually think he has a cool job (although cleaning toilets and stuff sucks). He told me at a certain point jokes like that become an assessment of someone's worth, so I continued to apologize and said I would never have said it if I thought it would hurt his feelings or that he would take it seriously. Eventually he just said ""I hear you"" and that was the end of the conversation.

I told my boyfriend to keep out of this and explained that I really was sorry and that I had apologized to his friend. He said that what his friend said was pretty harsh but he also understood why he got upset for what I said. And, like I said, I told him I had apologized repeatedly, etc. etc.

Now I feel a bit awkward. My boyfriend's birthday is tomorrow. I'm making a cake and we're all going out to a bar. I had told his friend that I would buy him an apology drink if he didn't hate me, but I'm honestly kind of hurt at what he said to me even though I know it was a reaction to what he perceived as something really mean. 

I literally haven't argued with anyone like this since I was a freshman in college. I'm not a judgmental person and I would never say something intentionally hurtful.

How do I handle this situation with some semblance of grace? I really don't want to make my boyfriend's birthday awkward, but outside of buying a drink, I've apologized and I don't really know what else I can say. I'm pretty hurt by what he said and that he thinks I would judge him for something like a janitorial job, but I don't expect he'll apologize for what he said. 

**tl;dr: Got into an argument with my boyfriend's best friend on fb because a joke was perceived as something offensive. Apologized repeatedly but tomorrow is my boyfriend's birthday and I feel awkward about the whole situation and don't want to talk about it. How do I avoid an awkward situation if his friend is still mad at me?**"

She found someone that she ""clicked"" with. Need advice please. ",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/17my5x/my_gfbest_friend_f21_highschool_sweetheart_of/,"
Thank you so much for anyone that gives me advice, just posting this helps me cope with the issue. 

We have known each other since tenth grade of high school and we were best friends for about a year before we decided to give each other a chance to be a couple. I had been with 3 not serious relationships (kissing only) and I was her first boyfriend. She is the sweetest most caring person I had ever met, looking out for others more than she did her self .We promised each other that no matter what we would always be best friends. I go to community college and have a part time job, admittedly I haven't had the best grades but I recently reach a 3.0 gpa while at the same time looking for a better job and she goes to a 4 year private university and is fortunate enough to not have to work and is currently doing an internship. 

Time wasn't  always on my hands, we limited seeing each other to two days a week without the knowledge of her parents and  because her parents didn't let her do weekends. Speaking of her parents, her mother never liked me when we started dating but had softened up over the years and her dad was cool. She was my first, and I was her first intimate relationship. She trusted me just as much as I trusted her, we would cry in each others shoulder when times were tough but we also shared beautiful moments with each other. Her friends were also my friends so we hung out together all the time.

  I was always the confident one, the one that kept on pushing her forward and she was my foundation that kept me strong. I regret ever wanting to break up with her about a year ago because I felt ""trapped"" because she was always talking about living together and talked about kids and I wanted to see how it felt being single again. We convinced each other to give it another go, a lot changed over those months inside of me, I  knew for a fact that she was the one. 

She is graduating next year and I'm still stuck in community college pursuing my dream. About a month ago she started her spring semester and also said she wanted to stop having sex sex because she felt terrified every time her period came late, I felt hurt but I told her it was okay and that there were other ways of being intimate.  She told me she made a new friend that I'll refer to as ""bob"". She met bob in one of her classes, same graduating class and such. She has had guy friends before at school so I just teased her to be careful and not to forget who she was with because she didn't have many friends there and I wanted her to be happy.

Last week she came over, and started talking about how she wasn't romantically in love with me and how she loved me but in a different way. I was speechless. Out of everyone I knew  including me self I never expected those words to come from her. I was blindsided, we had just hung out with our friends for her 21st and the thought of her celebrating with me and feeling like that crushed me. My world came crashing on me out of nowhere. I tried reasoning with her that we should have another shot, because I had felt that way before too and I over came it. I told her to sleep it put and rethink her position. The next day she said she had made up her mind and he said she wanted to be with me. I was happy, I started doing research on how to give out relationship that spark, what we would do for valentines day and I just had so many good ideas. 

The next time we met she said she didn't know how to feel, I got it out of her that when she met bob when the semester started and that she looked at her a certain way. She stopped having sex with me because the thoughts  of her accidentally becoming  pregnant and  not being sure if she would be happy with me scared her and  especially if we moved in together or married (which was a few years down the road, we hadn't even thought of planning it and that mind you she brought it up the most)

We both made each other grow spiritually, sexually and emotionally.  Now I feel used, lonely, and angry to some extent that she left me for another potential guy. The worst part is that she is my best friend, the person I cried to and shared my feelings with and now it hurts when I see her and we do things we used to do and even when I don't see her it hurts. 

Should I forget her and never see her again?

Should I still hang out with her and our friends? 

Should I wait and see if comes back to me?

Should I fight for her?

Deep down I feel she still has feelings for me and I just have to remind her of why we fell in love with each other, am I giving my self false hope?

What did I do wrong?

If I choose to fight for her how do I win her back?

I told her that right now I would focus on school and getting a better job and that I wasn't interested in looking for someone else by which I was trying to say that I would be there if she regretted her decision, despite her leaving me for another guy. I told her I understood how she felt that ""what if I was with that person instead"". "

I was originally planning on studying for P/1 during the summer so I can (hopefully) pass it as soon as or during the first couple of months that school starts again. I was planning on reviewing/going over the basic concepts and work through problems for Calc 3 and just learn what I needed to know for the P/1 exam and then just learn the rest when the new semester starts.

My other option would be to take an online course for Calc 3 at my college and then study for P/1 soon after.

The main problem is that I will be working full time during the summer so Option #1 seems more practical to me. Also the sooner I pass P/1 the sooner I can start applying for internships. Though I don't think I'll be able to get one as a Sophomore applying with only one exam and (hopefully) a 4.0 GPA, I can at least try and the earlier the better.

Thoughts?"

I am going there with my SO for both of us to be in a place that is good for us professionally.  I am trying to save up so relocation assistance won't be necessary but great greatly appreciated if possible.  

I currently am employed in my current location.  I hope to start networking and get connected to employment before I move.  I am working for my state government with records and customer service for their Department of Public Safety.  I went to school for environmental studies and urban planning.  I have completed internships in both of those as well.  I hope to find employment in my fields naturally but I certainly won't turn down a decent job offer anywhere it comes.  

Not sure if this is a place to say what skills I have, but here are a few.  I have skills in Microsoft Office Suite, GIS software, and I am learning some coding in Java and Python right now.  I am familiar with planning technical skills such as zoning ordinances, economic development and such.  I am familiar with sustainability concepts in green building, energy, and feasibility studies.  I have learned a lot about government and nonprofits from working in it.  I am currently on linked-in so you can see where I have been and what I know from there.

I can provide more information on anything if you PM me.  Thanks :)"
17mfqb,54,2013-01-31,Amney -- a Ouija board experience ,beforethewind,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17mfqb/amney_a_ouija_board_experience/,"My uncle started hospice last weekend. 

He is not terribly old. Of course, he is not terribly young, either. He is my grandmother’s brother, on my mother’s side of the family and he is dying. I am sitting on his bedside and outside, far away, police sirens are roaring. He was always our uncle, but he was more of a cousin, he was more of a peer. Uncle was a child at heart. With my brother and I being the only children in the family, he was our de facto cousin. He was the family friend we could relate to. He was not a condescending source of maturity; he was as ridiculous and optimistic as we were. The fact that he is dying destroys us. It destroys me. An obnoxious measure of sirens blots out my thoughts. 

Adam is taking it with particular difficulty. He is the truest baby of the family and my younger (and only) brother. That is not to say that the rest of the family is coping any easier. Uncle Jack was the youngest of his siblings, as well. It is a terrible situation no matter how you word it. He would always be the one telling me, “John, you take care of Adam if anything ever happens to us,” meaning, the older relatives and my parents. That advice gives me little solace today. 

Uncle Jack was a police officer for many years. He married a beautiful woman who we came to love as our aunt in his early thirties and that was probably the symbolic ending of our “peer relationship” with him. At that point, he was our elder. We were no longer arbitrary cousins. It ironed out the family. We knew who we were and what our family consisted of, at last. Adam was almost out of middle school when this happened and I was just graduating high school. 

It is incredible what a decade can do to your being. Adam is now a police officer, very much so following in the footsteps of his beloved uncle. But Uncle Jack, dearest uncle… he is not nearly as thriving. He maintained a lustrous career in the New York Police Department and was looking forward to retiring by fifty. Instead, he contracted a rare cancer, probably due to a consistent bout of responding to emergency calls in this one devastated area of the city. You know the area: uprooted partitions of asbestos and every god damned carcinogen known to man were crudely molded into low-income housing. Now, every time some schmuck with a gun let a slug fly, these chemicals became airborne. These chemicals infected the lungs of the men and women who were there to protect the innocent bastards who were unfortunate enough to live in these areas, to live besides the walking scum of mankind that fought such petty wars. And now he was dying, before sixty years of age. 

I will not get into the philosophy and utter bullshit that comes into play when discussing such matters. Would a just god allow a kind and fair person to die before the age of seventy? Would an omnipotent universe allow a schoolyard of young child to be slain at the end of a gun belonging to a madman? I am not one to even begin rationalizing these conversations and will sure as hell not begin to do so here. The fact remained: my uncle was dying and my family was preparing for the absolute worst. And we struggled against futile efforts. 

Adam and I, we grew up and matured under almost direct-influence from my uncle. Of course my dearest mother and father crafted our personalities. Of course our friends and schoolmates helped to form our ideas. But, as far as anything beyond our genetic destinations, our uncle was probably singlehandedly responsible for our identifications as selves. From our profound interest in the afterlife to our preference to spending the weekends playing paintball in the mountains, he forged us. Honing in on the whole “afterlife” aspect of our interests, he gifted us one item that truly solidified our love for the macabre. When I was just beginning high school, however many years ago, our dearest uncle gave my brother and I a simple Ouija board. 

It was a mass-produced and super commercialized item. We were, concurrently, super skeptical, but my brother was feebly open-minded and I was always looking for a way to spook myself and my family out. The silly board game even had a “glow in the dark” feature that added to the ridiculous nature of the whole ordeal. This led to Adam and I spending countless afternoons in the basement, sitting cross-legged on the floor in the dark, peering into the softly glowing, barely visible face of the Ouija board. 

My skepticism had never left me and Adam was never particularly deft in the craft of manufacturing a storyline and characters of a fictional persona. So, when we began “meeting” otherworldly beings and dead humans through this board game, I was a little bit more than pleased and worried with our findings. Whenever we would ask their names, we would get a handful of random letters that only loosely resembled realistic names. But their backstories would always be spelt with the utmost of tact and grammar. While their names were gibberish, their explanations were perfect. It was a tad unsettling, sitting as the elder in the room. 	

With all of this apparent fright, let it be known that I was never upset with my younger brother. I did not receive these paranormal readings as malcontent on his part. It just surprised me, at times in pride, at others in fear, that he could move the dial on the Ouija board and spell out entire life stories of people who had lived in the 14th, 18th, and 19th century. How did he, a public student living in 21st century America, know the politics of Luxemburg? How did he know that women in historical China would bind their feet? How would he, a boy who had barely begun to pick up the guitar, know what a mandolin was? I could not tell if it was my practical joking getting the best of him and I concurrently or if otherworldly forces were at play. Could this ridiculous board game actually channel… something else? Of course not. I refused to believe it. It must have been something about our subconscious or some other psychological phenomena that I could not explain.

Time went on and I found other vices to occupy my time. I found petty flirtations with girls my age that never came to fruition. Young puppy love and relations that never manifested themselves into an actual relationship. I was far too afraid to actually ask a girl out on a date, so these feelings only resulted in my confiding with my good friends. But I had not kept tabs on my younger brother. As where I had grown tired of playing with the Ouija board, Adam kept at it with his friends and even, at times, by himself. In the days that we had played with the device, we had “met” an entity known as Xenon. It was a completely ridiculous and unbelievable name, but she was supposedly an Asian immigrant of the Luxemburg storyline that I had previously alluded to. She was a servant of a household in the European micro-nation. She had also played the sitar. How my brother had created these characters, I have no idea. My imagination was certainly not at play and I, even as a younger teenager, truly did not try to disenfranchise the results of the board by creating my own metaphysical stories to frighten my brother. 

I allowed them to play with the board without supervision for quite some time. He had shown it to various girls and boys from the neighborhood whenever I was working at the local craft store. As I had said, I was no longer interested in the game, but his young mind surely was. Life went on. 

As we grew up a bit, we would cater to our love for the paranormal through alternative means. Fortunately for us, it became a topic of popular culture and many television series and specials were produced for broadcast programming. This allowed for our parents to become involved in our hobby. After a few episodes of a ghost hunting show on television, my mom confessed, with a slight bit of sarcasm and enthusiasm, that she had thought she had seen a “woman standing in our living room, late at night.” This was, of course, an appeal to my brother and I, an attempt at stirring our imagination. I nodded and worked on my dinner as Adam stared in amazement and swore that he, too, had seen such a manifestation. Our dog, a small Jack Russell Terrier, entirely white except for a splotch of brown on her head, took this opportunity to steal some food off of his plate. The little rat had always sat right behind Adam, sharing his chair and hoping that he dropped food. 

Having been next in line for our creative development (behind my beloved uncle), my mother would consistently drop little story starters into our daily lives and never provide much more to go on. Much like the short story about the woman in the living room, she would give us a mental image and an out-of-the-ordinary situation, and let the ideas cultivate in our young minds. This continued for a long time and at certain points, I could not tell if she was merely being whimsical or actually telling stories which had occurred in her life. I remember when I was a freshman in college, visiting home for the winter, she swore that when she was working on her computer in the kitchen, our dog walked past her legs and into her bed which was typically at my mother’s feet. She reached down to pet my dog and realized nothing was there. A few moments later, after searching, she found the dog sleeping upstairs. 

Weeks later, after watching one of these television series with the entire family, we found ourselves enjoying a scene, invariably scripted beyond oblivion, of the “paranormal investigators” utilizing a Ouija board and attempting to talk to spirits in the attic of an old house in Washington State. Adam sat there on the couch, with this knees held against his chest in rapt attention. It was pleasant to see that childhood enthusiasm alive and well. Although he had still regularly played with the board, seeing this television show had completely rekindled his love of the game. He asked that I would play with him that weekend when he had his friends over. 

There were two boys and a girl. They were all around fourteen years old and, naturally, little shits. There is really no other way to put it. I am all but positive that one of them and the girl were a couple. He’d take every opportunity of physical contact as a grace-lacking attempt at touching a personal area of the girl’s body. Were this incident to occur today, modernly, there would absolutely be harassment issues brought up between the girl and the boy, their school’s guidance counselor, and possibly the police. But that is merely my age revealing itself. Unfortunately, the curse of young adulthood and piss-poor personalities did not keep its hands off of my younger brother. 

Before we began the séance, we sat around the board and Adam gave the instructions, their objectives, and his “house rules” of sorts. The girl lit three candles and turned the lights off at his request. He warned his friends to be very serious in this exercise. He warned that it could be a lot of fun, but that they may end up talking to very powerful and sometimes malicious entities. He did not want them to display any disrespect or rudeness, because he frequently had spoken with “demons” who had initially introduced themselves as benevolent spirits. One of the boys asked what he meant and Adam, appealing to the annoying nature I had previously mentioned, told him that he would be temporarily cursed. Further inquiring to what Adam meant, he told him that “whenever he went into the bathroom, your face would be replaced with white eyes and a horrible screaming mouth” – I intervened and told him to knock it off. There was no point in playing with this if you were going to be a lying schmuck throughout the ordeal. 

He laughed at my objectivity and apologized. The three others laughed nervously too: they still believed in my brother’s ridiculous warning. No such “curse” ever came about, so there’s always that. Ha.
Before long, we encountered an entity that refused to give a name. The boys teased, saying that it was afraid of us, and the board said, simply, “bullshit.” They asked if it was a boy or a girl and it did not respond, again. The group was quiet for a little bit, nervous, and the girl hazarded, “Are you a demon?” The room was still for a moment, then the dial moved, all of our hands on it: yes, you little slut. I chalked it up to the touchy-feely boy, but he looked as shocked as everyone else. They were a little upset. 

Adam looked genuinely worried at this point. He apologized to the board, for our rudeness and whatnot. It responded with a simple “fine” and the group did not really know where to go from there. One of the boys finally asked, adding an additional apology, if they could speak to someone else and the demon could be on its way. The board told us that he would not release the board to any other entity. We were going to speak to him and him only.

This seemed to really not sit well with anyone. I, well, I was interested. I held my smirk behind a straight-grit in order to keep the group still and petrified. Without asking another question, the dial moved once more and scribed a sentence that chills me to this day: tell that brother of yours to stop being a smartass. My eyes widened and I looked at Adam. Adam looked at me and then wore an expression of a man twenty years his elder, so far removed from the comforts of modern living. He wore the face of a parent burying his child, of a surgeon failing, of a war veteran outliving his comrades. He bore too much knowledge about the situation at hand, far more knowledge than anyone in the room. Essentially, this was not a joke. We had all removed our hands with this last insult and Adam motioned to return them, clearing his throat.
“Demon,” Adam asked. “Is that you, Amney?”

The familiarity and tone in my brother’s voice made the hair on my neck stand. Without a second to contemplate the situation at hand, the dial read “yes.”
“Listen, we were just interested in showing our friends how the board works. We mean no harm.”
“I know, you little fuck. I was just checking in. How’s the family?” The board wrote.
After the response, the dial rapidly shot to each corner of the board, to the decorative pictures that branded the extremities. Nonsense.
“We’re… we’re fine, Amney. I know we haven’t spoken in a while.”
“Good. Good.  Which parent do you love more?”
At this point, I picked up the little dial and clutched it tight, standing.
“No, we’re done. This is bullshit. Adam, I don’t know if you’re fucking with your friends, or… or what. But we’re done.”

The fucking thing tore from my grip and landed upright on the board. The candles went out immediately after and the girl screamed. I moved towards the stairs and turned on the light. The candles were tipped over and the wet wax smothered the board. Most of it was covered, except for the smiling sun in the upper left-hand corner.  The wax encompassed it and most of the mess was already drying. Adam looked up at me and told me he was sorry, a single tear running down his face. He sniffed, looked away, composed himself and rapidly stood, cleaning the mess. His friends never saw his tear.

We quickly packed up and that was that. We did not talk much about it. He was obviously bothered, but got over it by midweek. We played plenty of shooter video games and we even drank a little bit of our parent’s alcohol when they went away the next weekend. That Sunday night we watched a horror movie which focused around a demon. Upon realizing the story’s premise and hearing the word “demon,” I silently hated myself and prayed that it would not bring some shell-shocked flashback to my brother’s being. No such break down occurred; in fact, he calmly and happily brought up the experience after the movie. He simply asked, “Do you remember that whole ‘Amney’ bit?”

Of course, I said yes.

“Yeah, that fucker is creepy,” he smirked.
“You talked to him a lot?” I asked him.
“Yeah. I don’t really know how to explain it. Maybe those things are like… creative unlockers? You know? Like they tap into your creative invulnerabilities and just pour words from you.”
“I don’t know, man.”
“Well, I hope so, at least. He described himself to me one time. Real creepy stuff.”
“Like what?”
“Well, he was a demon. First of all,” he chuckled at this. He was nervous at first, then the seriousness caught his voice. “He was a demon, and he told me that the  most relatable thing he could call himself, the thing I would most understand, was the shape of a dog. Except instead of your typical ‘dog-shaped’ head, he said it resembled a mask. Like a large, porcelain, V-shaped mask. Mostly blank, besides large black eyes.”

I think of my mother sitting at a computer desk in the kitchen, thinking she saw a Jack Russell Terrier move past her feet.

“Weird, man,” I reply, offering nothing else.
“Yeah…” he cleared his throat. “What did you think about when he asked about mom and dad?”
“I,” I thought for a moment. “I didn’t.”
“Good,” Adam nodded. “He would have done something vengeful.”

I did not know what he meant, but I did not want to pry. I was happy enough that we covered this topic without a breakdown of tears. We proceeded to watch some mindless programming for a few hours and he went to bed, happy.

Later that night, or rather, early that morning, I received a call from the police department informing me that my parents had died in a car accident on I-95. I did not tell Adam until later that day. He went to school, like any other day, and spent six or seven hours in ignorance. He went to his part time job at the grocery store and worked, happily and stupidly, like any other day. I had to tell him when he got home. Our uncle and grandparents were there. It was inevitable. It was not my choice. He had to know. Were it up to me, I would have kept him, to this day, ignorant of the fact that our parents died, one with the melted and molten iron and steel that cocooned their bodies. Their carcasses were inseparable from the frame of the vehicle that carried us to however many family vacations. The vessel that brought us to Disney World was now their tomb; the vehicle that brought us to the beach was now the same chemical composite as our parents. Were it up to me, I would have prolonged his revelation with bullshit in the vein of, “oh, they are traveling in Europe,” or, “they continued their weekend trip and their flights are delayed!” Bullshit. Ignorant bullshit that keeps the emotional mind at bay.

We mourned. The community supported us. I was on the verge of suicide for months. The thought of my brother being alone kept me going. Our uncle was our guardian for a while, although officially, per the government’s papers, our grandparents were our guarantors. I grew older, completed college, and watched my brother finish high school. The years that followed were uneventful. Adam got a community service commendation; I managed to break from alcoholism. I got a job in mid-management at the state health department; Adam earned an internship at the police department. We were the most typical fucked up brothers you could fine. That was until our uncle became sick.

Yes, I know what you’re thinking: oh, a family member was diagnosed with something malignant, aren’t you a special snowflake. Well, you can go fuck yourself. Uncle Jack is in hospice as we speak. I already told you this. Uncle Jack is in hospice and the sirens have been blaring all day. From all around our sleepy town in the middle of nowhere, crisscrossed by highways and interstates and roads that lead everywhere but here, the sirens have been blaring. Fire trucks and police officers from towns that never knew our name are here, portioning off an exit on the highroad.

Uncle Jack takes my hand. He looks me in the eye. The morphine is already terribly strong and it is getting stronger by the day. At this point, it is not to relieve his pain. It is simply a race against nature to cease his organ’s function. It is no longer palliative, but a challenge to god. Earlier this morning, he talked about cats I don’t own and family members that never existed, such as a sister who was “bringing him water” all day. His delusions were terrifying and pathetic. I could no longer bear to see such a loved person dealing with so much bodily failure and ultimately, pain.

Staring me in the face, he said, “Son, I appreciate everything you’ve done… but please, get your dog out of here.” At this, I was confused. I knew it was another symptom of the morphine, but I wanted to help him, however I could.

“Uncle Jack, we don’t have a dog. You know that,” I held back tears.
“Stop. Just close the door. Stop him from staring at me. Stupid… fucking… dog,” he choked.

I rose and closed the door. I could tell the end was coming. But it is never easy. It is never immediate. It is always a matter of hours, days, weeks. Sometimes, months. The sirens outside grew louder. On a day like today, no solace was spared. No grieving, nothing. Your problem was just another piece of rubbish in the mosaic that society is composed of. Little did I know that the sirens were clearing and helping sort out a pile up that was on the same interstate that killed my parents. Little did I know that my brother was driving home from classes this afternoon to help me take care of Uncle Jack. Little did I know that his sedan may have been involved.

“Son,” Uncle Jack cried. “You’ve always been as good as any child of my own that I could have prayed for. Your parents loved you. I loved you. And I could never have asked for anyone better to see me out.”
I will admit to having cried at this display.
“But please, close that damned door, that fucking dog…”
I turned to see the closed door and dropped my eyes to the floor. Poor, poor drug-induced illusions.
But, of course, he continues.

“He keeps asking me, John. He keeps asking, who do I love more, ‘Adam or John?’ Get that little bastard out of here.”

I’ll have periods of time where I’m just sad, and periods of time where I’m just numb, and periods of time where I’ll ignore the outside world and all my responsibilities and I won’t get out of bed for a week. Right now I’m in one of those really low periods where I can’t make myself do anything. The semester has just begun and already I’m missing my classes, not doing the assignments, calling in sick at my internship. All because I can’t make myself just get out of bed and go to class, or just turn my brain on and do my work. 

The past couple weeks, I can’t stop thinking about suicide. I used to think about it on occasion, but now I think about it for hours and hours every day, all through the day. I think about the different ways I could do it. I fantasize about getting hit by a bus, or having some stray bullet fly through my window straight into my head, or some other freak accident that'll do the job for me. It isn’t that I desire death itself, I just am tired of living. I don’t enjoy life. I don’t enjoy anything about living. Living hurts and I am not getting any happiness from it. The only reason I am still here is because I think about my family, and I don’t want to hurt them. Really though, they don’t need me. If I died, it would hurt them initially, but they’d heal with time. I’m a minor part in their lives. My dad has a wife and a young child. My mother just recently got remarried as well. My brother is married now and is in the stages of creating this whole new life with his new wife and new job and new home. They all have their own immediate families that I’m not a part of. 
 
The thing that really makes me feel like a worthless piece of shit is that fact that I SHOULD be happy. I have no right to hate life as much as I do. If I had the motivation to, I could excel in school and start up a successful career and have a good life. I don’t have any friends, but I do have a boyfriend that loves me. I have enough money for comfortable food and rent. I don’t have any huge life obstacles, any terminal illness, any major life traumas. I feel like a spoiled brat little shit because objectively, I have a good life. I have a good life, but I don’t care, because I don’t want it. I should be happy with life, but I’m not, and I can’t even pinpoint why. I feel so empty and hollow. All I want to do is find a nice dark hole where no one can find me and curl up and sleep for the rest of my life. 

I can’t keep living the way I’m living. I’m going to fail college and be unemployed and be wasting away in some gutter somewhere, because I won’t have the motivation to get myself out. I’ll just end up even more miserable than I already am. 

Living and feeling the way I am, it’s like I’m dying slowly. I don’t want to die slowly, I want to be at peace and not have to deal with the burden of living.

17m4s2,33,2013-01-31,A College Student's Guide to Making His Money Work for Him: Revised Edition. More Advice Needed!,WoodChopper,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/17m4s2/a_college_students_guide_to_making_his_money_work/,"Hello r/financialindependence! I'm not sure if you remember me, but I posted here a few weeks ago about my money-saving strategies and since then I have read y'all's responses and revised my plan! I really appreciate all the original advice! If you didn't catch the original post, here is my updated version that I revised with your critiques!. Background: I am a 20 year old college student with two jobs, one that pays from my on-campus housing and meals, and the other that I am using for strictly saving the money that I earn from it. From this job, I earn about $100 bucks a week, which is pretty modest, but I really want to save up to 90% of the money that I make. All my life I have been educated by my father about personal finance, whether from being forced to listen to Clark Howard as a young kid, or him showing me how to open my own bank account and credit card. I am completely debt free. I have absolutely no debt. Not a dime. My college tuition is paid for by scholarships, and my housing and meals are paid for with my Department of Housing job as a Resident Assistant. I have no credit card debt and only primarily use it for gas, snacks, or the occasional night out. So all my debt is already paid down. I'm pretty sure I'll graduate with zero debt. I also have had a credit card for about 3.5 years and use it for all of my general expenses (snacks, restaurants, gas, and nights out). I've never missed a payment and have zero debt on it. I checked my credit score for the first time a few weeks ago and its a 724. Which, for a 20 year old, I feel is pretty solid? Now that I'm finally into some extra money, I want to make my money work for me, rather than just let it sit in a low-interest savings account. So I kind of made up a game plan of what I want to do and when I want to do it. I am just asking for advice on whether these are good ideas, or if there are other options that might help me better!

So here is my plan:

* From my current job and the money that I already have saved, I know that I will have at least $1500 saved up by May. I plan on putting all of this money into a high interest savings account (with a rate of about 1%(Ally Bank), as opposed the the .15% that I am currently making). My purpose for this is to have a good chunk of virtually no-risk liquid cash that I can use for general spending purchases and to serve as my general savings account.

* Luckily, I just found out I landed an internship this summer and I will make about $8500 over the course of 10 weeks, in addition to my other $100 dollar a week job. I want to put at least $5000 of this money into a Roth IRA, which would double as an emergency fund. Yes, taking money out of an IRA seems like a big no-no, but it is actually a very viable emergency fund option.

* And this next step is one that I feel like you guys helped me with the most on my last post. I want to spend a little bit of money on myself as a reward. I have always been an extremely frugal person, but I feel like I need a little reward for all of my hard work. I am looking into buying a used Kawasaki KLR 650, which will run me about $3000. I've never owned my own vehicle, so I'd love to use this reward as a step toward financial independence from my parents.

Okay, Reddit! That's my plan, what to y'all think. Honestly, I am open to absolutely anything. I feel like some more money could go into long term stocks, instead of some other areas that I listed, but I'd just like to here from some more experienced people! I know I'm not making that much money, and after all this work, I may not have a large return, but I just want a game plan that I can test out before I graduate! I'm still young, so I'd rather make all my mistakes now!"
17m02v,1,2013-01-30,[critique] I need some quick advice! Grad. statement of purpose,[deleted],writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/17m02v/critique_i_need_some_quick_advice_grad_statement/,"Hello all! Feeling in a rut right now. I have read this too many times. It is a Frankenstein of an essay and it does not flow. It's for admission to graduate school in audiology (hearing science) Any advice or corrections welcome!!

    I want to pursue an AuD at The University of X because I know that this program will 
    sculpt me into a skilled clinician, able to deliver superior hearing health care. I believe 
    my academic background has prepared me for this demanding graduate program.

    I completed my undergraduate degree in three years because I earned college credits in high 
    school and attended summer school. My undergraduate coursework included Hearing Science, 
    Clinical Audiology, Aural Rehabilitation, and Child Language Acquisition. I majored in Communication 
    Sciences and Disorders in order to work with individuals with hearing impairment. During my last 
    year as an undergraduate, I chose to undertake a pre-graduate school internship. The objective of 
    the internship was to allow undergraduates a chance to explore the features of graduate study. 
    I began observing clinical practice at the X Speech and Hearing Center. I attended clinical staffing 
    every week to discuss cases with graduate students. I also attended graduate courses weekly, gaining 
    a feel for the classroom atmosphere. I left the internship with real-world knowledge that I had not 
    acquired in a classroom.

    Since graduation, I have completed thirteen hours toward an AuD at an out of state graduate 
    program. I joined the Student Academy of Audiology and became active in my local chapter. I most 
    recently volunteered to conduct hearing screenings at a health fair. The most rewarding experience I had 
    in the program was working as a graduate clinician in the speech and hearing center. Even though clinic 
    came at 8 am on Mondays, I was wearing a smile and ready to work. I was genuinely excited to put 
    to use everything I had been learning. Every week I performed comprehensive audiologic evaluations 
    on patients ranging in age from 2 to 74 years. I performed otoscopy, tympanometry, speech audiometry, 
    and pure-tone audiometry. I gained experience measuring ABRs and OAEs. I also independently completed 
    an audiological evaluation for CAPD. I was responsible for writing formal case reports as well as a 
    reflective journal of my experiences. After working as a graduate clinician, I am eager to do it again.

    While working in the clinic weekly, I began to notice how difficult it is to put someone's hearing loss into 
    words. It is difficult with a background in the field to explain the results in the simplest way possible. I have
    decided to base my Capstone research project around the audiologists' role in counseling. I think how we
    present the information to the patient greatly affects their perception of their own hearing loss. We are telling
    them so much more than the fact that they have a hearing loss. How will they explain this to their friends
    and family? It's not possible to remember everything the audiologist said. When I go home and look at my 
    audiogram, what do I really see? I am interested in researching different counseling techniques and case report
    formats and how they convey the information to the patient. The patient needs to receive in writing a more
    basic description of their hearing loss, as opposed to an audiogram and a formal report. I would like to
    research implementing more user-friendly counseling and just how effective our current counseling methods
    are.

    After earning an AuD, I will focus on a career as a clinical audiologist. Since January I have been 
    assisting an audiologist in her private practice. I am learning first-hand everything that goes along with 
    running a practice and I think it is something I may be interested in someday. The audiologist primarily 
    sees elderly patients in her clinic and I enjoy working with that population. I would like to ensure that
    their quality of life and independence are not compromised. I understand how hearing impairment can 
    adversely affect quality of life. 

    I also understand that working in this field requires more than a desire to help others. A career in audiology
    demands determination and commitment. I believe I have acquired these characteristics through my 
    academic and extracurricular experiences. I feel prepared for graduate study, and I look forward to 
    completing an AuD at The University of X as an exciting, essential step in my career.

17ls9u,1,2013-01-30,Quarter-life Crisis.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/17ls9u/quarterlife_crisis/,"25F fighting with parents.

About me:

I'm 25.  I have a BA in English.  I'm pursuing a BS in Comp Sci.  I have a part time retail position and another part time internship in public relations.  I just moved to another state last year with my ex boyfriend.  We love one another dearly, but things just aren't working out and we have decided to split up.  

My mother, upon learning of the split, asked me what my plans are.  I told her I'm going to move to a nearby town and get settled down before next semester.  She says I should just move back to her house.  This is obviously not an option, but for some reason she seems to think it is (I told her, the last time I was with her, that if we didn't go to family counseling she would lose me… we never went.  my relationship with my parents is **not** good.).  She called me a stubborn child and said for me to stop making my life more difficult.  I may not have financial stability but I sure as hell am no child.  I told her as much (in a nicer way) and a long argument commenced.  

Today, I get a text from my step-father (whom I NEVER hear from) saying that he doesn't know if my mom told me yet but I need to start paying my car insurance bill (80/month) they have enough bills of their own.  He wants to see me become an independent woman like my mom was when she was my age (mind you she had a child at 22 and settled for a life she is not happy with now) and that i need to stop relying on men.  My mom misses the froggy legged little girl I used to be yadda yadda.  These people (my parents) are obviously incapable of accepting that I am no longer 5.  I told him I will pay the bill and not to text me anymore.  This is not about the money, it's about respect.

I did not move with my ex for his SUPPORT.  in fact, he flipped out when he heard what my father said because he knows damn well that I will do whatever it takes to take care of my responsibilities.  My father, btw, moved in with my mom when he was about 20 and if it wasn't for her supporting him for a while he wouldn't have gotten on his own two feet… so I'm not sure who he thinks he is preaching to me.  My mother was the one who told me she would take care of the bill 'til I got settled (because she knew I was in the process of moving etc).  My parents are in no way financially constricted.  My dad plays tons of golf, my brother gets tons of video games, and my mom gets her hair and nails done frequently.

I moved out when I was 19.  The guy I moved with turned out to be abusive and I bounced around for a bit (in terms of living arrangements because my family had moved away and I had to finish school).  When I was 24 I moved back in with my mom to help her pay bills and take care of my brother because she and my step father were splitting up.  At 25 they're back together and I moved back out.  I paid my own college tuition, never asked them for a fucking penny, and everything I own I have achieved **on my own**.

I'm beyond angry.  I'm not sure what to do anymore.  I don't want anything to do with my parents, but my little brother still lives with them and we are **very** close.  I can't be around them, I can't be in contact with them.  I was supposed to visit them for valentines day and now I'm screwed cause I bought the ticket to see them but I sure as hell am not going to spend any time around them.

I am struggling financially, but like I said, I will do whatever it takes to keep myself afloat.  I'm intelligent and able.  Thank you for reading.

tldr - parents keep treating/viewing me like a child because I'm not making enough to support myself yet.  money != adulthood.  I have two jobs and I'm on my second degree.  They never went to college so all they know of is getting some mediocre job and grinding at it for years and years to make a decent income.  I'm at my wits end with the both of them and I'd cut them out of my life entirely if it wasn't for my little brother who still lives with them."
