Details inside.",[deleted],askscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/mwilf/exactly_how_bad_is_adderall_should_i_be_using_it/,"**Background:** When I was younger I was diagnosed with mild ADHD. I was an absolutely obnoxious little kid and my parents are very proud the way I have mellowed out and grown up. They have said ""We honestly thought that you would be in prison at this age.""

They had the option to put me on meds, which would have made their life much easier. They gave them to me ONCE, I said I didn't like how it made me feel, and they never gave it to me again.

To deal with my obnoxiousness, they really just got lenient with raising me. Kind of ""Let him do what he wants, he'll wear himself out"" strategy. I was babied in order to keep me in line and didn't learn much self discipline.

By high school I had mellowed out. I obeyed my parents and have yet to ever be in trouble woth the law. My irresponsibility continued and I just cruised through high school with little motivation. Without trying, I averaged a 3.2 gpa. I could just never get myself to focus for longer than 30min at a time.

**Now:** I am now a Senior Mechanical Engineering student and have a 2.8 gpa. For three years I struggled with ""should I take medecine for ADHD."" I knew that all it entailed was going to a doctor and asking for it. There was no real diagnosis process. Did I really need it? Could I not focus just because I was lazy? Am I lazy and unmotivated because of my (possibly self-percieved) lack of self discipline and irresponsibility? And if it was because of never learning those traits, did it really matter if that was what was holding me back and adderall would improve it?

After struggling with this and spending hours upon hours on engineering assignments staring blankly at the page, I decided I would try it. It has been two months since I've been taking adderall. All I take is 10mg twice a day. In two months, I have pursued  college recruiters and gotten three interviews and been offered all three jobs. I chose my perfect internship from the three. I'm no longer sleepy all day like I used to be, but instead I have a steady flow if energy from 7am until 8pm. My intelligence is starting to show, motivating me to work harder. I have been able to focus longer on assignments and have solved problems that I never knew I was able to solve. I am more social, and am contacting family members much more frequently.

**Question:** In the back of my mind, I feel like this is wrong. Do I really need it? It IS a drug, but if it is improving my life, is it really that bad? Is it possible that, if I really just hadn't learned self discipline / responsibility in my developmental years, that adderall could justifiably compensate for that until it has actually enabled me to learn those life skills?

Help would be great, Reddit. The anonymity of the website and supportive community allows people to get advice on such things. 

**tl;dr;** Was an obnoxious child. I feel because of this I may not have developed  crucial self discipline / responsibility skills. Parents accepted my declination to adhd medication when diagnosed. Senior in college, decided to get adderall perscribed. (10mg twice a day). Life seems to have greatly improved in the two months but, do I really need it?"

I recently had a paper accepted by a conference and was invited to present. Unfortunately, I think attending the conference will be prohibitively expensive once travel, lodging, and registration are summed up. I graduated a few months ago, so I'm no longer officially associated with a department that could pay for these expenses, and for the time being I'm a part time intern who is paid enough to cover food and rent but not enough to attend conferences out of pocket.

I've heard rumors that there are grants available from various organizations for the purpose of covering conference costs, but I don't know where to look to find these grants. Does academic publishing know where I should look?

Edit: Quite a few people have asked for the same info, so I figured I'll put it up here. The paper was accepted by the Broadcast Education Association (BEA) [conference](http://www.beaweb.org/bea2011.html). The paper itself is about a bill introduced in the Senate regarding federal regulation of online consumer privacy, and in general I keep a foot in computing/IT and in science/technology policy.

The paper itself started as an assignment for a class I took in the last semester of my master's work. The professor for that class provided the feedback and assistance of a typical class paper, and was the person who suggested I submit the paper to this conference. However, this professor hasn't had the time to be a second author, so the paper has been submitted with myself as the solo author. And to add one final bit of important info, the class and professor for whom I wrote this paper are not from my home department while I was a masters student, though there is definitely overlap between the content of this paper and the focus of my home department.

Thanks to everybody who has responded! I'm getting a better sense of where I need to look for help."

Will any job accept me as a full time worker, even without a degree? I'm really just trying to get into the job market as quickly as possible. 


That being said, my real interest is cyber security. I've had two internships in IT, one working with helpdesk and one that was a little more broad but just working with server installation and helpdesk. 

Now I haven't had any formal teaching in anything like that (being a CS major) but I would really like my first job to have something to do with that. Should I use the fact that I will have basically half a semester free to try and get an internship of some type in that field? Do they even have internships having to deal with cyber security?

Will a CS degree help at all with getting that field, or are the two way different? Is there anything I should study up on before even considering finding a job or internship in the field?

Thanks for your time guys I really appreciate it."

It was my first one and I was quite surprised that I landed it, given my academic performance. I enjoyed working with the team, the other interns, and the recruiters there. I got a job offer and accepted it without pursuing other companies during the period leading up to when I accepted. The pay is really good but I feel like I wouldn't be interested in the work, compared to other companies. 

It's been weeks since I accepted it and I am having second thoughts. I regret that I hadn't reached out to other companies. But then again, I enjoyed everyone at the company I interned for. They gave me the opportunity to work for them when no other company accepted me. The only thing is that I feel like I would enjoy the problems that the other companies are facing.

Some of the other tech companies have reached out to me but I have told them I have commitments already. So what do I do? I want to know if I were to secretly interview with another company and land a position, how would that reflect on me? Would this ruin my image among recruiters in Silicon Valley? How much news is shared between recruiters among popular tech companies in the area? How much does loyalty matter in Silicon Valley, especially for new graduates who were to do something like this?"

- although without any formal training, i'm fairly computer literate and can program in various languages and contexts. Being a bit of a nerd I had that as a hobby during highschool years and took some small programming jobs during uni.
- while at uni I had a job at it's research management department, organizing and editing an internal magazine reporting about research projects and findings.

* my ideal workplace would be in the aero-space industry, ideally NASA or ESA or a company developing space-faring technology.
* I would like to move to Australia or the US after completing my degree (BEng or IEng depending on how well I do in the following years.)

with that in mind, 


* how likely is it that I will find a job in engineering after completing my degree? 
* what would I need to do to get a job in aero-space?
* is it ~~naive~~ overly optimistic for me to have this goal considering the current economic climate, and the budgets cuts for all space agencies?
* where should I look for a summer internship?
* should I get part-time employment or focus on getting better marks? which one is more important for a future employer?
* what would be the must have books for my course in your opinion?

n0bfm,2,2011-12-04,Need help with roommate problem,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/n0bfm/need_help_with_roommate_problem/,"Background story between myself and my roommate.  I just secured a position of unpaid full year internship and was looking for a place to live near my workplace.  I searched through Craigslist for cheap rental option.  I came across one ad and seems legit.  I have never met him in person and had to rely on emails to get to know each other.  I drove to see the apartment and met my landlord who was very nice to open the door for me to check it out before I sign the lease.  Everything seems to be good.  He sounds pretty cool and nice and the apartment is very nice for a very cheap rent.  He's a graduate student for a college near our apartment.

Since we have lived with each other, I have never had a problem with him and we seemed to live with harmony though we never tried to forage a personal relationship as a roommate. We were just there as roommate, nothing more, nothing less.  The only place that we share is the living room and kitchen as well as laundry room.  Knowing that the three areas are the one that we have to share, I knew that I would need to clean after I used the stuff whether if it's mine or his stuff.  Even if I left the dishes or kitchen items on the sink, I always make sure to clean it at either the same day or the day after.

He brought in slow cooker and George Foreman grill for us to use in the kitchen.  I have used it several time with no complaint from him.  A couple of weeks ago, I've made soup with the slow cooker right before Thanksgiving Break.  I was going to clean it up but my friends(or interns) dragged me to go out the night before I had to fly back home for Thanksgiving.  I brought the pot and filled it with water so it would be easy for me to clean up.  I figured that I would be home before him since I have an early flight back home on Saturday.  I came home only to see the pot are cleaned.  My roommate was kind of harsh with the fact that I left it uncleaned and it smelled so he had to clean.  I apologized to him and said I had intended to wash the pot but my friend came by and dragged me to go out to the bar.  I simply didn't have enough time to clean it up since I had an early morning flight with a bad hangover.

That brings it to last night. I worked all day last night and was tired and hungry.  I made grilled chicken, using the George Foreman grill.  After eating dinner, I put dishes away and simply put wet paper towel over the grill to make it easier for me to clean.  I had intended to clean it up later that night.  I was in my room, sleeping on my own bed.  My roommate woke me up with a text saying ""I came home and noticed that the grill was not clean.  I must re-inteirate(sp?) that you do not use my things.""  I replied back, ""I'm sorry but I worked all day today and was tired.  I meant to clean it up tonight"".  He said ""Please do not my things.  You have lost the right to use it"".  I woke up this morning only to see the slow cooker and George Foreman grill not at the kitchen.  He took it to his room.  The funny thing is he always emphasizes cleaning after yourself, but he would always forget to his clothes in washer/dryer, and leave dishes at the sink for a long period of time.  He did it with any warning of some sort.  That left me pissed and I knew that by coming to him with any sort of emotion would not yield a positive result.

I always get along with pretty much everybody and never had anger problem.  Even in college, I have never had a problem with roommates.  This is the first time that I have a problem with a roommate and am angry at him for his action. 

So reddit, how do I resolve the problem in a calm, peaceful manner.

**TL;DR: Lived with a roommate that I met through Craigslist.  Had no problem with him.  Used George Foreman grill and forgot to clean it after myself after working all day.  He said I lost the rights to use his things and took it away from me.**"

Dear Dr. Tyson,

Because of the Ask Me Anything you recently conducted through Reddit, I know you have some familiarity with the community there. Currently, the atheism board is engaged in a full-throttle fundraiser for the extraordinarily worthy cause Doctors Without Borders. So far, we have raised over $100,000, and we're hoping to get far more by the end-of-the-year-deadline! I'm sure you are aware that you are a hero to the r/atheism community, and that there are countless posts praising your devotion to science and your excellent track record as a brilliant, well-spoken spokesperson for science.

Keeping this in mind, I was hoping you would consider lending a hand to the fundraiser. If you were to go to r/atheism and create a post promising some sort of special distinction (Twitter call-out, ten-second personalized video response, etc.) to anyone who donates a certain amount (say $100 or above), I think the response would be overwhelming, and would easily send the fundraiser over the $200K hurdle. I know you are a very, very busy man, but if this is something you (perhaps with the aid of one of your obliging interns/ site admins) could take the time to do, it would be of immense benefit to the charity drive.

Respectfully yours,
[PipPipCheerio's real name]

If we could get him on board, I'm sure we could clear $200K by the end of the year easily. I'm betting items in his email inbox can easily be overlooked due to sheer volume, so email him/ tweet him yourself too if you're interested in seeing this happen!"

The counselor and I continue to meet regularly throughout my first year, and by June, I've selected a major. Over the next three years, I develop a real passion for what I'm studying. I meet with professors, read the latest journals, network, establish a better sense of my career path. By graduation day, I'm a top student again, as expected, and I have a summer internship lined up. Life is wonderful. Yay me.

That's when the VCR tape starts melting and burning at the same time. This is possible, mainly because video cassettes are a composite technology with a few different materials. Trust me, this can happen.

Anyway, we're getting sidetracked here, because the point is, my fantasy hits a wall when I compare it with the reality of my real first day of college. My parents dropped me off, helped me move into my new room, lingered nervously for a few hours, and finally, thankfully, left. I was living on my own independent for the first time. Able to make my own choices, without structure or supervision. Free at last!

College was a disaster. I had no sense of myself; no clue what I was here on Earth to do. I studied a wide range of classes, based mostly on which ones allowed me to maintain a T Th 1PM-5PM schedule. Occasionally, I was grudgingly forced to embrace a Friday morning class. And believe me, I resented it.

It didn't matter, though, because I rarely went to class anyway. I was brutally depressed. I had no purpose in living, and it was obvious now. Nothing I was doing was intentional anymore - I was only reacting to circumstance and plodding through my day without a motive force. I barely graduated at all, and when I did, I searched high and low for a job that I thought would make me money. It didn't.

It has been eight and a half years since I finished school. I have a relatively good job as an analyst at a large company. I am well respected in the context of what I do. Not simply a subject matter expert on particular things, I am seen as a generally ""smart"" person who is capable of solving problems, executing, and delivering on objectives. I am paid very well - at least by general standards - and my job security, while it can never be iron-clad in this environment of the constantly whirling lay-off wood chipper, is pretty solid.

Did I mention that I hate my life? That I am completely miserable? Well, that's the point of this post, so it would behoove me to do so.

I hate my life. I am completely miserable.

I always believed I was destined for great things, and I still believe that in a dark corner of my soul that rarely sees light and seldom gets fed or nourished. I want to embrace the possibilities of life and take actions I can be proud of. One of the areas I've been working on is trying to create a vision of what I'd like my life to look like - and one important element is my career.

What I am asking for, in this thread, is for guidance on how I can go about brainstorming, exploring, evaluating, and ultimately, narrowing down some career options that would meet the following objectives:

- Opportunity for creativity to shine
- The feeling of flow - being so immersed in something I excel at, to the extent that hours pass in the grasp of optimal creativity and productivity
- Being admired or honored for my accomplishments
- A career where pure, raw intelligence is a critical asset
- The chance for both competition and collaboration

Skills That I Bring:

- Pure, Raw Intelligence
- Ability to appreciate the big picture and the detail level simultaneously; depth of field/scope
- Extremely effective communication skills, particularly in writing
- Mastery of tone; the ability to carefully attend to the subtleties involved in dealing with people at different levels
- Analytical ability - someone who identifies key questions, understands how to investigate them, and delivers/messages useful results
- Modesty (just kidding - put that in for a laugh)

The ideal result for me, through this thread, would be to connect with someone who has professional experience in facilitating these kinds of dialogues. Helping someone identify their most important objectives, greatest assets, and brainstorm all of the possibilities that might appeal to them.

For example: assume we discussed law. I'd want to consider all aspects of the pathway to a legal career. My likelihood of being accepted to a good law school. The value of one tier of law school versus another. What kind of job prospects would exist upon graduating? Which field of law would be the most appealing and/or accessible and why? What steps would I need to take to get myself where I want to be in that career?

So, it involves consideration of all of the important gauges; satisfaction, opportunity, income, cost, chance of success. I need to think through these things with someone who is a subject matter expert in this area. I need someone to help me create a framework for success in determining direction in my career.

Can you help?

(tl;dr - I need someone to help me choose a career)

Nothing is going as planned, or how I thought it would at an earlier age. Not one thing, I can't think of one thing that has materialized.
  
College, dear god. I left an engineering program...during my 3rd year. Can you imagine how LARGE of a loser I am? How many third years drop out?!
  
Now I am going to a less prestigious state school. But I thought I would leave those problems at the other school, but they've followed me. I try talking to everyone, but still, no friends. I haven't had friends since high school, and the ones I had have moved on. I really feel it's only a matter of time before I won't be able to go on and drop out of even this school.
  
Something is wrong with me. I was turned down for EVERY job I applied for. From engineering internships to grocery stores. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?!
  
I constantly fantasize about getting in a van and just driving away. I don't know where, maybe Oregon. But I am very afraid this is how people become homeless and eventually die. I don't I'm that different from homeless people though. We're both ghosts. I feel so cold and invisible.

I haven't ever visited, but from what I've heard it sounds like the best place for me. I have an introverted personality (INTJ according to Carl Jung), which I think is similar to most Swedes (from what I've heard). I am willing to work almost anywhere to secure my stay in Sweden. What I've gathered is to become a citizen I need to be 18 or older, be able to prove my identity, have a permanent residence permit, have lived there for 5 years, and conduct myself well while I am there. The only thing I have a problem with is the permanent residence permit. My educational background is rather unimpressive; I left High school, currently getting my GED, but I don't expect to land an extremely well paid job, merely enough to sustain myself where I live (probably close to work, outside of a city). I don't have much work experience, but I am currently an intern at a computer repair shop. I am quite proficient in repairing computers, so I may want to pursue a job in that field. Additionally I am currently studying Swedish, so I should be somewhat skilled by the time I leave. What are the steps I should/can take to help me with this endeavor?

What's the point in starving myself if I'm going to make my body look like shit with cuts? I like them though. My favorite is from when I took a lot of cocaine. I don't really remember it well. I did it because I couldn't feel anything. That area still feels ""off"" and it's been a couple years now. I'm so attached and fond of all of my scars. I carved a scull and crossbones sort of lightly a while back. It' pretty faded now, I didn't go too deep because i wanted to get the contours right. i am poison. is this a juvenile idea? I don't like when people cut in straight lines. I started playing tic tac toe.

But i threw everything away. The doodles on my thigh feel nice and are entertaining, but they aren't enough anymore. I'm scared because the only satisfying place to cut seems to be my wrist. And this is not good because I don't think I will commit suicide, when I do, by cutting. And I don't want to make my family sad before they have to be. I don't want anyone to see.

Maybe by not cutting on my wrists, I'm still keeping hope for my future. Is that strange? I want to be a doctor. I know I'm fucked up but I have a solid gpa and go to a really good school. i got accepted to a highly competitive internship for next semester and i have an interview for another tomorrow.

what the point anymore i mean im not going to even be alive much longer. i hate this. i fucking know i fucking know that i know. i cannot fucking think. i fucking know that on some level i want this and i want to be ok. that's why i havent fucking done it yet. that's why i cant fucking take myself fucking seriously. i shouldnt have listened to aaron. i should have kept my razors. i took the last of my ""emergent"" hydrocodone and the only beer i had.

dont take hydrocodone without at least one beer! total waste. 

i want to live but i cant anymore. 

things that might justify me killing myself. 
1. none of these reasons will be justification for me leaving my family but here goes. 
2. i guess one wasnt a point. and neither is this. 
3. i was raped last summer and havent had sex sober even since even though i had a boyfriend for 6 months
4. i've broken every person ive ever been with. a book by a woman named marya put it nicely and i'm afraid i cant describe it as poetically. breaking people just to break them. just because you can. i cheat on everyone.
5. i think im gay but i give really good head. 
6. like really good.
7. im really high
8. i miss cocaine. so badly. every day. every fucking single fucking day. 
9. daddy hit me
10 then he touched me
11. then he hit mommy
12 every day
13 my family expects too much of me blahblabhalbhabhlabh first world problems
14. i guess none of my reasons are good enough. 
15 oh yeah i think i sort of accidentally an eating disorder over the past 3 years. 
16. and might have bdd
17 and i have no friends and ive never had any friends. and whenevr i have friends  they all end up hating me even though i dont do anything 
18 you know when you're under water for too long? that feeling? that suffocating fullness that fills your body before you vomit the water back up? living is drowning me

mz90d,1,2011-12-03,I'm a terrible person.,fuctupkid,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/mz90d/im_a_terrible_person/,"I don't really care if anyone even sees this but I wanted to put my feelings to text and throw it to the wind. 

It all started 2 years ago when I was at a party with a bunch of friends. One of them was my best friend I've known since 5th grade, his roommate was a girl. She was beautiful to me, her face lit up the room. We danced around each other for a few weeks. I had recently gotten burned by a girl and had just really gotten over it, when I started sleeping with my friend's roommate, just sleeping so far. She was a virgin, I'm a whore. She asked me to take her virginity, and I didn't even blink. We started having sex, only really at the parties at her house. I was still not willing to trust, she was too new to relationships. I ended up moving home for a few months and not seeing her for that time. I had heard that she was mad about it, but I drowned myself in various forms of distraction from life. 

I carried on my life, and I thought she had carried on with hers, but as it turns out she was just waiting for me to come back. And I did. I could never say no to her, anything she wanted was hers, from my body, my things, my heart. About a year and a half ago, 6 months after we started our little affair, she finally gave me an ultimatum: We started dating, or we stopped having sex. 

I decided then and there to date her, I feel like I was already in love with her at that point. It took me longer to say it to her, and to really realize that I did fall in love with this girl.

Fast forward a year. We are living on our own in our nice apartment, I had a good job, she was interning in the field she loved, we were in love and nothing could stop us. 

The day it all changed was a Friday, right around noon. I got fired from my nice cushy job. Not to get into too many details, I hated the place, the people, the work, and I probably let it show too much, I had stayed only because they paid so well, but it leaked through. I let her down was my first thought. She had always put a lot of pressure on me to succeed. Partially because I'm very capable but lazy as hell, partially because we had already started discussing the rest of our lives together. 

That was the day everything went to shit. As closely as I can pinpoint it. She was very disappointed in me. It took a while but she began resenting me for it. Even now I'm still unemployed. 

I started seeing her pushing me to succeed as her trying to change me. I started seeing her neediness as clingy, dependence, weakness. I began pulling away. My feeling changed. But I didn't say anything. I would drop hints, but never outright say it. Even now I'm not sure how much was cowardice or hope that it was just a rough patch. 

We got by for awhile with just her working as an intern by me working odd jobs, ebaying stuff, selling drugs. It was stressful and probably didn't help.

We're almost to the end of the story, but it gets significantly worse. 

I became friends with this couple. Me and the girl would hang out a lot as our significant others had jobs and we didn't. I felt a tension between me and her, but brushed it off as me being weird, she had a boyfriend, me a girlfriend, her for 3 years, me for a year and change. 

Sept 29th, me and this girl were sitting on a couch watching TV, when she leaned her head against my shoulder. My heart started trying to beat out of my chest. She heard it, and asked me why my heart was beating so fast, with what I now know was anticipation. I sputtered something about having a fast heart beat for a moment, but we locked eyes, and our faces leaned in and we kissed, ""that's why."" was all I could say. As they say from there one thing led to another.

So we cheated on our significant others. It became addictive. We snuck around and lied and were bad, but it felt so good. I think we both considered only once actually coming clean, it was quickly discarded for being hard and scary. I could feel myself slipping further away from my girlfriend and developing feelings for this new girl.

My girlfriend could tell something was up. She started looking at my text messages, reading my facebook chats, throwing fits when I would go out. Instead of making me regret my actions it just made me angry.

Yesterday, my girlfriend found a facebook chat between me and the new girl. Of course I should have deleted it, but I felt safe with having my computer off and logged out of facebook. 

So I went home and told her everything. I answered all her questions with the truth. I told her all the things I didn't say before, and she told me all the things she had been holding back. 

She went home to her parents for the weekend.

I can honestly say that I have never felt this much pain and confusion. I still love her. I broke her heart. She's my best friend. I disrespected and hurt her. I love this other girl. I feel empty inside. I've cried more in the last 24 hours than I have in my whole life. I sobbed like I haven't since I was a child. I haven't been able to eat anything since yesterday morning. I got super wasted last night and talked to my friend who was my girlfriends roommate. I'm lost.

TL;DR: Read the title."

In my spare time however, I would like to develop some apps and release them on the market. You know, to gain more knowledge and to build up a nice portfolio for my future career.

But quite frankly, I don't know what to make. I seriously do not know what kind of app I want to make. It seems like everything is already made. I actually created a tablet app a few days ago for a newspaper  I like to read on my morning commute, since their mobile website was horrible to navigate on my tablet, but they are releasing an app of their own next week. After contacting them asking if I could release my app (you know, copyright and all that, it never hurts to ask) they nicely but firmly asked me not to release it.

Now I'm looking for something new to make. But I'm out of ideas. So, where do you guys get the inspiration for your apps? Enlighten me."

I do technical sales (pre-sales, kind of consulting + commission if they buy) and will make $125k in 2011. I have excellent ratings, network, visibility inside the company and I'm on a career path to become a manager. 

One of my mentors, a very high up smart executive, left the company a few years ago to create a startup which does specialized cloud computing work. He wants me to join as employee #19. I would be titled as the technical sales manager and would have two employees report to me. Both of the employees are top notch seasoned sellers with over 20 years industry experience each -- they could easily be my father so I believe the ""manager"" title is to be taken with a grain of salt, but an excellent opportunity and feather in my hat. I would have many new responsibilities, leadership experiences, and opportunities to wear many hats because, frankly, there's nobody else to do the work. 

The company is not profitable yet but has received another round of VC to last at least another year or two. All their employees that I have met have been top notch at what they do. Their cloud business model makes sense to me and they have a few notable very large customers as references. 

Their initial offer was $125k base salary (I should have never told them what I make) plus a realistic expectation of $10-$15k commission, with more possible. In addition, they're offering 30,000 shares of stock. Their stock is currently priced at $0.225 and the strike price is $0.25, so those shares are under water. My shares are vested incrementally over 2 years; 10k upon joining, 10k the next year, and another 10k the second year. Assuming the stock reaches the strike price! The benefits match my current employer.

I told them I was hoping for $150k base (thinking a 20% increase to justify the risk) and this was their first offer. Obviously, they're below but what strategy would you recommend to negotiate this higher? I don't want to give them any more numbers but at the same time, I won't consider a base of anything less than $140k. I like the company and, more importantly, the people enough to want to work there. At the same time, I'm worried about the risk. 

How would you play this?

n0eiw,2,2011-12-04,"Reddit, I need your help in determining if my internship is a scam or not",archenon,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/n0eiw/reddit_i_need_your_help_in_determining_if_my/,"Ok, so the internship in question is [Collegeworks Painting](http://www.collegeworks.com/). They came to my math 125 class a month or so back and asked us to fill out a little piece of paper with some information on it if we were interested. I filled it out, and didnt think much of it until weeks later, when I got a call from them asking if I was still interested. As I was looking into jobs at the time, I said yes, and a meeting was scheduled.


The first meeting was at a Tully's near campus, and it was basically an info session. It went alright, and the interviewer told me to expect a call later on in the evening, which I got. It was a kind of phone interview where they asked if i was positive about it and stuff, of which I said yes. They then scheduled me for a final meeting the week after, which was to be a formal business interview.


I went, and they told me I got a job, again asking me to affirm that I am 100% with them. Throughout this whole process, it seemed pretty official and I dont have much experience with the process anyways so I can't really judge for myself. 


However, the internship seemed too good to be true- I was told I'd make thousands and thousands of dollars, up to $20,000 during the job. I kind of wondered why it wasn't well known but chalked it up to being a new company. I talked to some friends about it and it was then that I started to hear some stuff about Collegeworks being a scam, with interns not being paid and stuff like that.


I went to the first orientation of the company today, and it seemed alright. I saw a few friends of mine from highschool there and we went to lunch- there we all found out that we'd heard from various sources bad stuff about Collegeworks. When I got home, I looked it up, and it seems Collegeworks has a pretty controversial reputation. I'd looked it up before I committed, but didn't do a very thorough job and chalked up the dissatisfaction of a few bad reviews to be just that- disgruntled employees and customers.


A more thorough research showed lots of bad reviews, by both past interns and customers. However there were also a good amount of good reviews. Since its the internet I can't be sure what to trust- the majority of the reviews might just be one or a few person making many posts to give a bad name to Collegeworks. 


The cmopany doesnt seem to be a scam in the sense of stealing money. It is legit enough, but it seems its the way it operates that is seen as a scam. Bad reviews tell of interns being lied to about profit- instead of tens thousands, some claimed to only make a few thousand working hours that would pay more even on a minimum wage job. Note that pay is based on both commission from locking down paint jobs as well as a base pay of minimum wage.


Reviews vary a lot so I'll leave it to the redditors to check- google ""Collegeworks Painting Scam"" or something like that will garner you a bunch of results. 

If anyone has any advice or anything on what to do please comment or pm me. Thanks reddit!"

n1w2h,7,2011-12-05,My parents found beer bottles in my room. Now they think I'm a delinquent and an alcoholic. What do I do?,chesterfoot,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/n1w2h/my_parents_found_beer_bottles_in_my_room_now_they/,"Here's the story: 

I am a 20 year old American female in my second year at college (in the southeast). I'm the oldest child and the only girl of 3 children (two younger brothers, 19 and 14). I am an English major, an A student, have been published in the New York Times, and have worked as an editing intern for several major publishing companies. I have glowing recommendation letters from professors and past employers. I have never been arrested, and I have had only one traffic ticket (for failing to turn my brights down within 1500 feet of an oncoming vehicle). I vacuum my room regularly, do laundry once a week, and call my parents every day. 

I do drink, moderately, being in college. My parents don't know this--or didn't, until this past weekend. They were going through my room and found some beer bottles I had stashed behind some books on my bookshelf (bad move, I realize, but I was home for the summer, took a few beers from the fridge to drink while I read a book, and didn't know how to throw them out without them realizing I'd taken them). Now they think I'm a deceptive alcoholic and am on my way to certain death. 

In high school I had some trouble with eating disorders and depression, but some medication helped tremendously, and now I'm an obviously fully functional and healthy person. My parents are flipping their shit. They've told me that they are going to make my Christmas break miserable, and I'm so scared to go home for Christmas in a week and a half that I am literally sick with dread. I spent all weekend crying and throwing up--because my dad told me that he should have given up on me a long time ago, as ""it's one thing after another with you"". 

What can I do to make them realize that this is insane? I am so tired of being the problem child, and I wish they could see that I am not as bad as they think. 

tl;dr: Parents found beer bottles and are freaking out, despite the fact that I am not that horrible. "

I actually have taken no computer classes so far; my first semester has just been liberal arts classes that I'd have to get out of the way eventually, save my Calculus 1 class.  
Anyways, I'm just wondering what advice you guys can give me. Classes not required for my major that would be a great idea to take regardless, etc.  
I'm not even sure what I want to do after college. I'd love to work with video games, and my lifelong dream has been to work for Valve software (I know, haha, fat chance). But I realize that those may not be very realistic. Any advice on certain types on internships I should look out for while in school? And what types of careers I should look out for?"
n3zgv,1,2011-12-07,"So, I have an Ethical, work-related question",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/n3zgv/so_i_have_an_ethical_workrelated_question/,"Ok, so here is the backgroud:  
 
I work in kind of rotating Internship program. I intern in the Fall and Winter, and others intern in the Spring and Summer. During your internship, you always have a chance of rehire if your current employer likes you enough.  
  
Because of the rotations, and the goal of the internship being to give you real-world experience, I help interview the next group of interns. I just got the list of interviewees and happen to know one of them from a past internship. I helped interview him, the company hired him.  
  
I was talking to one of my friends who worked with him after he got hired (I was gone when he started) and he said the dude was just horrible. He was very lazy, had an attitude and just recently got fired (part-time, after the standard internship) because he didnt show up for 4 weeks. (Don't worry, he is alive considering he just sent us his resume)  
  
So the question here is, do I talk him up after the interview and get him hired, or do I tell my boss the truth? If he gets the job and is just horrible, I would look like a saint thus severely improving my odds of being hired permanently.  
  
So Reddit, what should I do?"

Eventually I would like to start working on graphics demos in hopes of getting an internship for next summer."

I'm looking for something Machine Learning related - I'm taking a class on the subject and plan to take more, I've read a lot about the subject, and I'm hoping to do my undergrad thesis on something ML related. I've had Software Engineering internships, but nothing specifically ML-based.

My question is, will I be able to get a Machine Learning/Data Mining Job straight off my BS? Most of the jobs I see posted for such positions are for Masters/PhD people; while I expect to get a Masters at some point, I wasn't really counting on a PhD since I'm not looking to go into Academia. Will I absolutely need a Masters right off the bat? Will I need a PhD at all? Is there anything else I should be doing to improve my chances?"
n382u,8,2011-12-06,Just Another Random Dude,Dunnowhyimabadperson,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n382u/just_another_random_dude/,"Hey all, I doubt anyone will read this, as it's gonna be wall of text to the max. this is more of a confession/rant than anything else. It's not that important, nor is it anything new. There's some personal information here, but not enough for people who don't know me to find me. Also, not many people I know Reddit, and even fewer browse SW haha.

 I have an amazing life. I have a family who loves me, I was raised as a Christian (not as a religious person, but as a Christian. My family always taught me to basically imitate Christ and not buy into any organized religion bullshit. If I don't agree with the bible, my parents encouraged us to find what makes us happy. My brother's a gay Agnostic, for example.) I'm constantly reading self-improvement books, (picked up Failing Forward Recently, it's really good) and I read and reread them, trying to make me a better person. My parents never put pressure on me to do anything with my life, they've always told me to do what makes me happy.

I've tried to be a good person all my life. I come from an eight person family, and my best friends are my siblings. I have no home problems, I  enjoy a moderate amount of drinking, smoking, video games, exercise, etc. I'm a textbook balanced individual with a good home life.

I have an amazing girlfriend who makes me happy when I'm with her. She's so incredibly in love with me that she would do anything for me, and has proven this fact on occasion.

I went to high school in the Midwest, was popular and well-liked, and somehow I ended up at an Ivy League College. I'm 21, and I have a decent GPA, a solid friend group, and 2 close guy friends who I can tell almost anything. I have a great job for a college kid, I have an amazing internship lined up for the Summer, and my resume is a boss. I've interned in law offices, under senators, and I'm currently running a small non-profit program. My parents can't afford to support me in any way, so I pay my own way through college. I had to take out some loans, but I've been on r/frugal and I've been reading books on how to make sure I'm not to far when I get out.

I've always been told that I'm the happiest, funniest, friendliest guy people know. I've always been told that it's weird how much everyone likes me. Personally, I've always seen myself as a manipulator who can get people to do whatever he wants. 

If you're still reading, then here's the problem. I don't care any more. I don't care about my college, I don't care about my friends, I don't care  about anything. The only time I really care is when I'm with my girlfriend or my two guys. Then, and only then, do I care about them. After I say goodbye, I can't help but thinking about how much better things would be if they didn't know me/ I didn't know them. When I'm with my girlfriend, it is the only time I am truly happy. When I'm not with her, I can't stand the thought of us being stuck together. Before we dated, we were best friends for 3 years. We've been dating for 9 months now, and I can honestly say I want to spend the rest of my life with her. But I can't stand the thought. I can honestly say the only thing I can think of that is wrong with her is that she's not good at board games or many video games. But she is always willing and is always a good sport. We made plans to start playing DnD next weekend as a study break. She's fun, beautiful, smart, willing, cute....she is my dream girl. And I love her.

I've been in a slump for a while. I don't know why. And when I say a while, I mean for the past 2 years or so. I...I always think about suicide. Not in a really serious way, but like whenever I see a knife I think ""Man that would end it really quickly."" Or I'll just be in bed and think about jumping out the window, or hanging myself. I've been doing this since high school, and I'm only just now realizing how unnatural this is. The only time I've really seriously thought about attempting it was when I had to quit ROTC, I just wanted an excuse not to go for just one day so I cut myself really, really deep along one arm. while I was doing it I thought about just moving the knife over one inch to sever the artery...I wasn't scared or anything, I just couldn't do it to my family. I dropped out of ROTC the next week and cried for the first time in years. not because I almost killed myself, but because I was such a huge colossal failure.

Anyway, two nights ago I was hanging with one of my friends who I knew liked me. Neither  of us had ever acted on it, because I'm in love with my girlfriend and because she's a good person. Plus, there's no physical attraction there for me at all. We've been friends  since freshman year, and we've been good friends at that. But two nights ago we kissed. I don't know why I did it. I told her that it felt right, and it did, to an extent, but not for emotional or physical purposes. It felt right because I finally found a way to feel like I not everything was perfect. That I would have a reason to...I dunno...finally get what I deserved. To hurt people? To hurt myself? To destroy the only good thing I have going for me? I want to say that I was just horny, that I was just doing it because there was a warm body, but there was nothign like that. There was not physical attraction. There was no emotional bond other than friendship. I don't know why I did it, I don't know why I did it and I just keep playing it over and over in my head but there was no reason for it. 

I told my girlfriend what I did immediately after. She took a day to cool off, and then asked me sincerely if I wanted to be with her. I do. I do I do I do. But I don't. I can't make her stay by me when I do this sort of thing. But in this case it was just my baser selfish self saying that yes I do want to be with her. I can't tell her that I'm going to hurt her because I can convince myself when i'm with her that I wont. But when I'm by myself, I know I will, because that's who I am and that's what I do. I'm going to hurt her, I'm going to hurt my family, my friends, and my love. It's who I am. I'm going to fail at life, I'm incredibly fake and I just want to end it. I want to do it in a way that makes it look like an accident so no one blames them self. I'm tired of letting people down and failing in my life. I'm tired of people thinking that I'm a good person when I'm a bad one. My girlfriend told me that it was a mistake. That she's furious, but that she knows that it'll only happen once. and that she is already forgiving me for it because she knows how much it hurt me. 

What the fuck Reddit?! I cheated on her! How can she say that? I always thought that I wouldnt be capable of cheating. And this wasn't for anything tangible that I can think of. it's just because I guess on some level I like things to fall apart. I don't know. But right now, all of a sudden I don't want to die. Not really. I just want to not be born. that would be so much better. I wish that I wasn't here. I might just disappear. It would be better for everyone. The suicide thoughts are gone right now. I'm still gonna post this though, because they'll be back tomorrow. And the next night. And the next. Is it sad I'm more excited than anything else for when I finally get the balls to follow through with it? I mean, I've wasted everyone's time here because I have thoughts I don't have enough willpower and motivation to seriously consider for more than five minutes or so. It's pathetic. Anyway, asides from that, I have no motivation to do anything at all. At all. AT ALL. At all. At all... whatever. Here's hoping I get some motivation/willpower soon right?

TL:DR: I'm a stupid asshole who wasted your time. Sorry."

n4zt9,3,2011-12-08,Boyfriend's Mom &lt;vent mostly&gt;,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/n4zt9/boyfriends_mom_vent_mostly/,"She drives me up a wall sometimes. She's a nice enough lady but she really grates on my nerves. 

She wants grandchildren as soon as possible. She has been talking about them since before my boyfriend and I had been dating for a year. Most recently she was angry that my boyfriend said if we had kids it wouldn't be for probably another ten years. She sent him a text message the next day giving him a time line on when she expects us to have our first kid (5 years from now at the latest). It's creepy.

She's incredibly suffocating. She says things about how empty my boyfriend and I's fridge is. Sure it isn't overflowing but there is always a meal or two in there that needs to be finished. If she comes over and our place isn't spotless she will point everything out. She once started cleaning the whole apartment when she came over somewhat uninvited. 

She has more negative things to say about my boyfriend than positive. She nitpicks everything he does. He managed to get a great internship and all she had to say was that $300 was far to much to spend on an interview suit because you could get nice dress clothes for $50. When the internship offered him a second internship the next summer with a raise she couldn't believe that he didn't look at other jobs. Never mind the fact he loves the place, is swamped with homework so has no time for job hunting, and wants to work at the company full time.

I get the feeling she wants me to be with her family more than my own. For Thanksgiving she had me every week for a month if I was coming with her to her family's Thanksgiving. While the offer was nice being asked every week even after I said I would be with my family got old fast. She pulled the same sort of thing with Memorial's Day when I said I was going to seem my family for my birthday.

She is constantly talking about having her daughter come stay over for a weekend with my boyfriend and I at our apartment so her daughter can see what college is like. We've pointed out that there is nowhere for her to sleep and that she wouldn't even enjoy the classes if she went but those points fall on deaf ears. While I would have no problem if my boyfriend's sister wanted to come by and hang out for a day (my sister will be doing that) the fact her mom is insistent on a weekend bothers me particularly since I am not asked if it is okay.

She is just so different from my mother. My mother leaves me alone except for a weekly phone call of chit chat. Her only comment on grandkids was when I said a lot of my graduating class already had babies and her response was basically don't you do anything like that. I don't know how to deal with my boyfriend's mom, and since the holidays are upon us I get to see a lot more of her. I'm worried this will end in hurt feelings. I want to talk to my boyfriend about it but I'm not sure how to approach the subject without seeming like I'm attacking her. I'm not even sure if there is a way to fix anything since he says he just ignore 95% of what she says because that is the only thing that works."

I'm a girl, dating a girl. We met in fall of '06 and started dating in spring '08. Things were really rough at first, because neither of us had ever been with another girl. We broke up that summer, there was a boy. 

But love is love, and we began dating again in November. We told our friends, and many of them didn't understand, or more often made it into a joke. It was hard because we were still trying to accept it ourselves. One of my roommates found out and tried to get me evicted. That roommate ended up moving out, and things got good again. We stayed together through the rest of college and graduated together. In the summer of '10 I got an internship at Disney World, and she went back home. 

We loved and cried and fretted through nine months of a long distance relationship, before finally getting an apartment together. Our first.

I have a lot of friends here and there's a lot of gay people, but I'm still scared to tell people. I worry they will laugh at me or think poorly of me, because no one would ever suspect me of being what they classify as ""lesbian"". I like going out just me and her, and being in such a big town with such a constantly shifting population, and I can hold her hand and we can be together. I feel safe and happy in anonymity.

The truth is, I'm happy, really happy, and I really do want to show people and I wish I was braver. Because right now this girl is sleeping next to me and I'm very, very in love. 

I still feel scared about telling people about my relationship, and sometimes I still get nervous to kiss her on the cheek, if I know strangers are looking. But soon I'm going to ask this girl to marry me, and I don't even feel a tremor."
n4gyt,4,2011-12-08,I wrote this letter to the President to describe some ways the healthcare system discourages quitting.  Anyone have similar experiences?,BarackObamazing,stopsmoking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/n4gyt/i_wrote_this_letter_to_the_president_to_describe/,"Dear Mr. President,

I am a 22-year-old university student from --------- and as a temporary caucus chair for my precinct, I am an active supporter of your presidency.  I have participated professionally in Democratic politics since --------- as a field organizer for ----------, a government affairs assistant for ---------, and an intern for ---------.  I have strong desire to participate in my state's political future, but in order to realize the long and productive career of my audacious dreams I must quit smoking cigarettes.  

I am writing you to describe some institutional and financial obstacles I have recently faced in my effort to quit this disgusting habit.  Smoking has drained my bank account, ruined my respiratory health and will certainly kill me if I don’t quit. The personal benefits of quitting are as obvious as the societal advantages of a smoke-free population.  And yet I have been financially discouraged from quitting by expensive smoking cessation classes, an unaccommodating health insurer, and predatory pharmaceutical prices.

When I was 15, I started smoking as an act of poorly considered youthful rebellion.  My father is a pulmonologist and my mother is an oncology nurse, and in my willful ignorance I started smoking as a way to reject my parents’ values.  Since then, my tobacco use has increased almost as fast as the price of a pack of Marlboros. Until last week I was spending $6.27 every day for the privilege of poor health and a premature demise.  

I quit smoking last week after enrolling in a local tobacco cessation program for which I paid $90 for 6 group sessions.  Because my parents work in healthcare, I was able to obtain a prescription for the Nicotrol nicotine replacement inhaler without the additional financial burden of a doctor’s appointment.  But my “Cadillac” health insurance plan refuses to cover my cessation class or any nicotine replacement medication. Instead I have to pay another $180 out of pocket for only a one-month supply of Nicotrol, which I believe will be the most effective quitting tool for me. I’ve received no financial help whatsoever from my insurer, and am faced with paying almost $300 that I don’t have upfront to help me quit a deadly, socially detrimental habit. 

Today, when I tried to fill my Nicotrol prescription, my credit card was declined.  I couldn’t afford the product that would best help me quit tobacco, and was refused help after an afternoon spent arguing with my insurer and pharmacy.  But I did have $6.27 in my pocket. I bought a pack of smokes instead.  

My experience has been incredibly frustrating, and I am still without medication a week after I dropped off my prescription.  But while the most desirable nicotine replacement method has proven difficult and expensive to obtain, I have been offered Pfizer’s Chantix at every turn.  The drug’s FDA black box warning describes extreme psychological side effects, yet my smoking cessation nurse, my insurer and my pharmacy all have suggested I take it.  There appears to exist a coordinated effort to force this drug on smokers.  I’ve even witnessed my nurse knowingly recommend Chantix for a commercial vehicle driver in violation of a DOT advisory against its use, and have heard health providers question the validity of FDA reported side effects.  My lung doctor father, however, is extremely wary of prescribing a drug with such severe pitfalls and refuses to do so unless he is able to warn his patients’ family members of Chantix’s potentially dangerous psychological effects. In my experience, the smoking cessation industry is demonstrably more concerned with Chantix sales than helping me quit.

Your success in quitting smoking has been an inspiration to me, but my healthcare providers have discouraged me at every step. I urge your administration to review medical practices regarding Chantix and nicotine replacement, and I hope you can ensure that people quitting smoking in the future are provided more options and support than I have received. I am confident that I will succeed in quitting, but my success will occur in spite of, not because of our nation’s healthcare system. The fierce urgency of responsible tobacco policy demands your administration’s attention.

Thank you very much for your time and for considering my experiences.  Please know that I will express my appreciation by working as hard as possible to aid your reelection in every way I can.

With sincere admiration and respect,

Edit: **TL;DR** I can't afford my desired nicotine replacement therapy and my insurer, smoking cessation program and pharmacy are all trying to force Chantix on me.  My dad's a lung doctor and is very wary of Chantix after several family members and patients experienced extreme side effects.  The smoking cessation industry appears more concerned with Chantix sales than people quitting."
n4f91,1,2011-12-07,"She's ""coming back""",[deleted],relationshipadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/n4f91/shes_coming_back/,"Hey guys. You've helped me get through tough times in the past, and unfortunately, I'm back here once again. I'll try to make this brief.

Me: 22m Her: 20F; both seniors at a University in Southern California. 

We met Freshman year and dated for two years until the summer after our Junior year, when I decided to take an internship in London. She had also decided to study abroad in London, but she wouldn't be leaving until after I got back to LA in late August. We would have 10 days together here before she left for her four month program. Being tragically naive at the time, I thought that this whole experience of us being separated would somehow bring us closer together. The reality: she dumps me one month into my stay in London, telling me she can't handle the distance (that's when I first came to this subreddit). Of course the advice on here was to cut contact completely; however, I failed to do so and have been talking to her sporadically since July when she left me. Recently our phone calls/skype chats have taken a bit of a different tone; there is now a longing in her voice and it is evident that she misses me. I know that she is not completely happy there. Something is missing but I can't assume that it's me. 

It's impossible to tell whether she misses me as a friend or as a lover. I am absolutely dead-set on winning her back, but I fear the worst. I don't know what will happen if I am once again rejected; my psyche and mental state will just crumble. 

I've been sort of procrastinating thinking about what things will be like when she comes back to LA, but with her arrival so near (this Sunday), I have been absolutely consumed by it.

n4die,3,2011-12-07,Unstable Ex-girlfriend.,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/n4die/unstable_exgirlfriend/,"Hello,

I am a 25 year old guy who just recently moved across the country to pursue graduate studies. About 2 years ago, I met a girl (she was 20 years old at the time, I 23) at a friend's party, we were both drunk, and naturally, in my state, I tried to sleep with her. She denied me but we exchanged numbers. We meet up a few days later and went on a date. One date turns into two, three, four, and eventually we were officially dating. Fast forward a couple of months, and I discover that I will be going away for the summer to do an internship. The ""relationship"" up until this point consisted of dates a couple times a week, and having sex, ...I was not very emotionally invested. I thought she was on the same page. It eventually comes time for me to leave for the summer, we say goodbye, and mention that we will keep in contact over the break. Over the duration of the summer, we Skyped a few times, she even came to visit a friend in a nearby city, which gave me an opportunity to see her for a couple days. The Skype calls became less frequent near the end of the summer, up until the point I came back home. Given the long break at the beginning of the relationship (in fact, longer than the time we had been dating up until that point) my feelings for her were not especially strong when I returned. I tried things out for a couple of weeks, but eventually confessed that I did not feel the spark anymore, and I thought it would be good to break things off. She reluctantly agreed. Fast forward a couple weeks and she mentions that she has some questions that she wants cleared up and that we should meet over a coffee. I agreed. The coffee meeting ended up turning into me going back to her place and hooking up, which is hindsight was a VERY bad idea. My mind was clouded, I was thinking with my other head, and even though it was just sex to me, it just made her more confused. After that she was messaging me more often, and I eventually needed to abruptly end things (yes call me an asshole). I thought things were completely over at that point.

Jump ahead about a year, I have now moved, pretty much have a completely different life. Out of nowhere I receive a message from her, innocent at first, asking how my life was going. I replied lightheartedly, saying it was going well. She added me back on Facebook (I know I should not have accepted) since this just opened the floodgates for her creeping everyone on my page, and sending me more messages. A particular stream of messages states that she ""saw me with another girl"" ...which was impossible because I now lived 2500 miles away. She was delusional. The messages started becoming much more frequent, with her confessing that she loves me ""in a friend way"" and eventually saying that she ""cant be friends"" and that she actually ""loves"" me and wants to be with me again. I sent her back a short message saying that she has said some pretty heavy stuff in the messages and that when I come back to visit family we should meet to clear up any misunderstandings. The messages started coming unbelievably often (sometimes 20 per day, and even during the middle of the night). She was confessing that she is seeing a psychiatrist and that she is having panic attacks. Some of the messages are nearly completely intelligible and are likely just her dumping all of her thoughts on the page. At this point I am overwhelmed and cannot think of a response (wondering if I should even respond). The messages have turned into her saying things about ""when we start dating again"" etc. To me, she seems absolutely insane and VERY unstable, stating in one message that ""if you don't give me a damn good reason why you don't want me, I'll kill you lol"" I am hoping that is a joke, but honestly, given the number of messages, I am uncertain that she is sane at this point. I am concerned for her safety, but also mine if I decide to meet with her saying that I cannot be with her. What should I do? I feel that if I write her a letter stating my thoughts, she may do something stupid, as in hurt herself physically.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

In July I finished a two year course on Digital Compositing. The last four months consisted of an internship period, which I spent at a vfx studio in Denmark. When school finished I worked at said studio for two months, but my contract ran out in August. I've only been able to score a quick 48-hour project since. 

Yesterday I received my letter of admittance to a [six month course](http://www.kau.se/en/education/courses/ISGB20) on the basics of 3D modelling, lighting and animation. Do you think it will be very difficult for me to find work with my last studio position almost a year in the past and a relatively short 3d education? I'm worried I'll be throwing away the last two years of my life for something that, while incredibly interesting, might not pay off in the end. 

Thanks!"

I have graduated with a Civil &amp; Materials engineering B.S. (Or will this week), and the job hunt has been brutal. With my mediocre grades (3.1 gpa) and lack of internship experience, not to mention the atrocious job market for Civils, I am in between a rock and a hard place.

With this in mind I have always been quick to learn and pick up new programs and concepts easily, and as the CS/IT job market seems to be much better I am considering learning the material and picking up the various certs in order to make myself employable. Thus far (with my very limited CS knowledge) it seems that IT is the way to go, and that the CCNA cert is the primary one needed to be employable. Is this the case? And if not what other certs are 'required' to be employable. Does anyone have any suggestions about study materials etc. and the viability of this plan?

Thank you for any responses."

**I'm looking for**

Anything where I can use maths/improve at programming. I have a particular interest in mathematical modelling, programming (although I only use Haskell and MATLAB at the moment, I am looking to learn Java in the summer) and finance.

**My experience**

I'm currently studying Mathematics at Oxford, expecting to graduate with a 2.1 this summer. Some of the courses I am taking include:

* Structured project on finance, focusing on the pricing of simple European options in the Black &amp; Scholes model, and looking to expand into either binomial methods or improving the efficiency of Monte Carlo simulations
* Functional Programming using Haskell
* Design and Analysis of Algorithms
* Applied Probability
* Integer Programming

I have A's at A-level in Further Mathematics, Mathematics, Physics and French, along with 11A*'s at GCSE

I did a two week internship with BT, looking at cross-media communications research. I produced a formal written report and delivered a presentation to management.

I have 5 years voluntary work experience; progressing from shop assistant to a supervisory role in a local charity shop, as well as representing them on local tv and helping to organise, and participating in, a charity fashion show. I also spent a summer improving software usage, working on reception and running a stall at a local festival for CSV Media Clubhouse.

I led a team of non-science students for the Engineering Education Scheme investigating the challenges in building foundations on a site for new holiday homes, in order to identify a solution that was both structurally sound and commercially viable.

I led two teams of students to produce the two most successful magazines at my high school - encouraging people to submit content, organising the team to be able to publish on time, and negotiating a discounted price with a local printing company. We won the school's Searchlight Cup for teamwork both times.

I was runner up to the Somerville and Gurney essay prize for Sixth Form Scholarship students at the GDST, and won the Reade Essay Prize at my school, both for communicating scientific topics to a non-specialist audience.

**Additional skills and interests**

* Confident working with Microsoft Office, Haskell, LaTeX, MATLAB, Linux, Photoshop and MAPLE (98 in first-year project)

While I have applied and hit stage-2 on various huge international consultancy outfits, I'd prefer to work for smaller firms, where (from my experience) the environment is more meritocratic, entreprenurial and tightly knit.

My skills include: 

* Client management (emails/phone/at events) 
* Strong Excel skills - Intermediate Adobe Photoshop/ InDesign/ Illustrator skills 
* Investing in oil/potash exploration (self-taught, successful)
* Management and leadership, I currently lead teams running our company's products at high-profile events
* Strong entrepreneurial streak

I am very on the ball, and am almost obsessive about learning and get great satisfaction in implementing what I've learnt. I am also very friendly and social, which has helped me build a reputation with clients.

**I'm more than happy to break in to the company prior to graduating to prove my worth, whether this is a part-time position or an internship during the year, it would give you a chance to see what I can do, and me a chance to see how your firm operates**

My wife is studying in her home country (Germany) and as part of her degree, she is required to undertake an internship in her field of study.  
As we haven't seen each other in over two years, and as I'm currently financially trapped (being in postgrad education myself for the next three years), the ideal situation would be that she comes to NZ for the duration of her internship - we can see each other, have teh sexytimes and generally be together again.   

Now, I know that 'internship' is often used as a cover for slave labour, but my wife is very capable and has nine years work experience under her belt already, and she does not want to be used a cheap (= free) worker.
Our circumstances are such that she has to earn a wage while she's here - her parents can cover the airfare, but the tank is dry after that.   

My wife is studying toward a Bachelor in International Tourism Management, and her majors are in Tour Operations and Business IT - we'd really like to be able to find her a short term contract in either area, running from February through to August; her specific career interests are more on the IT side of things and so finding an internship/contract where she could learn more about websites and intranets or even social media would be great (which is Web Development I guess).   
Other areas where she has interests are in databases and data management, as well as HR and business management.  

As I said earlier, she's been working for nine years, so isn't a total noob and has worked in Ireland, the UK and New Zealand, so has a lot of exposure to different work environments.   
She speaks English like a native, and has worked for some major corporates.
She's 's also very cool, gorgeous and I love her to bits - two and a half years is a long time to be apart.

If anyone's able to help in any way, we'd be extremely grateful.  
Please message me if you think you might be able to help.  
Things are a bit desperate.

TL;DR - wife needs a short term IT job, I need my wife..."

The biggest issue I've had though is I am really now sure where to even start. I've thought of trying to stream/cast, but this has never really gotten off the ground since I'm not the highest ranked player or even that well know in the community. As for trying to work for MLG, a pro team, a community website, or any other sort of tournament or connection with sc2, I really am unsure of where to start. Just hoping for some advice, tips, or really anything that might help. 

Such as, do I need to finish my degree first? Should I try and offer some of my time to a community website? Should I do casting or eSports writing? Do different tournaments offer internships or any other entry level positions I can just jump in on?

Hopefully someone can help me find the right direction &gt;&lt;

n5upf,96,2011-12-08,The Fourth Floor Hall,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/n5upf/the_fourth_floor_hall/,"I switched from fry cook manager to certified nursing assistant about a year ago. My fiancee convinced me that he had the income to support us while I went to school to change careers. I'm glad he did, because I think I would have strangled the next idiot to come through the drive-thru. We shared a small apartment on the east side together, and my fiancee paid for my schooling and put a roof over my head doing IT work for the school district.

Shortly after ""graduating"" the CNA courses and doing my internship at a local hospital, I picked up a job at a nursing home about twenty miles from town. It was a private institution, but I quickly learned that its standards of care weren't as high as I expected, and people were left with call lights on a little too long. Most of the people were late-state hospice or Alzheimer's patients, and could be a little strange themselves. After a few weeks of work I began getting used to the job, because it paid well, and no one else was really hiring in the area. I tried to make things better, but I was mostly swimming upstream. AM girls didn't give a shit about the patients, and spent most of their time smoking or blabbing in the halls about vapid topics. PMs were a little better, but I ended up on the midnight shift, when patients were usually asleep by, but one disturbance could get a whole hall up in arms.

Goddamn, the midnight shift. Nursing homes are creepy enough during the day, even well-run ones, but this ancient building was positively terrifying at night. Old people would wheel out from some random room and beg me to help them--with what? Nothing in particular--they just got agitated sometimes. I got used to the vibe of the place and the way things were done, but there was one hall where the call lights took almost a half hour or more to answer sometimes. I quickly learned that no one, even the male nurses, wanted to go up there at night. I thought this was ridiculous, we still have living patients up there, and they needed tending to.

A call light came on on the fourth floor one night, and since I was the new girl, I had to answer it. I shook my head and took the elevator to the fourth floor. No nurses were up here at all, which I thought was odd, as I got off. I found the patient easily enough--he had just woken up and needed to go to the bathroom. No big deal, I thought. I took him through his paces and laid him back into bed. Maybe this whole thing was just some sort of stupid prank, I thought.

That is, until I looked behind me and a black robed shadow was standing behind me. I froze, not wanting to scare the man I had just put to sleep, but he woke up, and even in his Alzheimer's gutted brain I could see the fear in his eyes. The room got excessively cold, then it disappeared. The patient got all agitated again, and I snapped out of it and put him back to bed.

I went back out into the hallway and looked around. There was nothing out there. I heard footsteps coming up behind me, and thought maybe another nurse came up to check on me. I turned around, and nothing was there.

After answering that call light I asked the other nurses about that hall. ""Oh, it's haunted,"" they said as-a-matter-of-factly. ""Most nursing homes have one, seeing as people die in them all the time. Ours is just a bit more haunted than others.""

More curious than scared, I started regularly answering call lights on that hall. Sometimes it was little things, like a pen would go missing, or I'd hear footsteps and nothing would be there. Sometimes it was more pronounced, like shadowy figures stalking the hallways, a cold spot, or even a column of light. I'd eventually see half-apparitions of people, sort of gray in color, appear at the end of the hallway, or wheelchairs roll themselves from one room to another with no one in them. I started getting used to it, but none of the other nurses would usually answer those call lights, deferring to me since I was the ""brave one.""

Strangely, the effects only seemed to happen when a nurse was alone on the floor. If another one came up there, almost nothing happened, but no one ever thought going up to that floor as a pair was a good idea. Management at those places can be thick, sometimes.

I can only imagine what that floor is like for the patients. They say people close to death can see more than the living, and I'm not up there every night all night, so I can only figure what they see is worse than anything I've experienced, and they have no way out--except to die. I learned that the fourth floor patients don't sleep very well, and now I know why."

n5n1p,1,2011-12-08,CS student without much experience...is it reasonable for me to go looking for an IT/dev job now?,throwaway_12939,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n5n1p/cs_student_without_much_experienceis_it/,"background:

- I'm in junior/senior level CS courses at my university. A year ago I transferred from another school. My GPA at my old school was good but the one at my school is a bit low (although still above 2.0). I'll likely end up failing one or two classes this semester because of some depression issues that i'm starting to get care for.

- Not too long ago, I had an unpaid IT internship. I feel I got some valuable experience (ran the helpdesk myself sometimes, plus PHP, Active Directory, etc), although i don't know how i'd feel about putting the employer as an actual 'reference' on there. Aside from that, the last actual paying job I had was about a year and a half ago (customer service, tutoring jobs).

- I know some Java, PHP/MySQL, C, plus knowledge of Windows/Linux/OSX, networking concepts, etc. Presently i'm learning Rails. However, I don't have much to show for this aside from some PHP projects that i don't really feel are worthy of being put online.

I might be taking a semester off from school or go part-time, and need a way to pay the bills during this time. Of course I could go for a typical customer service job, but if possible i'd like to do IT work. All this said, might it be feasible for me to look for a paid IT job or internship at this point?

I live in a big metro with lots of IT jobs and a relatively good job market. I feel that i'm plenty capable of doing helpdesk work, and could do 'entry-level' web coding work after a week or two of getting acclimated to their framework, practices, etc. However, i'm not sure how reasonable it would be for me to go applying for jobs with these issues (no degree/certifications, lowish GPA, no portfolio to show). 

What would be the best way to go about this? I've poked around on Craigslist/Dice/etc, but of course most postings want experience/credentials greater than what I have.  Should I go ahead and apply for 'entry-level' ones that I have most of the prerequisite skills for? Might I get some responses if I posted my resume? Maybe spend a week or two working my ass off to throw together a web app or two to put on my resume? Plus I've heard decent things about some IT staffing agencies; do they typically hire people with a resume like mine?

Thanks all!"

Filled with that hushed din of young professionals forgetting the dryness of their work week at the office with an even dryer martini.  A man in the corner was making love to a jazz ballad on his sax. It was a classy joint a block away from the three biggest law forms in Manhattan. It was the go to place for the more junior members of the firms, those not looking to run into the vice president while thoroughly enjoying happy hour. Harry was sitting at the bar, slowly stirring the ice of his third gin and tonic.  He checks his watch. 10:29. His “date” was supposed to be here at 10:00. He downed his drink with a flick and ordered another. “Fuck it” he snickered under his breath. She wasn’t coming. He’s used to it by now. It’s not his fault, he’s not a bad looking guy, his expensive hair cut is only a week old, he even was wearing some new French cologne that he read about in a magazine on the flight back to New York this Tuesday. But money is what makes the second date in this town.  His salary as a law intern was nothing to scoff at, but women in this town have access to much more. At least this one didn’t show up with at the same bar with a different guy like the last soulless bitch. 
He took his drink and turned to the crowd of faces blurred by gin and jazz. He regretted ordering the drink, but wasn’t in the mood to let it to go to waste.  His eyes passed over the far corner. She was sitting alone at a table for two, nothing on it but an empty martini glass. The little sword stripped bare. She must have been a Goth girl in high school. Far outgrown it now, but you can tell she missed the freedom. She had shiny black hair that sat smooth and round on her head. She wore an outfit fit for a “girl’s night out” with her own flair. A smooth tight silver cocktail dress that showed just a hint of cleavage. She wore bright red shoes that matched her lips. She was writing something on a napkin. She looked up for just a moment and they caught each other’s eyes for the slightest of moments. But it was enough.
Something weird came over Harry. He asks the bartender for another of whatever she’s had, and starts to walk over to her. As he walks over to her with the drinks, he suddenly realizes what he’s doing. This isn’t him. He doesn’t just buy women drinks and sit down at the table with them. He’s not some Casanova. He put the glass on her side and puts his down on the table. His hand shaking ever so slightly. He tries to hide it under the table. Without looking at him she takes a sip from the glass he put down. She puts it on the table. A few seconds go by and she says “I don’t usually take my martini this dirty” she said with a false attitude and a deep voice.  Harrys mouth opened slightly but no sound came out. She peered up at him with a coy smile. ‘Molly’ she sighed, as she held out her hand. Her voice had the smoothness of a hand rolled cigarette. Harry shook her hand and did his best to flash his smile.  But then he tried opening his mouth. “Uhhh, hi I’m Harry.” 
Molly didn’t particularly like meeting people in bars.  The men there were always too easy to read. But for now both just stared at each other. They reached for their glasses at the same time. Both took a drink and softly put their glasses down. They kept eye contact the whole time. Harry’s eyes were a dull green with flecks of yellow, gold in the bars lighting, spiking from the center. Molly’s eyes were very round, and very open. Her steely gray eyes looked around at things as if they weren’t seeing the same things you were.
Harry blinked and realized what was going on. He reflexively asked what Molly did for a living. It’s what he always asked. Because then they ask him. A job with a firm for a man is the same a women getting plastic surgery. Hundreds of thousands of dollars for an easier pick up line.
Molly sighed. She reminds herself to bang her head on the wall when she gets home to punish herself for even acknowledging this guy. She could tell he was nervous. But his smile was nice…“I work for a pharmaceutical company, I help design and make drugs for AIDS patients. All boring science stuff you probably wouldn’t understand.”
She suddenly felt bad about being mean to him.
“Sorry uhh, Harry right?” she asked with a worried sort of scrunched brow
“Uhh yea” Harry mumbled. He was still soaking in her last sentence and figuring out if that comment was mean or not.
“Look, I don’t mean to rude.” She said nodding her head in. “One of our patients we were working with died today, and we were dealing with that grief, and the mounds of legal paperwork, and my girlfriend is not meeting me at this bar any more, and now I’m ranting extremely embarrassing and personal things over to a complete stranger. Jesus, I’m just going to go.”
Harry sat dumbfounded as she grabbed her bag and stood up. She cleared the martini glass in a single gulp and headed for the door. When she was half way to the door, Harry’s mind kicked back into drive. Ignoring his drink on the table he started after her, getting stuck in the polluted sea currents of the bar. He was a moth to a flame. 
He opened the door to see Molly lighting her cigarette in the cab. She looks out the window to exhale, and sees Harry standing in the doorway with a looking a weird mixture of worry and determination on his face. Biting her lip and closing her eyes, she pulls out her business card and holds it out the window. Harry grabbed it, and she looked him dead in the eyes, took a drag from her cigarette, and simply said “don’t fuck this up.” 
The cab took off.

n75dz,6,2011-12-10,The pact,eightfourty,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n75dz/the_pact/,"About a year ago, I was suicidally depressed (actually, most of my life). I decided to write a pact with 3 attainable goals:
1. Find a job
2. Find someone 
3. Become fit (I was normal/skinny)

If I failed I decided I would kill myself to stop being a burden on my family/society (they have enough burdens as it is)

A year has passed, I finished college and my internship, but I've been unemployed for 6 months (I've lost count of how many jobs I've applied to in many different fields). I'm about to run out of money and I'm 18k in debt (thanks school). 

I have a family but I can't return back home, mainly because of my deadbeat alcoholic father who doesn't do anything, and tells everyone else in my family that they're not doing shit (can't say anything about it to him, he's extremely mentally unstable, will snap and take it out on my mother). It makes me physically ill to be around him (hes put my mother and my sister through hell). Every time he talks to me or even touches me a killing intent rises in my body.

I'm more alone now than ever, I've actually lost the bulk of my friends (they moved, found jobs, etc), and I'm nowhere close to being mentally stable enough to sustain a relationship with someone. I have self-esteem and confidence issues even though I've been told by several people that I'm physically attractive (even other guys tell me I'm attractive). I am more muscular than I was last year, but I'm not fit, In fact I feel like shit most of time and I was actually more fit last year (cardiovascular wise). 

I'm 23 now, I'm socially retarded, unemployed (seemingly unemployable), in debt, all the standard depressed reasons. I don't really want to kill myself, but I know exactly how and when I'm going to do it. I just don't know what to do anymore, and I know its my fault. I didn't work hard enough in school, I didn't do anything to change my family, and I didn't develop my social skills. I failed. "

Can't stop thinking about her since.",throwaway_ra_1337,relationshipadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/n8fxo/advice_on_a_girl_i_met_at_an_internship_who/,"Okay, so this is a bit of a doozy. I’m looking for advice for a girl and I (both 21 years old now). Some unimportant details will be changed to protect the innocent (though if she saw this post, she’d probably know it was her…). I did a research internship this last summer. She, let’s say her name is Kat, was also in the same program. At first, we didn’t really talk much, since our research wasn’t related – however, she always did seem a bit “friendly”, possibly flirty. Mind you, I’m still a virgin, never kissed, never gone on a date, etc – so I don’t always pick up on these things, but she did seem interested in me, but I wasn’t sure since she seemed somewhat flirty with others besides me too.

It wasn’t until the last few weeks we started to talk. At first it was about her wanting to build something that I’m good at (unimportant detail), I figured it was one of those topics you use to start talking with someone you don’t know. I already had an interest in her, so naturally I flowed the conversation into other things. I friended her on Facebook and suggested we hang out. Kat gave me her number, so I began to text her and whatnot – talked about different things – again, good impressions. I asked her if she’d like to get dinner and watch something (which I thought would be obvious implying it’s a date) and Kat. This was getting close to moving out since the internship was nearly over, so she suggested lunch on campus. I thought, okay, makes sense, Kat’s just really into her research and is trying to do as much as possible before the internship’s over and she has to move out and go back to school.

Well, lunch came, but she ended up cancelling – she said she couldn’t since there was so much stuff to move – which I gave her a pass on since it was the last two days she could be there. I volunteered to help her move out, she obliged. We talked a lot while I helped move her out, on all sorts of topics. Again, I kept getting good vibes, and she seemed bummed we couldn’t do anything. We ate a quick lunch in her apartment (seems like she had her roommate disappear for it). She was mostly moved out at this point, she just had some other stuff she needed to finish up and I wasn’t really able to help there. We did bump in with each other the rest of the afternoon quite a bit, though. Kat asked later on if she could have dinner over at my place – I said that’d be great. So we whipped up something simple, and talked some more, still more great vibes. Finally dinner was over and she was going to go back to her new place (close by) to organize. I offered to help, but Kat said it’d probably be boring (her body language was confusing – it’s as if she did want me to, but didn’t), though it was up to me. I said that’s fine; I probably have to get ready to move out myself, but told her to stop by later if she could so we could maybe watch some of a TV series I suggested to her. We hugged and she was off.

Kat never came by later, texted her and she said she had too much. But she suggested we grab coffee in the morning (hours before I leave), and just have me wake her up in the morning since she’d be pulling a late night. Well, I did, but she said she was too tired and apologized, she was genuinely sorry. At this point I pretty much wrote her off and thought I had been played as a fool. Maybe Kat was leading me on, maybe I was reading way too much into things, I didn’t know. I ended up leaving later than I said I would and texted her goodbye, she said she woke up a bit ago and apologized that she was such a flake and hopefully she’d see me soon (we were hoping to go to the same university next year).

Anyways, she sounded a bit terse in the last text at that point. I was angry with myself for possibly screwing stuff up, and just a bit angry with her for not being clearer. I didn’t text Kat for awhile, but I did eventually and told her everything was fine, we’d meet up some other time. She didn’t text me back. She’s been nice on Facebook, some things happened that raised my eyebrows, thinking maybe she was paying extra attention to me, I wasn’t sure if that was so or if I was reading too much into it. But overall, the last 4 months there’s been little contact with Kat. I’ve been thinking a lot about her and have been going through one of the darkest and roughest patches of my life (some of it related to her, some for other reasons relating to the internship). I really don’t think I can live with myself if I don’t at least give contacting her a try. But I’m not even sure what to do or where to start. Some of my online friends have basically said that I should forget about it, one even said I had been friend zoned, or even worse “pity friended.” I’m not sure if this is the case.

A few extra details that are probably not terribly important: during the internship, she was really close to another intern. I could tell he was interested in her. Though I recently found out via her Facebook that he hasn’t talked to her since he started school again. I also heard a rumor from another intern that she was friends with benefits with some guy back from her hometown – which was plausible seeing how much he posted on her Facebook wall. Something happened with them since then, I think, after looking over Facebook. Maybe these were two reasons she may have held back regarding me, I’m not sure.

Anyhow, I’m hoping you guys can give me some advice regarding Kat and how I can proceed. I’d be alright if we had just a friendship, but it’d be much nicer if there was something more. I thought there were feelings on her part. I knew I definitely did. Being around Kat made me feel so… *alive*. Help. Please.

**tl;dr:** Okay, you really should read the above since this is a long story… but, here you go: met a girl at a summer internship. I started talking to her late in the internship, seems like there was a connection, and I set a date which she was receptive to. She ended up canceling since she was moving out, I helped her move out and we talked a lot, we did a quick informal lunch and dinner together, everything seemed good, but nothing more happened. We were going to meet before I left, but that didn’t happen. She apologized profusely, I accepted and told her we’d meet up again sometime. We’ve barely talked in the last 4 months since the internship. I can’t stop thinking about her and want advice regarding possibly contacting her again."
n8c9s,14,2011-12-11,My Story,historic66,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/n8c9s/my_story/,"*Note: I'm writing in a stream of consciousness, so I apologize in advance if this becomes a TLDR post*

I was raised in church. By raised in church, I mean I was [dedicated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedication_%28Baptist_ceremony%29), and attended often, usually three times per week (twice on Sundays and once on Wednesdays). I went through every level (I use that word as though one might use it to describe grades in school) of Sunday school, attended [bible school](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacation_Bible_School) until they would no longer let me and attended church camp from fourth grade (the first year one is allowed to attend) until I was a senior in high school (the last year one is allowed to attend as a camper). I also served as a counselor to ""junior camp"" once I was in high school and lead the band in my youth group for almost six years.

To sum up, I was about as dedicated to ""Jesus' team"" as one could get.

In the summer of 2002, the youth pastor I had always known abruptly left, giving no reason for doing so. Two weeks later, rumors began to spread about the senior pastor following his intern's (a different man than the youth pastor) abrupt departure. After several weeks of testimony before the [Deacons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deacon), it was revealed that the pastor had engaged in an inappropriate homosexual relationship with the intern and resigned.

During the next few months, our church and youth group, now both in shambles, struggled to get back to ""normal"". During this time, the adults in the church seemed to be far more concerned with their own wants and needs, neglecting the youth entirely. It was during this time that my band became the tightest and most creative of our entire tenure. It was also during this time that the youth began a rotation of ""taking turns"" delivering the youth sermons on Wednesday nights.

Eventually, a former Deacon stepped up to lead us until both a senior pastor and youth pastor could be found.

Both of the aforementioned hires turned out to be worse than having no official leadership at all. The senior pastor was a money hungry, [hyper-Calvinist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-Calvinism) who often used the church funds for person gain and neglected the congregation. The youth pastor was an immature liar who saw his job not as his [calling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_%28religious%29), but as a stepping stone to senior pastor. After he verbally embarrassed one of my close friends during a sermon and asked him to leave, I stopped attending church on a regular basis. For the second and final time, I also left the band I had been playing with, more or less, since I entered the seventh grade.

In the fall of 2007, I was attending a commuter college and began seeing my first serious girlfriend. It was during this relationship that I lost my virginity. My parents, upon discovering this, [kicked me out](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/m67gf/need_some_help_with_acquiring_a_car/) and sold my car. Although I attended church a few times during our relationship, my days as a regular attender had come to an official end. This was also the event which caused me to look, critically, at everything I had been told growing up, especially considering the complete contradiction between what my parents had taught me and what they were doing.

Since then, I have attended church only a handful of times (for various reasons), but have ceased believing in any sort of higher power. Also since then, I have begun to research religion a great deal and am amazed daily with the [inconsistency of the bible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency_of_the_Bible) and with the absolute lack of common sense Christians seem to have. 

Someone posted something here not long ago that mentioned how it takes a long time to ""cleanse"" someone of a religious upbringing. I had never thought of it until then, but now I notice it constantly. From time to time, something from Christianity will be presented to me (the story of Jesus' birth as told during Christmas at a local [theme park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Dollar_City), for example) and I will get chills, only to remember moments later that the story is bullshit.

I said all of this for two reasons: 1) I wanted others to know where I'm coming from and 2) I wanted those who feel ashamed of being atheists to know that it's okay to admit you have decided to live by logic and reason, not faith and fear."

I worked hard, and the managers were quite happy with me (even offered me a job after graduation). However, I feel like the job itself is not really what I studied for. I like coding software, and that is what I want to do. I feel that I can write good codes if I am given the chance - during the co-op, I coded some software (in .net) that helped automating some tedious manual jobs our team had to do, and the manager was quite happy with it.

During the terms, thanks to our school's co-op program, I was able to work in a company for quite a few months, although the job was not specifically related to development (it was mostly software testing). I worked hard, and the managers were quite happy with me (even offered me a job after graduation).  However, I feel like the job itself is not really what I studied for. I like coding software, and that is what I want to do. I feel that I can write good codes if I am given the chance - during the co-op, I coded some software (in .net) that helped automating some tedious manual jobs our team had to do, and the manager was quite happy with it. (In school, it's the computer theories courses that hit me really hard, not the courses with coding).

If I graduate with low grades without any experience in the field, I am afraid that I will have trouble finding jobs. Every time I think about this I get really depressed - I feel like I am behind everyone, all the other students who are getting good grades and already started working in some respectable companies.

What should I do reddit? Is there some kind of certification that I could take that will help me when I graduate and start looking for jobs? Would I be able to apply to internships with low marks? (Of course, I am not picky about wages if I am getting experience). I am not even sure what I should be doing or what I should be looking for. Help me reddit!

TL DR; I am a university student in canada studying computer science going into fourth year. I have low grades - what should I do after graduation?"
na7vf,0,2011-12-12,The previous intern  Ryan Chambers (POSSIBLE SPOILERS),qdaprince,Dexter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/na7vf/the_previous_intern_ryan_chambers_possible/,"I was wondering on a theory about Louis and Ryan for a while. I think Ryan chambers was killed by Louis already? I mean I think Louis had it staged from before. He met Ryan and they both were going for the Intern job and he made sure somehow that Ryan gets hired as the intern.

I think he probably knew how Masuka is and maybe he thought Ryan would get hired easily. So they ( RYan and Louis) both started going out and all. He had her get the hand and all. He told her to put it on the website so they could sell it but he didn't want to sell it. He just wanted Masuka to find out that she was the one who got it and was selling it.  

So obiously Masuka found out and she got fired. Being the computer geek Louis is he deleted it from the website. OR he knew Ryan's account and basically just removed the item from there.

He then killed Ryan I think so his plan just stays a secret? I just wonder how he would have killed her ?"

What should I do?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/n9zkj/i_accidentally_found_out_a_marine_overseas_is/,"For weeks now at work, Google Talk keeps popping up on my computer. Eric keeps looking for a girl named Molly, a former intern who used this computer before me. Finally fed up with his constant ""hey how are you"", I tried to disable the unprofessional chat. Instead what I found was long, explicate conversations between Eric and Molly including admissions that Molly has cheated on her boyfriend who in currently overseas serving as a Marine. Eric often asks Molly to describe her sexual acts with her boyfriend and she willingly tells him. Eric often invites Molly to join him in threeways and most of their conversations involve discussing sex in some fashion. I have no doubt the Marine has no idea his girlfriend is sharing details of their sex life for some other guy to get hard to, nor does this Marine know she's slept with someone else. I don't know Eric, Molly, or the Marine boyfriend and my only tie to this is that Molly was too blonde to disable her chat before quitting the office. Is it my duty as an American to let the Marine know the actives of his girlfriend or should I pretend I never saw a thing?"

But I just do not have the work to back myself. I feel confident about knowledge, I understand the principles and can see where/how things can be fixed to look nicer. But in a student film-school context, all my projects were rushed out over 3 days or less. As a result I'm having a tough time getting my reel to look like something I could be hired over.  
  
I'm currently in Toronto and looking for work as a compositor, I know After Effects and expressions. I can prototype a Python script in the ORSDK for Motionbuilder and I've got just enough understanding to feel like my toes are wet about Fluids, nCloth, DMM, RBD, SBD and Particles in Maya... But in no way have I found a time to get my hands on a decent camera and go shoot pieces. Or to create anything completely in CG.  
  
So this is what I'm wondering, if I decide to just do freebies for short films/student projects. To work on tiny things for dirt cheap or literally nothing... Would it be harm or hinderance.  
  
I don't know what to do. I am supposed to do an internship by working at a company as an 'assistant' or something. But no one has replied and most anywhere I find in the area is calling for Nuke, Shake, Flame or Fusion knowledge. Which I just don't have.  
  
It's likely a lot of fear and just anxiety at the idea that I'm just no good, that I'm disillusioned. But I'm damn certain I can do the work, that I can learn Nuke on my own and that I can turn out product worth broadcasting. I just don't know what to do from here.  
  
I'm sorry to be asking this but just any help or projects you need help with in AE... let me know.  
  
Help me r/vfx... you're my only hope.


**edit for clarity**: I began learning after effects 6 years ago. The program I just took (postsecondary film program) has been going for 3 years and pushing after effects. Now I'm near graduation and am taking in that what I've been taught is largely irrelevant. I will be learning Nuke by the PLE and downloaded the Manual and resources also whatever Lynda.com can offer. At 36k in debt I can't afford to not use solely free resources and common sense. It's how I've learnt most things thus far, it's, after this experience with college, the only way to go.  
  
I do enjoy writing Python so I'll be aiming for that. My only experience with nodal anything is Houdini. I've 'played' with just about every software, it's just once my program picked up speed and people asked me to do comps, I was only able to turn them out in after effects so the space to learn outside of the classroom just wasn't there. I've spoken to my course co-ordinator and am now working in Maya to finish up my dynamics project (If you have tips for why my road isn't taking shadows that'd be awesome but also it's own post). It was agreed I'll work for a month with the school full-time paid and then begin my co-op later than the others. during that time I'm expected to (and obviously will) learn Nuke... and then apply python to all the things.  
  
Prior to coming here I was writing Java in a Comp Sci program and doing network IT/management... So the tech part is easy, it's just adjusting to nodal that i worry will slow me down.  
  
Thank you everyone"

n9jf9,7,2011-12-12,"Fundamentalist Christian Girlfriend of 3 years cheated on me; Need advice, opinions",lost_abandoned,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/n9jf9/fundamentalist_christian_girlfriend_of_3_years/,"**Warning:** this is long and TL;DR doesn't do it justice, please read in full if you'd like to comment (it’s at the bottom to at least ou to read some). Also, feel free to encourage (I feel so lost right now and I have cried for the first time in years, one of few in my lifetime), but that is not what I am here for. I am sorry if this is too much detail (I have never done anything like this before), so you can skim this and read the conflict part, but I hope that you read it all if you’d like to give your advice or opinion. I typed this in my fury somewhat as a recap of out entire relationship so you can skip to the bottom to the more recent events.

Background: I am a 22 year old guy and she is a 26 year old gal. I am a hardliner atheist and she is a staunch Fundamentalist Christian (Literal interpretation of the Bible, Old Earth Creationism, and all that stuff). I am still a student currently with a year of bachelor’s left and she works as a nurse. I am also of eastern-European descent and have always had trouble with English and, coupled with being pathologically shy, could never make any real friends (almost had a girlfriend but never mustered the courage to ask).  She is a bit older, but still very young and energetic and only dated one guy before me that, as it turned out, wanted to marry her for a green card (they were a very “Christian” couple from what she has told me, they held hands together, so for all intents and purposes, I was her first real boyfriend).

Our story: 
We met when I was an 18 year old freshman in college and she just transferred from CC to get a nursing degree. We lived right next to each other but did not talk much during the first semester. We started talking at the end and had all kinds of interesting conversation and debate pertaining to religion and politics. She taught me how to swing dance, we danced outside, went to run after a rain, ate together and with friends. I soon realized that even with all the differences we had, she was the perfect girl to complement me, my thoughts and my abilities. 

Once spring was over and we separated we wrote each other long FB messages, somewhat flirty, but she was pretty naïve about me and wanted to be just friends. I confronted her and she rejected me, mainly because she wanted to date only a devoted Christian guy. I was devastated. 

I moped for a long time before the school started again. We were living on the same floor and she was going to be an RA. We met and spoke still and tried to be friends, but it wasn’t working for me, and I tried to convince her that I was worth it. She allowed me near her, and we hugged, touched (although she would not allow intimate places) and eventually, we built up to that moment when we had our first kiss (both of our firsts!). After that, we officially became boyfriend and girlfriend and no day went by without us seeing each other. We declared our love to each other by the end of the semester and I couldn’t be happier. We sort of lived in the moment and didn’t think about the future, just enjoying each other’s love, companionship and support. We both knew that it probably wouldn’t work out once we were done with college, but for the moment, that did not matter to me, and I assured her that we would get through it one way or another.

So that semester and the following flew by. We spent most the time together, except the times we studied. I never made many friends, except my immediate study group. One of the people that she studied with, a male student in her class is one of the culprits of the current conflict. They would talk a lot, but mostly with other people there (the guy had a girlfriend, and the few times I have met him he seemed like a nice enough guy, although an ex-marine). We spent the summer mostly apart but in constant contact over FB and phone even though she had no internet in her home. My parents knew of her, but she did not tell hers since she feared they would ostracize her and destroy whatever peace was left of her troubled family for dating an atheist (she is in a family with a single mother of three, of which she is the oldest).

 The fall semester, she was finishing up her degree and I lived in an apartment. I would often stay in her room and practically lived with her. Our love for each other was undying and we both worried what would happen once she was done. Yet, when she was, we decided to stay together, and since she lived only a bit of an hour away, she would visit me and friends. We were a very good couple in my opinion. She needed a lot more support from me due to her troubles with family, friends, (before she graduated, school), so it was always slanted a bit more towards her. She supported and encouraged me in endeavors and I have done some things thanks to her that I could have never done without her.

I made the decision to transfer to a much better school 3 hours away, sent my application and was accepted. I spoke to her about it when I first started thinking and again, we figured out we could make it work. The next semester flew by, with her visiting, going to a few parties with me (nothing wild, I taught her to drink alcohol with me, not a lot, just a little bit; she got a lot from some of her girlfriends). We slowly built up to sexual intimacy over the course of this relationship (no vaginal intercourse though, although she offered, I refused because I did not want any accidents or complications; we are still technically “virgins”) and of course by the end of this semester were fully comfortable with each other. The summer, we took some more time together because she was finally living on her own and we could get more time. She finally got a job, but before that she tried to get a job at a hospital literally across the street from the university (very halfheartedly and she admitted she didn’t want to get it because she wanted to be closer to her family; needless to say, she didn’t). My parents moved closer to her place at the end of summer and I moved to school 3 hours away. That’s when more troubles began to surface. 

A lot of times she was upset about the distance and wanted to come out and see me. I accommodated her as much as I could, but my workload as a transfer student was insane and there was only so much that I could do. The arguments got a lot tenser and difficult. We stopped talking about religion and politics and other sensitive issues because over IM and even phone we were not there to support each other and she would get very emotional (she was hopeful (both of us were) that I would change my views and we could be a happy “Christian” family). So this semester went by fast, we saw each other, and the times that we saw each other was absolutely amazing. She wanted to make friends where she lived and met a few guy friends, some of which got weird and she cut contact with them. We always talked about that, even if not in the open, and she was good at handling it, even though she had some mild issues saying no to people. We were still this hopeful couple utterly and devastatingly in love. Fast forward to next semester that preceded much like the fall, except the tension rose a bit more. She insisted that she needed more time with me, but again, I could provide her only so much… Then closer to the end of the semester I finally received an offer for an internship till the end of the year in a state over 2000 miles away. I tried finding opportunities in our state, but besides a few startups and financial firms, our state did not offer much for my occupation. I told her before I accepted and she cried. Maybe that’s when she thought our relationship would be soon over. We talked about it a lot though, and it seemed to me like she would bear with me. I had to take it because I needed the experience (and the money wouldn’t hurt). We were just so madly in love. We spent all the time together that we could before I left. She liked sending me cards (snailmail) expressing how much she misses me and loves me.

This summer went by fast, I worked at a large company with many other interns, and I met some people and had fun, but mostly events and bars, not even any parties. I almost never hung out with girls because I did not want to make her uncomfortable (although she never admitted it, she thought that without a code of morals like hers I could never be entirely trusted, that or was afraid girls would take advantage of me).  She told me that she met her friend from nursing school for lunch a few times. Him and his girlfriend has issues and he didn’t tell her that he was visiting my girlfriend.  She however, went to a b-day party for him later anyway (that his girlfriend hosted). I never voiced my concern on her seeing that guy until much later, but I thought she could handle herself, and I think she did. We still communicated a lot, video chat, phone, IM, texting, we did it all as it fit our mood. We had one major spat when I told her not to visit me for 2 days when she could because I did not want to meet her and have to leave her so fast (I realize I was a fool for thinking that, I would kill for that time if it could make her feel closer to me). I visited her for 8 days during Labor day week, during which we took a trip to the Creation museum (an attempt to reignite conversation on religion and science), and as always, had a great time. We were just as intimate, and close as ever, even if a bit distant at first.
Then I went back and we continued what we were doing before. I tried playing sports after work and going to gym (for her! even though I am already reasonably fit, I wanted her to think I was the sexiest man alive, and I will admit that I enjoyed looks from others of the opposite gender, but only for sport), so we talked a bit less but still a good enough amount to run out of things to talk about. 
Over the course of these 3 years she became my best friend and I thought I became hers too (maybe I am, but I cannot be sure now). I supported She was my first kiss, my first dance, my first valentine, my one and only love, the love of my life, my world.

The Conflict
What I knew up to today:
Things started to get weird around November. She would speak less and less to me, and was becoming more distant than ever. We would still talk, and share convo, send hugs and kisses, say “love you” and good night, and support each other. Then, she told me that she was meeting her friend from nursing school, more and more frequently. His girlfriend and him broke up, and I their meeting had a lot to do with the fact that he was available (both schedule and relationship status-wise). I suspect that she met him more often for lunch and such that she didn’t tell me about. She told me he had helped get a Christmas tree, introduced him to her friends. Only a bit over a week ago, she told me that he said he had feelings for her. I am still unclear on how she responded, but I think she tried to let him down easy. I have met him and know him, albeit only briefly. I don’t know why he would do such a thing that I later I found out he did - he just seemed like a much better man than that to me.

When she told me this, I was the most understanding a guy could be (as I usually am, which is the reason I am typing all this past 1 AM on  Sunday night), but now I realized I should have stopped her from seeing him at all costs. Instead, she assured me that they were just friends, and that she tried talking to him after and it didn’t seem weird, so she thought it was ok. She told me that she shared a lot about our relationship with him and received a lot of advice and explanations from his (he’s agnostic) perspective. I know he is one of her best guy friends, so I told her that I didn’t mind that if that’s all it would be then that’s fine. She has very strong opinions on cheating (and she more than once told me that the relationship would be over if I ever cheated… oh, the irony), I trusted her immensely, and I thought she would never let it happen even if the bastard tried. 

This week:
 She went to a friend’s party (Ugly Sweater party) this Saturday. The way things were between us, I didn’t want her to go because I knew there’d be drinking and she would drink (the party becomes much more important later on), and I always worry what could happen to her, especially with a bunch of random people that her friends know. Her nursing friend was also invited, although she said she would have liked it more that he wasn’t. I asked her why and she said I thought I’d be mad and asked her “you are just friends, right?” to which she simply said “Yes”, and for me, her word was more than enough, but doubts lingered. She was also staying at her girlfriend’s place for the night, which I thought nothing of also, since I assumed there would be only girls left (as my girlfriend is adamantly against sleeping in the same quarters with another gender, and has given me much grief for my apartment searching).

Sidenote: 
She swears that it’s not related to anything that happened in the last few weeks, but she also started talking about ending the relationship over this same time period. Mostly because she did not want to move if I got a job a year later in the same state, and did not think we could ever raise children together and didn’t want to continue on with it. I told her that I was thinking of marrying her (which took her by surprise, she thought I wasn’t even thinking about it), and can compromise to work things out. She reluctantly agreed that we should continue for now.

Which brings us to today (Sunday):
I called her to talk about the party and to see how she was. Turned out that she stayed out really late and drank a lot, danced with a bunch of people (probably not grinding or anything, but I am not sure now since she was drunk) did not “sleep well” on her friends couch. I talked more to her and she again tried to tell me that we should just stop seeing each other. I told her that I thought of a plan to get us through our misunderstandings about our mutual futures (there were a lot piled up by now), and that we will do it once we get back. I sent her a message on FB after that describing how much I love her and want to be with her and want to prove to her that I can be the “life-long companion, husband, father, lover, and best friend” that she wants me to be. She had her family for a Hanukah party later (they celebrate it due to their family ties with Messianic Jew community), so we did not talk about it. Once they were gone, she called me and told me that she read my message. I asked her what she thought and she wanted me to tell her more specifically what I wanted to talk about… we talked about that a bit and she seemed very receptive. 
And then the conversation took a turn for something I will never forget.

She was trying to say something, and said that she has done a lot of dumb things this week. I immediately perked up, my heart racing, afraid of the worst.  She was very slow about telling it all, most of it through tears and “I love you so much”’s, but she made out with her nursing school friend. On her bed, and he stayed the night (although she assures me that no clothes came off, but I assume there was groping and fondling). Then, she told me that she met with him again, and they made out again. This time, I am not sure if he stayed the night, but I don’t think he did, and again, she says it was just a make out session. 

I was unbelievably mad and angry, angriest that I have been in my life. I raged for a few moments. How could she betray my trust like that?! Right after I reinforced it and told her I trusted her?! Why would she do this when I was just a few weeks away from returning home? My heart sunk so far… I thought this would never happen to my sweetheart, my love, who I thought was so madly in love with me. I have tried everything in my power to make this LDR work, but it seems that it just wasn’t enough.

Then we talked more, I told her how truly heartbroken and stunned I was and she was asking for forgiveness. Then I asked if anything else happened. Turns out that when she got back from the dancing at a bar and crashed on the couch, one of her friend’s drunk friends climbed on top of her and in her drunk state, she made out with him too (and that’s where it stopped also, she told me).

The Aftermath:
We talked more and she is so extremely sad, both of us were, and how sorry she is to have done what she did, she says that she wishes she was dead rather than put me through this, and hates that she is now a “slut and a whore”. She said she would stop talking to that friend of her forever if I accepted her apology. When I asked her “what if I didn’t, would you still meet with him?” to which she replied “I don’t want to lose two friends in the same day”, to which I replied “Then how do you think I would feel?” I spoke more to her, trying to make myself and her feel better. I told her I still loved her and did not hate her but wasn’t sure if I can forgive her or not just yet. I told her we are all human and we make mistakes, and since this all happened within a week with an otherwise faithful and loving girlfriend I am ready to chalk this up to a “crime” of passion, but…. But I am hesitant because of the circumstances described above. Even if we continue it will be so much harder to work through our issues and disagreements... it may make it impossible if it wasn’t before. Even if we did, I could never trust her again as much as I did now. And what about the future? Could this happen again if I am away for some reason, or if she thinks that I am not treating her fairly or whatever it was that she thought when she cheated on me? I am afraid I can never be assured of that as I once was.

Can you help?
I will need some time to think about this myself, but I need somebody else’s opinion.  Unlike my foolish self, my girlfriend has made some more or less decent friends and still has a lot of her old childhood ones, but I am stuck by myself, with maybe my brother to talk to. I have lurked reddit a lot and love the community (for the most part) and am hoping to get your advice and thoughts on this on how to proceed. 
Which brings me to my point: what do I do now? I am not even sure how to feel or think about this right now as it’s late. She betrayed my trust and faith that I have put into her (in a conversation that I believe took place only shortly before she did so). Maybe the relationship dragged on longer than it should have to begin with, but it all happened so fast… It has a lot to do with me being far away, as she has expressed many times that she wanted me with her and couldn’t carry on like this for another year or more after that. I wanted to take the last week of the year off work and couldn’t visit her before all this happened… I feel like I should have now.

TL;DR: Otherwise faithful, amazing, loving girlfriend of 3 years makes out with a close guy friend from her nursing school days and also gets drunk and makes out with a random drunk guy at a friend’s party after passing out, all 2 weeks before I come back home from a 7 month internship. She says that she has no feelings for him, she doesn’t know how and why it happened (twice!) and that she is sorry about what happened at the party, that I am the only man she loves and she doesn’t (weirdly, all of a sudden) want to lose me, especially not like that. She did all this after I told how much I trust her and think that she can handle herself, not to mention that it strongly goes against her beliefs. What to do/think?

n9hga,6,2011-12-12,Advice needed please on internship that offered me a job.,poorintern,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/n9hga/advice_needed_please_on_internship_that_offered/,"*Note:* This is kind of long, I'm sorry. Am kind of depressed and thinking negatively, so some fresh advice would be appreciated please.   

*Background:* I have 10 years of office and retail experience; I am a published writer with experience in the music industry. I live in Los Angeles. 
I was fired in July from my last job (office admin type of work) due to an undiagnosed sleep problem I've had forever. I have been diagnosed with delayed sleep phase disorder. My desired career of choice is working with Asian artists here in LA, and I have gone through nearly all the options (and been ripped off by so many people). I applied to an Asian record company, my last bet.   
  
I got an immediate interview, but instead of a job, I was offered a 3 month unpaid internship (parking &amp; lunch paid) instead of the usual 6 month internship.  
The company is really small - Pres, VP, three office workers, and two freelancers on call. Everyone is Japanese but the VP, who is American. When hired, I'm told that they ""don't know what to do with me"" and I am to create my own internship. My writing background proves to be very useful as they badly need help writing bios and editing badly translated English. I'm not fluent in Japanese but I've taken a couple years of it. VP openly states that he has no talent for writing, and I get lots of praise for my work.  
   
The two office workers are S and H, and we get along well. The VP and I work well together. The Pres is in his office and sort of oblivious to what's going on with his employees. The music industry is tanking, so he's busy thinking of new ventures - music schools, energy drinks, festivals, etc.  
Internship ends early November. Pres tells me in a vague, Japanese way that I would be useful but the budget is low and so he can't hire me right now, but maybe in the beginning of December.... basically he didn't say no or yes. I leave when the end date comes.  
  
In the three months I was there, I tried very hard to find a part time job around the two-day-a-week internship without success. I have basically no income since my last job (minus an occasional freelance job). I am in serious debt, and am very depressed. Because my circadian rhythm is basically borked, I am on a very strict sleep schedule to try to regulate it. My lack of morning availability, in an employers market, means I do not get hired out of 10 or so interviews for retail work or office jobs.  
  
I follow up with the record label in December. I was told to come into the office on Friday to meet with Pres, VP, and H. Turns out, office worker S's visa got denied when she reapplied. She is leaving in late December. They want me to fill her job. I don't know what she does all day, and they don't really tell me. All her work is in Japanese so over the months, I've never been able to read her screen or paperwork. I know her work has nothing to do with writing.   
They want me to work three days a week, and maybe five when it gets busy, 7 hours a day ish. However, they can only pay $9/hr. The minimum wage in California is $8/hr. When I worked at CVS for two years in 2007, they started me at $9.30. I had to leave CVS because I wasn't able to save money. 
  
*Conclusion:* Internship wants to hire me to replace employee who is leaving for terrible pay and unstable availability. Considering I haven't been able to find work since July, I am highly doubting that I can find another job on top of this. I also suspect that they want me in this job because they can't attract anyone at that pay range. I feel that they're taking advantage of me, not hiring me due to skills. I highly doubt of any opportunity in moving up in the company. I'm 25, and I need to start investing in a career.

(xpost from r/relationshipadvice)",throwaway_ra_1337,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/n9bk4/advice_on_a_girl_i_met_at_an_internship_who/,"Seems that this subreddit has a lot more exposure, so crossposting from [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/n8fxo/advice_on_a_girl_i_met_at_an_internship_who/), but do comment here.

Okay, so this is a bit of a doozy. I’m looking for advice for a girl and I (both 21 years old now). Some unimportant details will be changed to protect the innocent (though if she saw this post, she’d probably know it was her…). I did a research internship this last summer. She, let’s say her name is Kat, was also in the same program. At first, we didn’t really talk much, since our research wasn’t related – however, she always did seem a bit “friendly”, possibly flirty. Mind you, I’m still a virgin, never kissed, never gone on a date, etc – so I don’t always pick up on these things, but she did seem interested in me, but I wasn’t sure since she seemed somewhat flirty with others besides me too.

It wasn’t until the last few weeks we started to talk. At first it was about her wanting to build something that I’m good at (unimportant detail), I figured it was one of those topics you use to start talking with someone you don’t know. I already had an interest in her, so naturally I flowed the conversation into other things. I friended her on Facebook and suggested we hang out. Kat gave me her number, so I began to text her and whatnot – talked about different things – again, good impressions. I asked her if she’d like to get dinner and watch something (which I thought would be obvious implying it’s a date) and Kat. This was getting close to moving out since the internship was nearly over, so she suggested lunch on campus. I thought, okay, makes sense, Kat’s just really into her research and is trying to do as much as possible before the internship’s over and she has to move out and go back to school.

Well, lunch came, but she ended up cancelling – she said she couldn’t since there was so much stuff to move – which I gave her a pass on since it was the last two days she could be there. I volunteered to help her move out, she obliged. We talked a lot while I helped move her out, on all sorts of topics. Again, I kept getting good vibes, and she seemed bummed we couldn’t do anything. We ate a quick lunch in her apartment (seems like she had her roommate disappear for it). She was mostly moved out at this point, she just had some other stuff she needed to finish up and I wasn’t really able to help there. We did bump in with each other the rest of the afternoon quite a bit, though. Kat asked later on if she could have dinner over at my place – I said that’d be great. So we whipped up something simple, and talked some more, still more great vibes. Finally dinner was over and she was going to go back to her new place (close by) to organize. I offered to help, but Kat said it’d probably be boring (her body language was confusing – it’s as if she did want me to, but didn’t), though it was up to me. I said that’s fine; I probably have to get ready to move out myself, but told her to stop by later if she could so we could maybe watch some of a TV series I suggested to her. We hugged and she was off.

Kat never came by later, texted her and she said she had too much. But she suggested we grab coffee in the morning (hours before I leave), and just have me wake her up in the morning since she’d be pulling a late night. Well, I did, but she said she was too tired and apologized, she was genuinely sorry. At this point I pretty much wrote her off and thought I had been played as a fool. Maybe Kat was leading me on, maybe I was reading way too much into things, I didn’t know. I ended up leaving later than I said I would and texted her goodbye, she said she woke up a bit ago and apologized that she was such a flake and hopefully she’d see me soon (we were hoping to go to the same university next year).

Anyways, she sounded a bit terse in the last text at that point. I was angry with myself for possibly screwing stuff up, and just a bit angry with her for not being clearer. I didn’t text Kat for awhile, but I did eventually and told her everything was fine, we’d meet up some other time. She didn’t text me back. She’s been nice on Facebook, some things happened that raised my eyebrows, thinking maybe she was paying extra attention to me, I wasn’t sure if that was so or if I was reading too much into it. But overall, the last 4 months there’s been little contact with Kat. I’ve been thinking a lot about her and have been going through one of the darkest and roughest patches of my life (some of it related to her, some for other reasons relating to the internship). I really don’t think I can live with myself if I don’t at least give contacting her a try. But I’m not even sure what to do or where to start. Some of my online friends have basically said that I should forget about it, one even said I had been friend zoned, or even worse “pity friended.” I’m not sure if this is the case.

A few extra details that are probably not terribly important: during the internship, she was really close to another intern. I could tell he was interested in her. Though I recently found out via her Facebook that he hasn’t talked to her since he started school again. I also heard a rumor from another intern that she was friends with benefits with some guy back from her hometown – which was plausible seeing how much he posted on her Facebook wall. Something happened with them since then, I think, after looking over Facebook. Maybe these were two reasons she may have held back regarding me, I’m not sure.

Anyhow, I’m hoping you guys can give me some advice regarding Kat and how I can proceed. I’d be alright if we had just a friendship, but it’d be much nicer if there was something more. I thought there were feelings on her part. I knew I definitely did. Being around Kat made me feel so… *alive*. Help. Please.

**tl;dr:** Okay, you really should read the above since this is a long story… but, here you go: met a girl at a summer internship. I started talking to her late in the internship, seems like there was a connection, and I set a date which she was receptive to. She ended up canceling since she was moving out, I helped her move out and we talked a lot, we did a quick informal lunch and dinner together, everything seemed good, but nothing more happened. We were going to meet before I left, but that didn’t happen. She apologized profusely, I accepted and told her we’d meet up again sometime. We’ve barely talked in the last 4 months since the internship. I can’t stop thinking about her and want advice regarding possibly contacting her again."

I have a bad headache. I feel cold. I don't want to work out. I just want to call it a night...

But not today. Maybe I can feel like shit tomorrow. Or next week. But right now... I'm going to better myself.
I drank some hot chocolate and listened to some upbeat music to clear my head. I made a game plan. Pumped some iron and feel a lot better. I'm researching programming languages and finding projects to do. I don't have much time due to my girlfriend. Shes into design and arts. I want to learn PHP programming. I asked her to design a website with me and I'll do all the technical work. 
I'm 19, I don't need my mom to tell me what to do and what not to do. 
I don't need to watch that ""flower"" speech to motivate me anymore. My actions will be my motivation.

I was crushed. Her reason was completely valid though. We were getting pretty serious and at the time, she had only a few friends aside from me. Now she has a bunch of friends and seems to be so much happier. I took the time off to really better myself as well. I poured myself into school and got an internship and it seems that I'm on a great path. At about 2 months of separation and absolutely no contact, she wrote me a handwritten letter telling me how much she missed me and how bad she wanted me back. At first I said ""fuck no"", but then after trying to see someone else, I realized I still loved her. We got back together. We get along great but for some reason I just can't relax when we aren't together. I love her, I always will. She's a beautiful girl and very sweet.  I keep getting clingy in a way that I really wasn't before.  

I guess my question is, when is getting back together a good idea?  She crushed my heart but I can forgive that. We've been trying to make it work for a month now and she's flaked on plans with me at least 6 times now. She never did that once before when we were together.

nblqf,11,2011-12-13,"A series of repetitive failed relationships, now getting dumped on my birthday, and my therapy sessions aren't long enough... ",YourDirtySlut,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/nblqf/a_series_of_repetitive_failed_relationships_now/,"**UPDATE:** This has been the most confusing 2 weeks imaginable, and I understand the simplicity as to why... he has been torn.  He broke up with me 2 days before my birthday, completely shattered my heart.  The next day, I failed the final I attempted to study for through puffy eyes.  But that day I was determined to start hardening myself and moving on.  4pm that day (the day I failed my final), he started texting me again.  I don't think he could handle NOT doing so.  And I so wanted to talk to him and not lose him.  Wednesday and Thursday we kept texting like we had never broken up, and he even suggested that Thursday night (the night of my birthday), that we spend a last night together (which is what I fucking wanted in the first place).  I agreed.  Again, texting all Friday and I went over to his place this Saturday night to enjoy a final evening together.  I wasn't sure how it was going to be.  If he was going to be weird, if he was going to change his mind again, I didn't know.  When I got the door of his apartment, I received the text I most hoped for... ""So, what do you think about pretending like we never broke up tonight?  Lol.""  What I thought?  FUCK YES.  And let me tell you... it was one of the best nights I can possibly remember, because I got the day I always wanted.  The night was... perfect.  We had crazy, intense sex first, like we were eating each other up.  Then I got my 5 minute break (per usual, the guy cant just have one session...) and we changed to making love for the next hour.  He kissed every inch of my body, and I just wanted to cry in the ecstasy of it all.  Afterward we just held each other, continued to kiss, he stroked my back, and constantly kissed the top of my head or nuzzled his face in it while we watched the credits to the movie we never watched.  I tried to memorize every curve of his face with my fingers while we laid there, traced the veins on his arms.  I was so happy.  He also got me a birthday present as well, something I did not expect with all the confusion that was us.  And it was the most wonderful birthday present I have ever received from a man.  Actually, it was something cheap and simple I have asked EVERY boyfriend since I was 15 to get for me, but none of them ever did: a stuffed animal sprayed with his cologne (even more meaningful since he was leaving me).  Not only that, but it was a stuffed bulldog (my dream dog that I am finally getting this winter).  He also got me this cheesy toy that we played with from the 90s, and gloves to help me avoid callouses at the gym.  As well as a birthday card.  So while we are apart, I can still have his smell and see the intimacy of his handwriting.  As painful and confusing as things I have been, this has been the best birthday of my life.  Today it wasn't goodbye, it was see you later.  But I still cried- a mixture of happiness and knowledge of how much I will miss him.  But I feel a new strength in me.  I know I can handle being single until I see him in February.  And I found an internship for this summer 20min from where he will be living.  I will be seeing my Therapist this Thursday, and that is when we will begin working on my past damage so I can make the next few months until I see him, and then the few months after that until my internship.  Now, I just need to learn how to act/deal while we are apart.  It's going to be hard for me to hold the sap back and treat him as a friend.  But I am really looking forward to seeing what will happen in the future.  2 months until I go the furthest from home I've ever been!

TL;DR- I got my last, wonderful night with him until I see him next.  And he just continued to prove how wonderful and perfect we are for each other.

I'm just so tired of crying right now :(

Little background here... been struggling with depression since I was 15, finally had it beat when I was 21, fell back into it last year when I was in a horrific car crash.

I've never really been single, always sought out the belonging, love, and security of a relationship.  The last time I was single I dated for 2 years, and I thought that was my method of dealing with it.  I was recently in a LTR until the end of October when I finally got out of the abusive relationship that it was.  If had let him tear me down because I didn't want to be alone.  1 month later, I met Greg, and we fell hard and fast for each other.  It was intense and crazy, and I couldn't stick to my ""move slow"" promise for long.  He was physically absolutely GORGEOUS (like Ryan Gosling with a fantastic tan), was sweet and romantic as hell, and best of all, he was crazy about me.

A week and a half after asking me to be his girlfriend, he informed me he was moving back to California and I had no say in it, but he didn't want to let what we had go.  For the past week now we have juggled with what to do.  I wanted to do long distance.  He wanted to just be friends, visit each other, and see what happens.  I accepted his want only if he agreed that he wouldn't be leaving me alone on my birthday (Thursday).

Tonight he tells me he can't do it because it's too hard for him.  WTF?  TOO HARD FOR HIM?? It's my goddamn birthday, I'm in the middle of my finals, and now I'm being dumped?  And he would get what he wants AND move back to California where it's warm and sunny with all his friends?  What the hell am I getting out of this aside from another shitty ass birthday?  Oh yeah, another note?  I have a series of REALLY shitty birthdays... ie, multiple pets have died on my birthdays, last year it snowed 2 feet so I had to cancel (and was in the middle of finals so it was pointless to reschedule to fucking January), and my childhood I dealt with a drunken father every year.

All of my past relationships have ended fairly similar... they use me, abuse me, then take off, and my heart ALWAYS breaks, even when I knew they were total assholes.

My therapist and I did some digging on Monday to figure out why it is I can't be single, why I give so much to relationships, and why I always give in to men. It stems from my childhood, basically.  I always knew it sucked having alcoholic, unaffectionate parents, being an only child, and taking care of myself since I was 9.  But I never realized that it is directly tied to my desire to fall in love and start my own family (I'm about to be 25).  I've never had that security that comes when you are strongly loved, even though I always knew my parents loved me.  I never had someone I could go to to feel safe and comforted.  No one to hold me when I felt like the world was out to get me.  I've spent my WHOLE LIFE struggling on my own with NO ONE to be there unconditionally. I've always felt like a burden to people. And all I have ever wanted was someone to want me, to treat me like I'm important, to treat me like I'm special, and to not leave me.

This is why my past relationships have always ended the same.  Even more so, this is why I am hurting so badly now, because Greg gave me all these things until he told me he was leaving.  He was the first person to really look at me and tell me I was beautiful. Plenty of men have said I was hot, sexy, etc, but that doesn't mean shit these days.  I always forgive men, let them get away with virtually anything, and then they take off and I hurt because I gave it all.  

I have my hobbies.  I have my goals.  I have friends.  I'm on meds that stabilize daily anxiety and depression.  But jesus christ I am so tired of feeling alone."

Now before you doubt how much work i have really done (being that i am only a freshman) hear me out, i am an electrical and computer engineering major with a declared minor in computer science and 2 of my 5 core classes for the minor already covered by my AP credits from highschool. This semester i took Digital Logic, and in my own sparetime over the last 6 years i have learned a few languages and become familiar with several others. Languages include C, Verilog, C++, BASIC, VB, Java, LabView, Perl, JavaScript and Python. I also work on small projects using AVR's and BASIC Stamps. Finally, next semester i will be taking Object Oriented Programming and Data Abstraction. I am also proficient in handling windows well beyond the task manager (sysinternals=love), i have played with various linux distros and i have tried my hand at the terminal and programming/scripting from within terminals on both linux and windows.

The point is, I am obviously well versed for a college freshman but i have no idea how to express that in a resume. Furthermore, my OOPDA class will probably be the most powerful force in my resume but i wont even be taking that until next semester. This is an issue because i would like to get this whole application process done during the break, not in june when i will finally get my grades and i would like to be starting.

Essentially my question is how do i make all of my own personal education and highschool/first-college-semester education look better to prospective employers?

Apologies for the wall of text.

This Christmas season, I've set out to build a PC. All my life, I've been ""that kid"" who is using an old office computer to game. I've had a few ""nicer"" office computers, but nothing designed for gaming. For a very long time, all I ever knew was low settings and 20 FPS. Even today, on my laptop, I get maybe 40FPS on Source games and by making the resolution 800x600.

That all is about to change. No more will I be held down by the restraints of a poor rig! I shall finally be able to experience games as they were meant to be played!

Except I don't know shit from shinola. The last time I ""built"" a computer, I was in 8th grade and we merely installed hard drives and RAM. I can ask for help with the physical part of building the rig from a fellow at the company I intern at. But besides that, I'm flying blind. I've read most of the beginner guides, and even then I'm overwhelmed. I read post here, and it seems like every day something newer and better is coming out, and I don't know what to get.

So I come to you, begging for advice. For the most part, I understand dealing with computers once they are up and running. Dealing with the parts is a whole need field to me. Plus, I always fear that I'll break something, a fear giving to me by father (To this day, the words ""Luke! You break everything"" still echo in my years.)

Budget-wise, I'm running at about 800 dollars, though it can go over slightly if it must. I don't need a keyboard and mouse, seeing as I can upgrade those later. Monitor wise, I should be able to get one or two for very cheap, if not free, thanks to my father. Case wise, I don't care. It can look like an old monochrome box for all I care. I just want it to run well.

tl;dr - Newbie to building, and scared shitless. Has about 800/850 dollars to spend. No need for monitors/mouse/keyboard."

I often get pulled into jumping for Jesus, and get prayed for by ministers who want me to 'Pray through', to 'Give it all to God' and to 'Stop making God a casual thing'. I love God with all my heart, I love my Jesus so much, that I decided that staying sexually pure for him until marriage was the right thing to do. To represent my commitment to him, I wear a Purity Ring on  my left ring finger. When I wore it to church, my pastor approached me, asking me to remove said ring. I didn't want to make a scene about it, but I did ask, 'Do you not believe in Purity Rings?'. His response was 'not 'till you're married'. I removed it only for the cause of preventing a scene being caused. It hurts to remove it at church; it hurts to get judged for every little thing I do, and it hurts to get preached at for said things. I love God so much, and I highly doubt a God of Love works that way. I have 'spoken in tongues', but I know that all it is, is an Emotional high. It's fake, at least in the UPCI's form of preaching it. People love it, because being wild is fun, especially when a crowd of people are joining you. I notice that it's all just repetitive gibberish, which has no scripture to back up that it's the evidence of having the Holy Ghost, and that it's essential to enter Heaven. I have friends who visited my church, and were told they would not see heaven of they did not speak in tongues. One of them even repeated the gibberish that the ministers were telling him to repeat because he just wanted the ministers off his back. In his head, he was praying for the ministers to leave him.alone.

When we take communion, we are told that we MUST be right with God, otherwise we will bring damnation on our souls. I saw, with tears in my eyes, my mother and sister not participate in Communion as they were met with judgemental looks. My mom is often the outcast of the church, and only a few members speak with her. It hurts me to see my mom cry over this. My Pastor is a good man, but is very authorative, and demands  commitment to every event that the church has. He even rebuked me for skipping Fellowship group because I visited a friend who I hadn't seen for  months. My church lacks a Youth Group. It's so hard to live for God without having  fellowship with young Christians who share your passion. I asked my Pastor if I could miss Wednesday Prayer so I could visit Landmark's Youth Group. He strongly opposed it, and said that he won't have musicians who aren't faithful to the house of God, and that we don't even know the Doctrine that is preached at Landmark. Simply put, I want to leave my church. 


...I'm so scared to do so, though. I'm 18, you see, and I have spend my whole life in the Apostolic Community. I have so many friends who are Apostolic, and I don't want to lose them, but I know I will be shunned if I leave. I know my Pastor will play the 'We don't have anyone to replace you on the Keyboard' card, and that I will 'lose my salvation'. You see, I want to be a Youth Pastor, and my Pastor has asked me to be a Youth Pastor Intern, but I simply refuse to preach the lies of the UPCI. My parents support me, but my little sister often judges me for wanting to leave. Thank God no one else in my family is Apostolic, otherwise I would die of a broken heart for all the 'shame' I would have of being a 'backslider'. It hurts to think of all the connections I'll lose, but I no longer want to live for God out of fear. I want to be my God's friend. I'm so scared, and I am asking for help.

Your Brother in Jesus,

nalwz,89,2011-12-12,Heels and Elbows baby!,ARDad,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/nalwz/heels_and_elbows_baby/,"Roll the clock back about 18 years.  I'm working my first tech support job as an intern.  Our area in the building is in the basement (I know, SHOCKER!) right next to the raised floor with the old IBM ES390 mainframe.  The intern area is right inside the doors off the loading ramp for the raised floor.  Leaving the raised floor to the ""customer"" area, perpendicular to the door leading to the area I'm working in are these double doors with a big red mushroom button next to them that shuts off power to the whole raised floor.  Right below that red button is a green one, same shape and size, that deactivated the maglock to open the door....  My best friend works there also, he's a tape monkey for the backups on the ES390.  One Saturday, I'm building/imaging PCs for my ""customers"" (we were each assigned a department to work with our mentors..) and talking to my friend and the electrician the company has in to replace the mushroom switch for one with a cover that you have to flip up to press it.  The electrician says ""Hey guys, want to come over and smack this mushroom switch before I take it down?  It's completely disconnected and won't turn off a thing, it'll be fun!"".  Clearly, this guy got his electricians license from the cracker jack box.  Neither one of us budge, there is no way in HELL I'm touching that thing, no matter what he says.  We tell him that, and just to be a smartass, he turns and punches the button.  .


Ever hear a 3000 square foot raised floor lose power to everything at the same time?  All the inverters, AC units, tape drives, RAID cabinets, ES390 cabinets, server and switch racks, EVERYTHING spun down.  My friend and I register what just happened (of course, we looked toward the raised floor when all this went down) and we turn to say something (what, I'm just not sure) to the electrician and we literally see one heel and one elbow as he BURSTS through the double doors and runs out of the building.  Gone.  Totally.

within seconds, our beepers start going off (yes, I said 18 years ago!) and we start making phone calls.  Withing 20 minutes, all the IT staff and infrastructure staff is onsite, with the electrical companies owner.  he's taking a ton of shit.  the guy he had onsite called him, told him what happened and quit over the phone.  It took us 28 hours to IPL the ES390 (boot it, from a dirty file system state, it took a LONG time) and we lost about 25 hard drives.  We suspect that the drives simply mechanically wouldn't spin anymore since they were stopped.


Anyway, the new switch was installed and we all got everything going again, restored from backups, etc by Monday AM.  The electrical company had to pay everyone's OT, and cover any costs IBM through our way (we were a complete IBM shop, EVEYRTHING what IBM).  

TLDR; electrician did his best Usain Bolt impression after screwing up what should have been a simple job (although at the time Carl Lewis would have been a better analogy) "

SLU is up to no good!!",seekingjustice2012,Louisiana,https://www.reddit.com/r/Louisiana/comments/nakwf/if_you_live_near_hammond_please_read_this_slu_is/,"Southern Louisiana, you disappoint me. I wrote -EVERY- media outlet I could find an address for in the area and told them about Southeastern Louisiana University suing to contest my great aunt's last will and testament. In what amounts to blatant fraud and taking advantage of the elderly, SLU wined and dined my great aunt and got themselves written into her will. When she was admitted to the hospital with terminal cancer, my grandmother, my mother, and my aunt showed up to take care of her as well as watch over her home and property- which had already been used for personal profit by the 'nice lady down the street'. My great aunt realized she was wrong to have left out her own blood from her last will, and changed it in the hospital two weeks before she died.

In an -unprecedented- move, SLU sued the estate of my great aunt. Yes, that's right, a publicly funded institution is suing to gain control of a family's last Louisiana home. So far, it's easy to say that the university has spent more on attorneys fees than the property is even worth.

Ladies and Gentlemen of the internet, it is time to stand up to institutions like this and hold them accountable for spending our hard-earned money. I have written the Governor of Louisiana as well as the President of SLU, Dr. John Crain, with an offer for a generous donation in my great aunt's name for them to drop the lawsuit.

I have yet to see a response from either individual or a representative of their offices.

How can people sleep at night knowing that the very institutions that we pay for will break every fundraising ethics rule (and even federal law) to make a quick buck?

Do you think my family is the only family SLU has done this to? They saw dollar signs when they took my great aunt out to formal dinners with a 19 year old intern as her escort (that goes waaaaay beyond cougar, my friends). They saw dollar signs when my great aunt donated small sums to SLU (could it have been because she was a teacher her whole life?). And they saw dollar signs when they noticed she owned a home, and had been a widow for some time. They neglected to realize she had any family in the area, and broke fundraising rules by intentionally separating her from her family. 

Sadly, there is very little public exposure for this heinous crime, as the media will not investigate the story while the court case is ongoing. Instead, the judge will most likely rule in favor of the University as he himself is an alumni of SLU and as we all know, Louisiana isn't exactly free of nepotism and corruption.

Shame on you Louisiana. For letting a school that you pay for, that should be accountable to you for its actions, to take a home from a family while posting a loss of money to pay for the attorneys fees.

Shame on all of us for not taking a stand, and instead finding comfort in the warm embrace of apathy.

If you care, feel free to repost this to your page and express your feelings. I welcome a hearty debate should you feel SLU is doing the right thing.

najmi,6,2011-12-12,Has anyone studied  P.R and then realized it totally was not for them?,marieelaine03,PublicRelations,https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicRelations/comments/najmi/has_anyone_studied_pr_and_then_realized_it/,"This might not be the best place for me to post my question, as anyone who isn't interested in P.R probably won't look at this sub reddit, but I figured I'd ask...

When I was 17 and needed to decide what to study, I chose Public Relations without any hesitation at all...I thought I'd love it, and more importantly, I thought I'd be good at it...I guess you can say I had passion for it.
I went to cegep (mandatory in Quebec before going to university) for 2 years in Communications.
Then I did a 4-year bachelor's degree in Communication Studies.
And to add to it, I did a 2-year university certificate in public relations management.
That's a total of 8 years of school for this.

I needed to get a good stable job to pay rent...I went on a few P.R job interviews but did not get the job.
I then took an office job so I can live comfortably and pay the rent.

I've worked there for 3 years now.
Family and friends ask me when I'm going to start working in P.R...some even send me links to job postings and let me know when internships are available.
The trouble is that I have absolutely no passion for it anymore.. I actually don't see myself being successful in the type of business...I just don't see it happening.
I know I don't want to work in an office forever though...so I've decided to start a new 4-year program to become an elementary school teacher.

I have a friend who also studied PR, and she has been working in the industry for the past 4 years. Her resume is super impressive, she's worked for really important huge multi-million dollar corporations as a PR / Media person. When I think about that, I get a little twinge in the sense that "" could I have done that too, had I just worked harder to get a job in the field?""...but then again, if my passion is absolutely and 100% gone, there's a reason for that!
I don't regret studying P.R in any way because at the time I absolutely loved studying it and enjoyed my time at school....
but part of me hates that I kind of wasted a lot of money/time.

So my question to you guys : when you finished your studies and started working in P.R...was the passion still there?
Did you have any second thoughts like I did..or did you still feel you were right for the industry?
Did you start working in P.R and then realize it's not what you thought it would be? (and if so..did you still stick it out and work in the field even though you didn't love it?)...or did the opposite happen, and working in P.R was exactly what you'd thought?

This is just for my curiosity, but I appreciate any response :) thanks!"

I'm having problem in determining what to buy for winter in the Northeast USA. I'll be be moving in January to Connecticut, commuting to NYC for a internship in video post production. 

I've practically have lived all my life in a place where the minimum in winter is 70F (Puerto Rico). As such, practically all my clothes are suited for summer. I do have a couple of sweaters and hoodies, but that is all in regards to cold weather clothing.

I'm aware that I need to buy a coat, boots and winter accessories. My question is, what kind of coat and boots could I buy that can handle a Connecticut winter while still being somewhat fashionable? I know that in freezing temperatures sometimes being fashionable is not an option, but would like to know my options. Would a peacoat keep me warm in 15F to 20F? If not, what kind of coats would work for that? Would [this](http://canvas.landsend.com/pp/LaceupBoots~212469_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::ZDB&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_Men-_-ShoesAccessories-_-Shoes&amp;origin=index) boots be enough to last me thorough winter? They can be had for $70 now. I expect to walk about 30 minutes from the home I'm staying to the train station in Connecticut. 

My budget is around $275 for both the boots and coat. Since I don't have a lot of money, I would like that the items I buy would be as versatile as possible. Can it be done?

PS. I'm 5'9"", weight between 155-160 and about to turn 22, if that sort info is of any use. Also, are long johns necessary?

Dexter is like ""woah this search engine is good, I'm gonna stalk all my victims and secret shit on it from now on"". This had NO IMPORTANCE on the show's plot, yet the scene was placed there for a reason.

Knowing that Lewis is a typical TV-show ""computer geek-hacker"" maybe he made this search engine himself that logs searches, and only told Dexter? So Lewis can see his search history? Maybe not cause he thought he was a killer but because he has a boner for Dexter. After this he found a correlation between Dexter's search history and recent future events (I think he searched for a bunch of suspicious things before they were known to the force). And now he knows Dexter is not who he seems.

ncq1p,49,2011-12-14,"SEX. There, do I have your attention? (This post is long and hard)",tossaway_FTM,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/ncq1p/sex_there_do_i_have_your_attention_this_post_is/,"Well it’s probably a bad idea for me to be writing this right now because it’s finals week and in the words of Anya: “These things are real, they’re dangerous, and they’re coming.”  

But I wanted to share this kind of bizarre experience I had that was very outside my comfort zone but ended up being really rewarding in a strange way.  

I’m not an outgoing guy as far as romance goes. I started transition when I was 18 and I’m nearly 25 now and the last time I had sex it was before I was even out yet, so you do the math. I think part of my gender identity disorder manifests in that I don’t see myself as sexy, or as a sexual being. My mental age in that category is stuck at 16—I just don’t ever feel like I’m ready to share my body with anyone else. It’s private, and it’s not exactly a place of happiness for me. My body has been my main source of unhappiness for all my life, how can I feel comfortable letting other people see it?

And now, many years on T later and years out of top surgery (the number of people who have seen my post-op chest, I can count on one hand), I still can’t help the feeling that my body is gross, unsexy, how could anyone find me attractive, just no. I can barely look at myself below the belt, why should anyone else want to conduct business anywhere in that vicinity?  

But recently I’ve been horny, ok? So shoot me. I think I passed the many sexless years with grace and dignity, and now I wanted to just get some. And I wanted a man, a biological, cisgender man.  

I should add that I’ve never been with a cis-man before. I had never touched a dick or even seen one that close up, let alone let anyone fuck me. The last time someone put something up there, I was on my gyno’s table and it was hot, let me tell you. (That’s a joke, BTW. It was extremely traumatic and I immediately had a panic attack.)  

Anyway, I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I wanted to know, to absolutely *know*, what I’m missing. I wanted a man to lay in my bed, take his god damn clothes off, and let me touch him just about everywhere. And I didn’t want him to touch me, because I’m sexless and unattractive and no one wants to be with me because gross. I just wanted him to be my human model so I could get a look at what I don’t have and never will have.  

This semester I “studied abroad,” but actually I just went to my state capitol city for four months and worked an internship. I got a four-month lease on a student apartment so I had a perfect place to experiment on any possible male trysts. So I was just missing a dude with a dick who would let me touch him and possibly put his dick in my mouth. Hey, I said I was curious. So sue me.  

So I went to the same place you always go when you need something strange: THE INTERNET. And it took a few weeks, but eventually a guy did message me. And I swear, he was *perfect*. 33 years old, attractive, interested in trans guys (it’s possible he was a chaser but I really don’t care because I was essentially “chasing” him too), and he told me two key things during messaging before meeting him:  

1.	He would do as much or as little as I wanted and he wouldn’t push or hassle me about it.
2.	He would lay back and let me explore his body.  

Fucking perfect, right?? That’s what I’m saying!  

So long story short, at the beginning of the semester he came over and let me do what I wanted to him, and I did what I wanted. And he even got me to take my shirt off. I had completely forgotten how nice it was to have someone touch my skin like that. So even though I was nervous about it, he made me feel really good about it. He *liked* my chest, and he liked what I was doing to him.  

For the record, it turns out I give *great* blowjobs.  

He left after he came, I never let him touch me anywhere below my belt but I told him if he wanted to do it again some time then he was welcome to come back. I told him when I was leaving town and he said OK. In the morning I texted him “Hey thanks for letting me blow you” essentially, he said, “Nah bro thank YOU,” and that was that for a few weeks.  

About two weeks ago he texted me again, he wanted to come over and this time he wanted to “go further.” I freaked out for a few days, finally texted him back saying, essentially, “Sounds scary but let’s do it.”  

I threw caution to the wind. I was very scared to let him see me, and possibly even fuck me, but the thing is that he was a really sweet guy and I knew he would stop if I felt uncomfortable, and the even bigger thing is that I knew, I just *knew*, that I would regret it if I didn’t take this opportunity. So I decided to just do it.  

Well, he came over last night and I let him do whatever the fuck he wanted to do, and it was great, okay? Just great. I didn’t have an orgasm but that’s ok because even on the best of days it’s hard for me to come, let alone with this relative stranger conducting business near my junk. It still felt fucking awesome and I was still really glad I did it.  

But I think the best thing I got out of this whole experience is that, yes, there are people who are going to be attracted to me, and they can be nice people! They can be cool people and people with interests similar to mine. I don’t have to be alone forever, as long as I take a little extra effort to put myself out there and meet people.  

So here’s my advice to struggling trans people out there in the lonely stealth world: *Do one thing that scares you every day.* Just do one thing that puts you outside of your comfort zone even just a little bit, and you will find that your zone is expanding faster than you could ever have imagined it would.  

Thanks for reading, if you read it. I know it’s a lot but I just had to get it out there.  

TL;DR – I fucked a cis-guy and it was AWESOME.

I've got a 2.5 year old MacBook Pro (2.8 Core 2 Duo/4 GB DDR3/NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT 512 MB/500 GB @ 5400 RPM) that I am in love with. I don't know what everyone here thinks about the whole Mac vs. PC thing, but this computer works flawlessly almost all the time, and everything I throw at it runs smoothly. Plus, its less than an inch thick and made of metal - I've never felt a computer with a better build quality. However, I am a college student and recently switched to an Engineering program for which a Intel X64 based system running windows is absolutely required. I tried a virtual machine this semester, but continually ran into compatibility problems. So, I've gotta buy a Windows laptop.

Option One: spend $400-$600 on a machine that can get me through 2.5 more years of engineering school, and hang on to my MacBook Pro as 'my computer.' It needs to be relatively fast (in my head I've got a requirement of at least an i5, but please correct me if this is overkill). Some of the programs we run are sort of resource intensive, and I don't want it to be constantly struggling. Multitasking is a necessity, so minimum 4GB of RAM but more is better. I'd love to have dedicated graphics in there as well, but I realize that is definitely rare in this price range. 

Option Two: Sell my MacBook Pro ($1000-1200) and get a Windows machine for $1000-1400 that will far outspec the Pro I have now. Can I get a laptop for that price that will run Windows 7 as smoothly as mine runs OS X? I've been shopping around, but there are so many options it is hard to quantify everything. If I take this option, it needs to be able to handle music, photo, and video editing easily, as well as be up for occasional light gaming (aka I play Portal every now and then). I'd also want something with superior build quality that doesn't flex or bend everytime I pick it up. 

EDIT: I've been eyeing the Lenovo ThinkPad T line for the second option, because there is something catchy about their understated business looks to me. Also, I used an old T60 in an internship over the summer, and that thing was built like a tank! Holding me back is the seemingly underperforming specs for the price.

I appreciate your help, r/SuggestALaptop!"

My advisor has treated me with scorn, indifference, and disdain since my first semester, when I was going through a traumatic life event and failed Statistics by one point (made a 69% - you're not allowed to make anything less than a C).

Despite the fact that I retook the course the following year and made an A, he has continued to make my life terrible. Here's a short list off the top of my head:

-When I failed Statistics at the end of my first Fall semester, he told me I had until Spring to make straight As, increase my class participation, and write a paper for publication, even though a) no other first year students were required to write a paper for publication and b) at least 1-2 students fail this course EVERY YEAR (the prof is a beast), and every single other student had the opportunity to take it the following year. Or, in other words, I was the only one who was threatened with being kicked out of the program and not automatically given the chance to take it the following year - I had to earn the chance.

-He regularly damages my reputation. For instance, we went to a conference and ended up going out to dinner with some very big names in my research field. I was sitting right next to this big name guy, and my advisor said, to the entire table of 12 people, that I had failed statistics, even though at that point I had already gone back and was making an A in the course. He said this in front of four prominent researchers and three of the other grad students in my lab. 

-He also trashtalks me in the Psychology building. For instance, we were interviewing potential graduate students last year and one of them admitted she wasn't good at stats. I was walking down the hall when I (and others) heard him discussing this with our lab manager, and he said ""I don't want to have another ""PhDinCruelty"" situation.""

-In terms of opportunities, he often does things that are unfair. For instance, he regularly writes book chapters and allows various grad students to collaborate with him. I have expressed interest in co-writing a chapter, but he's given three chapters to other students ""because I know they'll do it right.""

-One other grad student and I went to a conference last spring, and I'm more financially strained than the other students due to family circumstances. I asked him if he could cover any or part of my costs to the conference, and he said no. Then he fully funded the one other grad student who went.

-He also does small slights - for example, a job candidate recently came to interview for a position in the department. My advisor introduced the candidate to three of his other graduate students and didn't introduce her to me, even though I was in the room. There are other things, like the fact that he barely says hello to me in the hallway, barely makes eye contact, NEVER converses with me but converses with the other grad students, etc. These things sound small, but they contribute to the overall sensation of being pretty orphaned in my research.

-He HATES my papers, but refuses to give specific feedback as to how to improve them. For instance, he refuses to send my most recent paper off for publication because he hates the Lit Review, but either will not or cannot give specific feedback as to why, so I have to send it to other professors in the department to get more specific or concrete feedback.

-He did not read my master's thesis before my defense

-He kept one of my papers for six months without giving me feedback on it

-For the most recent conference, three other grad students were funded for 100% of their travel costs; I was funded for 50%

-One of my papers was rejected, and he immediately said, ""We need to bring in ______"", with ""_______"" being another member of my lab) - he asked her to help ""revamp"" it, even though two other members of my lab also recently got rejections and he didn't feel the need to add additional authors to ""revamp.""

-He allowed me to write an entire paper on gender, which took more than a year, then decided he didn't want gender in the paper.

-He insults my writing regularly, using phrases like ""this reads like a term paper,"" or, my favorite, ""Meh.""

I have spoken with the Director of Graduate Studies about this multiple times, and he is friendly enough, but not helpful. I have asked another professor if I could switch to her (her research interests are congruent with mine), but she has too many students.

This advisor of mine is in a high-powered position in my department and is the one who writes our letters of recommendation when we go to internship. I am afraid to cross him and make him dislike me more than he already does. I have no idea why I displease him so - I only know that I have quite a span of time left in the program and I could really use an advisor that allows me harvest the potential I have, as it is certainly not happening in this professional relationship.

What do I do, Reddit?
P.S. This is a throwaway, as my main account has some identifying info in my posts/comments.

**tl;dr My advisor treats me horribly, to the point that it's affecting my experience in the graduate program and also my future career. Nothing has helped so far. What do I do?**

I'm going to be living in another city (150km away) for an intership from February to May 2012.
Important: We share 90% of our friends and hang-out places. So we can't really go ""on a break"" mentally as we'll see each other at least twice a week.

We've been together since February 2008, so a bit short of four years. We were a high-school couple.

She doubted our relationship two weeks ago, saying she didn't know where it went. Saying she couldn't really picture me in her future.  I fought for our relationship that whole weekend. We (she?) decided to give it another chance.

But this night, it all came out. The doubts never left. Contrary to that, we had a really great time this weekend. We did a lot of things together, enjoyed each other, had good sex (imho). To me, signs that everything was okay. But I felt uneasy.

Yesterday evening, she texted me saying how she loved me, how she wanted to persevere even though I'd be leaving for the internship. She's clearly battling her own emotions, but seems to have taken a permanent decision.

She doesn't love me enough. It has been that way for some time. I clearly remember me always feeling like the one who needed more affection, even though I'm the dude. (Yes, I know that's macho.)
But I always attributed that to me being overly needy and her being normal.

Right now, I don't know what the fuck to do.

I had three securities, things that made me who I am: My family, my friends and my girlfriend.
My friends are very supportive, they've already checked up on me.

But what the fuck? It was me and her. We love(d) each other. I still fucking do, so much. I didn't care the lack of affection, I was happy with what I had.

And what now? I have fucking nothing. I just feel betrayed and humiliated.

What can I do to get over this as soon as possible?"

in Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur specifically), had some 
questions",Progenitus,malaysia,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/neexg/hi_rmalaysia_im_going_to_be_spending_some_time_in/,"I've asked this in /r/travel as well, but I figured going to locals would also be a good plan!

I've got the opportunity to spend 6 weeks doing a work study/internship in Kuala Lumpur in May/June. I haven't officially decided to go or not, but I almost certainly will be.

My first concern is getting an accurate idea of how much it's going to cost me; flights and accommodations are taken care of in the program cost, so I was hoping someone could give me an estimate of what kind of costs I'd be looking at for food/travel. The apartments are apparently located in the heart of the city (listed as 'across the street' from the Petronas Towers), but lets assume I'm going to have to use transit to and from work each day.

Second, I'd really love some ideas on what to do in my free time. As I said, I'll be doing an internship during the day but I'll have evenings and weekends free. The program includes two 'cultural trips' which I believe leave the city, although I'm not sure what they entail. That leaves me a few weekends free that I'd be willing to go somewhere if it was feasible.

Lastly, any tips about living in Kuala Lumpur/Malaysia in general, be it culture, cuisine, work ethics, etc. would be fantastic.

Thanks!"

life this way?"". Well dont worry. Because i really swear it that
i wont bug you. I will not abuse this privalage of having your
email. You wont hear from me again... Probably, unless i have
something new to offer you. The reason i'm writing now, in the
back of a car taking me to the Tonight Show set, is to let you
know that as of now there is some new and cool stuff on my site,
related to Live at the Beacon Theater. Theres a thing where you
can download and print a dvd box cover and label so you can burn
and make your own dvd of the video. And theres a new option where
you can gift the special to as many people as you want (for 5
bucks each) and they'll get a nice gifty email from you with a
link to the video.

Also, some of you may know, i recently made a statement (that
sounds so dumb. Like i'm the president or something) about how the
video has been doing online. Im pasting it in here below in case
you missed it.

Lastly I'm planning to put some more outtakes of the show on
youtube and i think i will put one on the site that is only
available for free to you folks on this list, who bought the

===========================
People of Earth (minus the ones who don't give a shit about
this): it's been amazing to conduct this experiment with you. The
experiment was: if I put out a brand new standup special at a
drastically low price ($5) and make it as easy as possible to
buy, download and enjoy, free of any restrictions, will everyone
just go and steal it? Will they pay for it? And how much money
can be made by an individual in this manner?

It's been 4 days. A lot of people are asking me how it's going.
I've been hesitant to share the actual figures, because there's
power in exclusive ownership of information. What I didn't expect
when I started this was that people would not only take part in
this experiment, they would be invested in it and it would be
important to them. It's been amazing to see people in large
numbers advocating this idea. So I think it's only fair that you
get to know the results. Also, it's just really cool and fun and
I'm dying to tell everybody. I told my Mom, I told three friends,
and that wasn't nearly enough. So here it is.

First of all, this was a premium video production, shot with six
cameras over two performances at the Beacon Theater, which is a
high-priced elite Manhattan venue. I directed this video myself
and the production of the video cost around $170,000. (This was
largely paid for by the tickets bought by the audiences at both
shows). The material in the video was developed over months on
the road and has never been seen on my show (LOUIE) or on any
other special. The risks were thus: every new generation of
material I create is my income, it's like a farmer's annual crop.
The time and effort on my part was far more than if I'd done it
with a big company. If I'd done it with a big company, I would
have a guarantee of a sizable fee, as opposed to this way, where
I'm actually investing my own money.

The development of the website, which needed to be a very robust,
reliable and carefully constructed website, was around $32,000.
We worked for a number of weeks poring over the site to make sure
every detail would give buyers a simple, optimal and humane
experience for buying the video. I edited the video around the
clock for the weeks between the show and the launch.

The show went on sale at noon on Saturday, December 10th. 12
hours later, we had over 50,000 purchases and had earned
$250,000, breaking even on the cost of production and website. As
of Today, we've sold over 110,000 copies for a total of over
$500,000. Minus some money for PayPal charges etc, I have a
profit around $200,000 (after taxes $75.58). This is less than I
would have been paid by a large company to simply perform the
show and let them sell it to you, but they would have charged you
about $20 for the video. They would have given you an encrypted
and regionally restricted video of limited value, and they would
have owned your private information for their own use. They would
have withheld international availability indefinitely. This way,
you only paid $5, you can use the video any way you want, and you
can watch it in Dublin, whatever the city is in Belgium, or
Dubai. I got paid nice, and I still own the video (as do you).
You never have to join anything, and you never have to hear from
us again.

I really hope people keep buying it a lot, so I can have
shitloads of money, but at this point I think we can safely say
that the experiment really worked. If anybody stole it, it wasn't
many of you. Pretty much everybody bought it. And so now we all
get to know that about people and stuff. I'm really glad I put
this out here this way and I'll certainly do it again. If the
trend continues with sales on this video, my goal is that i can
reach the point where when I sell anything, be it videos, CDs or
tickets to my tours, I'll do it here and I'll continue to follow
the model of keeping my price as far down as possible, not
overmarketing to you, keeping as few people between you and me as
possible in the transaction. (Of course i reserve the right to go
back on all of this and sign a massive deal with a company that
pays me fat coin and charges you straight up the ass.). (This is
you: yes Louie. And we'll all enjoy torrenting that content. You
fat sweaty dolt).

I probably sound kind of crazy right now. It's been a really fun
and intense few days. This video was paid for by people who
bought tickets, and then bought by people who wanted to see that
same show. I got to do exactly the show I wanted, and exactly the
show you wanted.

I also got an education. And everything i learned are things i
was happy to learn. I learned that people are interested in what
happens and shit (i didn't go to college)

I learned that money can be a lot of things. It can be something
that is hoarded, fought over, protected, stolen and withheld. Or
it can be like an energy, fueled by the desire, will, creative
interest, need to laugh, of large groups of people. And it can be
shuffled and pushed around and pooled together to fuel a common
interest, jokes about garbage, penises and parenthood.

I want to thank Blair Breard who produced this video and produces
my series LOUIE, and I want to thank Caspar and Giles at Version
Industries, who created the website.

I hope with all of my heart that I stay funny. Otherwise this all
goes to hell. Please have a safe and happy holiday, and thank you
again for all this crazy shit.

Sincerely, Louis C.K."

    First of all, this was a premium video production, shot with six
    cameras over two performances at the Beacon Theater, which is a
    high-priced elite Manhattan venue. I directed this video myself
    and the production of the video cost around $170,000. (This was
    largely paid for by the tickets bought by the audiences at both
    shows). The material in the video was developed over months on
    the road and has never been seen on my show (LOUIE) or on any
    other special. The risks were thus: every new generation of
    material I create is my income, it's like a farmer's annual crop.
    The time and effort on my part was far more than if I'd done it
    with a big company. If I'd done it with a big company, I would
    have a guarantee of a sizable fee, as opposed to this way, where
    I'm actually investing my own money.

    The development of the website, which needed to be a very robust,
    reliable and carefully constructed website, was around $32,000.
    We worked for a number of weeks poring over the site to make sure
    every detail would give buyers a simple, optimal and humane
    experience for buying the video. I edited the video around the
    clock for the weeks between the show and the launch.

    The show went on sale at noon on Saturday, December 10th. 12
    hours later, we had over 50,000 purchases and had earned
    $250,000, breaking even on the cost of production and website. As
    of Today, we've sold over 110,000 copies for a total of over
    $500,000. Minus some money for PayPal charges etc, I have a
    profit around $200,000 (after taxes $75.58). This is less than I
    would have been paid by a large company to simply perform the
    show and let them sell it to you, but they would have charged you
    about $20 for the video. They would have given you an encrypted
    and regionally restricted video of limited value, and they would
    have owned your private information for their own use. They would
    have withheld international availability indefinitely. This way,
    you only paid $5, you can use the video any way you want, and you
    can watch it in Dublin, whatever the city is in Belgium, or
    Dubai. I got paid nice, and I still own the video (as do you).
    You never have to join anything, and you never have to hear from
    us again.

    I really hope people keep buying it a lot, so I can have
    shitloads of money, but at this point I think we can safely say
    that the experiment really worked. If anybody stole it, it wasn't
    many of you. Pretty much everybody bought it. And so now we all
    get to know that about people and stuff. I'm really glad I put
    this out here this way and I'll certainly do it again. If the
    trend continues with sales on this video, my goal is that i can
    reach the point where when I sell anything, be it videos, CDs or
    tickets to my tours, I'll do it here and I'll continue to follow
    the model of keeping my price as far down as possible, not
    overmarketing to you, keeping as few people between you and me as
    possible in the transaction. (Of course i reserve the right to go
    back on all of this and sign a massive deal with a company that
    pays me fat coin and charges you straight up the ass.). (This is
    you: yes Louie. And we'll all enjoy torrenting that content. You
    fat sweaty dolt).

    I probably sound kind of crazy right now. It's been a really fun
    and intense few days. This video was paid for by people who
    bought tickets, and then bought by people who wanted to see that
    same show. I got to do exactly the show I wanted, and exactly the
    show you wanted.

    I also got an education. And everything i learned are things i
    was happy to learn. I learned that people are interested in what
    happens and shit (i didn't go to college)

    I learned that money can be a lot of things. It can be something
    that is hoarded, fought over, protected, stolen and withheld. Or
    it can be like an energy, fueled by the desire, will, creative
    interest, need to laugh, of large groups of people. And it can be
    shuffled and pushed around and pooled together to fuel a common
    interest, jokes about garbage, penises and parenthood.

    I want to thank Blair Breard who produced this video and produces
    my series LOUIE, and I want to thank Caspar and Giles at Version
    Industries, who created the website.

    I hope with all of my heart that I stay funny. Otherwise this all
    goes to hell. Please have a safe and happy holiday, and thank you
    again for all this crazy shit.

    Sincerely, Louis C.K."
ndwkw,0,2011-12-15,"Post-high school Redditors, what would you say about your favorite/most hated high school teachers?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ndwkw/posthigh_school_redditors_what_would_you_say/,"I stumbled across the RateMyTeachers page for my high school and felt it important to impart some wisdom to the younger generation.  Also, I thought it necessary to equalize the high and low ratings I didn't agree with a bit (Up Voting and Down Voting has taught me so much).  I tried to give as much detail as I could about why I did or did not like some of my teachers and found the process somewhat cathartic: It felt good to say how truly awesome some of my teachers were as well as how lame some of the others were.  In fact, here's what I wrote (characters were limited, so...):

German Teacher:  If you never take German from this man, just go shoot yourself.  I took German I with Mrs. Trulson, followed by German II with Mr. Telford, and what a difference.  He actually lived in Germany for a time and taught English, so he has a keen understanding of the language and culture.  He doesn't just teach the words and syntax, there's focus on correct pronunciation (so important) as well as German culture.  After taking his class, Germany has become one of the countries I most desire to visit.

English Teacher:  He instilled in me a love for literature and writing I hadn't known before. His class definitely prepares you for college. I'm working on my Master's in Electrical Engineering and still have a deep appreciation and affection for the knowledge and experience I gained from his class. I still regret that I didn't take AP with him, just honors. I had been in a slump my junior year, but his class renewed my vigor and thirst for knowledge. It made me enjoy literature classes in college. Take him!

Drafting Teacher:  I had two years of drafting with Mr. Parke, and it's amazing how much he taught us.  Hand-drawing as a ""baby drafter"" was fun, but is really more to help you appreciate drafting software.  Once you tackle the crane hook you can handle anything!  My little brother took Drafting I, II, III, and IV eventually getting to work on special projects.  He's studying Electrical Engineering at UTC and just landed an internship with TVA because his drafting skills were seen as a huge plus for some projects.

Math Teacher:  Mrs. Todd is a wonderful woman. I had her for Pre-Algebra and Algebra I in junior high (Unity), then Trig in high school. Her lessons were always straight-forward and easy to follow. I regret not taking Calculus with her in high school. I'm now working on a Master's in Electrical Engineering and still have a fondness for the tricks and mnemonic devices she taught us. She was also one of the few teachers who gave students a break occasionally and let us have free days (chess and checkers!)

English/Latin Teacher:  Mr. Ham will always be one of the greats in my mind. He's been around the world and did so much that it's hard to believe he's content to teach in a small community. I was lucky to have him for English and Latin in junior high (Unity). He's extremely knowledgable and downright interesting. He taught me the beauty and power of etymology. Aside from that, he sparked my interest in Greek mythology. Fayetteville is lucky to have him and his epic beard.

Drama Teacher:  A pretentious jerk, his class and performances are nothing more than platforms for him to showboat. Professional actor Frank Runyeon spoke to our class and pointed out that everything we had learned about acting from Bob was WRONG. No matter what script we read, he always did the same Disney-esque character for any elderly character: ""Pupupup! I beg yaw pahdon?"" So annoying. I didn't buy into his bullshit and refused to bring my bass to class to jam and he would chew me out as if I was required.

History Teacher:  I never had her as a teacher but ran into her a few times in the hall.  She was never pleasant and needed to know every detail of your journey to the bathroom like some kind of Hall Nazi.  Despite being an obvious butch dike, she was quite bitchy.  She was nice to my sister, but I think it's obvious why.  I recall her angrily telling another male student in her husky voice, ""Man, I'll fight you for some red-eye gravy"", and thinking how much that phrase described her belligerent personality.

English Teacher:  Mrs. Chapman was boring and could be a real bitch.  I felt like I could never please her no matter what and that she simply did not like me (I have no idea why).  A little personal, but she came to my grandfather's funeral recently and, despite the warm smile I gave, said nothing to me and ignored me, even though she greeted everyone else in the receiving line.  Years after having her as a teacher and wondering if she really was a bitch was confirmed on that day.

TL;DR: Rated some of my highschool teachers.  What would you say about yours?"
ndrmu,1,2011-12-15,"Reddit, I need your help to find the motivation I need to get a job.",[deleted],GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/ndrmu/reddit_i_need_your_help_to_find_the_motivation_i/,"Okay so here's the situation.

I'm 21 and recently dropped out of engineer school. Up until now I lived on my (private) student loan, but money is coming short after the past months and I need a job to keep paying rent and everything. My parents are good people but I would feel really bad asking them for any money since I actually have lots of free time to work my own job now.

I live in a medium to large city in France and I have behind me 4 years of formation in IT, plus the standard high school scientific formation. I can basically do anything one would need with a computer; I can do sysadmin, databases, network admin, programming and webdev (although I dislike webdev). I can also do gamedesign even though I don't have actual formation in the domain, I worked on different amateur projects in the past 7 years, most of them never went too far. And I have my own game design document for a rather large idea I've had for the whole past years I keep with me and improve on every now and then with the help of fellow designer friends.

So here is where the things get tough. I have an history of heavy procrastination since I'm a kid and I always managed to do the things I like instead of the things I have to do. I value my free time and freedom more than anything else. I'm also a long time hardcore gamer, not only video games but also tabletop role-playing games and card games and I would feel very unhappy if I was to give up on them. I was also thinking seriously about getting into pro-gaming to be able to live off my passion, but seeing as the probability to make it is rather small and I have pressing short term budget issues to solve, this is an idea I keep for later if I ever decide to give it a try.

Ideally I would like to find a part-time job in IT that permits me to keep most of my free time while still having enough money to sustain myself over time. I looked through job offers on the web and most of them are not quite what I'm looking for. Employers are looking to hire full-time in 99% of the cases or they look for part-time internship contracts with students who are still in school. The salary they offer in IT for a fulltime job is also way too much compared to what I need. To give you an idea, job offers that suit my profile are about 20,000 to 25,000€ a year for someone with little to no experience, when I only spend about 650€ per month (7,800€ a year) including rent, food, bills and various government financial aids.

I've been undecided as to what to do for the past month (or even more), thinking about it every day and kind of putting it into a corner of my mind since I can't settle on a final decision. I've been too hesitant to even fill up an application, even though I have my complete resume at hand. Finding a decent job is actually the most difficult thing I had to do thus far and I didn't think it would be that hard to get a situation that is both profitable for me and for my future employer, since I don't want to get a job and feel like I'm forced to wake up every day, wasting my time into an unenjoyable, necessary duty and not be productive because of that (this happened in the past with internships I worked and I felt pretty bad after that).

So that's the problem I'm facing right now. Actually just coming up with this post was kinda hard for me and I wouldn't admit any of this if it wasn't for the relative anonymity of the internet. Any tip or advice you can give me would be greatly appreciated. And if you took the time to read this entirely, thank you."
ndlgj,8,2011-12-15,Not sure if I'm strong enough to forgive,Bleachd,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ndlgj/not_sure_if_im_strong_enough_to_forgive/,"Hey Reddit I could really use your help tonight.  I’m having a pretty tough time and would like to get this off my chest.  I hope putting this out there will make me feel better.  Over the summer I started dating this girl.  We fell pretty hard pretty fast.  I am a sales engineer and work and she was the intern in one of our other divisions.  We had a great relationship for a while.  She had a guy friend that lived here in town.  (You can already see where this is going.)  

Anyway, she had been spending some time with him.  She went to a wedding with him and didn’t come home that night.  I was furious.  I packed up all of her things and left them by the front door.  When she got home in the morning she began crying her eyes out.  We argued and she genuinely convinced  me that this guy was only a friend.  From that point forward our relationship deteriorated.  She became withdrawn and distant and our sex life dwindled.  When I would confront her she claimed that my overreaction to her not coming home had upset her and she just wasn’t able to get over it.  Things got worse and worse until she went back to finish her last year of college in fall.  Finally, I couldn’t take her distant attitude and ended the relationship.   

I moved on with life and dated some other girls, went out and had fun.  She was never completely able to leave me alone though.  I’d get random calls asking my advice on things and I maintained to everyone that she was still my friend.  I should mention, she has been offered a full time position at our company so I will be seeing her again… A LOT in June 2012.  So one night a month or so ago it came out that she missed me… and I told her that I missed her as well.  We had seen each other a few times and spent a lot of time talking.  We made plans to spend New Year’s Eve together in Chicago and exchange gifts for Christmas.  

I have a sales call not far from her university tomorrow morning so we agreed to have dinner tonight and exchange gifts.  We were having a nice evening, talking lightly about how we missed each other.   Then she dropped the bomb on me.  She teared up and admitted that over the summer, she had been cheating on me with her friend… the first night was the night I suspected and it continued on from there all summer.  She started to cry and tell me how much she loved me and how she hated herself for it.  She said something about she was 21 and made a mistake.  To be honest, I just zoned out and gazed into the distance.  Finally, she just got up and walked out of the bar.  I chased after her and said, “You said a lot of shit in there… but I never heard you say you were sorry.”  She started to cry harder and tell me she loved me, kissed me, and ran.  I came back to my hotel….devastated.   

Reddit, I don’t know if I can forgive her or trust her again.  I know I don’t need to make that decision tonight.  I feel humiliated, hurt, angry, and strangely numb.  I’m embarrassed that as a 27 year old man, who prides himself on being able to read into other people…. That a 21 year old girl took advantage of me and hurt me this bad.   I spent most of my 20’s being a less than upstanding gentlemen when it comes to the opposite sex, maybe this is karma.  But I had to meet so many girls to find this one that I truly loved… I’m scared of how long it will take me to find another one.  I’ll get through this (maybe with her or maybe without her) but I’ll come out a better person on the other side… I could just use some friendly words of encouragement right now."

ndb0g,1,2011-12-14,Ready to Give Up,thowzawayz,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ndb0g/ready_to_give_up/,"Honestly, I don't believe I have been that much of a happy person, but over the last few months I've had an extremely hard time. I had my first relationship with a girl who i had been pursuing for 8 months last month and after about a week she started becoming extremely withdrawn. Eventually, she started making plans with me and blowing them off at the last minute to hang out with my roommates. We eventually broke up and now she is basically dating one of them. My situation is even more difficult because I'm at an internship 10+ hours away from home and have maybe one or two friends here who are nice but i don't know them well enough to talk to them.

 My history with girls has always been difficult. I have pursued two girls before this and each led me on for two years.They seemed to be interested in me but they never really were, and it was extremely painful to watch as they would pick piece of shit guys over me. It seems as if this is just going to be some continuous pattern where i try extremely hard to build a relationship with someone and they write me off when the next closest guy approaches them. 

I honestly have tried to make myself feel better but my efforts have been fruitless. My roommates continued to invite her over to our apartment for 2 weeks straight and they would just ignore my vomiting and crying that I was doing in my room. I have sought out a therapist but she frustrates me wanting to blame this on the fact that my parents would leave to go to their vacation home for 4 days a week and that I never had anyone around when i was over the age of 15.

I think about this situation constantly and it has completely consumed me. I relive every situation i have ever had with her trying to figure out what I have done wrong. Every girl loves to tell me that Im the nicest guy they've ever met but they then continue to lead me on and ultimately destroy me. I think about the 21 years I have lived so far and if I had to live them over again I would not. I honestly just want this to be over. I feel that if someone is to be happy they can't just go along with life learning to cope with problems, but eventually they must have something good happen to them. I feel like this will never happen for me. I'm extremely tired and ready to give up.

Thanks for reading. I'm trying to express the way I'm feeling and any comments, advice, and opinions will be extremely appreciated. Sorry for the terrible grammar, I'm not in a great state of mind.

 I will be finishing up University by april with a BBA. The thing I'm worried about is my employment history. Every summer I've tried getting internships or at least a regular office type job with no luck. 

Throughout the academic season I'm working part-time at a grocery store. I've been able to find some good paying full time jobs in the summer but they don't do much to add to my resume business wise. 

Last 3 summers :

1) Assistant cook on a kid's camp then I was promoted to head cook for the last month of the summer

2) Tree planter, planted thousands of trees.

3) Brush saw operator, cut down thousands of trees.

All these jobs paid waaay more than minimum wage which is nice, but they're all hard labour grunt jobs, mostly the last two. 

Will this negatively affect my chances of getting a ""real"" job after I graduate?"

nevdc,5,2011-12-16,Seeking general career and education advice,cwd68,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nevdc/seeking_general_career_and_education_advice/,"Hi Reddit.  This will be long, so bear with me.  I'm currently working as a software engineer for a company that mostly does government contracting, and I've been doing it for about 2 years now.  The work I'm doing is ok, but it's not the most exciting stuff in the world - mostly low traffic, DB driven web applications.   I've recently been trying to figure out what the best way forward would be to break into something more interesting - my ideal job would probably be something at a blue chip tech company like Google or Microsoft, or potentially at a startup that is doing something cool.

I went to a top university, but I didn't major in CS in undergrad.  I've enjoyed programming since a young age, but I was kind of scared off from majoring in it as a result of going to high school right after the first dot com bust, and hearing a lot of talk about outsourcing and such.  I've since wised up.  I did a different engineering major instead, but I still took several CS classes in undergrad because I enjoyed them.  I had enough of a background to be accepted into a part time CS masters program at a reasonably well known school in my area, which my company is mostly paying for.  At first I was pretty excited about the program, as I was hoping it would help me make up the deficiencies in the upper level CS classes that I didn't have in undergrad, but I'm about halfway done with the degree now, and I'm kind of disappointed by it so far.  The classes have been pretty easy, which I think is a direct result of the fact that the program is designed for people who also work full time - the classes &amp; professors aren't the same as what the full time masters students at the school take.  For instance, I just took my program's Operating Systems class, and I spent some time comparing the projects I had to do with the projects in a couple of undergrad OS courses at my old school and others.  It seems pretty clear that the undergrad courses were way more hands on and in-depth than what I had to do.  It's gotten to the point where I'm actually considering stopping my program, and applying for a full time masters at a program that is more rigorous instead, since I know some masters programs let you count some upper level undergrad courses towards the degree.  The pros and cons I see are:

-If I stay in my program, I can be finished in about a year.  It won't really cost me any money, and I'll be getting more work experience.  That said, I don't know if I'll be learning enough to get the chops I need to stack up against people with CS degrees from good schools without really teaching myself.  I also don't know if this degree will really even open any doors for me that I couldn't get already.

-If I leave, I think I have a decent shot at getting into a good school for a full time masters based on my undergrad credentials.  It's probably too late to apply for this upcoming fall, which means I would have to apply in the winter to start in the fall of 2013.  When you tack on another 1-2 years to finish the masters, I'm looking at around another 3 years or so just to finish the degree, plus about $50 grand in debt, plus having to explain to everyone I know why I'm leaving a free masters program for one I have to pay for.  On the flip side, I'd probably learn a lot more, and it might get my foot in the door at a company like Google if I can get a good internship or via on-campus recruiting.  I might also be able to transfer in a couple of credits from my current program.

So, what do you think Reddit?  If you were in my shoes, what would you do?  Thanks!

neqbr,16,2011-12-15,College feels like a waste of time and money -- is dropping out feasible?,ParaGrass,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/neqbr/college_feels_like_a_waste_of_time_and_money_is/,"I'm in school for Computer Science at a public college which is not extremely prestigious or anything. I also work part time during the semester and full time during the summer and breaks as an intern for a Financial Services company developing web software in Java, Javascript, CSS, HTML, etc. I have a self-taught background in C++ as well, from attempting to develop a game engine with friends during High School.

I've been finding more and more that I learn almost nothing in my CS classes. I'm not sure if it's me or the school I attend or the nature of programming, but I feel more and more like I'm wasting my time and money attending college. I get a lot of real-world experience at my work, and I feel like I learn more there through exercise than I do through theory at school. But also, it seems like I could pull off the duties of most of the developers I work with already (save for maybe the lead, although he's extremely bright in the first place). During the semester, I spend a lot of my day working and learning, a lot of my day sitting bored in class and not learning much, and very little of my day working on personal projects and such.

Anyway, my question really is: Is anyone here self-taught and doing well? Is anyone a drop-out and doing well? Would it be extremely stupid to drop out of school now and just freelance/look for work? Although I'm sure it looks much better to be in school, would many companies be willing to hire (even as an intern to get work experience) a drop-out who can show that he is a skilled programmer?

EDIT: By the way, don't be scared to answer because this is a life decision or something. I'm obviously not going to solely base my decision on Reddit, as much as I love this place.

tl;dr If I drop out of school so I can spend that time doing something productive, will I be un-hireable? "

(It's only $5 and you can download or stream),iamwarrendale,funny,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/nej7a/louis_ck_is_the_man_its_stuff_like_this_email_he/,"Hi.  This is LOuie.  It seriously is me. Im even going to leave
the O stuipdly capatalized because who would pay an intern to do
that?? Okay so you bought the thing with my fat face on it and
you clicked the button that said i could email you. And i know
that now you are thinking ""aw shit. Why'd i let this guy into my
life this way?"". Well dont worry. Because i really swear it that
i wont bug you. I will not abuse this privalage of having your
email. You wont hear from me again... Probably, unless i have
something new to offer you. The reason i'm writing now, in the
back of a car taking me to the Tonight Show set, is to let you
know that as of now there is some new and cool stuff on my site,
related to Live at the Beacon Theater. Theres a thing where you
can download and print a dvd box cover and label so you can burn
and make your own dvd of the video. And theres a new option where
you can gift the special to as many people as you want (for 5
bucks each) and they'll get a nice gifty email from you with a
link to the video.

Also, some of you may know, i recently made a statement (that
sounds so dumb. Like i'm the president or something) about how the
video has been doing online. Im pasting it in here below in case
you missed it.

Lastly I'm planning to put some more outtakes of the show on
youtube and i think i will put one on the site that is only
available for free to you folks on this list, who bought the
thing and opted in. But dont hold me to that because really i
just thought of it and typed it.

Okay well please have a happy rest of the year and more happy
years after that. And please even have been happy in your past.
What?

Thanks again for giving me 5 dollars. I bought 3 cokes with it.

Regards. Sincerely, Actually,

Louis

===========================
People of Earth (minus the ones who don't give a shit about
this): it's been amazing to conduct this experiment with you. The
experiment was: if I put out a brand new standup special at a
drastically low price ($5) and make it as easy as possible to
buy, download and enjoy, free of any restrictions, will everyone
just go and steal it? Will they pay for it? And how much money
can be made by an individual in this manner?

It's been 4 days. A lot of people are asking me how it's going.
I've been hesitant to share the actual figures, because there's
power in exclusive ownership of information. What I didn't expect
when I started this was that people would not only take part in
this experiment, they would be invested in it and it would be
important to them. It's been amazing to see people in large
numbers advocating this idea. So I think it's only fair that you
get to know the results. Also, it's just really cool and fun and
I'm dying to tell everybody. I told my Mom, I told three friends,
and that wasn't nearly enough. So here it is.

First of all, this was a premium video production, shot with six
cameras over two performances at the Beacon Theater, which is a
high-priced elite Manhattan venue. I directed this video myself
and the production of the video cost around $170,000. (This was
largely paid for by the tickets bought by the audiences at both
shows). The material in the video was developed over months on
the road and has never been seen on my show (LOUIE) or on any
other special. The risks were thus: every new generation of
material I create is my income, it's like a farmer's annual crop.
The time and effort on my part was far more than if I'd done it
with a big company. If I'd done it with a big company, I would
have a guarantee of a sizable fee, as opposed to this way, where
I'm actually investing my own money.

The development of the website, which needed to be a very robust,
reliable and carefully constructed website, was around $32,000.
We worked for a number of weeks poring over the site to make sure
every detail would give buyers a simple, optimal and humane
experience for buying the video. I edited the video around the
clock for the weeks between the show and the launch.

The show went on sale at noon on Saturday, December 10th. 12
hours later, we had over 50,000 purchases and had earned
$250,000, breaking even on the cost of production and website. As
of Today, we've sold over 110,000 copies for a total of over
$500,000. Minus some money for PayPal charges etc, I have a
profit around $200,000 (after taxes $75.58). This is less than I
would have been paid by a large company to simply perform the
show and let them sell it to you, but they would have charged you
about $20 for the video. They would have given you an encrypted
and regionally restricted video of limited value, and they would
have owned your private information for their own use. They would
have withheld international availability indefinitely. This way,
you only paid $5, you can use the video any way you want, and you
can watch it in Dublin, whatever the city is in Belgium, or
Dubai. I got paid nice, and I still own the video (as do you).
You never have to join anything, and you never have to hear from
us again.

I really hope people keep buying it a lot, so I can have
shitloads of money, but at this point I think we can safely say
that the experiment really worked. If anybody stole it, it wasn't
many of you. Pretty much everybody bought it. And so now we all
get to know that about people and stuff. I'm really glad I put
this out here this way and I'll certainly do it again. If the
trend continues with sales on this video, my goal is that i can
reach the point where when I sell anything, be it videos, CDs or
tickets to my tours, I'll do it here and I'll continue to follow
the model of keeping my price as far down as possible, not
overmarketing to you, keeping as few people between you and me as
possible in the transaction. (Of course i reserve the right to go
back on all of this and sign a massive deal with a company that
pays me fat coin and charges you straight up the ass.). (This is
you: yes Louie. And we'll all enjoy torrenting that content. You
fat sweaty dolt).

I probably sound kind of crazy right now. It's been a really fun
and intense few days. This video was paid for by people who
bought tickets, and then bought by people who wanted to see that
same show. I got to do exactly the show I wanted, and exactly the
show you wanted.

I also got an education. And everything i learned are things i
was happy to learn. I learned that people are interested in what
happens and shit (i didn't go to college)

I learned that money can be a lot of things. It can be something
that is hoarded, fought over, protected, stolen and withheld. Or
it can be like an energy, fueled by the desire, will, creative
interest, need to laugh, of large groups of people. And it can be
shuffled and pushed around and pooled together to fuel a common
interest, jokes about garbage, penises and parenthood.

I want to thank Blair Breard who produced this video and produces
my series LOUIE, and I want to thank Caspar and Giles at Version
Industries, who created the website.

I hope with all of my heart that I stay funny. Otherwise this all
goes to hell. Please have a safe and happy holiday, and thank you
again for all this crazy shit.

Sincerely, Louis C.K."

My grandfather was dying.  He had been ill since about March and was progressively getting worse until he died at the end of May, the day of my graduate commencement (he passed three hours before the ceremony). During this time, I was in a very intense internship and R. was on my team. R is an older lady who was about to retire and took me under her wing.  I was struggling with my own health issues, my grandfather dying, and the weight of such an intensive internship on my shoulders.  She understood what I was going through unlike any other person that I worked with. It was R. who told me to stand up and pretty much tell everyone to go screw themselves  and just take care of me.  Without her, I would have not survived those three grueling months and the time after graduation when I was flailing around.  I took her advice to heart, did some soul searching and this spring, I am going back to school and completely changing my career.  Today, I did some online stalking, found her address and am mailing her a Christmas card that truly thanks her for what she did for me.

A 60 year old women that tells you and someone on your behalf to go screw themselves is pretty baddass and even though its been six months since I've seen her, I hope to see again soon one day.

So thank you R for being your badass self and having so much compassion when you didn't need to. "
ngj2q,6,2011-12-17,In a little less than one month my LDR will be over!! Proof that it can work.,dlmead,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/ngj2q/in_a_little_less_than_one_month_my_ldr_will_be/,"After two and a half long years of trying to move to NY to be closer to my SO it's finally happening! I have been commenting on posts for a while, but I have never told our whole story. I figure now would be a good time. Warning, this will most likely be very long.


We met while both working at Disney world as college ""interns"" in April of 2009. At the time I was dating his roommate at the time but he says the instant I walked through their apartment door he was in love. After a few weeks I could kind of tell that he liked me, especially the night of the formal when he told me that I looked beautiful about five times. I was starting to get kind of creeped out, but my then BF told me thats just how he was. Slowly but surely we started to become good friends, and when the other relationship came to an end I really started to rely on him. About two weeks after the break up he tried to kiss me for the first time by pulling the strings on my hoodie, but I pretended to be distracted by the parade. A week or so later one of his roommates LD GF's came into town and we spent a nice morning in the theme parks with them. Apparently as soon as we left to get to work the GF asked the BF how long we had been together. When he responded that we weren't, she told him that he needed to find a way to get us together because we were perfect for each other. Later that week as we were sitting in my apartment eating lunch he randomly asked me if I would consider moving to New York after our internship if I fell madly in love with him, because if so he would up his game. I told him I didn't realize that he had a game, but really I wanted to shout yes! That night when we were at EPCOT we decided to have our picture taken, and the photographer tried to get us to kiss and look lovingly into each others eyes. He kissed me on the cheek, but I wished he had just kissed me then. Also that night we decided to both sleep at his apartment since my roommate had her boyfriend over. We spent an hour awake just whispering with each other and cuddling. We almost kissed, but we could feel someone's eyes watching.We both were moving back home a month later, and I was scared to start something to have it end so quickly, but every day we spent together I liked him more and more. For my birthday he had planned to surprise me by taking me to a super fancy restaurant, and I decided to surprise him by kissing him. The day before my birthday he got fired, and had to move home unexpectedly. The day before he left we sat cuddling in my apartment, and I wanted to tell him how I felt so badly, but I just couldn't do it.

 
Later that month I decided to surprise him by flying to NY with his roommate, the one that had his GF visit earlier. I told myself that I needed to go so that I could figure out how I felt, but I already knew that I wanted to be with him, and only him. On the first plane up I started writing a letter to tell him how I felt since I am better at writing things down then saying them, but on the second flight the roommate was watching me write so I didn't write everything that I wanted to. I spent the first three days of the trip depressed because I couldn't bring myself to tell him. Finally the roommates GF showed up and at a party that night I confided in her that I really liked him, and I didn't know how to tell him. She told me that he had said that he has loved me since the moment I walked into their apartment. That put a smile on my face, and after a few more drinks I finally got the courage to tell him. Our first kiss happened that night because when I told him I started hyperventilating and kept trying to talk. So our first kiss was to get me to shut up. Two days later when it was time for me to leave and we decided to not be exclusive at first and discuss it after the next time we saw each other. When I was getting on the subway to the airport he kissed me over the turnstiles and then two minutes later came rushing down the stairs to say that he wanted to say goodbye some more, and also he had left his i-pod in my purse.
    

We didn't see each other until that January when we met up at Disney World. It was on that trip that I told him I loved him, and he told me he was 85% sure that he loved me. The actual words didn't come until July, but he said it in different ways. We ended up not discussing the relationship thing while we were together, but three weeks later on January 27th he told me that he couldn't take it anymore and he wanted me to be his girlfriend, and I accepted.
     

We were able to visit each other every other month for the first while, and then when I moved back to Florida we saw each other every month. This past January when I moved back home, which is Portland, OR, and he started a new job we realized that we weren't going to be able to visit each other for quite a while. That put a lot of stress on both of us, and I got especially depressed because I didn't have a job and I didn't really have a life outside of talking to him which was a big mistake. In May I broke up with him, but we said that if I ended up in NY later we would try again. We didn't make it that long though. We started talking every day again in August, and in September he came out for a visit and we were officially together again. I moved to Utah in October for a job that hasn't been working out so well, so I started looking for jobs in NY, and yesterday I got offered one! I will be an hour and a half train ride, or a 45 minute drive away from him which will be some amazing. I am visiting him next week and will be there until the 4th of January and then on the 13th I move to NY for good. We have definitely had our ups and downs but I am so glad that we were both willing to see this through because so soon we won't have to say goodbye for longer than a few days at a time instead of a few months. So to all of you guys in LDR's when it's the right person it is so worth it.
Tl;dr Had an up and down LDR with someone I met at Disney World, but in a month we won't be LDR anymore :)"

I'll start with a little bit of back story...

So my girlfriend and I have been dating since about july last year, coming up to a year and a half, we met through my friend and his girlfriend (different story), really hit it off etc. Anyway, so for the first three-four months, we were not exclusive, we liked each other, saw each other regularly, but were still doing our ""own thing"". It was really fun, exciting ladida. We finally became ""exclusive"" at around January time, when we both realised that we were not getting with other people, not because we felt bad, but because we didn't want to (if that makes sense). Roll on a few months and we reached our first argument(after 9months). 

Basically, this guy that used to like her, she was out clubbing, so was he, they were talking and she sent me a text saying ""this guys wants to get with me"". About a month later when she came down to my university(we go to different universities, about hour away no big deal) and we ended up getting drunk... She then told me that the guy kissed her, but she pulled away and didn't let it continue. I was naturally, a little angry, the whole ""typical excuse he kissed me I didn't do anything) but by this point, I was emotionally attached and decided to give her ad break, we just really click. I am the sort that's very picky about girls. So everything is really well until summer when we both go on internship.

We ended up doing the same internship. Which required us to live in houses with 4-5 other people. She ended up being in a house with 4 other guys. This didnt bother me much, as there was little time to go out partying and what not because of the intensity of the internship. It lasted for 10weeks, we saw each other about 4-5 times during it. It was no big deal, but obviously, living with guys, I was a little worried... But I'm very trusting and didn't really bother me.. Until our last night out for our awards ceremony. 

She was extremely flirty with some of the guys in her team in the club (night out before awards), we have never really been the type of couple that has to spend every second together.. But it bothered me. I raised it up with her in the club.. Got in a huge argument and ended up with me going home because she accused me of cheating (I have never cheated in my life, it's sick and I find it disrespectful. Being from a middle eastern background, respect is a major thing for me). Anyway..

The night if the awards ceremony, I was staying with her team in the hotel study had booked, so we agreed to not fight and just have fun with our friends. The awards was fine. We then went to a after party with the whole company.. Again I was ignored and disregarded for, she ended up getting quite drunk. This is where my paranoia starts.. On the way home, she was holding hands with one foe the guys in her team.. Me and the rest of her team went to get some food, they went back to the hotel without us. When I finally got back, I found both of them outside the hotel room waiting, we went into the room, I lay down on the bed, at which point she comes and lays next to me. That's fine. Then she gets up and begs the guy to take her to her room. They went up to his room(another guy there also from her team). After about 10mins I decide to go get her. Arguing all the way back down to our room. I then leave in the morning, not saying goodbye and went home. We basically then had a chat about it, and she apologised and apologised and apologised. We decided that with friends of the opposite sex, we can be ""friendly"" but not to that extent or rub it in each others faces like she did(I'm okay with the being friendly with friends, as I have a few very close female friends). Then things have been better than ever ever since then. 

But, as part of the internship, the best performers go on a company trip(their team won best team) I could not go on the holiday, but now she's in a sunny country with all her team and that guy. I'm just paranoid that she will do something.. Being clubbing, drunk for a week, with ad guy that has a clear interest in her (which she disagrees with that he has an interest, but it's a little obvious) I think something could accidentally happen.. 

I dunno, am I being paranoid? Or is this natural? Or should I bail.. We are both nearly 21.. So its not the end of the world, but I just click with her, she lovely. Would appreciate some advice. Thanks so much.

nj2px,2,2011-12-19,Looking for advice on possible projects or ways to improve resume for EE,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/nj2px/looking_for_advice_on_possible_projects_or_ways/,Does anyone have any advice for EE projects or ways to enhance a resume? I've been looking into this for a while as a way to make my resume look better for career fairs because my GPA is only 2.9X and I was told 3.0 is often used as a minimum requirement. The reason it is so low is because when I first started college I was not ready for it and did not try hard. I was actually in business school and got C's quite frequently and my GPA dropped to a 2.7 but after my second year I transferred into engineering and am doing much better but it is still hard to raise my GPA with so many SH already under my belt.  Hopefully after this semester it will either be a 3.0 or 2.99. So far what I plan to do is learn C++ as I heard C/C++ are the most used languages and I already learned C in one of my classes and as far as I am aware C++ is not taught directly in another required EE class.. The other thing is that I ordered an Arduino starter kit that included different sensors to start playing around with that so I can say I have various experience using a microcontroller. Does anyone else have suggestions for what I can do that would help me procure an internship?

Filling up the Resume.",[deleted],resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/nj2mq/up_through_the_ranks_filling_up_the_resume/,"I've been having a bit of trouble filling up my Resume. My goal is to end up in an administrative job dealing with computers. On that note, I have slowly been working on my Computer Information Technology degree, with a concentration on Network Administration. I just got my Network+ certification, and have completed most of the other general classes. Math, Public Speaking, Sciences, Intro to computers... Those kind of classes. I'm having trouble emphasizing my knowledge of computers, seeing as I really only have hands on knowledge while growing up a dealing with computers in most of my free time. As most of the computer literate will understand, helping the family, friends, work associates is where I end up figuring stuff out. I took the computer classes in high school, but nothing really program specific. I know my way around Windows, as well as Mac. I enjoy customization of Android, and have done some work with Blackberry and other smartphones. I will be starting an internship with a school near me, but that has yet to come to light. On the job side of things, I have worked at (insert major fast food chain here) for almost 6 years now. I started as a crew member, and have worked my way into management. I have my job listed under the management position with most of my duties. Do I need to split up the different positions I had throughout all of my employment and emphasize which duties were different under each one? Also, any additional comments on what I could add under the list would be helpful, seeing as it is a common job that most can relate to. I may have drifted off a bit while typing this, so if there are any questions, I will be around to answer.

You know, I get some weird looks when I tell people you're my best friend. They question your character, if I could trust someone like you. I have for almost a decade now, maybe this is all out of habit. I know you're a good person at heart. I know you honestly...well probably wish the best for me. I like to think you wish the best for me but part of me isn't so sure any more.

You have your boyfriend and I'm happy for you. Maybe he provides that normalcy in your life you've never really had. I didn't like him at first, but I realized he's an okay guy. He worries about you, he cares about you and he loves you. I'm happy you have that. You probably deserve that much.

I just don't know if this friendship goes both ways my dear. As the months have drawn on...I think this has been a one way street. A street I should probably turn around on and get off of.

I've never truly gotten advice from you. You've always been short with me. Never taking in what I had to say and trying to give something back. Always trying to turn it back to you. I just sort of accepted that's how you dealt advice and moved on. I've never pointed out a girl to you that you've approved of or thought ""was right for me."" It was a negative and then move on. When things didn't pan out, you said sorry. But did it relieve you in a way? Did you have a sigh of relief that someone wouldn't be taking up my time away from you? When she dumped me, you just told me about how you couldn't see your boyfriend. So I bottled it up. You weren't interested in it...so forget it.

When I got my internship acceptance letter and you found out, you brushed it off. You just couldn't give a shit less, could you? Or were you mad? All of my friends whom I told we're excited. They offered congrats, wanted to start scheduling going away things and the like. And you? You tried to tell me how your friend hated it. That I wasn't going to like it. You didn't even want to talk about it further. On my birthday, you made it an objective to take potshots at me in front of my friends. You haven't said so much as a word about if we'll see each other before we leave. I'm going to be gone for eight months, maybe longer. But I don't know if you care, our if you want to act like I'm not leaving.

Right now I could care less if I ever see you again. I don't know if I can stomach your presence.

What am I to you? Do you have these weird feelings for me? A jealousy of seeing me go further and not being that crying shoulder? Do you enjoy seeing me fail and come down to this miserable level? 

You tell me I'm your best friend. And I'd do anything for you. Maybe I love you still. But right, now I hate you. I don't want to...but I hate you so much. "
nibjp,2,2011-12-19,Dexter Season 6 Finale (Spoilers!),FlopShop,Dexter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/nibjp/dexter_season_6_finale_spoilers/,"Personally, I stopped enjoying the season about half way through it. The only thing I enjoyed about the finale was when Deb catches him. 

There was a lot of filler in this season that all seemed to happen for no reason at all. (Brother Sam seemed almost forgotten by the episode after he died, Dex going to Nebraska for nothing, Brian coming back for one episode, etc.) The one thing that annoyed me, is the plot gaps and the things that the writers are kind of brushing off, reason being that I always treasured Dexter as the show that never did that. (Remember in season 5 when Quinn was tailing him, and found that his partner got killed? Apparently the writers don't.)

But really, Dex just seemed invincible this season. Even though he was making stupid mistakes, nothing ever happened. Like when he was captured by Travis, he got away without a scratch. And the season ended with so many questions left unanswered, and with a cliffhanger, which Dexter never usually does as a show. Who was the intern video game kid, and why did he send the Ice Truck Killer arm to Dex? What's happening to Quinn? 

Anybody agree, or disagree?"

**But you are not in prison or dead... who knows what could have happened to you.**  
Worse case scenario I'd be in jail and have food everyday no goddamn bills and no worries about money lol


----
**I don't know if the drug game is friendlier in Canada, but in America you either end up doing life in prison, dead, or with a semi-successful rap career that ends in you doing pop music with Katy Perry. Are you any good a rap? That guy Snow was from Canada and he was pretty good.**  

**Seriously, there are more important things in life than money. Freedom and not getting shot come to mind. Someone once told me that ""nothing worth doing is ever easy"" and I've found it to be true.**  


lol that made me laugh thanks.

In my experience to get shot at I'd really really really would be out of luck.
The only time I had a gun pointed at me was when I used to drive escorts and some black guys that knew what we were doing came knocking on my car window with his gun out so he could get a free blow job from one of those dumb ass bitch of escorts. I just drove away.

nothing worth doing is ever easy... Yeah but you are supposed to get something out of it! I got NOTHING from going the hard route doing the right thing. I've found to be true that to keep doing something you need to get some returns 


----
**Why would someone downvote this? Seriously, this guy could use a break. He's trying to do the right thing. Perhaps a few upvotes will get him noticed by someone that can give him a legit job.**  

**Do you really think doing the right thing is going to be the easy thing? Fuck no. Often it isn't. But I sincerely feel for you and wish things would have worked out eazy breazy.**  

**If you haven't already, expand your job search to any-fucking-where. Move if you have to for a job. Even if you don't want to leave where you are, do it and in a couple years come back when you can find a job where you want to be.**  

**If you do go back to your former vocation, do it just for the rent, just to squeak by. Don't sell the E and speed. Stick to pot. Don't get any new customers, only people you know to limit your risk. And do it while you're looking for a real job!**  

I'm looking all over the place I'm at a point I don't even look where the job is I job apply and if I get it I don't care I'll move. E and speed is way more profitable then only weed thats the big problem. And yeah if I go back it would just to make ends meet. 
And yeah I need a break I've been working on getting my shit together since 2008 and after 3 years of hard work and always telling myself continue like this its gonna work out somehow...

But to be honest I've lost hope, its just been too much without anything good coming out of it


----
**Honestly, I would go back to dealing. You have experience in the business and could be smarter about it. Based on your responses, you're not that afraid of the law or going to prison. You did the right thing and tried to live a good life, but now you're at a position where you're just trying to survive. If anything, repeat the cycle by dealing, saving, getting a real degree like more than a bachelor's and looking for a good job.**  
Yeah all I got to do is manage a way to survive till next spring so my seasonal job with no real future that isn't in my field starts again.

Which sucks that after finishing school the only job I could get was not in my field and the irony is it paid more than I would have in my field.... 

And to be honest I should have put in my title it was either going back to sell drug or to drive escorts again which I did before selling drugs.



----
**Isn't it sad in our world that its easier to do something illegal to get by on than do ""the right thing"" and get by on it?**  
Actually it really is. But I won't go back to old ways gonna give land surveying another year then change career if it doesn't work out


----
**Are you extremely passionate about the feel you studied?**  
Was at first but with the passing months and the lack of responses from possible employers just got me down. I was in the top 5 best students during my class


----
**I work for a very successful land surveying company in a big city, and it's definitely not easy for someone with 20 years of experience and connections to get a job, let alone someone right out of school. Try to get  some kind of internship 'cause you're not gunna make $30 an hour right out of school like you could 10 years ago. Lemme know if you have any questions about the field.**  
My only question can you get me a job?
Yeah I'm not expecting doing 30$h I'm asking for like 14-15$h. I just want to find a good place that I can get experience and stability for at least the 3 next years.

I just want some place that give me a chance.

The only place I that hired me for land surveying was an office that as a very bad reputation and tbh I didn't like that company because the way they worked didn't make me comfortable with my personal ethics. Example lying to clients, cutting corners everywhere and they made me work with an intern so basically we were 2 guys on the job with no experience at all trying to do the job and when I asked questions to the boss or supervisor their answer were : I don't work on the field I don't know how to set the station settings... Or even once I had a problem I had to move a point's location by 30cm and I was having problem with the cogo menu I call my boss and tell him the problem his answer: Well cogo! They couldn't even be bothered at the office to make it on autocad and give me the coordinates nope just cogo


----
**What Operating System(s) do you run in your computer(s)?**  
at home windows 7 at work was windows XP or 7 but the last job 7 was giving us problem because of the program we used wasn't made for win 7 so we had a lot of crashes.  


----
**If you're willing to move to Alberta, there are a shitton of surveying jobs out here. Fun fact: More people have been hired in the land development field (Surveying falls under this category) than the entirety of the United States in the last year.**  
Yeah I've been thinking about it a lot! Got any leads?
I don't mind moving anywhere my only condition is that I can take my dog with me. 


----
**Former drug dealers are not the only people struggling to find and keep work, you're not the only one. Changing for the better was not about making money, it's about doing the right thing. Hang in there, you've made it this far, don't screw it up!**  
Yeah the right thing I keep telling myself this but the ""evil side"" in me that is tempted by having money is getting stronger every damn day


----
**Did you enjoy the work you were doing as a drug dealer, or did you feel ashamed of what you were doing, but put it to the back of your mind because of the load of cash you were making?**  

**Also, do you plan on finding a girlfriend/wife and starting a family?  Would you continue selling drugs if you had a family?**  

**How many scary situations have you actually been in while in the drug trade? and how long have you been doing it?**  
Never found much joy in doing that. To be honest saying the ""scum"" of society every damn day and the misery that drugs bring about didn't make me happy but I'm mostly missing the money

Girlfriend\wife\kids yeah definetly I wouldn't go back.

Only 1 dangerous occasion someone tried to ""kill me"" in the dumbest way possible. So the guy got my number dunno how wasn't to sure if I knew him or not but decided to go anyway. So I get there the guy comes next to my car I have the window rolled down and he grabs me by the throat and says i'm going to kill you. So I basically just laugh in his face kicked open the door he fell to the ground I took my baseball bat and was like : Come at me bro I'm pissed now I wanna see some brain matter explode.
Thats when I realised I was next to a main boulevard 3 blocks away from a police station at 7h pm pockets full of money and dope. So I got the hell out there before I could see some brain matter explode


----
**dont play the game. sell drugs and make money, to be fair, society doesn't give a shit about felons etc. everybody is just a number and if you've made a mistake in your life it's over. it's just a huge game that you'll never win. or get lucky with a good job you like but unfortunately that probably wont happen.**  
Wow thats how I'm seeing things right now you just put better words into expressing it!


----
**Simple, start selling drugs again, I mean wtf. Its a no brainer.**  


**I thoroughly enjoyed drugs, ecstacy, meth, cocaine, acid, shrooms, speed and my personal favourite was cat, loved that shit.**  

**Clean now for years, but would love to do it again. I did excessive amounts, and then just stopped, was weird.**  
Yeah its a no brainer but I still wish I could have a real job with stability "
nkfyd,9,2011-12-20,"Ladies and Gentlemen, it is possible",ShrinkingUrHead,SingleParents,https://www.reddit.com/r/SingleParents/comments/nkfyd/ladies_and_gentlemen_it_is_possible/,"I just recently stumbled upon this subreddit and figured I'd share my story with you guys. And for those of you who ask if it gets better, I can tell you it does. 
My story starts in 2008. I was married, on active duty in the U.S. Navy and just had my son. As soon as he was born he was rushed to the NICU because he had severe seizures. I was told he would be a mentally challenged child. We brought him home a week later. I played constant music in the house, read to him, sang to him, basically I did anything I could to stimulate brain growth. 
He was doing well for a while, growing and developing like a ""normal"" child. The doctor had me weening him off the Phenobarbital.  Then one day he wouldn't stop screaming, he was pale, and lethargic.  My husband said he would stay home since he had gotten out of the Navy and could take the day off from work. I had a mandatory training class to get to. I got half way to work when he called and said our son went completely limp and pale before he screamed again. I couldn't take it anymore. I risked my Naval career, turned around and got my child. I took him to the Naval Hospital where he had a seizure infront of his pediatrician. They admitted him right away and then my entire world fell apart. They ran a bunch of tests and refused to tell me why.
The next morning a Naval Chief, hospital social worker, two police officers, armed security, Child Protective Services, his pediatrician, and pediatric neurologist came into the room. They told me someone had shaken my son and they were taking him away from us until the investigation was complete. 
The events after this were a whirlwind and a blur. What I clearly remember is my mother flying from Florida to where I was stationed to take custody of my son so he wouldn't get lost in the system. Our CPS social worker even allowed us all to be in the same house as long as no one but my mother was alone with my son. 
One of the few days I remember clearly was the day I realized my husband, the father of my child, shook the baby. We were in a private room in the CPS office with our social worker and her supervisor for 45 minutes and his story of what had happened changed FIVE TIMES!! As miserable as that was for me, it was also the happiest day of my life. I was given custody back of my son. 
Two weeks later, the day before he was going to be arrested he left. I haven't heard from his since. He's been on the run for three years. His family is helping him fly under the radar. At first I was pissed at this, but then I realized Karama's a bitch.
I stayed where I was stationed until the end of my enlistment and moved into my parents house. I'm not thrilled to be living with them, but it's what was best for my son.  
They supported us for nine months. My parents allowed me to stay home and spend much needed bonding time with my son. After those nine months I went back to school, full time. I met new people, started going out again, and enjoying life. 
Here we are, three years later, both happy and healthy. My son is ""normal"" (for lack of a better term). He's very intelligent, handsome, and a very curiously child. I have two semesters left of school before I do my internship in Addictions Counseling. 
Just over a year ago, I met a wonderful man. He loves me and my son. We do not live together (my son and I are still living with my parents), but when the two of them together I can see a wonderful bond forming. It warms my heart to think that my son will not have to go through life without a Dad.
So, for those of you who aren't sure if you can continue this forever uphill battle I say just stay strong and try to surround yourself with a good support network. I would not have been able to handle everything if it weren't for the most epic support network every.
It's okay to cry, just remember to hug your babies a little tighter. It's all for them, and one day they'll realize why you've done all you have. 
I hope my story has helped at least one person realize it's possible to be happy. Have faith, my loves."
nkbkg,0,2011-12-20,About to take a career leap to be a start-up CTO...need advice!,throwaway_safety,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/nkbkg/about_to_take_a_career_leap_to_be_a_startup/,"Context:

I graduated from a good college last year and have been working at a cushy software engineering job in the Bay area.  This job is easy, it has security, it pays well, the management is nice and supportive, and there are nice benefits.  The work/life balance is low-stress and low-pressure.  The company is pre-IPO but looking good (and I'm generally skeptical about these things), and I have been given some options which have not yet vested.

Despite being a relatively large startup company, they do listen to me and do occasionally let me make architectural decisions that would be out-of-reach for a new grad at a larger company.  I already have a reasonable level of ownership on a small part of the core system.  My manager looks at me favorably and has told me that he will be pushing for a promotion soon.

At the end of the day though, I am bored.  I feel like no matter how well I do, I'll always be a small part of a big team.  I feel like there is too much down-time due to low expectations about how much I can produce.  They give me too much time to work on things, and so I spend as much time as they expect to actually do it, with a lot of reddit and freelance programming in the middle.

Cue timely opportunity.  I was contacted a couple of months ago by somebody I used to work with who was developing the beta for a start-up that was looking for a full-time CTO.  I get a lot of inquiries like this, and I usually just ignore them, but the person who contacted me wasn't an idiot, so I engaged them further.  I've met with the founders who both have a background in venture capital and have had one moderately successful acquisition that is allowing them to bootstrap this startup.  They intend to close a funding round once they have a full team together, the CTO being the missing component.

I've always wanted to do a startup of my own, but imagined it several years off the horizon.  After having spoken with the founders, I've realized that there is so much more to a technology startup than the technology.  My real passion has always been the technology and that's what I'm good at.  It seems like if I want to do a startup, this is the best way to go, and at the very worst I will learn a lot about what does go into the early stages of a startup.

After a couple months of discussion, they've made me an offer.  Until they close a round, I'll be making less than I make now.  Obviously, I'll be working significantly more and it will be a lot higher stress, but I have worked at smaller companies where this was the norm and definitely prefer hard work that I can fully engage in.  I'm assuming that if we consider growth and raises within my current company, I'll be making less consistently throughout my time at the startup.  That being said, it is still a comfortable salary.

The equity offer they've made is obviously a lot greater than my current company, though that equity is substantially higher risk than my current company.  I am aware that the odds are against this equity, but I believe in the startup's value and our ability as a team to succeed.

After closing a round, I will be able to hire a couple new developers. I have a network of friends where the new startup is located that I think I can leverage for talent, as well as connections with my school.  I will be managing an intern when I join.

My primary motivation for joining the startup are:

- Personal reasons for wanting to move
- Pipe-dreams of success and highly valuable equity
- Faster-pace of development, greater willingness to take technology risks
- Wider scope to keep me interested in projects
- Architectural decision-making; this is something I'm passionate about
- My youth (Now is the time to take risks, I think. I don't have any kids so nobody depends on me.  My skills are still valuable and there are a lot of companies hiring from my segment.)
- Learning about more diverse technology faster, due to necessity
- Learning about the startup world

At this point, I am very confident I want to take it.  I am planning on continuing at my current position until the end of the current release, so that I can minimize any bad feelings.  In the meantime, I am working part-time with the startup--refactoring the code-base so that when I get started, it will be where I want it philosophically.

----

Why I'm asking reddit/what I'm looking for:

- General advice from people who have taken this leap or also people who have decided not to take this leap
- Resources regarding this topic, which I imagine has been covered by many before me
- Support/Disapproval
- Advice regarding how to leave current position without hard feelings
- What to expect on the other side of this, whether or not the company is a success
- Financial advice, due-diligence related recommendations, etc
- Sarcastic retorts and XKCD comics welcomed

TL;DR: I'm quitting my secure job to be a startup CTO, in what ways is this a terrible/great decision?"
nk6gn,0,2011-12-20,My student adviser is hot,[deleted],funny,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/nk6gn/my_student_adviser_is_hot/,"Okay so at my school we have faculty advisers that are assigned to students according to their last names. The faculty advisers help students with scheduling conflicts, general questions, help with internships/employment, etc. My adviser is named Jess Depew and as you can see she's pretty hot. The picture doesn't really do her justice but they're all I've got at the moment. She's like 25 and she's only been at the school a few years. Anyway, I have been looking into getting an internship at a TV station or something over the summer, and the school helps coordinate these things with an internship database that's maintained by the advisers. You log on with your school ID and password and you can browse internships and stuff. I was having trouble logging on to mine so I went to go see Ms. Depew. That's where all the trouble started.

Firstly, I walked into office like 15 minutes early like an idiot and she's in the middle of lunch. So I awkwardly make stupid stall talk until she's finished.

""Oh, hey, what are you eating?""
""Salmon. I love it. I eat it practically everyday.""
""Just salmon? That's pretty weird."" Why the hell did I say this?
""Oh, well, I don't know. I try to eat healthy, natural foods...you know, like wild berries and honey and stuff.""
""Yeah, I like food too."" *facepalm*

Man, I was so nervous. Anyway, we finally begin squaring my stuff away. She looks up what I registered with in the beginning of the year. This is when the crap really hit the fan. This is how the conversation went:

""Okay, you're account name is [my name] and your password is ...'depewissexy'...""

Oh damn. I completely forgot that I put that as my password in the beginning of the year. What the hell was I thinking? It was probably the longest 20 seconds of my life before I finally got my balls together to stand up and leave. Just as I walk out the door she says,

""In the future, you might want to bear in mind what kind of things you want keep to yourself.""

I was so freaking embarrassed I wanted to kill myself right then and there. I wanted to run the hell out of there and never, ever see her again. But something about what she just said kept me standing in her doorway. I decided to man up and apologize. I turned to her, looked her straight in the eyes, and swallowed my pride. And then, it hit me like a train full of bricks.

She was eating Salmon.

She tries to eat all healthy, natural foods, like wild berries and honey.

She told me that I might want to bear in mind what kind of things I want to keep to myself.

Ms. Depew was a bear disguised as a human.

Immediately, the bear saw that I had seen through its charade. It roared loudly and took a menacing swipe at me. I deftly avoided its claw and sprinted out of the office. The bear was soon in chase, crashing through the walls of the office as if they were made of paper. I jumped over the receptionist desk and ran out the back entrance. The bear followed, tossing the secretary aside like a rag doll. The bear began to pursue me through the street traffic. While I fought my way through the maze of vehicles, the bear simply careened its massive force through anything standing in its way. Cars veered off the road to escape the onslaught of grizzly force that was barreling down the road. The bear was gaining fast. I had no other option but to make my way into the nearest building: a preschool. I burst through the door, startling the children from their naps. Immediately, the bear slammed through the wall, crushing a child beneath his massive paws and burying several other children in sheet rock and debris. I maneuvered my way through the chaos towards the back exit. The pre-schoolers were little more than a screaming annoyance for the bear. Its massive paws cut swaths through the sea of toddlers with each swipe. I used the precious time these children had afforded for me to make my escape into the playground. I scrambled up a ladder to a fort-like structure. My goal was to walk across the monkey bars then jump to a tree which I could climb to the roof of the preschool and perhaps flag down a passing helicopter.

I began my trek across the monkey bars just as the bear charged outside, its teeth and claws still fresh with the blood of the innocent. It let out a monstrous roar and began its assault on the cheap, wooden
playset. I let go of all caution and ran to end the end of the monkey bars. I leaped for the tree branch just as the bear's enormous girth came plowing through the entire structure. I grasped the branch tightly as the bear collided with the tree, sending it into a daze. I saw this as my one opportunity not for escape, but for victory. I leapt off the tree onto the ground and grabbed a stray bar that had been shorn from the playset. The bear was slowly coming to so I had to act fast. I ran to the beast and thrust the jagged end of the pole into its jaw and through it's skull.

The bear had been defeated. I shambled home in pain but victorious.There will be more threads and more bears in the months to come.

But today, I returned home a champion."

I am already employed at the college in a part time position, I'm familiar with the director and I've worked with her briefly. My current boss suggested I apply for this job since the move to make my current job full time has been denied.


---------------------


Dear Ms. XXXXX,

I was excited to hear of the Assistant Director of Career Services and Internships position, as I believe my past experiences combined with my personality and connection to the THE COLLEGE community set me apart in what I have to offer. My experience developing and nurturing relationships with clients, preparing and conducting training workshops, and my strong computer skills make me an ideal candidate for this position. 

As my enclosed resume indicates, my educational and professional experiences meet your needs. I think you will agree that my background in survey development and implementation, management of large databases, delivery of professional development and training presentations, and established relationships with THE COLLEGE’s faculty, staff and students would allow me to immediately contribute to your Career Services program development. My assessment and survey development background at THE COLLEGE coupled with being an THE COLLEGE alumnus provides me with a unique perspective as to the needs and concerns of our students. Additionally, my Psychology curriculum and research experience has provided me with a strong foundation of testing and assessment. 

I assure you that my skills will reveal that I am far more than a data manager, but rather am a vibrant, energetic professional who relates well with faculty and students alike and excels in building and nurturing relationships.  Also, in my previous work experience, utilizing my strong Internet research skills and outstanding interpersonal communication abilities, I was able to identify and establish partnerships with wholesale clients for the distribution and promotion of my company’s products. My personality and skill set are well suited for serving as a liaison both internally to campus departments and externally to local employers on behalf of Career Services.

Finally, my understanding of and commitment to promoting the mission and vision of THE COLLEGE as well as my experience as a student here at the THE COLLEGE prove invaluable in assisting students with understanding how to transfer a liberal arts education to the future work or graduate study. I would welcome an opportunity to speak to you further about how I might fit the needs of your office. Thank you in advance for your consideration.

**+**Slightly better compensation (+700/month)

**+**Fairly interesting project (MIGHT get to work on technology that game developers will use for mobile)

**+**It's Microsoft (GOOD, STABLE, and BIG company)

**-**Away from home (I'll be lonely because all of my friends that will start working at Microsoft will start as full time employees towards the last 2-3 weeks of my internship)

**-**I've interned at Microsoft before (different team), so it won't be a new experience (I'm interested in startups)


**Zynga:**

**+**I get to work on games (however, I'm not a fan of their games)

**+**Get experience in the game industry

**+**The internship will be in my hometown (I'll be close to my friends and family)

**+**Still a fairly small, startup-like company, so I'll get a new experience

**+**Free lunch and dinner

**-**Slightly smaller compensation (-700/month)

**-**It's ZYNGA (I'm not a fan of the company, they just went public, and I've haven't heard or read good things from the employees)"

I'm a Computer Science student, and I'm in a bit of a pickle. I currently have an offer for a summer internship with Microsoft and Zynga, and I don't know which one to choose. Something to keep in mind is that I'm interested in getting into the video game industry. I'd appreciate any advice! By the way, this will be my last internship before I graduate, and in the past, I've interned at Apple and Microsoft.

**EDIT:** The reason I mention being away from friends and family is because two summers ago I interned at Apple, where I didn't know many people, and last summer I interned at Microsoft, where 3 of my close friends also interned. As a result, I enjoyed my summer at Microsoft much more than my summer at Apple because I wasn't lonely."
njouq,92,2011-12-20,New to SNSD? This post is for you :D,DJ_Byun,SNSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/njouq/new_to_snsd_this_post_is_for_you_d/,"Browsing around [/r/SNSD](/r/SNSD) I've noticed quite a few posts of people asking for more info on certain SNSD related subjects. Newer fans are probably curious about the shows SNSD have been on (which would explain inside jokes that long time fans would know lol), as well as SNSD's past songs / albums. To help the newer fans, I've compiled a list of required SoShi viewing. Hopefully this helps newer fans who are interested in learning more about SNSD, who necessarily don't know how to go about finding what they want.

****

**Required Viewing:**

* *Girls Go to School* (2007): A 9 episode documentary of SNSD, covering their time right before and during their debut. It shows the girls moving in together for the first time, as well showing their first live performance on Mnet's **School of Rock**. See how it all started and see how far these girls have come. [WATCH HERE](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4B4FCF006758F167&amp;feature=plcp).

* *MTV's Girls' Generation* (2007): Another documentary filmed around the same time as GGTS, this one is also 9 episodes long, with each episode focusing on one member at a time (starting with Sooyoung and ending with Taeyeon). Get to know the quirks, personalities and aspirations of each member. [WATCH HERE](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2BB92300435644E6&amp;feature=plcp).

****

**Variety Show Appearances:**

* *Factory Girl* (2008): A show focusing on SNSD as fashion interns for **Elle Girl, Korea**. They are divided into two groups, and the two groups are then put into fashion competitions (the teams are; **Candy Girls**, Taeyeon, Jessica, Sunny, Yuri and Yoona - **Dream Girls**, Tiffany, Hyoyeon, Seohyun and Sooyoung). [WATCH HERE](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4DF8F05542C11575&amp;feature=plcp).

* *Horror Movie Factory* (2009): A variety show that focuses on having the girls go through 'scary' moments in order to help them with their acting in various situations. It's a short show, only having 6 episodes and the premise of the show changes about 3 episodes in. It goes from the girls experiencing scary moments while acting out scenarios and ends up as an extended acting lesson for the girls. It's filled with hilarious moments from the girls. [WATCH HERE](http://ithetimes.wordpress.com/mbc-snsd-horror-movie-factory-eng-sub/).

* *SNSD's Hello Baby!* (2009): A show about SNSD taking on the role of moms as they babysit a baby for months (not entirely sure how long, maybe half a year?). An awesome show filled with laughs and awkward moments (watching 9 girls attempt to change a baby **boy's** diaper is hilarious). It was supposed to be a show about teaching the girls the roles of motherhood, but it ended up being a show with SNSD playing with a baby and with each other. [WATCH HERE](http://ithetimes.wordpress.com/kbs-joy-snsd-hello-baby-season-1-eng-sub/).

* *Invincible Youth (Season 1 and 2)* (2009 - Present): A variety show which puts idol girls in the middle of rural South Korea and are taught how to live the life of a farmer. They learn how to farm certain vegetables, they learn how to take care of farm animals, they learn how to drive farming machines, and they learn how to cook. Watch as the girls go from 'City Idols' to 'Farming Idols' and their growth as friends. Season 1 had our very own **Sunny** and **Yuri**, and also starred fellow idol girls; **Narsha** from the Brown Eyed Girls, **Hara** from Kara, **Hyuna** from 4minute, **Hyomin** from T-ARA and **Sunhwa** from Secret. Later on in the show it also had; **Victoria** from f(x), **Juyeon** from After School and solo singer **Sori**. Watch Season 1 [HERE](http://entertainments10.blogspot.com/2010/11/invincible-youth.html) (Thanks to [kimbrough](http://www.reddit.com/user/kimbrough) for the link). Season 2 of Invincible Youth is currently airing, new location (a fishing village) and new members. The new members are ; **Sunny** and **Hyoyeon**, **Woori** from Rainbow, **Bora** from Sistar, **Jiyoung** from Kara, **Amber** from f(x), **Suzy** from Miss A and **Yewon** from Jewelry. Watch Season 2 [HERE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-56NNoV9zfc&amp;feature=results_main&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PL7B1F36AA29B09E5F).

* *We Got Married (Season 1 and 2)* (2009 - 2011): A variety show which puts random celebrities into fake marriages (yes you read that right lol). They do what any married couple does, they move into a house, they cook together, they go on dates, and they actually take wedding pictures together. **Season 1** had our very own 'Kid Leader' Taeyeon, who was paired up with popular comedian Jung Hyungdon. They were nicknamed the '**Pudding and Jelly**' couple. Watch the couple [HERE](http://ithetimes.wordpress.com/mbc-wgm-pudding-and-jelly-couple-eng-sub/). **Season 2** had our innocent, sometimes borderline unemotional, maknae Seohyun, who was paired up with the leader and lead vocalist of idol band CN Blue, Jung Yonghwa. They were nicknamed the '**Goguma**' couple (for Seohyun's love for sweet potatoes) and the '**YongSeo**' couple (**Yong**hwa + **Seo**hyun). Season 2 is definitely a must watch for fans, Season 1 was very short and had some funny moments, but it wasn't really engaging (the age difference between Taeyeon and Hyungdon really turned off some people, and the fact that he was in actual relationship at the time didn't help at all). The YongSeo couple moments are fantastic, unless you're a huge Seohyun fanboy who gets jealous easily lol. Watch the YongSeo couple [HERE](http://gogumaepisodes.blogspot.com/p/goguma-episodes.html).

* *Girls' Generation and the Dangerous Boys* (2012): Their newest variety show, it puts the girls as guidance counselors for troubled boys (high school boys). The girls are divided into 5 different groups to guide 5 different boys. The boys themselves will actually be living together as well. Watch the first episode [HERE](http://www.youtube.com/user/taenacity#p/u/4/tq9Vyc5BRoA).

* *Numerous Popular Show Appearances* (2007 - Present): Part of the girls' ridiculous fame is the amount of shows they have appeared on. Newer fans may have watched awesome clips of SNSD on shows but have no idea where they are from, so I compiled a list of shows that they have appeared on. Shows: **Family Outing, Running Man, Strong Heart, Star Golden Bell, Star King, Happy Together, and Star Life Theater.** Find these shows on [Soshified](http://soshified.com/), the biggest SNSD international fan website on the internet.

****

**Drama Appearances:**

* *Unstoppable Marriage* (2007): Featuring cameos from Yuri and Sooyoung. [MORE HERE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstoppable_Marriage).

* *You Are My Destiny* (2008): Yoona's first major role, it's also the role that helped her break through in terms of acting (she won an award for best new actress for her role as Jang Saebyuk). It's a daily drama which is a whopping 178 episodes long. If you're a fan of Yoona, it's a must watch. [MORE HERE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Are_My_Destiny_\(TV_series\)).

* *Cinderella Man* (2009): Yoona's second major role, a mini-series which is only 16 episodes long (each episode is about an hour). It didn't do very well ratings wise, but I enjoyed it more than YAMD. [WATCH HERE](http://www.dramafever.com/drama/40/1/Cinderella_Man/).

* *Fashion King* (Currently Airing): Yuri's first major role in a drama, she plays a fashion designer named 'Choi Anna'. Watch Fashion King [HERE](http://www.dramafever.com/drama/4100/1/Fashion_King/).

* *Love Rain* (Currently Airing): Yoona's third major role (her first in almost 3 years), it's a double role, as she plays two characters in the series (her co-star Jang Geun Suk also plays two roles). Watch Love Rain [HERE](http://www.dramafever.com/drama/4099/1/Love_Rain/).

Within 6 months I renegotiated my salary to 30K and moved up to IT Consultant (to me that's a career change, not a raise).

It's been a year since, but about 8 months ago, I was been assigned to a specific client, working with MS Exchange 2010, AD, BES, MS Project + Visio, and other things like managing projects, having interns assigned to me (from the client), and creating policies with departments such as HR and Accounting. It's a mix of Tech Support, SysAdmin, and maybe analyst.

I've had friends recently give me job offers elsewhere that pay around 35K, just for Helpdesk and a similar one for Tier 1 support. They both laughed at the amount of work I said I did when I told them my salary. 

Am I getting underpaid? If so, what should I be asking for?

**EDIT:** I don't have a college degree, but I'm also maintaining an outdated Nortel Phone System, work with software licensing, Software/Hardware Inventory (which the client didn't have before me), and will soon be working with Hosted Exchange."
nlezb,9,2011-12-21,Professional Ents - Please give me some advice!,EntProThrow,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/nlezb/professional_ents_please_give_me_some_advice/,"Sorry to use a throw away account but I'm at a loss.

I came to discover my love for trees in college, and we soon became inseparable. Unfortunately my choice of major, and internships, was in engineering (in manufacturing in particular).  Most engineering jobs require drug testing, particularly in a heavy manufacturing environment. 

So as you can see there is an impasse between the two things I love. I was willing to not smoke for the 4-5 months out of the year I needed to be ""clean"", for the four years I was interning at school.

Around the time of graduation I contracted Chron's Disease. This permanently eliminated my other chosen vices of smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol (they cause me extreme pain, bodily damage). Smoking trees became much more important to me.

So after graduation I decided to expand my horizons a little bit beyond manufacturing. I followed up with a Masters in Business Administration. I finished up my coursework with a very high GPA, and will be graduating in January. I hoped having an advanced degree as well as an engineering degree from a prestigious university would give me the leverage necessary to bypass the drug test issue.

The problem is that i still want to have a lucrative and successful career. In the business field this mostly exists in management, accounting, and finance. Being that I don't have an accounting or finance background, I have a big disadvantage to apply to these jobs. Also, if I work in accounting or finance, my engineering pedigree will basically be worthless.

I really have trouble coming to terms with the fact that despite all of this ability I have gained over the years, the fact that I like to smoke trees trumps any future employer's into thinking I'm some stereotypical worthless stoner. 

In the past when I had other fun options, like drinking, it wasn't as hard to stop smoking. Now it's the only choice I have left in terms of vice. I think that I deserve to have at least one vice. My partner of 5 years who I will likely marry also likes to smoke trees. Her career choice makes it easy for her though (shes an art historian).  Obviously I would like to smoke trees with my future wife into our old age.

I really want to find a career where my two lifestyles are compatible. I want to find an employer who will appreciate me for my ability and contribution and not discount me because of my like for trees. However, I feel if I even mention the question of drug testing to an employer, regardless of whether they require it or not, my resume will be thrown out. I am not willing to wear a whizzinator and lie to my employer/attempt to beat their test. It isn't a choice that is sustainable for a career. 

I want to know if there are any professional ents out their who have some advice on how to proceed with my life. How did you find a career as opposed to looking for ""jobs""? 
Are there any ENTrepreneurs out their who have the same ideologies I do? If so, would you be willing to give this man a chance, or point me in the direction of someone who will?

About me and the company:
I'm the hiring manager for a web development team, working at PayPal.


The team spends a good chunk of their team innovating new products and possibilities. We build tools and JS libraries for the rest of the company, prototype new products, build production versions of some of the main PayPal products, and think of our own products that we build and sell to the business.


I'm looking to build out my team significantly and develop great products. Nothing is off limits to the team; want to build for mobile? consoles? tablets? - I encourage you learning how and we'll put that knowledge to use.


I'm willing to relocate individuals from other states and countries, but please note that if you're in another country, you are going to have be a star.


Lead and Senior Web Developer Requirements:
I'm looking for multiple senior and lead web/front end/UI developers. As a senior developer, you should have a deep understanding of applications, MVC, OO programming, etc. The application language itself is not very important to me, as long as you have experience working in medium to large sized applications that use MVC, templating, scripting language (jsp/asp/etc).


What I'm ultimately looking for is a very well rounded developer with a strong emphasis and passion on the presentation tier. You should have very strong knowledge and experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - and you take into consideration aspects such as site speed, accessibility, mobile users, user experience, security, product value, etc. I would assume you have a deep understanding of how the browser works.

In terms of personality, I'm hoping that I can place you on projects or initiatives and not have to worry about it. I don't want to micro manage. You should be able to not just develop the project (and make sure it's on time), but bring great business value in other ways depending on your skills (that might be improving code tools, security, user experience, product, or anything else you're passionate about).


Responsibilities for the position include, making good architectural decisions, mentor/train our more junior developers, do code reviews, be responsible for the project you're on.


College Grad Requirements:
I'm also hiring computer science college grads, and the requirements are simple. Be passionate and show me that your passionate by sending me links to applications you have built outside of school and internship

Need some advice (tl;dr included),rohanprabhu,hyderabad,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyderabad/comments/nl13r/moving_to_hyderabad_need_some_advice_tldr_included/,"Hi all.. I am moving to Hyderabad from Bangalore this January and was hoping to get some advice from my dear Hyderabadi redditors. I was in hyderabad last summer for 2 months as part of my internship stint. There was a place in Kothaguda (Shilpa Park, to be specific) where for a monthly rent of Rs. 10,500, the following facilities were available:

* A single room with cupboards and necessary furnishing.
* A/C
* Attached bathroom
* Television (an actually kick-ass one)
* Cable television (might also be DTH, don't quite remember)
* WiFi enabled internet connection
* Lunch and Dinner (veg and non-veg)
* Daily cleaning of the house
* Shared refrigerator, kitchen and dining area

So, my question is, could I avail the same facilities in Madhapur for a similar rent? I am being posted as intern in HiTec city, so I believe Madhapur would be the best area for me.

Also, at hyderabad, the guesthouse where I was given accommodation for 15 days, had a Beam telecom internet connection and I got some crazy speeds there. The plans say 1000 bucks a month for a 10mbps line (2 mbps post 40gb). Despite the cap of 40GB, this is an awesome package compared to other broadband services. So, can anyone tell me how good their service is in the long run?

**EDIT**: Got a deal for Rs. 10000 in Madhapur. All facilities, but the best part is that this place is much bigger than the one I had gotten earlier and the flat is totally new.. I would be the first person occupying that place.. so its totally spic :) Thank you all for your help.

**tl;dr**: Saw a room for 10.5K a month with A/C, internet, lunch+dinner and shared fridge and kitchen at Kothaguda. Can I get the same at Madhapur?

**tl;dr2**: How is the service on Beam telecom in the long run?"

I've applied to several places, and get the interview, but don't get the job.  I don't have any internship experience, even though I have applied for 2 summers, I still didn't get them.  

Now I am a graduate with no experience.  I find postings with qualifications along the lines of: Sophmore pursuing Computer Science or related degree.

Can I apply for these internships as a graduate to simply get some experience?

Sadly, I remember reading a post about a graduate who got a degree and doesn't feel like they know how to program properly.  This is how I feel now, even though when I am given questions during my interview, I feel like I answered the questions correct.  The parts I feel I tend to fail lie in inexperience and software design (in particular, OO).

I NEED ADVICE REDDIT!,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/nm1fz/not_one_for_asking_advice_ive_always_been_one_to/,"apologize but this might be a bit to read. 

Here goes:

About a year and 4 months ago my Fiancé and I had our first child. Things were very stressful as I was on route to finish college and she had just finished but had no job. I don't regret my daughter one bit because she molded and made me be where I am today. Anyway getting back to things, our daughter was born 25 weeks and we were just in a dark place with neither of us having steady good paying jobs, me having to finish college and the fact that everything became weight on my shoulders to figure out a gameplan. Once I started motivating myself to leave my shitty Radioshack job, which no way in hell would be able to provide money to support my newborn daughter and ideally my fiancé, I began with paid internships in NYC of which I began saving up. I saved up to pay my school bills for the semester and saved some money on the side for any emergencies that my daughter, fiancé and I would need. Anywho after saving up I came to a conclusion that I wouldn't be able to afford paying rent for an apartment, paying to continue to go to school and affording to pay for expenses my daughter fiancé and I needed. Cue my wonderful parents. They had no problem letting us stay over their house, which at the time was small, on the one condition that once the fiancé and baby came in we would help around and clean up after ourselves. THEY DIDN'T EVEN ASK ME TO PAY FOR FOOD OR RENT. Sounds simple enough right? Wrong. Ok being a first time parent is indeed one of the most difficult tasks ever. No sleep, waking up early to catch the train to NYC, coming home at 7-8 pm exhausted was not pretty. Well the first half year I would make it a routine to always be clean, help with the baby as much as I could and just be a good father/spouse. The fiancé didn't do much besides watch the baby and that was it. Now I love her to death and I know she is a great mother, but I should have began to find it a bit concerning that she had become used to me doing all the cleaning up after her while she used the excuse that the baby was full time work.. Now I'm not stupid. When babies are newborn all they do is eat sleep and shit. I know because all I would do on weekends was help her with the baby, which was not much except the fact when she would wake up in the middle of the night to be fed, changed, or her stomach was upsetting her. Well at first my parents got a bit pissed off when they noticed all we would do was spend time in the room they gave up for us and we wouldn't do anything regarding helping out around the house they were letting us live in practically for free. The arguments began and my mother and father began talking to us as adults, that we are, to begin smartening up or get out if we were going to continue living like slobs and not help out. So only I at the moment smartened up. The fiancé kept using the baby as an excuse to not do anything which left me with everything. So I began waking up early to clean up, make the bed on weekends after the fiancé woke up, keep the room organized and even cook breakfast/lunch/dinner for us while she watched the baby. Well my dad is pretty old fashioned and he pulled me to the side and said ""son.. You wake up at 6am everyday, go to work, come home at 7-8 pm, you then have to clean up and on top of that after her? Come on you and I know the baby sleeps practically all day.. She has time to do some chores and more time left over to make you something to eat when you get home. As a woman, she should be at least responsible to clean and cook and take care of the baby if your going to work preparing yourself for a future and saving up for a place for your family. Talk to her and have her help out."" Dads, smart motherfuckers. Anyway I don't tell her that my dad told me this, but bring it up to her that it was killing me to practically be doing everything on top of working. She gets offended, gives me the bs excuse that watching the baby is hard and gets extremely mad and upset. I start getting a bit depressed because I feel like everything is on me. Well cue 1 yr later and the same BS with me still doing everything. Parents end up making a huge extension of the house and give us our own room and the baby her own room. I become a consultant in the medical IT field and things begin to look promising financially. Less stress as work is closer to home and going to school PT. However same BS with her not helping until we get in a huge argument. She leaves, threatens to never let me see my daughter again, and has her stepfather threaten me. All in all I'm made out to look like a bad guy. Now I'll be honest, yeah when we argued I called her some names that I wish I could take back but I couldn't handle my stress of having to hold this huge weight on my shoulders anymore. She leaves to go back to her parents house the same weekend it's fathers day. Didn't even spend my first fathers day with my daughter which made me, a grown man cry. She comes fathers day, gives me a fathers day picture she had of the baby done for me(didn't even bring the baby with her) and leaves. Feel like my heart has been ripped out of my body. At this point I tell her never to text me or talk to me. All I wanted was to K.I.T with my daughter and see her as much as I could. Well not even 2 weeks go by and whatayaknow she says that she wants to meet up. Says she's gonna bring the baby and wants to talk. I was still pissed at her but if that meant I get to see my daughter well fuck it I'll meet with her. We meet up for dinner I give my daughter a kiss and hug after not seeing her for 2 weeks and we talk. She says she wants to come back and live with me and my family because things weren't going well at home. There were constant arguments regarding the baby making noise and not letting anyone sleep. I tell her I'll think about it. Go home talk to the parents, they're not happy but they know that I'm happy as long as they know I get to see my daughter and they get to see their grandchild. They agree but say that if it happens again to seek counseling or split up for my sanity. We agree that if she comes back to the house that she will need to find a job and behind helping around the house and not use the baby as am excuse. She comes back and I tell her my parents rules. She gets annoyed but I enforce it and she obliges. She begins working part time like myself but continues to be a complete mess. Always wants to go out and shop on weekends and not keep our room tidy. I begin getting fed up cleaning up after her and working part time and going to school part time and coming home to a messy room. Parents intervene and talk to her and tell her that if she expects so much she should at least have the decency to help as she doesn't work full time and doesn't collaborate at all in the house. I then tell her no way in hell I'm going to save up my hard earned money and waste it all on an apartment that she's not gonna help keep clean and organized AND always using our daughter as an excuse to not do anything. I've began losing feelings for her but don't want our daughter growing up with separated parents. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I offered her to go to couples counseling and she wants nothing of it because according to her she's not crazy.. Please if anyone has gone through something like this any input would be greatly appreciated.

Edit 1:
TL;DR fiancé doesn't help out expects me to do everything and uses excuse that our 1 yr old daughter is hard work.

Edit 2: typed all of this from an iPhone sorry.

HELP!",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/nm0yk/reddit_i_am_not_one_to_ask_for_advice_as_i_always/,"I apologize but this might be a bit to read. 

Here goes:

About a year and 4 months ago my Fiancé and I had our first child. Things were very stressful as I was on route to finish college and she had just finished but had no job. I don't regret my daughter one bit because she molded and made me be where I am today. Anyway getting back to things, our daughter was born 25 weeks and we were just in a dark place with neither of us having steady good paying jobs, me having to finish college and the fact that everything became weight on my shoulders to figure out a gameplan. Once I started motivating myself to leave my shitty Radioshack job, which no way in hell would be able to provide money to support my newborn daughter and ideally my fiancé, I began with paid internships in NYC of which I began saving up. I saved up to pay my school bills for the semester and saved some money on the side for any emergencies that my daughter, fiancé and I would need. Anywho after saving up I came to a conclusion that I wouldn't be able to afford paying rent for an apartment, paying to continue to go to school and affording to pay for expenses my daughter fiancé and I needed. Cue my wonderful parents. They had no problem letting us stay over their house, which at the time was small, on the one condition that once the fiancé and baby came in we would help around and clean up after ourselves. THEY DIDN'T EVEN ASK ME TO PAY FOR FOOD OR RENT. Sounds simple enough right? Wrong. Ok being a first time parent is indeed one of the most difficult tasks ever. No sleep, waking up early to catch the train to NYC, coming home at 7-8 pm exhausted was not pretty. Well the first half year I would make it a routine to always be clean, help with the baby as much as I could and just be a good father/spouse. The fiancé didn't do much besides watch the baby and that was it. Now I love her to death and I know she is a great mother, but I should have began to find it a bit concerning that she had become used to me doing all the cleaning up after her while she used the excuse that the baby was full time work.. Now I'm not stupid. When babies are newborn all they do is eat sleep and shit. I know because all I would do on weekends was help her with the baby, which was not much except the fact when she would wake up in the middle of the night to be fed, changed, or her stomach was upsetting her. Well at first my parents got a bit pissed off when they noticed all we would do was spend time in the room they gave up for us and we wouldn't do anything regarding helping out around the house they were letting us live in practically for free. The arguments began and my mother and father began talking to us as adults, that we are, to begin smartening up or get out if we were going to continue living like slobs and not help out. So only I at the moment smartened up. The fiancé kept using the baby as an excuse to not do anything which left me with everything. So I began waking up early to clean up, make the bed on weekends after the fiancé woke up, keep the room organized and even cook breakfast/lunch/dinner for us while she watched the baby. Well my dad is pretty old fashioned and he pulled me to the side and said ""son.. You wake up at 6am everyday, go to work, come home at 7-8 pm, you then have to clean up and on top of that after her? Come on you and I know the baby sleeps practically all day.. She has time to do some chores and more time left over to make you something to eat when you get home. As a woman, she should be at least responsible to clean and cook and take care of the baby if your going to work preparing yourself for a future and saving up for a place for your family. Talk to her and have her help out."" Dads, smart motherfuckers. Anyway I don't tell her that my dad told me this, but bring it up to her that it was killing me to practically be doing everything on top of working. She gets offended, gives me the bs excuse that watching the baby is hard and gets extremely mad and upset. I start getting a bit depressed because I feel like everything is on me. Well cue 1 yr later and the same BS with me still doing everything. Parents end up making a huge extension of the house and give us our own room and the baby her own room. I become a consultant in the medical IT field and things begin to look promising financially. Less stress as work is closer to home and going to school PT. However same BS with her not helping until we get in a huge argument. She leaves, threatens to never let me see my daughter again, and has her stepfather threaten me. All in all I'm made out to look like a bad guy. Now I'll be honest, yeah when we argued I called her some names that I wish I could take back but I couldn't handle my stress of having to hold this huge weight on my shoulders anymore. She leaves to go back to her parents house the same weekend it's fathers day. Didn't even spend my first fathers day with my daughter which made me, a grown man cry. She comes fathers day, gives me a fathers day picture she had of the baby done for me(didn't even bring the baby with her) and leaves. Feel like my heart has been ripped out of my body. At this point I tell her never to text me or talk to me. All I wanted was to K.I.T with my daughter and see her as much as I could. Well not even 2 weeks go by and whatayaknow she says that she wants to meet up. Says she's gonna bring the baby and wants to talk. I was still pissed at her but if that meant I get to see my daughter well fuck it I'll meet with her. We meet up for dinner I give my daughter a kiss and hug after not seeing her for 2 weeks and we talk. She says she wants to come back and live with me and my family because things weren't going well at home. There were constant arguments regarding the baby making noise and not letting anyone sleep. I tell her I'll think about it. Go home talk to the parents, they're not happy but they know that I'm happy as long as they know I get to see my daughter and they get to see their grandchild. They agree but say that if it happens again to seek counseling or split up for my sanity. We agree that if she comes back to the house that she will need to find a job and behind helping around the house and not use the baby as am excuse. She comes back and I tell her my parents rules.

I spent a lot of time in community college and pretty much got all my gen eds done and all my computer science classes done as well. I then decided I was going to transfer to get my bachelors degree. Well my first choice in schooling got shot down and this school was my back up option, but looking at the course list a bit more, I am kinda saddened.

 ACIS stands for Applied Computer science and Information systems. There are three tracks to take in it and I'm taking the Mobile and game development track atm. When I look at the degree courses I need to take though I don't see any courses in compiler's or Operating systems and this really bothers me as I've always been curious about the real low level operations in computers. I didn't notice this before as the school just recently changed their degree offerings and in the course catalog it still has these courses up even though I don't think they are doing them any more. 

Any way Reddit I feel stuck in a bad decision and am not sure how to move forward on it. I am thinking of spamming internships as fast as possible to try to get my foot in the door and network with people so that when I get out I have more experience to show that I am actively willing to learn and work. Also I am thinking of doing a project on the side just for myself if I have the time for it. Do you guys have any other suggestions?  If you  need more information just let me know and I'll edit this."

Well I finally have something to put on my list since my *wonderful* ex spent the week building me up just so he could destroy me on Christmas Eve. 

Now I am gonna rant but if you do read it, hell even if you don't, I could really use some uplifting words and some holiday cheer. Here it goes.

He and I are both 20. Almost a year under our belt. Met in college. First real relationship for me and I was crazy about him from the start. However the bickering got to be too much for us, and I tried breaking up with him a couple days after Thanksgiving. However both of us lacked the self control required to stay away from each other. 

I had always asked for him to take me on a date, and we laughed at the irony when took me to dinner and a movie a week later after we broke up. We were talking for a while, and most importantly happy. No bickering. I could feel myself latching onto him again though, and with failed attempts at distancing myself from him (it's hard to distance yourself from someone who lives in the same dorm as you), I gave up and gave him everything I had again. 

We started sleeping together again and it was better than ever. I felt excited like I did when I first met him. I would look over at him and see him smiling at me from across the room. Things went on like this until break. I prepared myself and told him we could have our space over winter. 

And then there is this week. I feel sick to my stomach just thinking about everything. 

On Monday, his psychedelic mushroom trip brought upon fleeting feelings for me. 

Tuesday he confessed how much he was thinking about me and how special I was to him. I tried not to let it get to my head.

On Wednesday, he got drunk at a party and called me to tell me that after much thought, he had come to terms with the fact that he loved me. I told him I wouldn't believe him until he could tell me in a sober state. And he did. 

The next morning he called me, apologized for the drunk call and confirmed that he meant it. He then proceeded to invite me to a holiday potluck with his friends and then to a party afterwards. Against everything in my head that told me not to go, I couldn't help myself and drove 45 minutes through the pouring rain to meet with him. He was drunk by the time I got there and ran through the streets saying how much he loved me. He eventually got mad that I wasn't returning the affection to extent he was and I told him I was confused. The night was amazing. We drank, we gleefully ran around 7 Eleven grabbing all the junk food we desired, we went back to his place where we proceeded to smoke and pig out and have sex. This whole time he was assuring me he wanted to be with me, how much he loved me, how beautiful a person I was. I kept laughing it off and begging him ""please don't say these things if you really don't mean them."" 

I guess you could say things turned sour. It sounds funnier than it was but mid-sex he accidentally thrust into my clenched, unseasoned asshole. I screamed in pain and started crying. He apologized profusely, and I told him it was okay as I brushed his hair aside. I let him finish in my but from here he felt too bad. And he said that I was the one making him feel bad. He wouldn't touch me the entire night, and the next morning you could say we both woke up on the wrong side of the bed. I left for an appointment I had. I texted him and said I was sorry for being grumpy and that I had fun the night before and I hoped he had a good day. No response. I brushed it off. I waited. I went over everything in my head. I couldn't stop thinking about everything he said. I was fully ready to start things again, us both as better people. 

Last night I called him while he was with his friends. I told him I didn't want to bother him, but that I had wanted to talk to him. He was short so I asked what was wrong. He said he was upset because he didn't feel accomplished compared to his friends. I immediately responded with this, ""Nobodys lives run at the same pace. Some friends may have amazing internships now, but who is to say yours isn't around the corner? Or ten years from now? We have classmates who are already married parents. And we can always find flaws when we compare our lives to others. But you know what? None of your friends have a girl who cares so much about them. I'm here for you whatever you do."" And he admitted to being cheered. 

I proceeded to get wasted at a friends Christmas party and called him multiple times. Eventually I stopped once I felt like a psycho and let him be. 

And here we are today Christmas Eve. I wait all day for him to call me since historically he sleeps late and his phone is always dead. I answer and ask if everything is ok. What we proceeded to discuss was how he never wanted to see or speak to me again. He told me I ruined the idea of relationships for him. That I ruined talking on the phone with people. I asked him what caused this sudden change when he was so sure of loving me. He said he didn't want to be with me. He denied every statement he made to me. Every declaration of love he made, he now claimed I was either crazy or he was blackout drunk when he said it. I freaked. I felt like I was in some freaky nightmare. That my world had been ripped out from underneath me. I was crying and struggling to figure out why he was doing this. He was incapable of saying one kind, soothing word to me. 

And now I am alone on Christmas Eve. The holiday makeup I applied for tonights Christmas plans is now smeared across my cheeks. I am sitting here in my underwear with my outfit I had planned on the chair across the room. I am struggling to figure out where to go from here and what to feel. I feel like it is all my fault for falling for it all. This deception has left me completely broken. I can't imagine ever trusting anyone with my feelings ever again. And I don't ever want to see another Christmas.

**tldr; the ex convinced me he still loved and then denied saying or meaning any of it in a christmas eve phone call.**"

nparh,19,2011-12-24,How I want Season 7 to play out...,DexterrrMorgan,Dexter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/nparh/how_i_want_season_7_to_play_out/,"I kind of made this comment in another thread, but I wanted to expand on it.

So we all know the end of Season 6, and for many the question is: Will Deb realize that Dexter is the Bay Harbor Butcher? 

Personally, I do not want Deb to know right away, and I'll explain why in a minute. The obvious hurdle to her not knowing: is her overlooking the fact that Dexter is using the same MO as the BHB in the church. So let me go into how they could get around this.

**The Lie**

Dexter has finally been caught with his pants down. So what does he do? Well, he lies of course. Dexter tells Deb that after Rita was killed, he swore to himself that he would never let another serial killer harm another family again, if he has the opportunity to prevent it. He can even say he was fueled further by this when the man that killed Rita, went back and killed Jonah's Mom and Sister as well and is still out there (feed one lie into another lie). But we still have the problem with the BHB MO he's using. Simple. Dexter could tell Deb that as a blood analyst, he knew that Doakes's method was the most efficient and safe way of not spreading the evidence. Having worked his case directly, he took inspiration from that. Hell, he could even tell Deb that he's way in over his head and that this being his first kill, he didn't even want to do it. And that he wasn't even going to kill Travis, but was personally investigating him on the side, and then Travis took his son. So he decided he had to do it, for the safety of his family. Either way, there is a way for Dexter to throw Deb off for the moment, and it's with a good ol' fashion lie.

**Why I don't want Deb to know right away...**

In my opinion, Deb walking in on Dexter at the end of Season 6 did not really feel earned. Unlike Season 5 (where she used her intuition and detective skills to corner Dexter and Lumen) - Season 6 felt like she just stumbled in on it. It lacked tension and suspense for me (personally). But by her not knowing Dexter is the BHB right away, it does two major things.

* I. It builds up suspense throughout the Season, as Deb starts to doubt what Dexter is saying.  This in turn forces Deb to investigate into her brother, and start questioning his actions.

* II. They could use this plot to tie up all the loose ends of past plots that the Miami Metro (and FBI) foolishly overlooked. Remember how Dexter got arrested at the same bank as Trinity at the exact same time he was there? Remember how Deb saw Dexter at the Trinity house before anyone else, without a vest on, and in a location he shouldn't have even been? Remember how Rita was Trinity's last victim, and they never thought it was odd that Dexter was at the same bank as Trinity, and then his wife was the last victim? Not to mention the mysterious Kyle Butler that was some outside guy, that was intervening in their family matters. These are just a couple examples. But point being, Deb could start looking into some of things that might have bothered her in the past, and could start to realize one by one that Dexter IS in fact the BHB. That he's lying etc.

Not only does this vindicate past plot points, but it cleverly wraps up the entire story, and makes all of Dexter's past sloppy actions have actual consequence. It all comes back to bite him. This intensity would also be heightened if they choose to use Louis in Season 7 as the new killer. But he's not just a killer. He's a copy cat killer. He's trying to impress Dexter, and is actually learning from him. He's using his job at the Miami Metro (well, we'll see. They hinted that his internship was almost up. But if they do bring him back for a full time job, or even part time job) - he could use his job to foil his investigations, similar to what Dexter has been doing all along. So while Deb is dealing with her doubt with Dexter, Louis's killings will have a similar MO, making her think it's Dexter. 

The other aspect I like about this, is that Louis actually means well (in regards to Dexter). And it would be Dexter in a weird position, because Louis never knew the code. And would end up on his table by the end of the season for killing innocent people. He didn't know Dexter abides by this code, and will feel betrayed that his idol is not pleased with all that he has done.

So that's my take on Season 7. That's how I personally want it to play out. Would love to hear what you guys think. "

A lot of older engineers grew up in the heydays of the space age and were inspired to work on aircraft and spacecraft. Others are gearheads and love automotive stuff. That's all well and good, but it's not for me. I grew up in the computer age, starting with a classic Macintosh, progressing to building my own computers, and now being fascinated by the capabilities of smart phones. Stuff like this is exciting to me because it's still constantly breaking new ground, not stuff that has been ""figured out"" over many decades.


Whether it's software, hardware, networking, or something else, I find myself asking inquisitive questions: ""How do Google routers handle such massive traffic?"", for example. I don't find myself asking questions like that about many ""traditional"" mechanical topics, like turbomachinery, cars, aircraft and spacecraft, etc. 


I think that sort of curiosity is essential to be a good/fulfilled engineer, and I don't appear to have that sort of interest in mechanical topics (or maybe my courseload has simply crushed any extra inquisitiveness beyond that which is required).

So where do I go from here? I have been applying to a couple of ME grad programs to keep my options open, but ultimately I want to go to industry and make cool stuff.


**tl;dr**

Graduating with BSME in June. Interning at GE/NASA/Amazon made me realize I want to work in some sort of computer company or tech industry. What are my options?

np54o,5,2011-12-24,Fantastic girl shows the signals but then confuses the hell outta me.  Did I mess up or was there nothing ever there?,roy_boy,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/np54o/fantastic_girl_shows_the_signals_but_then/,"Hey reddit, I’m in a situation I have never faced before and I was looking for some input.  It’s a lengthy piece but it gives more than enough food for thought.  I put some bolded **TL;DR** if you want to skim but the devil is in the details here.  Any answer is appreciated!

I'm 20 years old and over the past six months I have become very close friends with a girl named Lorie, who has recently turned 19. A little background on Laurie first:  she is a sci-fi fanatic with vast knowledge of Dr. Who, Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galatica, Merlin, Firefly, Stargate and so many more it’s unbelievable.  She loves to read any and everything from pure science fiction to Palahniuk to the classics including her favorite The Count of Monty Cristo.  She also plays video games, and by play I mean she actually plays them for enjoyment.   Overall everyone sums her up as a guy in a girl’s body.

Our relationship started when I met her through a group of friends who all worked at the same theme park together.  When we first met I was dressed in a ridiculous pair of jean shorts and was very shy towards her.  Over the first few weeks after meeting her she began texting me through various friends’ phones at work teasing me on and asking for entertainment.  We would talk about science fiction, joke about the ridiculousness of my outfit when I met her, as well as playfully banter with each other.  I could always make her laugh too; she seemed to love it because she kept coming back for more saying she “loves the way you (I) text.”  She then got my number off of one of my friend’s phones and started texting me directly.

She lives about a half hour away and would always go to our friend Tyler’s house after work.  She has a bad home life so she would stay there for days on end sometimes, sleeping in the upstairs bunk bed.  I would be invited to come over and hang out, but it would always at least be her, Tyler, and me.  According to people from their work she and Tyler had gone on what Tyler had thought was a date but Lorie only considered it a trip to the movies with a friend.  Despite this, every time we would hang out at Tyler’s house, she would be touchy-feely with Tyler including hugging him, tickling him, and lying on top of him at times as well as saying the occasional “Tyler is my best friend” phrase.  Everyone from their work said they were the best of friends and only friends but it did not seem that way.

**TL;DR Girl named Laurie shows interest by getting my contact information on her own.  We text a lot and hang out at our friend Tyler’ house.  Tyler is her friend, but she has a lot of physical contact with him.**

The most upsetting time I hung out with Lorie over the summer was at one of her co-workers parties.  I arrived late and was greeted by a drunken Laurie.  We played some pong together and then she left when her one friend said “he’s halfway there, go for it.”  She came to me eventually and looking for Tyler, claiming he is who she goes to when she is not having a good time at a party, and eventually went with him upstairs to the bathroom.  I found her then alone and crying in the bathroom.  I put her on a couch and went to sleep myself.  I found out the following day that she was hoping to have sex with one of her other co-workers but got rejected.  She later told me that she becomes an emotional mess when in a drunken stupor and had apologized to her attempted one night stand, clarifying that they were now solely just friends.

The pinnacle of our hangouts over the summer came when we went on a trip to New York.  It was a trip planned by Tyler and Laurie as an end of summer event.  Laurie invited me saying that Tyler was bringing his two Chinese friends.  She continued to say that Tyler always entered an “Asian Mode” where he never listened to anyone but his international love interests so she needed someone to talk to.  She would always text me days before the trip asking if I was excited and that the trip was a big deal.  Prior to leaving, Laurie was introduced to Tyler’s best friend from up the street who was also my mutual friend since junior high school, Stefan, very important later.

So it was set that Tyler, Laurie, the two international girls from Tyler and Laurie’s job , and me went to the big apple for the day.  It was a fantastic time to say the least.  Laurie and I got a lot of one on one time going through the Museum of Natural History, the MoMa, and central park.  We joked of Tyler’s “Asian mode” and then shared a bed in the hotel but nothing happened since Tyler and company were in the same room.

**TL;DR Laurie tries to have sex with a co-worker and says alcohol make her an emotional wreck.  Laurie is introduced to our friend Stefan.  Laurie, Tyler, and I go to NYC but nothing happens between her and I.**

So summer ended and Tyler, Laurie, Stefan, and I all went back to school.  Stefan goes to school in California, Tyler in New York, and Laurie and I both in Ohio.  Laurie actually attends a branch campus of my college, the very branch campus I had spent two years previous at.

I thought that our texting would die down after school started, but it did not.  Laurie would always make attempts to ask me how the main campus was, how things were going in general for me, and where certain buildings were at her new branch campus, a lot of small talk.  Eventually, Laurie would send me messages saying she needed “help” with her calculus homework and that I should call her to help.  We fell into a groove where she would initiate these calls that ended up just being us talking about her our friends, her family life, school, good novels to read, and her dislike of guys who tried to hit on her at school, almost anything.  She began working at an internship two hours away as well where on her drive there she would call me to keep her company. 
 
She also revealed that unlike Tyler she and Stefan had been keeping in touch too.  She said she would Skype him at work for someone to talk to since his time difference had him up when she was at work.  She said he was not really a texter and did not like to initiate conversations but she could still get a hold of him on the phone if I was not available.  She said she had been forwarding the best drunken messages of mine to him and that they both wanted to see me drunk.

**TL;DR Laurie and I keep in touch after school starts up.  Contact goes from small talk via text to full phone conversations.  Laurie keeps in touch with Stefan but not so much Tyler and sends Stefan my drunken texts.**

When I would go home every so often, we would go hang out together.  One weekend she said I should come back to go out to eat with her, Tyler, and the group of friends she worked with over the summer.  I would not have been able to get back in time for the meal, but she suggested I come back anyways to hangout the next day.  We went alone together (Strokes fans rejoice) to see the Lion King in 3D and I tried to make a move by putting my arm around her but she did not have it.  I averted and made a joke of it to which she seemed genuinely amused.  She gave me the title of innocent kitten, which I thought was a way of saying I had no chance.  After this there were a few times where I came home and we hung out, but it always was with a group of people.  During one of these sessions she made a point to say that Tyler had thought they were on a date when they went to the movie during the summer, but that attempt by him had earned him a permanent spot in the friend zone.  This made me lose faith in a relationship even more.

**TL;DR Attempted to make a move on Laurie while at the movies together and pushed away, find out she says Tyler was friend zoned in a similar situation.**

I tried to get her to come up to my campus for Halloween weekend, but she said she could not get off work and on several occasions said how disappointed she was.  She came up the following week with my band mate, who was also a co-worker of hers.  We all got drunk both nights, but she got especially plastered the second night.  It resulted with regurgitation in my bed, disgusting but I managed to clean her up and made sure she wasn’t swallowing her own vomit.  In the process I had to maneuver her phone about and saw that she and I had the most amounts of texts, 900 some more than the closest person.

In the following week she said she was sorry that she vomited in my bed and I responded with the fact that “sheets were replaceable, which they were with silk ones, but you are not.”  She absolutely died and said she would save the message forever since it was so adorable.  One night while talking on the phone she was petting her cat and went on to say how cute and innocent it was.  She concluded saying that being an innocent kitten didn’t necessarily mean anything bad at all.

Mid November we got into a discussion where she said we should get married so she can stay in my bed.  I made nothing of it but later she asked if she was poor, would I marry her.  I said yes, of course, assuming she was joking and that that was that.  She continued to bring the discussion up weeks later though, saying how we would get married but our last names did not flow well so she would keep her own.  I went with it and had fun crafting our future together.

**TL;DR Sweet talk Laurie and she says its adorable and that her provided nicknames are not meant to be degrading.  She talks of a future where we get married.**

Around her birthday, in late November, I decided to send her personal hand-written card saying how happy I was that we kept in touch.  I went on to say that our talks always made my day, that she meant a lot to me, and that I thought she was beautiful. She texted me saying I was the ""best that ever lived"" and over Xbox Live the following day told me that it was a pleasant surprise to come home to and that for my birthday she was going to get me a pair of silk suit pajamas, which are extremely pricy for a friendship gift. Since then our texts had died down a bit yet she still called me, but again not as regular.

Recently during this winter break, we crossed the border to Canada to celebrate her birthday.  This was the first time I had physically seen her since the letter. Again, a group of our friends went, including Tyler and Stefan.  We had a great time and over dinner she said she was going to give me the nickname of “blue eyes” as she held my stare for extended periods of time, note though we all had alcoholic teas during this period.  Afterwards we were en route to get liquor for the night, still buzzed, and she said how she wished I would initiate texts with her more often and call her instead of her having to do the work.  She said that when I don’t respond to her calls, she goes to Stefan and attempts to figure out why I don’t call back.  We drank in the hotel that night and the next morning she, Stefan, and me watched a Plinket review in bed.  Tyler tried to lie on top of Laurie but she told him no skin to skin contact and pushed him to the side.  She then said her leg was cold so I warmed it with my arm, which she had no qualms about.  After Canada, she, Tyler, and Stefan were going to go to Tyler’s place in New York for the a few days and she really wanted me of all the others to go, but I had prior obligations.

**TL;DR Sent Laurie a hand written card saying how much she means to me.  She says I’m the best person that ever lived.  On a trip to Canada she sends signals that she is interested.**

If you are still here, this is where it all comes together.  A day after those three returned to the area, we were drinking with our friend group again.  She gave me her phone and I saw that she texted Stefan about the birthday letter I had sent her, demanding that Stefan had to call her. Their following texts said they were composing their own sappiest, cheesiest, and over romantic ""letters"" to each other, it seemed to be a joke.  Somewhere along the line Stefan told her that she was without flaws and she took it to heart. At this party she called Stefan her ""flawless gem"" and was very touchy-freely with him giving him a plethora of hugs and clinging onto him.  Despite this though, she would say in her drunken stupor that she “wants to remain single for the rest of her life.”  

I knew Stefan knew Laurie and I kept in touch so I went to him alone, playing the role of the plastered drunk, to attempt to divulge details she may have said about me.  I asked him if she had told him about the letter, which obviously from the texts from her phone proved he had,  and he said that she had not mentioned anything and that whatever I sent she was probably fine.  How could such a long time friend betray me?!   

We had another party last night for Christmas where I brought gifts for my friends, as I usually do this time of year.  I did not even get real thanks from Laurie for the gift, just a reassurance that I would get my silks.  She continued to talk and cling to Stefan flirting and having side conversations.  The final nail in the coffin came when I found out that Stefan would be taking Laurie to a wedding in August.

**TL;DR Found out Laurie told Stefan about the letter.  They made their own joke letter to each other and Stefan calls her flawless.  She starts calling him her flawless gem and is very flirtatious with him.  Stefan is taking her to a wedding this coming year as his date.**

My ultimatum was to ask Laurie out over this winter break but now I cannot decide what to do.  Everything seemed perfect until this whole flawless gem bull shit.  Is she just trying to be playful around Stefan since he will be gone for a while back in California or is there serious potential there for the foundation of a relationship between them?  Did I ruin my chances with her by sending her the letter or were there never any true feelings on her part, just teasing?  My only choices for a relationship now would be to wait to ask her on a date prior to new years to try and establish a connection, which I personally do not see as an effective way to move forward, or to go to a New Years Eve party I was invited to with her, Tyler, Stefan and crew and hope that alcohol works to my favor.  However I could always wait another semester of college until she comes up to my campus and have other people out of the way.  What should I do?!

**TL;DR Is she really interested in a relationship with Stefan?  Did sending the letter ruin any chance of mine or were there never any true feelings from her?  Should I ask her on a date now that we are on a break from school or wait till she goes to my college campus, which next year she will, to make another kind of move, or am I too late?**

np4s8,3,2011-12-24,Decided to not spend Christmas with my family. Need some advice.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/np4s8/decided_to_not_spend_christmas_with_my_family/,"I have a bunch of things I need to get off my chest and I would like to ask for advice from fellow redditors who have had similar experiences.  It involves my decision to not spend Christmas with my family this year.  I want to know if I made the right decision and what I should consider doing now.  

Last Christmas my dad had a stroke.  On Christmas Eve, I drove him to the hospital while my mom struggled to figure out what to do.  It was quite a scare but thankfully it wasn't as severe as it could have been.  We decided to wait until he got home to open our presents, so they sat under the tree unopened for three weeks while Dad went from one hospital to another and from there to physical therapy.  When the time came for him to come home I was doing some internship work further downstate.  A few days later when the internship ended I practically flew back to see him only to find my family had already opened their presents without me.  No one apologized or asked how I felt.  In fact no one really seemed to care.  Since then I’ve been on edge with them.  

When I was growing up my mom was hard on me.  She was always bossy and hard to deal with and spent a good part of my childhood and teenage years putting me down and trying to make me feel inferior.  Even though I’m an adult now living on my own she still tries to dominate my life and make my decisions for me.  She tends to try to bully me and my dad and has been abusive to him in the past.  My sister meanwhile has become very much like my mother.  She’s selfish and obsessed with being the center of attention.  She sees other people as means to her end; as long as they’re useful to her she’ll pretend to be nice to them but if she doesn’t need them then she doesn’t care, and over the years she seems to me to be completely without empathy for anyone but herself.  When talking to either of them it is impossible to make them see when they are in the wrong and both maintain a constant aura of moral superiority that makes it impossible to tell them anything.  My dad meanwhile is quiet and passive and tends to just do what my mother and sister tell him.

Over the course of the year my relationship with my family has worsened.  My sister brings up dad’s condition when it is convenient for her but doesn’t seem to really care how he’s doing.  All the while she lives in my parents’ house, outright refusing to pay rent even though she has a well-paying job.  Over the course of the year we have had several instances of her trying to put me down and when I tell her I’m not going to put up with her crap I just get cursed out.  Lately every time I come home to visit I have to get an earful from her, and while my parents see and hear this they never do anything about it.  I am an adult and can fight my own battles but it is hard to see that I get no support even from my family.  Things got worse when I brought my girlfriend over and my sister tried to have it out with her.  Needless to say we left.  

Since then things have gotten increasingly rocky.  My mother has taken to blaming my girlfriend for what happened.  As a result I have felt less of a need to go home.  When I’m away my parents never call and when I do visit my mom tries to make me feel guilty for not coming to visit more.  To make matters worse, she has taken to lobbing backhanded comments about my girlfriend (“I guess I’m not getting her a present for Christmas”, etc.)  

Lately I have felt like my family has been gradually pushing me away.  Whenever I do come over my mother has taken to lobbing backhanded comments about my girlfriend and complaining I'm never around anymore.  When my father's birthday came around my mom told me we weren't doing anything on the day so she had me come the following weekend.  I got there only to find his presents had already been opened (he had opened them the day of his birthday).  Just last week I called to learn they had already got a Christmas tree and decorated it without me, and I only found out because I happened to call my dad; it really seemed that had I not called I would have only found out when I got there for Christmas.

I decided I had finally had enough and I called my mother yesterday to tell her I wouldn't be coming home for Christmas, that I was tired of feeling like a stranger in my parents' home, and that I was sick of how they were treating me and my girlfriend.  My mom responded by offering excuses for not including me in those events and trying to guilt me into coming.  The real kicker was when she put my dad on the phone, who seemed indifferent about the whole matter.  A few minutes into talking to him he paused and I heard my mom say something to him and out of the blue he told me he was going into the hospital for tests in two days.  If I hadn't called I likely wouldn't have found out until I got there for Christmas.  I ended the conversation saying I would rather spend Christmas by myself.  

Immediately after I got off the phone my sister started phone spamming me and sent me a profanity-laden Facebook message basically ordering me to come home.  I responded by turning off my phone.  Neither her comments nor my mother’s seem to give me any indication that they cared about my feelings or understanding why it came to this.  They just told me that I’m making my mother sad and to come home right away.  

I ask for those who have had similar situations what kind of advice they could give me.  I don’t want to cut them out of my life but I feel like I’m reaching a point where they are never going to change and the only way to save my sanity is to get out of the situation.  I’m really not sure what I should do next, or if I should just back down for the sake of the holiday (damn watching Christmas specials).

Sorry about the long bulk of text but thank you for reading if you’ve reached this far.

np4m3,1,2011-12-24,Fantastic girl shows me the signals but then confuses the hell outta me.  Do I peruse a relationship or withdraw from the battle?,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/np4m3/fantastic_girl_shows_me_the_signals_but_then/,"Hey reddit, I’m in a situation I have never faced before and I was looking for some input.  It’s a lengthy piece but it gives more than enough food for thought.  Help is appreciated!

I'm 20 years old and over the past six months I have become very close friends with a girl named Lorie, who has recently turned 19. A little background on Laurie first:  she is a sci-fi fanatic with vast knowledge of Dr. Who, Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galatica, Merlin, Firefly, Stargate and so many more it’s unbelievable.  She loves to read any and everything from pure science fiction to Palahniuk to the classics including her favorite The Count of Monty Cristo.  She also plays video games, and by play I mean she actually plays them for enjoyment.   She claims to be bisexual and overall everyone sums her up as a guy in a girl’s body.

Our relationship started when I met her through a group of friends who all worked at the same theme park together.  When we first met I was dressed in a ridiculous pair of jean shorts and was very shy towards her.  Over the first few weeks after meeting her she began texting me through various friends’ phones at work teasing me on and asking for entertainment.  We would talk about science fiction, joke about the ridiculousness of my outfit when I met her, as well as playfully banter with each other.  I could always make her laugh too; she seemed to love it because she kept coming back for more saying she “loves the way you (I) text.”  She then got my number off of one of my friend’s phones and started texting me directly.

She lives about a half hour away and would always go to our friend Tyler’s house after work.  She has a bad home life so she would stay there for days on end sometimes, sleeping in the upstairs bunk bed.  I would be invited to come over and hang out, but it would always at least be her, Tyler, and me.  According to people from their work she and Tyler had gone on what Tyler had thought was a date but Lorie only considered it a trip to the movies with a friend.  Despite this, every time we would hang out at Tyler’s house, she would be touchy-feely with Tyler including hugging him, tickling him, and lying on top of him at times as well as saying the occasional “Tyler is my best friend” phrase.  Everyone from their work said they were the best of friends and only friends but it did not seem that way.

The most upsetting time I hung out with Lorie over the summer was at one of her co-workers parties.  I arrived late and was greeted by a drunken Laurie.  We played some pong together and then she left when her one friend said “he’s halfway there, go for it.”  She came to me eventually and looking for Tyler, claiming he is who she goes to when she is not having a good time at a party, and eventually went with him upstairs to the bathroom.  I found her then alone and crying in the bathroom.  I put her on a couch and went to sleep myself.  I found out the following day that she was hoping to have sex with one of her other co-workers but got rejected.  She later told me that she becomes an emotional mess when in a drunken stupor and had apologized to her attempted one night stand, clarifying that they were now solely just friends.

The pinnacle of our hangouts over the summer came when we went on a trip to New York.  It was a trip planned by Tyler and Laurie as an end of summer event.  Laurie invited me saying that Tyler was bringing his two Chinese friends.  She continued to say that Tyler always entered an “Asian Mode” where he never listened to anyone but his international love interests so she needed someone to talk to.  She would always text me days before the trip asking if I was excited and that the trip was a big deal.  Prior to leaving, Laurie was introduced to Tyler’s best friend from up the street who was also my mutual friend since junior high school, Stefan, very important later.

So it was set that Tyler, Laurie, the two international girls from Tyler and Laurie’s job , and me went to the big apple for the day.  It was a fantastic time to say the least.  Laurie and I got a lot of one on one time going through the Museum of Natural History, the MoMa, and central park.  We joked of Tyler’s “Asian mode” and then shared a bed in the hotel but nothing happened since Tyler and company were in the same room.

So summer ended and Tyler, Laurie, Stefan, and I all went back to school.  Stefan goes to school in California, Tyler in New York, and Laurie and I both in Ohio.  Laurie actually attends a branch campus of my college, the very branch campus I had spent two years previous at.

I thought that our texting would die down after school started, but it did not.  Laurie would always make attempts to ask me how the main campus was, how things were going in general for me, and where certain buildings were at her new branch campus, a lot of small talk.  Eventually, Laurie would send me messages saying she needed “help” with her calculus homework and that I should call her to help.  We fell into a groove where she would initiate these calls that ended up just being us talking about her our friends, her family life, school, good novels to read, and her dislike of guys who tried to hit on her at school, almost anything.  She began working at an internship two hours away as well where on her drive there she would call me to keep her company. 
 
She also revealed that unlike Tyler she and Stefan had been keeping in touch too.  She said she would Skype him at work for someone to talk to since his time difference had him up when she was at work.  She said hewas not really a texter and did not like to initiate conversations but she could still get a hold of him on the phone if I was not available.  She said she had been forwarding the best drunken messages of mine to him and that they both wanted to see me drunk.

When I would go home every so often, we would go hang out together.  One weekend she said I should come back to go out to eat with her, Tyler, and the group of friends she worked with over the summer.  I would not have been able to get back in time for the meal, but she suggested I come back anyways to hangout the next day.  We went alone together (Strokes fans rejoice) to see the Lion King in 3D and I tried to make a move by putting my arm around her but she did not have it.

However I could always wait another semester of college until she comes up to my campus and have other people out of the way.  What should I do?!

TL;DR Met an amazing girl who I thought had feelings for me and has definitely showed the signs till recently she has started flirting with a friend.  Is her new interest authentic or do I still have a chance at a relationship?

noxh8,32,2011-12-24,The struggles of forgiving a girlfriend who cheated.,toughtoughlife,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/noxh8/the_struggles_of_forgiving_a_girlfriend_who/,"We're both 22.  In the first 2 weeks of our relationship (before we were ""official"" we were still just hooking up occasionally) I ended up going out to a party and having sex with another girl i had met.  
I felt terrible about it, told the girl the next day, she forgave me about a week later and we have been dating ever since.  As we weren't even dating or remotely serious at this point, it wasn't really brought up again.
During the summer after all this happened, we became extremely close.  I love you's were said very early on, talks of marriage and future were brought up.  At the end of the summer I had to leave for three months to intern in Seattle and she stayed in DC.  We promised we'd stay faithful.  I have been cheated on in past relationships and begged her not to.  She promised she wouldn't.  At this point we had been dating for 10 months.
We talked and videochatted everyday while I was gone, it was difficult, but I was happily staying out of trouble and was completely in love with her.  


One saturday night I stayed in and she, unlike usual, didn't call me when she got out of work that day.  I figured she was tired and went to bed early.  It turns out she had gotten home from work, decided on a whim to go out with some neighbors, drank a shit ton, did coke, blacked out and ended up fucking her next door neighbor.  She apparently stopped him in the middle of it, woke up the next morning, puked on his floor and ran out crying.  She called me first thing balling her eyes out apologizing.  I was absolutely furious.   She ended up buying a 600 dollar plane ticket to Seattle the next weeked (losing her job in the process) so she could apologize to my face.  It worked for the most part.  I gave her an ultimatum, if she could stay sober for the rest of the time that I was gone and turn her life around, I would attempt to forgive her.  I've been given a lot of second chances in my life that I didn't deserve and know what it means to be self-destructive, I figured I'd try it out as I've never been one to forgive anyone.


Flashforward to now, the day before christmas eve.  Things have been going great, she bought me a wonderful watch when I returned to show me how greatful she was that I stood behind her and allowed her to clean up her life.  She is now sober, has a better job, and is working on her future.  She tells me everyday how devoted and thankful she is that I forgave her.


But still, even though I can feel great with her all day, I get so angry sometimes.  I feel furious, I over analyze every single detail of that night, ask her to explain things over and over again.  One doesn't obviously just ""get fucked"" by a dude, you talk to them, you go to their room, you kiss them, you take off your clothes, it's a lot.  And she still lives nextdoor to this guy (they haven't talked since and I told him that if he even so much as looks at her he'll get his head smashed in). 
 

I want to forgive her, I actually completely utterly want to move on, but I can't shake the feelings I get in my chest, it's like my stomach is turning over and I just can't get rid of it no matter what I do.  Most days since i've been back it has been wonderful.  If she goes out alone, at most she'll have one beer and even then she doesn't finish it.  If we go out together we attempt to ""party"" like we used to but neither of us feel really comfortable about it.   Honestly though, we get these wonderful moments where all is forgotten and we're just happy and overjoyed to be with one another.  
 

She's about to spend christmas with me and my family, I have been taking her in and attempting to give her the second chance I feel she rightfully deserves, but still, tonight I feel furious.  Tomorrow I'll feel fine, but I'm tired of getting this rage when I'm alone, or in the shower, or driving to work, it's taking it's toll on me.  And it isn't fair to her as well, if I'm going to say I forgive her I should be able to fucking forgive her.  I get so angry.  I obsess over getting revenge on this dude.  I just want to forgive her so badly, maybe more so to forget it and move on.  I know at this point the responsiblity falls on me to either make or break this relationship.


**tl:dr: girlfriend cheated on me one night, she told me immediately the next morning terribly upset.  Flew accross the country to aplogize, changed her life around, and has completely devoted herself to me.  I ""forgave her"" and love her everyday, but at night when alone, I think terrible angry thoughts and can't forget.** 

Any tips for moving on, forcing myself to get over it.. or is it hopeless?


**well happy christmas eve, blargh.  I'll keep this to myself until a few days after christmas, I almost want to show her this thread just so she can understand the struggles and the differing opinions.  I'm not going to give her the boot, I do really care about her.  I think I'm going to work on my own mental struggles, so I can address the root of the problem, and if the root of the problem is that she cheated or my incapability to forgive it (or forget it), so be it.**

I met him 7 months ago as I was getting ready to graduate college and as my 3 year relationship was falling to pieces. He was just hired where I was finishing up my internship. My original plan was to move with my fiance after graduation but when that was no longer an option I went full time from my internship. Over the past 7 months he has became my best friend. He helped me through my breakup, I helped him fight an illness which kept him away from work and laid up in bed many days and we have talked about everything and anything. I had told him a few times that I had feelings for him but it was all pretty much swept under the rug. A few weeks ago he met a girl. She's blonde, beautiful, pink motorcycle, and pierced nipples from what he told me.

Well, in short I couldn't handle it. I told him how much it hurt me to see him with her, but I would try to work through it. It turns out that I can't.... I let it all out tonight. I told him I loved him, that what we had is a rare thing and that I couldn't bare seeing him fall for another girl. I went in to kiss him and he dodged it. He told me he would but we work together and that would cause tension and big issues at work. 

I'm sorry if this doesn't seem very put together but I am distraught and typing this on my phone. I guess I am just looking on advice on how to get through this and handle it at work. Our offices are directly beside each other and there are only 12 people in the whole building. Should I try to still be friends? Should I try to pretend he doesn't exist? Should I move to Siberia? "
nqk63,10,2011-12-25,"After decades of depression and suicidal thoughts, I finally have a plan",abrokentoy,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nqk63/after_decades_of_depression_and_suicidal_thoughts/,"Some background; I apologize in advance for being graphic, profane, TMI and tl;dr:

First, some demographics. I’m a forty year old white male. I’m unemployed (and probably unemployable), living on just under $900 a month, disability for my back and psychological issues. I previously worked in offices and lower level acting and performing (corporate shows, character work, some plays and musicals). I have a (largely useless) two year IT degree from an online university. I’m divorced, no kids. I live in Chicago; I’m currently renting a room from a friend, but I can’t stay here long term. I also can’t afford to move anywhere, so I’m kind of trapped. I have thousands of dollars of student loan debt (that I’m trying to get forgiven via my disability), and I have horrible credit.


My above mentioned psychological issues: the official diagnosis for my disability is Bi-Polar II, with anger/rage issues, social anxiety, panic attacks, reactive attachment disorder, OCD, PTSD, and mild ADD. I also have addiction issues, primarily with sex, porn, internet usage, and video games. 


My physical/medical issues: I suffered a spinal injury back in 2003 when I fell on my coccyx; I have intermittent pain from pretty much any activity involving my core or sitting, and the nerves in my rectum are starting to fail, resulting in me shitting myself about once a week. This is made worse by my gallbladder being removed last year, and general bowel/gastrointestinal distress from anxiety. Sometimes I shart when I sneeze, which is just awesome. In addition, I’m obese (5’10”, 320 pounds), have thyroid issues that seem to be keeping my weight on, despite changes in diet and exercise, sleep apnea (I use a CPAP when I sleep), and insomnia.


In addition to the above, or maybe because of it; I’m a cynical misanthrope. I’ve described myself in the past as a polite asshole, someone who keeps his mouth shut until faced with such utter stupidity that I have to say something; I feel more and more surrounded by stupidity every day. 

I don’t leave the house unless I absolutely have to, and I have only a few people who love me enough that I can call them friends. I’ve driven away everyone else, both family and friends, with my anger, intolerance for what I perceive to be stupidity, and my general impatience with humans. I prefer the company of animals, but my cat died on Thanksgiving, and I can’t really afford a new pet. 


I remember having my first suicidal thought at age seven. I suffered from night terrors as a child, and never felt like I fit into any social situation, even my own family. My parents were divorced, and I lived with my father, who worked constantly, so I didn’t feel close to him. My mother was in the picture, but was majorly alcoholic, and wasn’t the best alternative; my PTSD actually stems from being sexually abused by my mother’s drunk friends between the ages of 8 and 15. 

My father does not believe I was sexually abused, probably because if he admitted to believing that, he’d have to face up to not being a very present father; he actually told my ex-wife that I was lying about that for attention. Seeing as I didn’t even identify it as abuse until I was in my mid-20s (I just thought that’s how you learned about sex), and I don’t really like to talk about it, I fail to see how I’m getting attention for it. That’s pretty par for the course for my father, unfortunately. 


I've been in some form of therapy since age five. I’ve been on every cocktail of depression and bi-polar meds available at one time or another.  I’ve been in and out of psychiatric facilities in recent years; I’ve been to the ER five times in the last seven years with suicidal ideations. Nothing seems to help for very long. The one thing I haven't tried is ECT; I was told a couple of years ago that I wasn't a good candidate. I'm going to try to see that doctor again soon, but I don't have much hope that he'll change his mind. 


I've never held a job longer than two years. My last job longer than a few months was driving a cab; I lasted five months. My physical problems, in combination with my psychological issues, make it hard for me to get, much less keep a job; as well, I don’t have good references, or a good work history. The bad credit doesn’t help, as some employers check that now. I don’t have any romantic/sexual relationships for many of the same reasons I can’t get/keep a job.


I've gotten to where I am today, I suppose, because I came to the realization that, with all my problems, it’s ***never*** actually going to get any better. I’ll be poor, in physical pain, and shitting myself the rest of my life; with the pain and shitting getting worse by the year. I'll probably end up in a wheelchair if my spinal injury continues to get worse; and it's inoperable because of its location. 


Like my title says, I have a plan. That worries me, because in the past, I’ve **thought** about suicide, a lot. But now I know exactly how I would do it. I even have backup plans. Scary.


One of the things that kept me from committing suicide in recent years is that my brother hung himself back in 2007. My first, very selfish thought when I heard about it was, “he beat me to it, he escaped”. My mom had died earlier that year, and he had a lot of financial and legal problems; but if I compare our situations, I’m actually worse off than he was. I try not to think about that.


I really, really don’t want to go back to a hospital. I’m on Medicare, so the best they do is watch you for a few days, but they don’t hold you if they don’t see you as an immediate threat to yourself or others; they just don't have the beds. You’re lucky to see the same doctor twice, and it’s usually a psych intern who just takes your history, again. The last time I committed myself, I think I told five different interns my life story. It seems like the only way to get real psychiatric help, if you don’t have money or good insurance, is to be criminally insane, which I’m not, as yet. Maybe I should dress up like the Joker and rob some banks.


I don’t know what my next move is. My plan requires money that I don’t currently have; but I’ll probably be getting some money back from the IRS from my cab driving work this year. I worry that when I do have the money, I’ll implement the plan. I can't stay where I am much longer. I've lived in three cities in the last year, and I have nowhere else to go. I am an expert bridge burner.


I would love to hear any thoughts or ideas about my situation. Thanks for reading."

I entered college with limited knowledge, only knowing how to navigate and use a computer well, but no technical skills. I'm currently an intern at a huge retirement community which I started about 7 months ago.

My concern is since I'm new in the IT field, is more school something I should pursue or does real-world experience teach you so much more the college ever can? 

I enjoy IT, but there is so much to know which sometimes is overwhelming. Thoughts? Advice? Personal experience?

npzbj,1,2011-12-25,The Night Before Hipstmas,[deleted],humor,https://www.reddit.com/r/humor/comments/npzbj/the_night_before_hipstmas/,"Hi Reddit, I wrote you a poem to celebrate for the season. Enjoy.

**The Night Before Hipstmas**

Twas the night before Hipstmas, and all through the apartment,

Not a creature was stirring, not even the dog we ironically named Jean-Paul Sartrement.

The homebrew was fermenting in the fireplace with care

to air out the rank smell emitting from there

The guitar was making some weird feedback

Since no one had bothered to pull out the jack. 

The housemates were scattered all over the Mission

While dreams of intercourse danced in their vision

And me with the Coors Light, and Max with the Jack

Had just settled ourselves for a drunken night’s snack

When out in the art room there arose such a clatter

I sprang from the den in time to see the splatter

The moon reflected off of the fresh-fallen vomit

splayed out on a vintage sweater in the shape of a comet.

Puking Max running round like a reprobate Elf

had drunkenly knocked down the IKEA shelf,

And what to my horrified eyes did appear

But an explosion of vinyl, and vomit, and beer. 
 
More rapid than eagles the records did fall,

from the IKEA shelves once affixed to the wall,

As I drew in my head, and was turning around,

I was smacked by a 7-inch as it fell to the ground,
 
“Not the vinyl!” moaned Maxwell still dribbling puke,

“Not the Ella! The Calloway! The Sinatra! The Duke!

Vintage, all vintage,” he screamed in despair, 

“Those LPs were expensive—and foreign—and rare!”
 
Yet while he was lamenting, I heard two sharp cries

Emanate from the chimney where the homebrew resides,

When, what to my critical eyes should appear

But an overweight hipster with an ironic beard!
 
He was dressed in a Snuggie (facetious, I think)

from behind his square glasses he gave me a wink

As I took out my earbuds and pulled out my phone

I just had to tweet “St Nick is here in my home!”
 
A bundle of presents he had flung on his back!

And he looked like a homeless man opening his sack,

His eyes–how they twinkled with feelings sardonic!

(And I think his tattoo of Frosty was ironic,)
 
The stump of a Parliament he held tight in his lips,

He sighed. “Wait. I’m not Santa. It’s just an internship.”

He rolled his red eyes and he took a big toke,

Then he blew in my face and said “mind if i smoke?”
 
Before I could reply with a witty wisecrack

St. Nick’s intern removed several gifts from the sack

Since my trust-fund was dwindling, I watched on quite eager,

But the size of the haul seemed especially meager.
 
Only six presents, nothing more, nothing less,

And the size of the packages didn’t impress.

“Is that it?” I asked him, trying not to sound brash,

“Is that all that we get from your magical stash?”
 
The intern sighed again and said, “Not to be snotty

But according to Facebook, you’ve been pretty naughty,

You’ve been sucking down whiskey, giving adults attitude,

Spending food stamps at that yuppie Whole Foods,

Shopping at vintage stores, running up your mom’s credit,

And spending your nights browsing porno on Reddit,

“I can see from your photostream you drink more than enough, 

And besides, you guys already have lots of stuff,

Come now, do you think that these presents are free?

Go out and do something with that English degree.”
 
His words hurt me more than I care now to share,

And I pushed away the iPad and sat down on my chair,

Yet when St. Nick’s intern saw the tears in my eyes,

His jaded young heart must have increased in size,
 
“Come on, I was joking. I have one more gift.” 

Then he stuck his hand in and gave his bag a sift,

And when his hand emerged, it held an LP

With Japanese lettering I couldn’t quite see,
 
“What is it?” I muttered, examining the condition,

“It’s rare,” said the intern, “a foreign edition, 

by a band that’s so good no one knows who they are

but they sound like the Kinks kinda mixed with The Cars,
 
Then mixed with Arcade Fire. It’s hard to explain,” 

He thought for a second while scratching his brain

“Anyway, never mind. Just take my advice,

On eBay, this fetches a pretty good price.”
 
And before I could take a picture for my blog,

The grizzled young intern scurried off like a dog,

He sprang towards the fireplace like a stout little pixie

And rode back up the chimney on his magical fixie. 
 
And I swear that I heard, as his fixie took flight,

“Merry Hipstmas to all. And to all a good night.”"
npsxn,7,2011-12-24,Do people ever grow past 'attachment issues'?,attachment_issue,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/npsxn/do_people_ever_grow_past_attachment_issues/,"So I'm a 21 year old male, and my girlfriend is also 21. We are in similar programs at school and share many of the same classes. I am on an internship for the year (started last May, ends next September), and she is continuing classes. If it matters, I am a North American Caucasian, and she is Chinese (moved here ~10 years ago; her mother comes from a militant background).

So we got into this relationship around November 2010, and things went relatively okay until May 2011 when I started my internship. She got a 4 month internship (May 2011 through August 2011) at a city about an hour drive away from where I got mine.

We would visit each other every week (I would go there, or she would come to where I am). Things went pretty okay until around August when she said that we wouldn't be able to see each other for a while because she wanted to spend the month hanging out with her friends from high school, who happened to be in the same city she was in. I obviously got upset with this, seeing as she was basically saying we wouldn't be seeing each other for 4 or 5 weeks. Things eventually blew over though, and I got to see her a couple times during that period.

During this time, she progressively became harder and harder to get a hold of. I would message her a couple times a day online, but would only get a response maybe 1 out of every 10 times. I got upset, but then accepted it assuming she was probably just very enthralled with whatever work she was doing.

September came around, and it just became worse. It annoyed me because the classes she was saying she was very busy with were classes I had taken the year before - I knew they had a lot of work, but certainly not enough such that I wouldn't be able to at least say 'hi' once in a while. Most of the time when she would initiate contact with me through this period, it was to ask me for help with something, and once she got it, she would disappear - often mid conversation.

The odd thing though was that when I would visit her on weekends, she was fully attentive to me and we could talk and have fun - just as if nothing were wrong. She attributes this to that when she's not looking at me (or not being with me rather) I'm just completely out of her mind and not a concern. She doesn't 'remember' me (if you want to call it that) unless I'm with her. She says she doesn't find talking online fun anymore, and would rather play video games by herself. She finds it a chore to 'have to talk to me' every once in a while because of how boring talking online is. It's odd to me because I've never considered online chat to be something 'fun to do' and rather a communication medium for talking to other people. I don't know if I'm the odd one out on thinking the person on the other end is what makes it entertaining - not the way you do it.

At one point during a visit to her, she said she had really bad stomach pain, and I told her to go to the university doctor as soon as possible. That was on a Sunday and she had scheduled her appointment on a Monday. I wasn't able to get a hold of her at all until the Thursday of that week to ask her how it went - obviously pissed off that she took so long to contact. She got mad saying that she has a really busy schedule and if I want to talk to her, I should do it through email so that she could respond to me at her leisure. This worked well for a while, and I was able to get decently long and thoughtful responses from her.

Right now I'm on vacation, and told her I would email her every so often to just check what's up and tell her what I'm doing. The past few emails I've sent her, probably about the length of half of this post have either gotten no response or a one word response to some question I asked her within the email (i.e. ""So how are you doing?"" - ""Good""). I had a feeling she just basically glanced over what I wrote and looked for anything ending in a question mark. So I asked her if she was disinterested in what I had to say (making it obvious I didn't like her lack of response) and if she would prefer we just speak in the new year. She said ""Ya, lets just talk in the new year then"" and that was it.

Obviously that didn't go well with me, but I didn't respond to her... just left myself time to think.

-----

Aside from that, she just got a 16-month internship herself starting in May. I tried to coax her into not applying to it (she only did because it was the first posting she saw), because that would mean we would now graduate at different times (I'm in a 4 year program, she's in a 5) - and because there would be plenty of 4-month postings later at the same company. The plan was originally that we would live together our final year, but she suddenly decided against it (before she got her job offer) saying she wanted to live with some friends by herself. I've never met these friends, but she's gone to multiple parties with them and told me not to come since it would be ""awkward"" (these are friends she met through her previous boyfriend - they don't know I exist). She says they're all single, and it would be weird if I lived there too because it would make her the odd one out as the non-single one (she wants to keep up a sherade that she's single too). After that point we would then 'meet' and it would look like we started dating after she moved in with them. Seems absolutely stupid to me.

She also started making comments here and there about how she doesn't see us lasting after graduation since we'll probably have to go our separate ways. I got all depressed over it and she said it was just her 'being realistic'. She then later said she said that because she has a problem with 'pushing people away after she gets close to them' like she did with previous boyfriends - an attachment issue. She now claims we're going to be 'together forever', but I know she's just saying that in a weak attempt to make me feel better.

. . .

So this being my first relationship, I don't know what to make of all of this. I feel like this is all related to the 'attachment problem' she goes on about - where she severs connections upon people she's close to not physically being in the same place as her anymore. She can even go a couple months at a time without talking to her parents, who are only a couple hours away.

I really don't know whether to attribute all of this to her being a jerk or her having some kind of behavioural problem that may or may not be correctable - I can't see any advantage of not being able to form persistent attachments so I'm just assuming it's a problem. It may not be a problem with her at all, and may be an issue of me being too needy - I don't really know what the '0' of the relationship normality plain is. I just know it's making me feel pretty bad.

What do you all make of this? Any advice?

nqua4,1,2011-12-25,What do I do? Am I a bad person?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nqua4/what_do_i_do_am_i_a_bad_person/,"I'm a 21 year old college dude with 1.5 years to go and the girl I am currently after is same age and has either 1 year or 1.5 years left in school. However she Lives 2,500 Miles away (essentially Im on the West Coast and She is on the east) The real kicker here though is she has a boyfriend, of 4 years..... 

So that's the demographics on us and here is the other background information. So I have been going to the same summer camp for the past 16 years and 2 years ago same old same old checking in but then all of a sudden me and this girl (M) saw each other for the first time and we both had the whole dear in headlights, omg, love at first sight connection thing. We both talked a bit and things were great. She asked me questions like ""do I ever get breaks"", etc. (I was a volunteer counselor and she was staff at the camp) So I switched my schedule around and we hung out that monday, flirting and making out ensued that's it. But then I am going until that Thursday night and she switched her schedule around and we ended up hanging out that night. I was like what the hell once in a lifetime thing at camp, never going to happen again so we ended up having sex, cuddling after all that. I got her number we talked for about a month after and then it all stopped and we got on with our ways, I thought that was that.

She cam back to camp again the next year, started texting me all day every day for a month before I got there. Started having serious feelings for each other needless to say camp happens, we hang out and flirt one night and then two of the other nights we have sex and the last night we just laid together cuddling and actually fell asleep with each other under the stars (best night i have had with a interested partner) Afterwards we end up talking all day every day for 3 months we actually start to get to know each other while I also get as much information as possible on her current relationship and the boyfriend and of course im going to be somewhat biased but I find out he, makes fun of her body (her parents drove her to anorexia as a child), physically doesnt hug her, kiss her rarely anything. Her mother had cancerous surgery with big complications and he didnt eve ask her how she or her mom was doing until the day after, She drove to see his brother and his partner for HER birthday and he didnt pay for any of the gas, hotel room, etc. Didn't get her any kind of gift OR even tell her Happy Birthday on her birthday (they drove together for 9 hours sitting 1 ft from each other, how hard is that?) she asked whats up and he said ""its not always gunna be rainbows and butterflies, and kisses and I love yous"" every relationship has a honeymoon phase but you dont say things like that. However, this is the best guy she has ever dated :( shes been thrown down the stairs, cheated on, etc. anything you can think of by past Boyfriends.

I start getting really attached and start trying to help her gain self confidence and try to explain to her that her relationship isnt healthy but eventually become attacking and mean so I told her I need a break so we dont talk for 2 months then she texts me again and we start up talking all over and thats where we currently are. I'm trying to rebuild what I destroyed and show her I really care about her and want her to be happy and even if it doesnt mean me she deserves better than this asshole. So I am going out there for Spring break and even if I don't see her then I will for sure see her at camp again this year. The BF might do an internship in Colorado after camp so they would be seperated for 6 months. Her and I both are planning on moving there after school so I have no idea if I should continue to try to pursue something for that long. Should I tell her good luck and be on our ways. Should I be a good friend and be there for support and try to show her she deserves more? 

I just have no idea what I should do. I Care about this girl and we click more than I ever have with anybody I have been interested in or who has been interested with me. I want to be supportive and show her there are good guys who arent douchebags (in doing this I am really hurting myself seeing them together, knowing their together, etc.) as well as enabling her to cheat on her bf etc. or do I just try and give up and move on and just see where things are at camp or when were both done with school and in Colorado? Sorry for such a lengthy post but I would really appreciate any advice.

Thank you friends :)

ns0cf,2,2011-12-27,College student having trouble losing weight,violabeatle,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ns0cf/college_student_having_trouble_losing_weight/,"For as long as I can remember, my mother has been putting the pressure on me to lose some weight, even as far back as middle school. Until I began work at a major fast food chain my senior year of high school, I was around 165-170 lbs, which is on the high end of ""average"" weight for a girl of my body type and height. I was pretty much allowed to take home whatever food (mostly junk food) I wanted throughout my time at the job, which lasted about 8 months. I gained about 15 lbs. 

I left my job to go to college about 6 hours from home. I gained the dreaded freshman 30. When I returned home for the summer, my doctor recommended I see a nutritionist. The nutritionist laid out a diet plan, and to this day I've tried my hardest to follow it. It's a plan that seems easy and makes sense. For who knows what reason, I'm finding it extraordinarily difficult to follow. I try to keep healthy foods in my apartment (fruits and veggies of course) and portion my unhealthy foods. However, I continue to buy unhealthy foods, and when looking for a snack, I go for those, even though I know I shouldn't. As a result, healthy snacks go bad in my fridge. 

This past semester I made it a goal of mine to work out at least 2-3 times a week. I succeeded for the most part, until mid-November came along. That was about the time of the semester when I had very little free time between the constant stream of tests and projects, my current job, finding a spring internship, and extracurriculars. I felt like I had no time in the day to do my own thing, much less hit the gym. On top of all of that, I was stress eating which as you all know helps nothing. 

I guess my issue is motivation. What motivated all of you guys? From what I've seen, this is a strong community and maybe some support is all I need to get started. I would love to get down to my original weight, and if possible my ultimate goal is to be about 150 lbs.

nrqfz,1,2011-12-26,"How to cope with loneliness, living without my spouse?",couldusesupport,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/nrqfz/how_to_cope_with_loneliness_living_without_my/,"I'm lonely and I have nobody to talk to.  None of my ""friends"" really care too much, and nobody is around right now anyway.  Nobody wants to talk to me, and my family isn't too supportive. So here's what I would like to share with anyone who is kind enough to listen.

My freshman year in college, there was a girl who I passed quite a bit in the engineering building.  She was tall, a bit nerdy looking, but very fashionable and just gorgeous.  I figured she was completely out of my league, so I didn't even think about making a move.  Fast forward a few months later, she popped up on my ""People You May Know"" on Facebook.  I reluctantly added her, thinking whatever.

She didn't accept my friend request for a couple months actually.  When she finally did, I tried to be bold and I messaged her.  I introduced myself, told her that I had seen at quite a bit of times outside of class, and I also told her that I thought she was really interesting and I'd like to get to know her.  We spoke on and off for a few weeks.  I finally grew the nuts to ask her out on a date.  She accepted.  I thought she was the most amazing person I'd ever met.  She was smart, sophisticated, beautiful, great sense of humor, etc. etc.  However, the date ended and we did not kiss.  I felt it was not going anywhere, but I continued pursuing her.  One week later we had our second date, and this time we kissed for hours afterwards.

We hit it off.  She was older than me.  It was the second semester of my sophomore year, and she was a senior.  She was graduating.  Now here's something I left out...  She was a foreign student on a government ""scholarship"".  She had to leave.  She couldn't stay after graduation.  Her student visa would expire just a month after graduation.  I hardly had any money.  On top of that, I come from a conservative Muslim background.  They refuse to accept this.  But whatever, I was so much in love with her that we kept it going.

After she left, I was completely heart broken.  For the first time in my life, I knew what depression was.  It really hurts.  It hurts like a fucking bitch.  There was nothing I could do though.  She had to leave.  I had massive depression.  I'm a 4.0 student who only cared about his school work, getting workouts at the gym, and watching his favorite TV show every week.  She changed me in a way.  Suddenly, I couldn't live without this woman who I had lived the majority of my life without.

Anyway, because of her student visa and U.S. law, anyone that comes to this country and is sponsored by a foreign government must go home and live for two years.  This two year home residency requirement can't be lifted.  There's nothing I can do, even though I'm a U.S. citizen.

Anyway, regardless of the situation, I dealt with it.  We talked everyday via Skype.  The person I was with every hour - I could now only be with her on a video stream, for just an hour in the morning and an hour at night (12 hour time difference).  We loved each other though, so we made this loooong distance work.  That summer, I interned at a company to build my resume and get my mind off this.  I still couldn't deal with it.  The day my internship ended in August, I had money now to buy a $2500 plane ticket to go see her in her country.  I went.  My parents tried to do everything to stop me.  They even tried to hide my passport.  I wouldn't let them.  I went anyway.  For two weeks, it was like a dream.  I finally got to touch her and see her again.  We both cried when we saw each other at the airport.  But eventually, I had to leave after the two weeks.  Classes had started, and I had to return to school.  I'm on a scholarship, so no room to mess up and destroy it.

Anyway, so my junior year started.  Everyday we talked on Skype.  Every morning, every night.  Then junior year ended.  I was used to being without her by this point.  It was okay more or less.  I still loved her, and she was so important to me.  But anyway, summer after junior year (last summer) my father passed away.  I began to panic.  I have an older sister that was to start med school in August and a younger 13 year old sister.  With my family being conservative Muslim, my mom had never worked a day in her life.  Regardless, my internship last year paid very handsomely.  The hard work began paying off.  I earned in one paycheck the amount I earned over the entire internship over the past year.  Money was not a huge problem, despite needing to help the family.  I figured a way to deal with dad passing.  And now, I asked her to go apply for a visitor visa to come visit me.

She applied, and to our joy they gave her the visa.  We were both so excited.  And so she came.  This is where my current situation arises.  She only stayed for 5 months.  I took 18 hours this semester while she was here and worked 20 hours a week to support us.  It's my senior year.  I even pulled through all A's.

A few hours ago, I dropped her off at the airport.  We both cried like little children.  We didn't want to let go.  Not again. God not this stupid crap again.  Why can't we be together?  We haven't committed a crime.  She's educated.  She has an engineering degree, one of the highest paid in the U.S.  She wouldn't be a burden on the tax payer.  Why do these fucking laws exist?  Why does it have to be this way?  I know we can't change this, but how do I cope with this?  The woman I care about so much is not with me.  We've lived together the past 5 months.  I'm so used to being with her all the time.  We even married.  Last month, we went to the county court and made it a done deal.

What can I do?  How do I cope with this?  This depression hurts.  Depression, anxiety, I don't even know wtf to call it.  I feel broken.  Physically and mentally.  I can't even sit on my bed or look around without thinking of her, seeing her face.  Is anyone else going through this?  What do you do?  My family isn't supportive at all.
I love this woman so much I'd give up everything I own for her.  My grades, the degree, everything feels so fucking useless about now.  I feel pathetic."

My academics are sufficient for most schools as I am a national-merit scholar with a 4.0 unweighted GPA.  I feel I am a competent programmer and have spent time reading college lectures online and familiarizing myself with the computer science field.  These were the colleges my mom made me apply to and I procrastination and put in very little effort into the applications.  I realize now, right before other applications are due, why that was incredibly stupid of me.  I do not need that part reiterated to me.  **What I would like is your opinion on what the ramifications of going to each of the three following colleges would be and what other schools I should apply for before the week is done.**



Where I have currently applied:

University of Central Florida - They are a lesser school but they are close to home and want to pay for most of my education and put me on a track for a masters in 5 years after which I would asses further options.  Talking to friends there is discouraging though as the only class they say is hard freshmen year I can exempt due to an AP course.

MIT - I was deferred from the early application but i did not put my full effort into the application.  If I can edit the application before the regular decision I should get in.  I think the prestige of MIT stands alone.

Georgia Institute of Technology - They accepted my early application though affording tuition there will be tough.  They are ranked very high though I know little of the school besides their high prices.

nto21,1,2011-12-28,"IAMA guy who fell into a barrel cactus 6 years ago. Hilarity ensued, including hospitalization, orthopedic surgery, as well as some at-home surgery courtesy of my wife. AMA.",[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/nto21/iama_guy_who_fell_into_a_barrel_cactus_6_years/,"About 6 years ago, I had dropped off my car at a local dealership to have the brakes worked on. I had arranged for a co-worker to pick me up that afternoon, who was unfamiliar with exactly where to go to get into the place.. So, I waved her down, and like a complete doofus, jogged over to the street where she had pulled over. In the process, I tripped over a retaining chain between two cars, and fell arms-first into a large barrel cactus like the one in this photo:

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Echinocactus_grusonii_-_golden_barrel_cactus_-_status-endangered.jpg

Havign fallen on it, I rolled off it to one side. Amazingly, I didn't feel it at first. Maybe it was the shock of it, or the little adrenaline boost that came from jogging over to the car, but I didn't feel a thing at first. I just stood up and noticed I had maybe 30 or 40 spines in my arms, each about the diameter of a toothpick, curved, and about 2"" long. Not really knowing the full extent of my injury, I hopped in the car, and we went back to work.

On the way, I started bleeding out my arms.. It didn't look too good, bleeding all over the place, and my coworker suggested I go to the ER. (I work at a hospital, thankfully, so, it was within walking distance..) ...So, i'm walking over there, dripping blood all over the place, and the pain starts to set in. It hurts to let my arms hang at my sides while I walk, so I start walking with my forearms stretched out in front of me looking like I'm carrying an invisible package. I get into the main building, and start looking for direction signs that will get me to the ER. That was fun, in and of itself, walking by people inside the hospital with my arms out like Frankenstein having to explain to them, ""It's okay, I just fell into a cactus.."" and having them not freak out at all the blood.

Anyway, I get to the ER, and get triaged.. I get in pretty quick, and the doctors have a look at me. The doctor was new to the area (this is Tucson we're talking) and hadn't quite dealt with a cactus injury before. In conversation, I found out he had just come in from Baltimore, and was more used to gunshots than cactus needles. He conferred with some other doctors about giving me a CAT scan, but it was decided that the spines probably wouldn't show up. He settled on giving me an ultrasound instead.... which proved to be equally pointless.

By this point, i'm in some pretty significant pain. Maybe 7 out of 10. I can't move a couple fingers in my left hand for some reason. So, they put me on an exam table, and wheel in an ultrasound unit, and start lubing up my arm in preparation for the scanning wand. I didn't think much of it.

The instant they pressed the wand into my flesh, it felt like my whole goddamn arm was being sawed off. As I explained in a different post preceeding this AMA, it felt like my arm was being put through a deli meat slicer, and with every pass of the wand, the slices were being flipped through like a deck of cards..I howled in absolute fucking agony, each pass of the wand basically driving the needles further into my arm, one by one as the tech moved the wand up and down my arm. The pain was so incredible that it triggered that weird sort of ""animal"" response, where I felt compelled to attack the thing causing it. I tried very, very hard to resist the urge to do so, and blacked out, waking up a few seconds later on my side, crying. They called off the ultrasound at that point.

A few minutes later, an intern shows up with a rather large pair of tweezers, and starts examining my arms for puncture marks. They manage to locate quite a few, and pull each one of them out, like toothpicks out of a ham. The spines themselves were are similar in shape and size to the tines on a dinner fork. They were flexible, but stiff, sort of like thick plastic. In a way, it was good that they were so large. The smaller cactus needles are hard as hell to find and remove. Tweezer guy removed about 20 of them.

They strip me down and find a couple more embedded in my butt. My wallet still has the marks from where a needle or two poked through my jeans and dug into the leather (thank you, wallet!) ...After taking care of those, it was time to look at why my middle and ring fingers weren't working. A doctor comes in, and asks me to try and move them... then suddenly, POP, oooooooooooh fuck. ... Turns out I had a spine lodged directly into one of the tendons just below my wrist, and in retracting that tendon, it basically flipped the needle like one flips a light switch on a wall. Unbelievable pain.

An hour or two (and LOTS of pain meds later), i'm informed that the local orthopedic surgeon had just left on vacation. There was another one available, but it would be two weeks before I could see him. They bandaged up my arm to keep it immobilized, and sent me on my way.

Two weeks later, I see the ortho. Turns out the surgery involves full-body anesthesia! Apparently, the nerves in the arms and fingers are not to be fucked with, and the risk of damaging something on a local anesthetic is too high.. So they just knock you out completely. I wake up in the recovery room reciting numbers and telling the nurses how beautiful they are.

The surgeon said it took quite a while to locate it, so, the resulting scar was much bigger than he had wanted. All stitched up, I headed home.

I'm a Unix admin by trade. A computer geek. My hands are my livelyhood, so I kept the bandaged area absolutely air-tight and soaked in neosporin for the whole time it took to heal. For those of you who dont know, keyboards and desks are fucking playgrounds for bacteria. Worse, I work at a hospital, and not 6 months ago there was a case where someone in my department had contracted MRSA, presumably from their keyboard. He was a cubicle worker, like me.

Keeping the area bathed in neosporin meant it took quite a while for the scar to heal up. And it looks fairly nasty. It's like a little flabby bag that hands off the lower part of my forearm. (I'll include a picture here shortly, for amusement).

Full view of my forearm: http://i.imgur.com/jR0FA.jpg

Close up of scar: http://i.imgur.com/cobux.jpg

Flabby bag of scar tissue: http://i.imgur.com/rObdS.jpg

Over the years, some of the remaining spines still lodged in my arms have worked their way out. I can still feel at least 3 of them in my shoulders. My wife removed one, bless her heart, using some good ol' fashioned 19th century home surgery. A razor blade sterilized by candle, a bowl of ice cubes to keep the area numb, and a pair of tweezers to extract the needle itself. I have a small scar on the back of my right arm from the procedure about the diameter of a nickel. I'm happy to talk about how that whole procedure went as well.

Well, thats my story. AMA.

I spent a pretty penny on it earlier in the year, with the specific goal of being able to carry it back and forth to school, work, and my internship.

With the further goal of minimizing what I carry daily as much as I can, I'd like to find a device that would allow me to carry my notes and textbooks digitally while being powerful enough for routine media and web browsing.

I've been looking at the Transformer Prime with a dock, as that seems to basically be what I'm looking for. Nevertheless, with the recent crop of ultrabooks that have come onto the market, I now have a harebrained scheme in the back of my head to pick one up too. I guess I could dock my X220 and use it as a home machine while carrying around a Lenovo U300s, for example.

Now, the idea sort of sounds good in my head, but I also know that it's more than likely a ridiculous waste of money, especially since I could pick up a tablet for approximately half of what an ultrabook costs. I guess I'm looking for some sort of affirmation that I'm either a complete idiot or if this could be a decent idea."
nteem,1,2011-12-28,"IAMA guy who tripped and fell onto a barrel cactus about 6 years ago. Even with surgery (including the home variety), I still have cactus spines embedded in my arms to this day. AMA!",[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/nteem/iama_guy_who_tripped_and_fell_onto_a_barrel/,"About 6 years ago, I had dropped off my car at a local dealership to have the brakes worked on. I had arranged for a co-worker to pick me up that afternoon, who was unfamiliar with exactly where to go to get into the place.. So, I waved her down, and like a complete doofus, jogged over to the street where she had pulled over. In the process, I tripped over a retaining chain between two cars, and fell arms-first into a large barrel cactus like the one in this photo:

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Echinocactus_grusonii_-_golden_barrel_cactus_-_status-endangered.jpg

Havign fallen on it, I rolled off it to one side. Amazingly, I didn't feel it at first. Maybe it was the shock of it, or the little adrenaline boost that came from jogging over to the car, but I didn't feel a thing at first. I just stood up and noticed I had maybe 30 or 40 spines in my arms, each about the diameter of a toothpick. Not really knowing the full extent of my injury, I hopped in the car, and we went back to work.

On the way, I started bleeding out my arms.. It didn't look too good, bleeding all over the place, and my coworker suggested I go to the ER. (I work at a hospital, thankfully, so, it was within walking distance..) ...So, i'm walking over there, dripping blood all over the place, and the pain starts to set in. It hurts to let my arms hang at my sides while I walk, so I start walking with my forearms stretched out in front of me looking like I'm carrying an invisible package. I get into the main building, and start looking for direction signs that will get me to the ER. That was fun, in and of itself, walking by people inside the hospital with my arms out like Frankenstein having to explain to them, ""It's okay, I just fell into a cactus.."" and having them not freak out at all the blood.

Anyway, I get to the ER, and get triaged.. I get in pretty quick, and the doctors have a look at me. The doctor was new to the area (this is Tucson we're talking) and hadn't quite dealt with a cactus injury before. In conversation, I found out he had just come in from Baltimore, and was more used to gunshots than cactus needles. He conferred with some other doctors about giving me a CAT scan, but it was decided that the spines probably wouldn't show up. He settled on giving me an ultrasound instead.... which proved to be equally pointless.

By this point, i'm in some pretty significant pain. Maybe 7 out of 10. I can't move a couple fingers in my left hand for some reason. So, they put me on an exam table, and wheel in an ultrasound unit, and start lubing up my arm in preparation for the scanning wand. I didn't think much of it.

The instant they pressed the wand into my flesh, it felt like my whole goddamn arm was being sawed off. As I explained in a different post preceeding this AMA, it felt like my arm was being put through a deli meat slicer, and with every pass of the wand, the slices were being flipped through like a deck of cards..I howled in absolute fucking agony, each pass of the wand basically driving the needles further into my arm, one by one as the tech moved the wand up and down my arm. The pain was so incredible that it triggered that weird sort of ""animal"" response, where I felt compelled to attack the thing causing it. I tried very, very hard to resist the urge to do so, and blacked out, waking up a few seconds later on my side, crying. They called off the ultrasound at that point.

A few minutes later, an intern shows up with a rather large pair of tweezers, and starts examining my arms for puncture marks. They manage to locate quite a few, and pull each one of them out. The spines themselves were about 1-2"" long, very similar in shape and size to the tines on a dinner fork. They were flexible, but stiff, sort of like thick plastic. In a way, it was good that they were so large. The smaller cactus needles are hard as hell to find and remove.

They strip me down and find a couple more embedded in my butt. My wallet still has the marks from where a needle or two poked through my jeans and dug into the leather (thank you, wallet!) ...After taking care of those, it was time to look at why my middle and ring fingers weren't working. A doctor comes in, and asks me to try and move them... then suddenly, POP, oooooooooooh fuck. ... Turns out I had a spine lodged directly into one of the tendons just below my wrist, and in retracting that tendon, it basically flipped the needle like one flips a light switch on a wall. Unbelievable pain.  

An hour or two (and LOTS of pain meds later), i'm informed that the local orthopedic surgeon had just left on vacation. There was another one available, but it would be two weeks before I could see him. They bandaged up my arm to keep it immobilized, and sent me on my way.

Two weeks later, I see the ortho. Turns out the surgery involves full-body anesthesia! Apparently, the nerves in the arms and fingers are not to be fucked with, and the risk of damaging something on a local anesthetic is too high.. So they just knock you out completely. I wake up in the recovery room reciting numbers and telling the nurses how beautiful they are.

The surgeon said it took quite a while to locate it, so, the resulting scar was much bigger than he had wanted. All stitched up, I headed home.

I'm a Unix admin by trade. A computer geek. My hands are my livelyhood, so I kept the bandaged area absolutely air-tight and soaked in neosporin for the whole time it took to heal. For those of you who dont know, keyboards and desks are fucking playgrounds for bacteria. Worse, I work at a hospital, and not 6 months ago there was a case where someone in my department had contracted MRSA, presumably from their keyboard. He was a cubicle worker, like me.

Keeping the area bathed in neosporin meant it took quite a while for the scar to heal up. And it looks fairly nasty. It's like a little flabby bag that hands off the lower part of my forearm. (I'll include a picture here shortly, for amusement).

Full view of my forearm: http://i.imgur.com/jR0FA.jpg

Close up of scar: http://i.imgur.com/cobux.jpg

Flabby bag of scar tissue: http://i.imgur.com/rObdS.jpg

Over the years, some of the remaining spines still lodged in my arms have worked their way out. I can still feel at least 3 of them in my shoulders. My wife removed one, bless her heart, using some good ol' fashioned 19th century home surgery. A razor blade sterilized by candle, a bowl of ice cubes to keep the area numb, and a pair of tweezers to extract the needle itself. I have a small scar on the back of my right arm from the procedure about the diameter of a nickel. I'm happy to talk about how that whole procedure went as well.



Well, thats my story. AMA.

ntdba,0,2011-12-28,Got a PM (Program Manager) internship!  Now what?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ntdba/got_a_pm_program_manager_internship_now_what/,"Next summer I will be interning as a PM at Microsoft.  I'm very excited about this, but I also have a couple of doubts:

* **What will a typical workday be like for me? ** 

I asked a couple of interviewers about this, and their responses were very varied; some of them definitely did their share of coding, while others did none; the job description also says that PMs consult with clients, meet with devs and testers, etc.  I just want a better idea of what being a PM is like from current or former Microsoft employees, or PMs from other companies... which brings me to my second question:


* **What is the future outlook for a PM?**

I believe this is the kind of job I'll want to stick with once I graduate; I'm really happy with both the company and the job description, (and hopefully I won't have to find out the answer to this question on my own) but how will this experience translate across to other companies?  A friend told me that other companies do have PMs, but they just don't recruit interns because they want people who already have experience.  How much truth is there to that statement?  Does it apply to both big and small companies?  Are there other similar jobs?

As far as my background is concerned, I will be graduating within a year with a BS in Computer Science from a fantastic school.  I have had a previous internship as a software engineer, although my project was very heavy on the UI design element.  My ideal job would involve my CS knowledge without being confined to a cubicle and writing code all day; my main interests are HCI, UX, UI design.


Thanks!"

nt1lw,1,2011-12-27,How do I tell her I don't want to be with her anymore/am I just an asshole?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/nt1lw/how_do_i_tell_her_i_dont_want_to_be_with_her/,"Hey guys so I need a little help. I've been dating this girl for 4 months now (we've known each other for 8 months) and to be honest it’s not working for me anymore, for a few reasons.


 Firstly, she’s getting increasingly needy for attention to the point where she gets mad at me quite often for not showing her enough attention. Now I am perfectly fine with showing attention to someone I care about but the amount she wants gets in the way of my work and studies (we’re both in college) and she makes me feel bad whenever I tell her that I have to do stuff. She’ll pull the sad card or the angry card and I’ll end up feeling like an asshole for trying to get my shit done. I am juggling a research position, a distance job from Chicago, School, and a fraternity (which she has already started voicing displeasure about despite supporting me before). She basically had me tutor her all through last semester at the expense of my own studies and If I didn’t have time again made me feel bad about it. I’m currently on break and working 2 jobs and commuting to cover tuition next semester and every day she’s gotten mad at me for not talking to her for hours when I barely have ten minutes to myself between the jobs and travelling and the maybe 4 hours of sleep I get a night. She expects me to write her “morning messages” which are supposed to be these long messages talking about how much I love her and sweet stuff like that because I did that once or twice but now I’m getting up at 6 to go to work and I don’t have time to write that stuff before I leave.  I just feel that it’s kind of ridiculous that she doesn’t understand when I tell her these things. I’ll digress on this subject because I could go on for a while.


Secondly, she expects me to deal with a bunch of her issues like her ridiculous test anxiety/general stress. Again normally I would love to and wouldn’t think twice except for the sheer scope of the situation. She’ll get so upset before an exam or if something goes wrong with school or her work that she’ll basically get hysterical and kind of mean really and I just feel like I can’t deal with that anymore. I have so much on my plate already that I just can’t add hours of consoling just for a simple test. And it really is hours. She has these ridiculous expectations of me that I can’t keep as a college student like taking her out all the time (she insisted it didn’t have to cost money but just take her out somewhere like a park) or cook her dinner all the time and I just don’t have the time! And then she gets mad at me and says I don’t make her feel special and that she does so much for me (AKA brought me food a few times when I was studying) and then she’ll burst into tears. 


She demanded that I stay at her place every night last semester and basically had me move in to her student apartment room, so I had two shelves to put my clothes and shit on and had to take trips back to my apartment to get books and stuff for class and had nowhere to work and if I EVER mentioned sleeping at my apartment she would get mad and sad and all that and talk about how she didn’t want to sleep alone. One time I made the mistake of going out partying and crashing at a friend’s apartment ( I may not have answered my phone all night due to intoxication) and she told me not to come home and was pissed at me all day the next day until I had to apologize to make my life easier.


Now here’s where it gets complicated. These feelings are completely and utterly one-sided. She tells me all the time how I’m perfect and how happy she is to have me and how she wants to spend the rest of her life with me (another worry) and stuff like that. How am I supposed to break up with her? I’ve had these feelings like I just want out for a while now but I just don’t know what to do. Am I being an asshole? I’m really a nice guy and a good boyfriend but I just feel like this situation is too much.


Holy shit this is long. Sorry guys I just had to get it out. 


EDIT: also one thing I failed to mention is that she still keeps in contact with 1) her ex boyfriend, who punched her in the stomach during a fight but now apparently has "" done his time"" according to her and she seems ok with his desperate grovelling and is still his friend and 2) these guys who constantly flirt with her, one of whom during a night when we were both drunk partying at my fraternity house threw me into a serving table, cutting my head open (clearly over her), and who also kissed her over the summer at a party at a time that we were basically together while I was in Europe on an internship. She was playing beer pong with him just a week ago the night I left to come back home for break.  It just bothers me how she is still friends with that asshole and also with these other guys who flirt with her all the time. but maybe I'm overreacting. 


tl/dr: girlfriend is needy and doesn’t understand my time constraints and makes me feel bad about myself. However she tells me I’m the one she wants to spend the rest of her life with. How do I tell her I don’t want to be with her?

I am a former sonar technician of 5 years. I've been trying to find a job for a year and a half, and now my resources are exhausted deeply.

In my 24 years of life, I've taught myself countless programming languages as a hobby, including C/C++/C#, Java, Python, Lua, GameMonkeyScript, etc., mainly working on Windows and Linux platforms, taking great discipline on their respective console scripting languages and pipeline creating. I've also programmed using various graphics and audio libraries, more notably OpenGL/AL.

In my military career, I was taught more of the hardware side of things, from learning how to use basic electronic testing tools to troubleshooting advanced equipment using schematics. I'm also qualified as a quality assurance worker. 

As of this moment, I am going for my associates degree in computer science, so I will be happy for a non paying internship in software just to get my foot in the door, but I am more inclined to go for the electronics field in component-level troubleshooting, maintenance, and repair.

I should mention that I'm a 2nd semester sophomore at the moment.
My fear is that I don't see the classes getting easier any time soon, and so I will graduate with something around a 3.0. First this makes it almost impossible to get internships over the summer due to more competitive applicants being out there. Second, in a negative feedback loop with a shitty GPA and lack of resume experience, I won't get into a good grad school, thus dooming me to a life of shit...

I've been contemplating switching to Computer Science or Computer Science Engineering. Almost none of my credits transfer over so I would need an additional 4 years to graduate on top of the 3 semesters I've already done. I've done a little bit of programming in my free time and enjoy it but can't be certain my grades would be any better than I'm currently getting in BME.

So I guess what I'm asking: between 2.9-3.0 GPA from top 10 program in BME or assuming slightly better grades in CS/CSE, which is the more career-oriented decision?"

In preparation for starting my full time job search, there's one thing that's kind of concerning me.

My grades are good but not phenomenal (Dean's list most terms and overall).  I also have some very good work experience from internships at well known large companies.

However, my most recent internship for a very prominent company where I did some really cool work ended with my worst performance review.  It was also the only internship where I didn't get a full time job offer.

I truly believe that, at least from a technical perspective, my work there was good given the circumstances.  I also worked harder than ever before (and harder than is healthy or reasonable, i.e. 80 hours some week) because I was really interested in my project.

However, my supervisor and I got off on the wrong foot and had a terrible relationship the whole time, which I believe is almost entirely to blame for my poor evaluation and lack of offer.  There was nothing unprofessional about it like overt discrimination or arguing, but we disagreed about the right way to do pretty much everything (even if both our ways were perfectly reasonable solutions), and it seemed to me like even when I would bend to his view, he would change it so I am still wrong.  Maybe I was not able to properly adjust to his style and that is partly my fault, but it was also not my first or even fifth job in the field, and it's the only time I've ever had any issues like this.

Due to the prominence of the company in my field and the fact that it's my most recent job, it's almost certain to be a focus in my upcoming full time job search.

I think dumping on your past boss in an interview looks bad, but so does 'poor' performance without an actual explanation.

How do I spin this to not look bad without saying we just hated each other."

I'm a sophomore in college and a general biology major. I'm not exactly sure what I want to do with that after college. However, I live very close to a military base with research labs and I've worked for them for the past three summers teaching kids. I'm hoping to get a job there eventually, but I'm not sure about what that'd be or how I'd get it. 

As far as school goes, I'm not doing so bad but I'm not the best either. I've got a solid 3.0. I'm part of a club. I want to be a TA for the introductory biology course at the university because of my small background in teaching and my love for the course. At some point in my college career, I definitely plan on either doing an internship or doing research under a professor on campus. 

Here's the thing: my family has serious financial issues. My mother has a gambling problem and my father's a simple-minded man with a short fuse who drives about an hour or two getting to work so all his money basically goes to gas. My mother ALWAYS ""borrows"" money from me and it's scary because sometimes, it's the money I get from loans. She always says, ""I'll pay you back"" and although I've had some close calls, I'm able to pay my rent and tuition miraculously. 

My sisters are working now. My older sister's trying to pay off her college debt and my little sister is training to become a nurse. I'm the only one who's currently enrolled in college and not working. I'm planning on getting a job next semester, now that I'm taking the bare minimum amount of credits because I'll be taking three labs. I'm hoping that'll help with day-to-day things like paying for groceries and making ends meet with utilities.

I'm afraid of falling into the same trap as my older sister: going to college for four years only to be trapped at home trying to pay off all that. My parents never saved up for college and all the money I made from working in high school went straight to my mother to pay for the bills. My mother gambled away all the money that was supposed to go to paying for our house and now she's trying to catch up by borrowing money from me. It also frustrates me that my parents are very irresponsible with their money. My mother tends to buy things that she doesn't need and doesn't listen to me or my sisters when we tell her ""No. Don't get that."" The ""just talk to them"" solution never works with my parents, and believe me, I've tried on a number of occasions. 

A few times this semester, I've thought about dropping out so that I can go home and get a simple job in order to help my mother with the bills. Sounds fair since I don't even really know what I want to do with my life yet, I've been doing average in school, and I feel guilty enjoying my time with college knowing that back at home everything's a wreck. I can just go back to school when I've figured it out and when the house, cars, phones, etc. has been paid off, right? 

However, I've already applied for a loan that'll be paying for the rest of the spring and summer, so if anything I should just finish this school year off and then get another job over the summer. If I decide on anything, it'll be for after summer is over. Also, I feel like if I go home and get a simple paying job, that'll be the end of it. I'll be at a dead end and no longer able to advance either academically or in terms of a career. I'm probably all wrong about that, but I don't have much telling me otherwise.

**TL;DR** I'm an average college student with a family that has financial issues. Should I drop out to help out with the bills at home or should I continue to go to school in hopes for a better job in the future? "

I could use your advice before spending $75-$100 dollars or so on a new hard drive. I got my MacBook around August 2007. It's one of the plain white ones that were recently discontinued, not a pro. Anyways, a few months ago my computer froze and told me to do a hard reboot and when it came back on a folder with a question mark in it popped up and that's all that's happened ever since. 

I brought it to the Apple Store and I believe they said it was a failed hard drive. Now I've been waiting to hopefully buy a new one but it's become apparent to me that won't be happening until my internship ends in the summer (I get paid really poorly) so the only way I can have a Mac experience instead of using the dumpy laptop my work gives me I'd rather shell out the $100 for a new hard drive. 

So has this happened to anyone else? And was it as simple as replacing the hard drive? I have my Snow Leapord and Microsoft Office install discs still available also so that won't be a problem. "

But here we go. So I broke up with my now ex because she was severely unhappy in our relationship, she wanted to be independent and have her own place but she has been constantly relying other people. Moving from one family member to another, till eventually she moved in with me and my family.  We got her a well paying job that she could use to support herself, but she hated working in an office, as she has only worked retail, which showed in her work and attitude which eventually got her fired. Slowly over time she gave up in our relationship, even though I did everything I could to help us and her. Including constantly searching for jobs and defending her from my family who was getting annoyed by her not doing anything to really help. She slowly started to resent me until one day it erupted into a hate she only reserved for her father and possibly Hitler. Over night I had become the worst scum alive and had done something that made me ""a manipulative and lying bastard"" and ""I was never a good person"" that she refused to reveal and yet would never tell anyone about. She then packed up and called my best friend to pick her up and take her away. She then moved in with him. A week later I had to see her at a Christmas party with my friends where she took every chance to passive aggressively insult me and our relationship.

 I don't want to take her back, with us separated both our lives are much easier. I can go off and finish college (I had taken an internship with an art studio and got me a job there, I just want to expand my knowledge) and she can do whatever it is she wants to do. The only thing I want is how do I get to feel comfortable with my life again, as I'm constantly haunted by all of this. I have two jobs, in both I work by myself so negative thoughts are often easy to think about, and since my friends and myself are all very busy it can be difficult to get everyone together. Now when we do she is always there. Reddit, how do I feel better about myself and get over this girl without sacrificing my friends?"

nxx54,0,2011-12-31,Reddit: what was your worst New Year's experience?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/nxx54/reddit_what_was_your_worst_new_years_experience/,"I'll go first.

Last year, I was supposed to meet up with some friends, one of whom lived in a building with a hot tub on the roof and a pool and sauna in the basement. We, along with some others, were going to go party hopping and then hot tub to end the night. I bought a bottle of champagne for each of us to drink, as one does on New Year's Eve. Unfortunately, his phone died or something, so we lost contact. Me and the friend I was with were stuck with two bottles of champagne, two (preban) Four Lokos, and two tallboys of beer. Drank the beers, popped the first bottle on the L train at midnight, popped the second bottle on the dance floor at the second party. By 1:30, I had finished both bottles of champagne (mostly by myself) and started on the Four Loko. Gave the rest of it away.

Got calls from a couple of my niggas who were out in Williamsburg at a couple of loft parties that were apparently poppin' off. So my friend and I said our goodbyes and went to the L. I don't remember anything after I turned onto Myrtle Ave. except for a few brief flashes. Apparently, I said I was going to be sick, she bought me tacos from one of the best trucks in the area to settle my stomach, we got on the train, I started puking everywhere, I collapsed into a puddle of my own vomit and continued to puke, my nose started bleeding, and I was dragged onto the platform at the next stop. There were already cops there and they called for an ambulance when I couldn't stand up.

I woke up the next morning propped up in a bed in Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan with a plastic bag tied around my neck in case I puked (which I had) and no wristband. There was dried blood and vomit all over my face. My cash and MetroCard had been stolen from my wallet when the paramedics took it out of my pocket to figure out who I was in the ambulance. It was a brand new two-week unlimited I had just bought the day before and fifty dollars my grandparents had just given me for Christmas. A doctor was leading interns to my room. I heard him say, ""Now we'll see how to treat a patient who has overdosed on cocaine."" He came around the corner into my room, saw that I was awake, went, ""Oh,"" and led them elsewhere.

Apparently, before my friend left, they asked her repeatedly if I had done coke (I hadn't) and just continued to assume I had OD'd after she told them I hadn't touched it. And the younger of the two paramedics flirted with her in the ambulance while the older one went through my wallet. That's when we think they took the money and MetroCard.

I still went to work that day.

**tl;dr:** Got alcohol poisoning, collapsed into own vomit and blood, got robbed by paramedics, hospital left me alone without treating me for several hours so they could demonstrate how to treat the coke overdose they incorrectly assumed I had, still went to work."
nxujy,8,2011-12-31,"Reddit has proven to have far more jerking power than many of us would have ever expected. Everyone should pay attention to this, not just those interesting in circlejerking.",[deleted],circlejerk,https://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/nxujy/reddit_has_proven_to_have_far_more_jerking_power/,"tl;dr Reddit is starting to make big differences in how important we all think we are sitting at our computers. Let's continue, and convince ourselves that we are shaping the world even more next year. Let's make it Reddit's New Year's resolution.

Reddit has formed into an affective way of fighting back against $2 fees, but those politicians whose batshit ideas will die out with their generation. It has become sort of a magnifying glass for many of us want to be intellectual 20-somethings, and the rest of the weak 3rd world is on the other side. We have the power to set any any we want aflame like the joker in the Dark Night because our opinions are so fucking important.

It's been a long journey for me with Reddit, but what we've been doing to talk amongst ourselves about SOPA has warmed my heart more than any other altruistic function Reddit has ever organized (next to Ron Paul). I think we should continue. Reddit has been in the news more than ever (a whopping 2 times in the 4th quarter of 2011), and I think it says something very important about the United States political system. Democracy in and of itself it incredibly ineffective unless the people are well informed like everyone who browses r/politics and r/atheism and agrees with the hivemind there. At this point, especially in the United States, the status quo are, unfortunately, very uninformed and just downright wrong (Ron Paul). So those who ARE informed, must fight back with in a collected, unified, targeted manner against anyone who identifies themselves as a Republican, Christian, Conservative, White, and over 35. Not just boycotts, but, just as many have said before me, targeting one or two politicians at a time and spamming their inboxes with form letters for their interns to delete. Or one or two corporations at a time so they can blatantly ignore us or pander bullshit to us to shut us up. The harder we smash them into the ground, the more revered Reddit will become, and the harder my dick will become.

Other things I want to add if you want to be a part of this:

* Make a Reddit account already. Upvotes/downvotes are what make Reddit so powerful and you can't do that without and account. Seriously, if we have more fake internet points NOTHING CAN STOP US. Signing up for Reddit was the quickest and more painless process I've ever went through for a site, but remember, don't disagree with the hivemind.

* Comment on things. Sure, you'll probably get downvoted for having an opinion on stuff but who cares? It's a number. That's it. I've gotten downvoted plenty of times before, and as a result I learned why what I said was incorrect. The Hivemind is omniscient and omnipresent like Ron Paul.

* Lastly, and I hope most obviously, take part in what we decide to focus on. We are right. All the time. You may think you are only one person and moving one or two domains from GoDaddy or doing that ONE THING won't actually change anything, but you are thinking as a single person. This is a collective organism. This is hivemind. You can't think that way, or you won't help at all. It does make a difference. We are so god-damn important. Unless you disagree with us. Then, fuck off.

nxprp,0,2011-12-31,"Dear Reddit, should I break-up with my girlfriend?",SYRIO_FOREaL,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/nxprp/dear_reddit_should_i_breakup_with_my_girlfriend/,"We’ve been dating for almost 2 years now, and things have started getting complicated. Here is a little background:

We’re both university students making our way through our bachelors. I am studying as an “insert business related degree” and her, an ”insert science related degree”. My goal is to go to graduate school and receive my “insert professional title”. Her goal is not yet clear. But that doesn’t matter… where things are complicated is when you take into our parents and our culture.

We’re both “brown”. She’s from country “A” and I’m “B”. We’re both born into the same religion, so there is no religious tension. However, her parents are both highly educated (PhD and university professors), quite wealthy and very socially “connected”. In contrast, my parents aren’t as educated, they don’t have a complete grasp of the English language nor the “A” language (which are the languages my GF’s parents speak fluently), and are not wealthy at all (you might say poor, but I wouldn’t). 

My parents came here and, as the story goes for most immigrants who had young kids to raise, went straight to work. My parents worked in a factory and gave everything to my brother and I. My dad’s biggest regret was to never have been able to provide us with a house. We still live in an apartment. My brother (26) and I (21) share a room together. You might be wondering: “Why is your brother still living with your parents?” Well culturally we don’t leave our parents until after our marriage, but even then it’s not rare to see kids keep their parents company. My brother is such person; he will never leave our parents alone and will always be by their side whenever they need him to be. Another reason for my brother living with us is that he is the breadwinner now. My mom was laid off 2 years ago, and my dad barely kept his job, working for almost minimum wage. My brother works for a bank, and makes a good salary for a “bachelor”, but the combined salary of his and my dad’s is barely enough to support a family of 4. 

Through all this, my parents raised me to be an educated man, and I have a good future ahead of me. I estimate that upon my graduation, I’ll be starting off at 35k CAD (I am currently finishing up an internship with a multinational, and am expecting a contract). If I do get my title, I should be starting off closer to the 80k-100k mark, and it will only go higher. Why am I mentioning all this? It is because I want to be able to buy a house for my parents, for my dad, for my brother. For the people that have given so much to me.

What is the issue now? Well you might think it’s funny that a 21 year old would think about this, but that is the nature of our brown culture. My girlfriend and I have been talking about wedding and such, and when to tell our parents. I keep telling her to push it back till when I’m ready, but she feels guilty about hiding our “relationship” from her parents. She intends on telling them about us when we graduate. 

The problem? I don’t know how I’ll get my parents and her parents to ever get along. My parents are very reserved, rarely talk, and are not familiar to “high society”. I don’t want this to seem like a Disney love story, but in our brown culture, this whole issue about social/class status is a big deal. I’m afraid her parents will never allow her to marry me. Another thing that leads me to believe this is her mother who keeps telling her and her sister that it is important to find a partner who will be able to make sure that they are financially stable. Her sister is a “medical progressional” and will only marry someone of her “level”. She’s a very nice person, and I can understand her, I would do the same. I guess it’s just how we were raised, to always look for someone who is your equal. She met a new man and is getting serious about settling down. Whenever she mentions her boyfriend (who is also a professional in the medical field), she mentions how his family is rich and full of doctors/dentists/educated people. These conversations make my girlfriend uncomfortable; she’s like “fuck”. Not “fuck” as in “I chose the wrong guy”, but “fuck” as in “Why do we care about all that, it’s the guy who matters!” 

Up until this point, you would probably think it’s all a cultural issue. But sadly it isn’t. I think deep down, I’m not ready to commit. I’ve been having recurrent thoughts and dreams about… being single again. It’s gotten to the point where I question myself: 

-	Am I being honest to myself? 
-	This girl, who is probably the best friend I ever had, who would make a great mother, is she the one?
-	Am I actually committed to her, even if it’s been 2 years we’ve been together? 
-	Can I ignore all our family issues and still act like nothing bothers me?

I don’t know what to do. This might be the best thing, or the worst thing in my life. I feel like I’m in so deep with her (2 years is a big deal for me), that I feel like I owe it to us to make it work… But then again, I don’t know if I’m ready… ready for what? I don’t even know.

**TL;DR: Trying to keep everything in check, but self-questioning about culture, family and my own happiness leading to a strained inner conscious (relating to my relationship with girlfriend).**

nxn2v,1,2011-12-31,Advice for atheist new to a career setting,saramb03,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nxn2v/advice_for_atheist_new_to_a_career_setting/,"I'm a recent atheist (about 3 years ex-Christian) and I'm about to start a career in a hospital laboratory. I've been doing internships for my last year of college and have already been put in a position where Christians have been questioning my beliefs. On almost my first day there, my trainer and I were discussing the coagulation cascade and she said that when she learned about coagulation, ""that's when [she] knew there was a God."" Then she looked at me expectantly, waiting for me to agree with her. I had no idea what to say, whether I should play along in hopes that I be hired there someday or just tell her the truth. I ended up saying ""Yep, it's pretty amazing...."" After that, she was significantly cooler to me, and we had to listen to the Christian radio station for the rest of the day. I'm wondering if this is something I will experience at every job (This isn't my first job, I have worked in the restaurant industry for 7 years. The demographics in a restaurant are completely different though, and could hardly be considered professional; I could say whatever I wanted at any of my other jobs). 

Normally, I like to be pretty vocal about my atheism but I'm worried that in a professional setting this might work against me. Ideally, I'd like to get into management and I wonder if coming out as an atheist will get in the way of that with office politics and all. Also I worry that people will think I can't make moral decisions about patient care since I don't believe in god.

My questions to r/atheism are: 
What have your experiences been with theists in the workplace? Any confrontations? 

Did you tell them you were an atheist, try your best to be ambiguous, or lie about your beliefs? 

For people who are openly atheists at work, have you had a negative or positive experience?

For any Christians reading this, would you be weary of promoting an atheist or feel inclined to discriminate against them because you feel they have no basis for morality?"

She's always been a party animal, but as of the last two years, since she returned from a year long internship abroad (in Chile), her partying has grown to frightening porportions. We're talking drinking to the point of blacking out on a regular basis (and belittling those who can't or won't drink at that level). Additionally, she's become hypersexual; we recently went to a party where she pointed out five different guys in the same clique that she's slept with in the last three months, and became upset when I simply spoke to them in a non-flirtatious manner. 

After this party, she became hysterical when her and another friend got into a fight of Jersey Shore proportions (screaming, grabbing, etc) regarding one of the guys she hooked up with. I broke them up, and the other friend left. K was crying, I sat her down, and got her a glass of water. She responded by GRABBING THE GLASS AND THROWING IT IN MY FACE. It didn't break, but it did leave a bruise. I began taking my things and making to leave, she grabbed my legs and begged me not to leave her. I stayed to calm her down, then left as quickly as I could the next day to have brunch with a saner friend. K whined that she wanted to come with, despite another friend repeatedly asking her to come out, and if I was a true friend I'd invite her along. I responded that a true friend wouldn't have attacked me the night before. I left her moaning and crying alone in her apartment. 

I spoke with some mutual friends about what happened. Two of them pointed out that K's been getting more and more hysterical over the last year, as well as becoming more narcissistic (Example: a mutual friend had ovarian cysts removed, and may not be able to have children. K's idea of cheering her up was coming over to her house after surgery, getting drunk and bragging about her sex life. Not once did she discuss the friend's operation). 

After talking about this, we think something may have happened to her in Chile. How do we ask her if something happened, and how we can help? The narcissism bothers me; she's an immensely fun girl, but her actions over the last year are upsetting. Throwing a glass in my face was the final straw. I want to be friends with her, but I'm truly concerned about her behavior. Should we be having an intervention for her? Call her parents? Consult a counselor, or hell, even AA or Sex Addicts Anonymous? What should we do? "

Let me start with some background info so you can see my reasoning.

My Parents were immigrants from Europe. Both have Masters Degrees. They lived with their parents until they came to the US. They left Europe because they could not make ends meet as Teachers and came to the US legally and are US Citizens. Because they didn't speak English this was a major block to their potential employment prospects. My mom was a housekeeper for years and finally moved up the ranks to that of Supervisor. She currently makes about $40K + benefits. My dad did various low paying jobs and eventually got into construction: working for a General Contractor for over 20 years. My dad has never made more than $35K and has never had benefits. It makes me sick to my stomach that even though he has all this experience he gets paid so low.

Like most people on here I was told the same thing about going to college and getting a good job afterwards! I had dreams about getting a good job so that I could help my dad retire early. I was so sick of my dad being taken advantage of that I was willing to support him if I made enough money. My dad is a very hard worker but he is just not a people person. There is no way he could ace any interview. 

Even though both of my parents don't make much money [ New York City standards] they live what I would consider a middle class life: They have a house with a mortgage, a used car, cable tv and cell phones. They bought their house in Queens in 1994 and got a 30 year mortgage. They have about 13 years left or so on it. The house was $195K which was the most they could afford at the time. Same house today is about $450K. They were forced to buy outside of the neighborhood where we originally lived - Greenpoint, Brooklyn. If you are from NYC you know that area along with Williamsburg has exploded ! The price for a house now in that area is at least $750K and I am talking a piece of shit wooden house with no garage. There are condo buildings going up left and right all the time and I think the minimum is about $500K [ but I could be wrong depending on the size and # of bedrooms etc] Basically if you want to live as a family in that area be prepared to spend at least $750K.

OK back to me. So my parents thought that I should go to college and I would be able to get some good job and be better off than them. That was the plan.
For my freshman year I went to a reasonably priced school called Hofstra University, which cost about $14K for the year back in 1995 - 96. I had to commute everyday and lived at home to save money. I also worked pretty much everyday to cover whatever scholarships and loans didn't. The commute from Queens to Long Island to school and then the commute from Queens to Manhattan to work took its toll on me and I decided to transfer the following year to a school in the city. 

Here is where I started making major mistakes. I ended up going to NYU where tuition was over $25K if I remember correctly. Of course I got some grants etc, more loans but I was always short. Whatever money I made I was constantly paying it to the school to cover the tuition, books, etc. After I graduaded in Fall of 1999 I had student loan debt of approximately $50 - $60K. There were so many loans it was confusing to keep track of all this stuff. For the first few years I remember making only the minimum payments because my income was just so low. Finally in 2004 I made more money and increased my payments and by October 2009 I actually finished paying off my student loans. Yes it took exactly 10 years to pay it all off.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Finance. This is a hard major and people are supposed to make good money with this degree. Never happened to me. I do blame myself though - but only to a point. You see, I didn't even want to go to college and I really hated Finance after studying it. I only went because everybody including my very successful boss was telling me that is what I needed to do. I saw college as expensive and in the way of my job but I didn't listen to me, I listened to them.
I started working at age 14 and at age 16 I met my main employer. This would become my employer for the last 17 years! Yes, I started working there at 16 in 1993 and finally lost my job in 2010. What's hilarious is that I was already there working at 16 yrs old so technically I didn't even need to finish High School! I could have dropped out in my Sophomore Year and nothing would be different. I learned everything I needed to learn on the job and eventually trained other employees.

After I got my degree I realized how hard it is to get a better job [i.e. with health benefits and opportunities for advancing an actual career] than the one I had been working at since age 16. I had no industry connections, my parents had none either. Actually I had 1 contact in the finance world and even he couldn't help me although I offered to work for FREE to get experience. He and other adults told me that most of the finance jobs go to the kids of the parents / relatives already working there at those firms. So the only other slots left were for students with very high GPA's that had managed to get industry specific internships at those firms. So if you didn't have that internship - you were toast. I would have gladly done an internship but that was out of the question because I was working to cover whatever the loans didn't. The big companies already had online recruitment then and after I submitted my applications I never heard back from any of them. 

So here I was working the same job since High School and here come some recessions: 9/11 attacks, dot com burst etc. Had to take a second job during those bad years to survive. I even went to some computer retraining program on Sundays for several months during 2002 that was funded by the State. Didn't learn anything useful that I could use at work or to get better work. Turned out to be a scam school of some sort. I feel bad because the State was scammed along with the tax-payer and I.

So to sum this up I went to college but never got a job in my field or a remotely related field and never got a job even utilizing anything I supposedly learned in school. I was essentially cornered into holding on to my job until things improve. They never did. I was one of the unlucky graduates who fell through the cracks of the system. I was lucky that I did manage to pay off my student loans during the better years when the economy was good for all companies even the shitty ones. Then I lost my job the following year. And I ask: What the fuck happened? I just wasted 10 years of my life working and paying off some shit that hasn't done me any good. Negative return on investment.

During the busiest years at my old job I didn't have dinner with my family for 2 years! I only saw my kids in the morning when they went to school and then on Saturday and Sunday nights. It was like having ""visitation rights"" with your own family even though we lived together.

I want to puke everytime I see some ad in the subway for such and such college. Pictures of smiling kids with Graduation Caps. Such false hope !

One thing that I want to clear up is that I am not jealous of anyone else. I am pissed because others have figured it out before I did. I believe that everybody who works hard and is interested in working should be able to get a good decent job. And if you want to be exemplary then be a star performer and get the best compensation. But the average people don't even get a fair chance at average pay. Everything seems below average with no benefits and no stability.

I tell people that I totally fucked up when it comes to the whole college thing. I have a laundry list of what not to do. I am convinced that college is for few people either the priveledged ones or the lucky ones or the dirt poor ones that can get a full ride. College is not for the average person with no connections -- only to be saddled with debt.

You know, when it was time to go to college, everybody said ""don't worry, just go, you'll get that fantastic job later"" Now that we're out ""oh no, there was no guarantee of a job"" . Hey - Fuck You ! You should have explained that more clearly in the beginning and I would have never went. You should have explained that some people get good jobs with signing bonuses but some graduates get crappy leftover jobs and they're underemployed perpetually. There will be incredible competition for jobs - translation: there are NOT enough good jobs for everybody. There's no rhyme or rhythm. I feel like the whole jobs situation is like a Ponzi Scheme. The people at the top are the lucky ones and cash out.
It's a combination of connections, luck and street smarts. I obviously have none.

Update on characters in my post:
That 1 contact I had in Finance: Lost his job at Bear Stears when Bear crashed, now lives and works in Asia. His wife lost her job at Lehman Brothers, works somewhere in NYC doing something similar to her old job, their relationship soured from being apart, most likely will divorce in the future.
My ex Boss: his company finally closed in 2011, getting divorced.
My Mom: After she lost her job in 2008 [ at the place she worked at for 25 years] she rebounded and found a similar position in 2010, still there $40K + benefits.
Dad: no change, still underpaid, still no benefits.
Myself:  A year ago I got my security guard license but couldn't find any legit guard work. Zero. Currently selling things online and in person to barely make ends meet. Studying for a CDL to see where that goes. I don't think I will ever use my degree for anything. It's too late and I don't remember jack shit anyway because I never had the oppurtunity to use and build on what I had learned.

Am I going to tell my kids to go college? Hell fuckin NO."

I am a student intern at the Blind Pig.  It's an unpaid position, but I do it because I'm really passionate about this place, it's one of my favorite concert venues in the world, and I want to show it off to all my friends!

I run the Twitter Page, so follow me for a followback if you'd like:

I really enjoy this place, and it might be a cool hang out, meet up for my fellow redditors.  There are some great shows coming this year, and if you have an act that you'd like to see, and they are suited for a ~350 person venue, let me know and I'll chat with the agent about getting them here to rock out!

Have you guys seen some great concerts here?  Anything you feel that the establishment should improve??"
nwz11,4,2011-12-30,"Reddit, I broke up with my girlfriend and now I have to see her every time I hang out with my friends, how do I get over her?",Awkwardartist,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/nwz11/reddit_i_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_and_now_i/,"So I made this throw away because she's an avid redditor and I don't know if she will see this. I also posted this r/Relationships and they pointed me here. I figured I repost to see if I can get some more advice and from people who are more used to this sort of thing. More is always better than less right? Before we start, I'm a twenty one year old male, and she's 22. We dated for about a year and a half before we eventually broke up. If any other details are needed or anything about the relationship I'll put it up. I'm not really sure what you guys need but here we go.
So I broke up with my now ex because she was severely unhappy in our relationship, she wanted to be independent and have her own place but she has been constantly relying other people. Moving from one family member to another, till eventually she moved in with me and my family. We got her a well paying job that she could use to support herself, but she hated working in an office, as she has only worked retail, which showed in her work and attitude which eventually got her fired. Slowly over time she gave up in our relationship, even though I did everything I could to help us and her. Including constantly searching for jobs and defending her from my family who was getting annoyed by her not doing anything to really help. She slowly started to resent me until one day it erupted into a hate she only reserved for her father and possibly Hitler. Over night I had become the worst scum alive and had done something that made me ""a manipulative and lying bastard"" and ""I was never a good person"" that she refused to reveal and yet would never tell anyone about. She then packed up and called my best friend to pick her up and take her away. She then moved in with him. A week later I had to see her at a Christmas party with my friends where she took every chance to passive aggressively insult me and our relationship. I don't want to take her back, with us separated both our lives are much easier. I can go off and finish college (I had taken an internship with an art studio and got me a job there, I just want to expand my knowledge) and she can do whatever it is she wants to do. The only thing I want is how do I get to feel comfortable with my life again, as I'm constantly haunted by all of this. I have two jobs, in both I work by myself so negative thoughts are often easy to think about, and since my friends and myself are all very busy it can be difficult to get everyone together. Now when we do she is always there. Reddit, how do I feel better about myself and get over this girl without sacrificing my friends?"
