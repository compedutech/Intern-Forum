I can now actually get the sumbitch (no offense, label of love) to check for new updates when I click the doohickey to update, and check in ""Just In Time"" for anything new again.

Guy (and his minions, or the poor bastard intern, if any) deserve some credit.

Public credit.  I'm not gonna fill up Git with platitudes.

So, thanks, dude.  It was a little bit maddening to go through 15 different motions to get a security update."
1rvbce,1,2013-12-01,I always think about my parents being disappointed in me.,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1rvbce/i_always_think_about_my_parents_being/,"I'm 18 and my first quarter of college is coming to an end.  

I've always been very focused on school because my parents put a great deal of emphasis on it, but I've always needed some sort of crutch.

I went to a private high school that my parents were very proud of me for going to (it was their dream that I went there) and I did very well, and I got into a good college (they wanted me to go here very badly, just like my two older sisters).  The only problem is that I've always needed some sort of crutch in my life.

In high school, I drank basically every night.  I rarely got drunk, but usually I got a nice buzz so that way I could go to sleep.  This started my sophomore year and it continued for the rest of my high school career.  Contrary to what you may think, my grades didn't go down at all, and I was still in the top 10% of my class without difficulty.  

Now that I'm in college, my crutch has been transferred to marijuana (my roommates would find it strange if I drank nightly, while daily marijuana use is socially acceptable; also, marijuana is much more accessible than alcohol on a college campus).  

I smoke multiple times per day (3-5), and although I have no physical dependence (I have no trouble ceasing use when I go back home) I still find that it helps immensely in relaxing me enough to do my homework and sleep at night.  I go through about 1/8th an ounce of marijuana a week (which is probably considered heavy usage) which I pay for using my own money (I am currently employed in an internship and I also use the money I made from my internship throughout high school).

I find that I’m generally honest with myself, and I truthfully believe that my marijuana use helps me.  It relaxes me enough that I can talk to people without any difficulty, and this, in turn, has enabled me to make a lot of friends – and, I feel as if I’m generally liked by people now; whereas in high school, I was somewhat of an outcast and I had very few friends and, to be quite honest, people didn’t really know who I was.

I’m much happier now that I’m in college.  I have friends, I managed to get a rewarding internship very quickly in the year, and I find the classes I take to be quite interesting.

My grades have not suffered in college either.  Although I procrastinate (mostly due to hanging out with friends when I should be working), I have still managed to get nothing below an A on every midterm and essay assigned (I still do all my work and study regularly).

However, at the end of every day I think about how disappointed they would be if they saw the way that I live every day.  They both are strongly opposed to marijuana and alcohol use (largely due to my mother’s side of the family being littered with alcoholism and suicide), and, although I personally feel that there is nothing inherently wrong with using either substance, I regard my parents very highly and value their opinions.

My parents always say that they’re proud of me and it makes me feel even worse every time I hear it.  They tried their best while raising me: they always supported me in everything I did, encouraged me, and paid a great deal for both my high school tuition (it was a private school) and my college tuition.

I honestly wish, more than anything, that I was able to function without any crutch.  When I go without marijuana, I can still do my school work perfectly fine, but I’m simply not happy -- I’m too uptight,  have more difficulty operating in a social environment, and, most of all, I have a lot of difficulty sleeping (insomnia is common in my family).

My question to you redditors is do you find my substance use justifiable?

1rv5k5,7,2013-12-01,Advice on PHd Subject Areas within CS,richard248,compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/1rv5k5/advice_on_phd_subject_areas_within_cs/,"Hi, I am hoping someone will be able to advise me on my aspiration to do a PHd in computer science. 

I have an undergraduate degree in physics with astrophysics (2.1) and a taught conversion masters in software development (high distinction) from a Russell group university. As for experience, I carried out an internship at a small big-data focused startup, and am currently working for a large multinational company doing software engineering. For research, I carried out a research-orientated masters dissertation working on a distributed parallel computing framework in C++, and have a good relationship with my supervisor and have been told my work may be tweaked and extended into a published report with me as co-author. 

I am looking to start a PHd in computer science in a year or two, and to this end I am currently trying to explore some possibilities and areas with the aim to come up with a good research proposal to apply with.  I understand having no formal CS 'fundamentals' education sets me back against other candidates, which is why I am hoping to develop a strong and worthwhile research proposal (along with self learning the underpinnings of software). However, I am finding it difficult to get an understanding of what areas are in need of work, aside from 'Big data', 'Machine Learning', 'Cloud Computing' etc, high level areas that are hard to know where best to start.

I am interested in continuing with high performance computing, compile-time or runtime parallelism etc, but it seems like any ideas I think of are already extensively well researched. Does anyone have any knowledge of a few more specific topics that i could look further into? It is quite daunting at the moment, so any advice on even sensible methods that I should be using in order to find that niche is much appreciated.

Thanks, I realise that a PHd is very much self-directed, but feel a little lost in the sea of seemingley disconnected research papers at the moment! I am hopeful that there are some PHd students in compsci who have gone through a similar situation. 

Edit: on my phone, and not quite sure of how well formatted this is, my apologies if it's a little hard to read."

1ruqq1,0,2013-12-01,"25F knocked up by 27M, while he was apparently cheating on 20F.",toss4w4y,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ruqq1/25f_knocked_up_by_27m_while_he_was_apparently/,"**TL;DR:** Someone I thought was my best friend knocked me up after telling me he was ending his relationship. Once I was pregnant he began to treat me like shit and repeatedly demand I abort, despite being alerted to my suicidal ideations.


I'm going to try and give as much background I can, while keeping this as short as possible.

I (25F) and ""James"" (27M) have been friends several years; often confiding in one another during hard or confusing times. We often called each other our best friend.

This summer, we began a physical relationship as neither of us wanted something serious. (I began birth control pills specifically for this undertaking, because he refused to use protection.) This went very well for about a month, at which time James told me he loved me. Because I know his history very well (has been cheated on in every major relationship), I stopped seeing others. This went well, until he realized he was being very openly affectionate with me and ignored me for two days.

When he spoke to me again he told me he decide to pursue Lea (20F) a waitress he saw briefly six months prior. That if he didn't stop us now, our friendship would be ruined. Hurt and confused, I accepted this and moved on. I stopped taking birth control.

I loaned him money for their first date, I helped him get his outfit together for a charity function we all attended, I created a floral arrangement for her-- I did all this because I care about James and I'd like him in a healthy relationship. 

James decided things were too heavy with Lea and told me he was ending it; a few days later, he tells me he misses me and invites me over. He was pretty buzzed and wanted me to play catch up-- I oblige and end up knocked out. He wakes me up, takes me to his room, and we have sex. 

The next morning, he tells me he's still with Lea. It's decided she won't be told; I'm just not allowed to drink over there alone anymore. He says he really cares about this girl and he's never made this mistake before. It's not my business, he was messed up, he seems really upset as is... he can make his own decisions.

A week later he sends me a bunch of nonsense texts, so I go check on him (he had/has a bad habit of robotripping and drinking a lot). I get him water, put him to bed, and he begs me to stay. We talk for awhile as he starts to sober up be begins to kiss me, which I allow, but when he goes to take my clothes off I stop him and ask about Lea. I get fed, and believe, that he cares about us both, wants us both, but is afraid of losing me. This doesn't change the fact my clothes stay on.

Fastfoward two weeks, we aren't talking much, but we're talking. Until I tell him my period's late and my boobs are swollen and painful. This stops what little interaction we have. I take a pregnancy test, which is positive but I want to know his thoughts before I tell him.

In telling him termination was an option if I was, his response was, ""the hell it is."" I was told that I only considered termination in a pregnancy, was because I wasn't raised with family values. That this was bigger than us both. I still considered it in silence, crying most of three days. I ultimately decided I couldn't out of fear for my mental health; I have PTSD and severe depression, which is reoccurring. I considered suicide while contemplating this.

When I told him I was pregnant, he immediately began pushing me to abort and has made it abundantly clear that he thinks Lea not knowing is far more important than anything I'm going through. (I told him everything listed above).

Also, that I'm no longer welcome in his life.

Anytime he speaks to me now it's: 

* I don't want this kid. 
* You need to terminate. 
* Lea's all that matters.

I told him I can't/won't force him to be a part of the kid's life, but I want him to be. I told him if he wanted to wait for a paternity test, he can, but I wasn't ovulating with my next partner, I was conscious, and my ultrasound said the kid was conceived the night James and I were together.

I don't want Lea in the dark about how James is proving himself to be and that he tried to cheat on her sober... and he has a kid on the way. He told me I'm a worse person than he is for wanting her to know and ruining their lives.

I'm honestly lost in every direction... Just any input that can help me move forward is appreciated.



**EDIT:**  I have been to Planned Parenthood; I have received lots of data on adopting, termination, and raising. I'm a second year Social Work master's student with a paid internship. James works in retail. I have insurance and a very competent support system. "
1ruoyn,3,2013-12-01,[22/F] Is there anything I can do to make this (21/M) happen?,summerlovinIguess,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ruoyn/22f_is_there_anything_i_can_do_to_make_this_21m/,"This summer I became really good friends with a guy, let's call him Joe. We interned together on the other side of the country and in many ways he became my sidekick. I went through a time where I ended up falling for/hooking up with one of the other interns, let's call him Richard. Joe was always supportive of me during the whole Richard thing but didn't really condone hooking up with coworkers (it was a big company though so we never actually saw each other at work) and said that was something he would never do. Richard and I went to the same college though so I was hoping that something could happen when we got back to school but, alas, things ended up falling apart during the summer and I lost a good deal of my friends that I made as a result. But not Joe, Joe stuck with me. The two of us would hang out every day and we were very close. This summer though, I never viewed Joe in any sort of romantic or sexual light. 

Well fast forward to back to college. Joe and I still talked but not nearly as much as we did during summer. We never really texted that much this summer either other than to arrange meet-ups. Joe goes to a school that is 5 hours away from mine and my club sport ended up having a tournament at his university so we decided to meet up and grab dinner when I got in. We had planned to go back to his place to pregame and go out to bars after dinner but we well...never ended up leaving his apartment. It was the most fun I've had in a while. We ended up dancing around to stupid 90s music and just catching up. And then he went into his bedroom (I thought he went to the bathroom) and he called me in to ""come hang out with him."" While we were on his bed he announced that he made a decision and started to kiss me. We didn't have sex, but we did everything else and it was really intimate and fun. I suspect that he had been into me since summer since he said things like ""I always wondered what they (my boobs) looked like..."". 

I ended up not staying the night since I had to go back to my team and be up at 6am for our competition. It should also be noted that I had originally planned to hook up with my ex that night but ended up staying with/hooking up with Joe instead. I had mentioned that it was clearly the better decision and as he was walking me out he asked me why I thought that he was the better decision. Since I am brilliant, I told him it's because we are good friends that don't see each other or talk that much and he said he kind of felt the same way and said he wouldn't see me until the next time I was in his city for a tournament. And I said ""Or never"" because I have no tact and meant that I don't have any more tournaments in his city. I am incredibly bad at this shit and also really bad at being vulnerable. We texted flirty a little bit for the rest of the weekend but then kind of regressed back to hardly talking. 

Is there anything I can do to salvage this? I had a lot of fun that night and wouldn't mind driving the 5 hours to visit him once in a while in a casual way or having him visit me here. I know that nothing can come of it long term since we will likely be working on opposite sides of the country after graduation but I feel like it's just such a shame to just let it go. 

I drunk texted him last night saying we should have casual sex and he never responded. (Edit: Just kidding, he just responded 14 hours later saying ""yeah I couldn't tell if this was a serious question or not""). Again, I know, I'm the definition of class. Guidance would be lovely since as you can see, I am very incapable of doing things and am also an idiot. 


**TL;DR**: Have some feelings for a good friend/coworker from the summer but he goes to school 5 hours away. Ended up hooking up with him when I was in his city and now want to see if I can create a casual relationship with him since I know nothing will work long term. "

[Prolific meth usage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqumi7?context=5)|Me? No. Never touched drugs and don't plan on it. However, a lot of dancers like to use various drugs, including cocaine, crack, meth and molly, when they come to work because it ""gets them in the mood"".
 |Personally, if I want to be in the mood to show my junk, I just have sex before I go to work.
[How long do you see yourself doing this job ?

However, it is paying the bills and keeping me fit. So, no this isn't something I've always wanted to do, nor do I want to do it longer than necessary - I work with women who are in their fifties and can't keep doing this much longer, but have no real job history so they can't go anywhere with their lives. I don't want to be them.
 |I'm currently studying Forensic Science as a background for my Private Investigator's and Criminal Detective's certification(s), which is my dream job. I will be doing this during the school year because of the flexible schedule, but over the summer I have internships lined up.

[Any funny stories while on the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqtl3p?context=5)|Here's a good one: I was working at the Silk Stocking in College Station a few months back and this guy kept staring me down. He wouldn't do anything - even shooed our lovely waitress away -, he just stared. So I go onstage and the guy starts looking at my face (okay, let me just say: when you're practically rubbing your boobs in their face, it's weird for a guy to look at your *face*.) and then promptly gets up and walks outside to the smoking patio. When I get off-stage, I get dressed and turn the charm up to full volume. I go outside, spot him and say, ""Hi there, would you mind if I sit with you?"" to which he responds. ""First, can you tell me if I'm wearing these right?""

Very curious, because I'm 18 myself and I couldn't even imagine doing something like that. More power to you though! As long as you're happy doing it :\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqup8m?context=5)|I enjoy certain aspects of it, and others I don't - just like any other job.
 |Well... $200+ a night, sitting around talking to people and listening to music for eight hours; or, $200- a week, sitting behind a cash register for eight ours? Easy choice to me. :P Actually, I used to waitress, but the hours were killing me and my schedule was not at all flexible for school, so when I talked to my mom about how well she was doing at her club, I figured I'd give it a shot.

Who are the worst?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqvm6n?context=5)|My favourite part has got to be being onstage and dancing, doing pole tricks; my leaset favourite part is table dances. The guys always want to grab, grab, grab, touch, touch, touch.
 |The customers vary, person to person, but I have to say that men that tip really well while I'm onstage or ask me to sit with them when I get offstage, and women are the best customers - at least for me; the worst are the ones that sit in their seats, nursing their five dollar beer and just when they're about to leave they come up to me and bitch about how I didn't sit with them. Dude. Really. Get off your ass and spare a dollar, I don't work here for free.
[Do you have a lot of female customers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdsertz?context=5)|I used to, especially when I first started dancing.

 |My *weirdest* experience? That's a tough one. I had this one guy, when I first started out, ask me to pee in his mouth for $600. My answer was a big ""HELL NO"", and I was so confused. I started out very naive and I had no idea that that was a fetish.
[Yep, that's defiantly weird. $600 though! I can't believe some people would pay that. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqtw6z?context=5)|This guy... I'm not gonna lie, he was kinda gross to begin with, that was just the icing on the cake.
[Least and most money you've earned in one night?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqufjb?context=5)|This is embarrassing! The least I've ever walked out with was $6. It was a slow night and there were more dancers than customers. The most I've ever walked out with was roughly $700.
 |And I say ""walked out with"" instead of ""earned"" because most clubs in Texas require a house fee and nightly tip-out; the house fee is what we pay to work, and the tip-out is a certain amount or percentage of your earnings from that night to the DJ, bouncers, managers, bartenders, waitresses or whoever they require be tipped-out. So what I earn and what I keep aren't always the same thing.
[6 Dollars.  Sounds like someone made it hail!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdr7v23?context=5)|Also take into account that I paid over forty dollars to the club that night, too.

It usually depends on the crowd, and my mood. Sometimes it's dubstep/skrillex - a favourite being Michael Jackson's ""Beat It"", Mutrix Remix. Normally, though, its Taking Back Sunday, Rob Zombie, 30 Seconds to Mars, Kill Hannah, Fall Out Boy, Def Leopard, Warrant, etc. The mix is energetic, so it catches people's attention.
 |My favourite set of all time is My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark by Fall Out boy, Lips Like Morphine by Kill Hannah, and Makedamnsure by Taking Back Sunday. The mix of genres makes people look twice, from what they've told me. :)
[Def submit some kinda proof. I've a couple questions. One, 18 is young, by any standards. What got you into dancing so young? Does your family know? Not putting you down, but just curious :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqtkgt?context=5)|I'm not entirely sure what kind of proof to give you, I could list the places I work, but that would be just as dangerous as giving my real name while at work.
 |And yes, eighteen is really young - I don't make as much money as others because of it, but I turned eighteen in May and was supposed to be attending Texas A&amp;M in the Fall, so I had to pay for it; my mom had been dancing off and on throughout her life - even raised my oldest little brother and I, and put herself through nursing school doing it - so I figured I'd give it a shot.
 |And in case that didn't answer your second question, yes, my family knows and is very supportive. My mom even sends old customers my way.

Also, thanks for your answer :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqtrak?context=5)|Not really. I mean, I'm a horrible conversationalist, so the more we already have to talk about without me thinking something up, the better.

 |Me: ""Thank you, I'll take a coke.""
 |Him: ""Don't you want something a little stronger?""
 |Me: ""I'd love that, but I'm eighteen.""
 |Him: ""Oh."" *Awkward silence ensues*
 |Me: ""Oh?""
 |Him: ""I was going to ask for a dance, but the age throws me off. Sorry, you're like my daughter's age.""
[Picsoritdidn'thappen.  But seriously, what is something that you dislike about your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqtiia?context=5)|Oh, I could write a book with the things I don't like about it, but it all boils down to one thing: drunk old men. Yeah, talking to them can be fun, but they can go from sweet guy to rapist in 0.02 seconds.
[If you don't like it, why do you still do it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqtmek?context=5)|Because for every little thing I hate about it, there are two things I love about it. I make my own schedule and I don't have to tell **anyone** what it is, I typically make good money, I meet lots of fun people and make lots of connections with people in high places, and I get to lose weight, build muscle *and* dance.
[Have you had any close encounters of the sexual abuse sort? How did it go over?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqty67?context=5)|A couple. The worst being some cocky guy thinking he was above the rules of that particular club and decided that he was going to ""make me his woman one way or another"" and kept trying to fondle me, grope me, and slap me until the bouncers threw him out.
[What do you mean you make your own schedule and you don't have to tell anyone about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdquu01?context=5)|The club I danced at for the very first time (May) is in Dallas, too far from where I moved. However, I walked in the door just a couple weeks ago and no one said a word, despite the fact that they hadn't seen hide nor hair of me for months.
[Wow, I did not know this. Very interesting. Is this totally cool with the managers or is there some sort of unspoken agreement to give them a heads up about schedules, even if you aren't tied to it?

So, they are never left hurting for people to work.
[*they are always hiring because they don't have to pay them.*  Are the dancers working solely off customers' tips and not wages, or am I misreading what you're saying? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqznio?context=5)|No, that's completely accurate. We are tips/commission only. This is why, when you go into a club, girls will *frequently* ask you if you want a dance.
[Do you get paid a wage plus what you get in tips?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqu4md?context=5)|No, entertainers are private contractors, so we are only paid what the customers pay us. However, there are usually set rates for things like table dances.
[Do your parents/loved ones know you have this job?  What do they have to say about how you make money?  (I'm kinda jealous- I'm recently out of college and have HUGE bills to pay, sounds like you do decently well\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdr4sux?context=5)|Actually, my mom was a dancer for twenty years, and she is the one who got me started. My whole family is really supportive because it takes care of me and I enjoy it. :)
[Hey! im also interested in this sort of work. I feel like I'm decent looking enough. I just suck at dancing you have any tips?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdquyjb?context=5)|Don't judge your dancing style. The best thing to do, would be find a guy friend that you have a good relationship with, and ask him to give his opinion on your dancing.
 |Step two, go into a club for Amateur Night - almost every club has one.
 |Step three, find a club that you are comfortable with and get to know some of the girls - be careful who you trust, though - and ask them to teach you a few tricks. You'll learn faster this way.
 |**Always have a backup plan. ALWAYS.**
 |You do NOT want to end up without a fallback. If you need help with anything else, feel free to message me.
[Im a guy btw so dont know if i should be telling my guy friend if my booty looks good. but THANKS! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdradv0?context=5)|Then replace every gender stated with the opposite. :P 
[Alright lol. By amatuer night do you mean any one goes up or how does that work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdrao7a?context=5)|Usually clubs have one night a week where anyone (of gender for that type of club) can go onstage and do their thing. Usually, there is a cash prize and the amateurs keep all tips earned. 
[Ooooh thats sick then. And how did you apply did you just go to amatuer nights until they picked you up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdraumz?context=5)|I went in for amateur night to see if it was something I could do, then I spoke to the manager about a job. They contracted me immediately. 
[Are you ever attracted to any of the male clients?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqu3sk?context=5)|I'm not gonna lie, I've seen a few really attractive guys come in, but their personalities turn me off almost instantly.
 |To clarify; most of the attractive guys that come in are looking for girlfriends/fuck-buddies and that's what turns me off. (I.e., ""so, what are you doing when you're done here? Want to come to my place?"")
[Tentatively speaking, what are you looking for/wouldn't mind in the personalities of such attractive guys?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqwixq?context=5)|Go ahead and laugh at the innocence of this response,  but... I love it when a guy can make me genuinely laugh and smile until my cheeks hurt, hold an intelligent conversation, and above all, be respectful of me and considerate of their surroundings.
[The laughing part is easily handled but how do you expect to hold an intelligent conversation at a club when you're practically rubbing your boobs in my face? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdr4hrr?context=5)|Easy, - and that's the problem I run into a lot - I am just another human being. I have feelings and thoughts, and I bleed red, but some people don't seem to see me that way just because I'm dressed in a sexy outfit. I've had plenty of intelligent conversations at work, it just depends on if the customer is considerate or not.
[By considerate do you mean that most people are just cold and insensitive to you as a human being ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdr5fjf?context=5)|Precisely. People like our friend Chicago here, seem to think that because I show my tits, I am an insensitive and unfeeling creature and not a human being.
[There are more people like him? What assholes.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdr61px?context=5)|As long as there are people growing successful in the world, there will always be people like him.
[How many guys do you think are in love with you? What's the most expensive gift one of them gave to you/tried to give to you? Anyone ever propose?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdrir9d?context=5)|I have no idea how many, dozens have said they were.
 |And yes! A guy once proposed to me with a sapphire engagement ring. In front of the whole club. I told him no and he wasn't terribly upset, but he told me to keep the ring because it was a gift.
[Has Johnny Manziel ever been in your club. Is he a good tipper?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqvy2a?context=5)|No, I don't think so. Actually, I'm pretty sure he's not old enough to get in.
[He's definitely old enough to get in, but probably not a good tipper. I've met him. Dudes a major prick.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdr7m8h?context=5)|I met him on campus once last year and had no real opinion on him. Good to know he's not the sweet guy everyone thinks he is, though!
[How long do you plan on doing this? Are you going to school/do you plan on going to university in the future? Has a customer ever recognized you during your day-to-day life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqxtfc?context=5)|I already attend Texas A&amp;M University, and that is why I am working this job. As soon as school is done, so is this occupation. 
[What has been your favorite experience while dancing/stripping?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqv5z6?context=5)|Honestly, meeting my co-workers. I was home-schooled my whole life and I didn't really have the opportunity to make friends, and now I don't exactly have a lot of friends, but I have a few that mean the world to me. I wouldn't be moving forward if I hadn't met them.
[Is it true that some strippers willing to have sex with customer in the private room ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdrhau9?context=5)|It's pretty common and happens more than even I know, but I wish it wasn't. And when those men go to the doctor next, they will be, too.
[How commom or uncommon is that? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdrhau9?context=5)|It's those girls that make the rest of us look bad.
[Do you find that your boyfriend, or past boyfriends become jealous because of what you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdr9fwz?context=5)|Surprisingly, no. He is very understanding of my job, and he always says: ""It's just a job. I'm the one you come home to every night.""
[Do you think your education, high school, middle school life led to this sort of lifestyle?  In other words, do you think you were more susceptible to this type of lifestyle due to your past? For example, a bad breakup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqw7rf?context=5)|I don't think so. I mean, anything is possible, but I'm almost positive I still would have accepted this option, even if I hadn't had those experiences. 
[As you studies are in forensics. if you later in life get a job at a forensics lab or a simillar job that you have to testify in. do you fear that your stripper career can be used against in court to hurt your credebillity?  Sry if my english sucks not my native language.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdr5vr3?context=5)|Not at all! Actually, I think it would help my credibility; imagine a dancer gets molested or some such thing and I have to testify on the evidence found, I have that background to back any conclusions I come to.
[What are you studying in college? Also, when did you start doing this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdrbq01?context=5)|I'm studying Forensic Science at Texas A&amp;M.
 |I started dancing around the end of May.
[Freshmen right? Do you have a forensics lab over there? I've heard they even use triple integrals to find the volume of bullets.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdrc1ch?context=5)|Yes.
 |We do, but I won't use it until I'm a sophomore. 
[If you ever have a couple of hundreds don't hesitate to start a little business!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdrd8mo?context=5)|My mom actually used to have a little metaphysical shop called Baubles and Broomsticks that I plan on reopening someday 
[What kind of articles did she use to sell?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdrg7jy?context=5)|Fairies, dragons, incense, herbs, etc.
[Why are you working as an exotic dancer? Is it kind of a ""dreamjob"" or something like this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqv1am?context=5)|Not at all. I'm doing it because it not only pays my bills, but also pays for my college. It isn't something I intend to do my whole life.
[You said you earn between $50 to $500 a night.  Taking average  $300 / night and 22 days of work you earn $6600 per month or shall I say between 80K to 100K per year.  That's a lot of money and two years of work would be more than enough to pay hard cash for Texas A&amp;M engineering degree.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdr933g?context=5)|I said I can make anywhere from $50-$500 a night, yes, however as I have said, you never know who will walk in that door. Its always a hit or miss. Lately I've been walking out with maybe $80 and I haven't been able to work much as its almost end of semester. Also, its the holidays (boo). For other dancers, it depends on the girl. Some make what I make, some make less, and some make way more. I know girls that walk out at the end of the night with almost a thousand when everyone else made a hundred or so. To be honest, it has less to do with dancing experience and more to do with conversational skills. You could be the best dancer in the world, but if you couldn't send a seductive hello, you'd make nothing.

[Why not webcam instead?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdr0eiv?context=5)|I'm not THAT confident. When I'm onstage all the lights kinda make me zone out, and I can pretend I'm the only one there and no one can see me. On the internet, people could save that image - hell, my grandkids could see it.
[Why do they call it exotic dancing?  *erotic.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqw4vo?context=5)|I suppose because we are supposed to portray your most exotic fantasies.
[What's exotic about being a stripper?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdr2wq5?context=5)|Hell if I know, its just what my job is typically called. Maybe the pole tricks? 
[Under what circumstances will you allow the customer to fondle you breast?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdr02rv?context=5)|Possibly familiarity, but the no touching policy I have is because I want them to realize I'm not a five dollar hoe, with a $2.50 rebate. I'm a stripper, not a hooker.
[If the right guy came along do you think you would leave the club with a client despite having a boyfriend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdrldpb?context=5)|Absolutely not. That is my number one policy; I don't do extras and I don't do after-hours.
[Favorite music to dance to when you're by your self?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqwpb8?context=5)|Pretty much the same as when I'm working. I love various forms of rock and love dancing to Ricky Martin's ""She Bangs""!
[Ok as a guy who just turned 18 and has never been to a club before what would be proper etiquette I guess if that makes any sense? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cds1ysi?context=5)|Well, in Texas you can only get into nude clubs, which are BYOB.
 |Honestly, the biggest tip I have for you is to, well, *tip*. Dancers live off tips only and we don't get paid wages, so be courteous of them and toss 'em a dollar. Don't be afraid to approach the stage!
 |Other than that, find a girl you like, talk to her, and have fun. :)
[Does it offend you that people call the club ""The Dirty Sock""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdt4h5h?context=5)|Not really. I mean, it did at first, but I had several people clarify for me and now I understand how it got it's name: It's been sitting in the same place, like a dirty sock, since before I was even born! I think it's comical.
[Are you paying your way through college?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdr12cx?context=5)|Absolutely! It's the only reason I'm doing it.
[Would you say being a good dancer or having a understanding of male psychology is more important as a stripper?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdrmhy8?context=5)|A little bit of both, I suppose, but conversational skills are the most valuable. 
[What's the most surprising thing about your profession that most people don't know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdrmkel?context=5)|I think it would be age. Most customers don't realize how young some of us are.
[Hi! I'm a bit Late so I hope this you're still answering questions. I've been toying of the idea of taking my husband to a club. Both of us never been and don't know exactly how to act. Any tips? Guidelines? Also we preferred mixed drinks to beer, does that even make a difference? Thanks so much! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdrln0i?context=5)|My first tip would be to, well, *tip*. My second would be, if you tip a dancer onstage or buy a dance, ask her if it's alright to touch, because some of the girls are too bashful to say anything if it bothers them. Third tip, have fun and enjoy the view! And they also serve mixed drinks at topless clubs, but be warned: nude clubs are BYOB, for the most part.
[Hypothetically if you were guaranteed the same pay to work as a cashier at a grocery store would swap jobs? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdrlzg9?context=5)|Most likely, yes, if the same pay were guaranteed. 
[Do you think you would have chosen this line of work if your mom had not done it, or your family was not supportive?  It is pretty taboo... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdrb426?context=5)|To be honest, this is the first thing I've done that they have supported me in. I've always been a rebel, so I think I might have - just not as soon.
[Where do you work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cds0xso?context=5)|That's not information I'm willing to share here.
[I would just like to say I work at a all night dinner and  the job you do sounds about the same as mine but I don't get to pick the music. LoL ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdr5dsu?context=5)|And I do flips and spins on a pole until two in the morning. Haha, actually dancing is really similar to waitressing, but instead of drinks/food, you bring them company and conversation.
[Dont go into porn.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqw2qd?context=5)|Haha! Definitely didn't plan on it! 
[This AMA is seriously lacking nipples. Come on OP!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdrl8r2?context=5)|Right, because every girl wants a picture of her tits on some random jackass's desktop for Christmas. No, thank you.
[Well you posted here for attention so I'm sorry that I naturally thought you were an attention whore.  EDIT: I am fapping to you right now and you can't do anything about it!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdrm1yy?context=5)|You aren't one of the voices in my head, how do you know why I posted?

[Nobody talked you into doing anything. You're a whore. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqw1ns?context=5)|Thanks for your opinion. Which of my bills are you paying, again?

If you haven't done it would you be open to the idea? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqwuj3?context=5)|Well, I have to admit that I have no idea what that implies and entails, so I'd be open to the idea, but I don't do extras.
[You're pretty hot for a Redditor.  =\)  I dig the hair. When you settle on one cut/color, you'll dig it too.  So, are you originally from Texas, or did you move there for the whole ""no state income tax"" thing? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqx3jp?context=5)|Actually, I was born in Phoenix, Arizona, but traveled all over the country my whole life. I have, however, now officially spent half my life in Texas.

1rumem,2,2013-12-01,Advice on Job desicion!,glilify,UKJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKJobs/comments/1rumem/advice_on_job_desicion/,"OK, over the last week I have had 3 interviews for graduate positions, with one interview being for an 8 week internship. The other 2 interviews were for full time positions at interesting companies and I felt like they went really well, and I'm hoping to hear back good news about them, over the next couple of weeks. The problem comes in that I have been offered the internship, and I need to give them a response by tomorrow to start the following week. The internship would be a great opportunity for me to get some experience under my belt but I don't really think the job seems like a good fit for me and would require a roughly 1^1/2 hour commute each way, which is far from ideal.

So my basic problem that I'm hoping /r/ukjobs could help me answer is what would you do in my position? At the minute I'm thinking I'm just going to be honest and say that I'm waiting to hear back from other interviews, and will have to defer my decision, and hopefully they would understand. I know it would be unlikely that they would agree to this but its worth a shot I guess! Thanks!"
1rul67,121,2013-12-01,"[Build Complete] David, the Goliath Slayer",beefJeRKy-LB,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1rul67/build_complete_david_the_goliath_slayer/,"Hi everybody. I've been following this sub for the past 6 months or so, planning a build. When i discovered that I'd put my grad school plans on hold, I decided now was the time to use the money I made in my research internship last summer to get a new PC up and running.

Now, I live in Lebanon, and yes parts are expensive, but the bigger issue is more the lack of choice than anything. Cases are limited to older Cooler Master and Thermaltake parts. Motherboards are generally either MSI or Gigabyte, only in ATX. Really hard to find unlocked Intel CPUs and AMD is non-existent. You get the drill. So last time I built a PC (my first time actually), I managed to get a number of parts from Canada and got the rest from here. But this time, I just used Amazon mostly and a package forwarding service Borderlinx. The only exception is my PSU because I didn't want to ship anything that heavy and something local was good enough and my case which a friend added to his own Newegg order (no Paypal = no Newegg or other sites). Even with the relatively high price of shipping and customs on my parts (totaled about $300 for everything), I did save some money. The GTX780 is sold here at $850 equivalent for example.

The name of my PC is something of a recent habit of mine of naming PCs after biblical figures. First off, my previous build is being passed on to my brother temporarily before he builds his own and then will be relegated to the summer house. That PC was Goliath because it used an enormous Thermaltake Armor+ Super tower. It was only fitting to call mine David then.

Without further ado, specs:

Some notes about the build:


* Mini ITX is difficult to build in, but the result is marvelous.
* Core i7 + 16GB of memory because in addition to gaming, I will be doing some photo editing and CUDA programming
* If the Node had bad airflow, a Titan cooler would have made sense, but the Twin Frozr is a pretty good cooler for this one.
* Looked up the power supply and it lacks multi-input voltage (110-220V) and that's why it's not 80 Plus Bronze though it's within spec for efficiency
* The monitor I received about a month ago, and I highly recommend getting your own VESA mount because the flimsy plastic one it comes with is pretty shaky and annoying. Might eventually get another ~19"" 1440x900 IPS monitor to put in portrait
* I almost fucked up my BIOS but the clear CMOS button on the back of the mobo is an awesome tool.
* Couldn't hook up the fans to mobo because some didn't reach so I'm using the case fan controller and it's fine.
* Haven't overclocked yet, but intending to soon.
* Going to throw in a 4TB HDD by next week as well.
* Also wanna get a new keyboard and webcam.

1ruif4,4,2013-12-01,Am I [23 M] being too harsh [24 F] ?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ruif4/am_i_23_m_being_too_harsh_24_f/,"Last week around Monday I was feeling a little unsure about my upcoming final, so I told my girlfriend of 2 years I wouldn't be able to hang out at all during the week. I would be studying my ass off for a final on Saturday, and Monday I had a surgery for my deviated septum. She sounded very supportive and understanding. Tuesday I get a Beta invitation to a video-game over the weekend for a company I have applied for multiple internships and plan on working at once I finish my degree. I call my girl and tell her about it, but spin it to sound like it's a ""test run"" for an internship (she hates that I play video games at all. I did not want it to sound like I was just gonna play video games all weekend after not seeing her for a week). My girl remains understanding, sounds a  little bummed but everything is OK. I recognize how great she is being and plan on surprising her with a date to her favorite expensive restaurant after this all ends. Everyday during the week I call her and we talk at least an hour, something we haven't done since the beginning of our relationship since we see each other fairly often.

Here's where it gets interesting. It's Friday around noon and she calls me sounding sad. We talk for about 30 minutes and I'm like, ""Babe, I really need to get back to studying. Don't worry, I'll see you soon."" She won't let me hang up. Basically the we talk another 15 minutes about how much we miss each other, and finally I just end the call abruptly. It was rude, and I expected backlash, but I needed to get a good grade on my final.

Now at 10pm she calls again, this time in fucking tears. She's just bawling, and I'm trying to figure out whats going on, and basically she feels so lonely, she hates her life, she wants to come over, all that jazz. Why was she having a breakdown right then? She always had breakdowns right before I had some big thing going for me. I felt like she was trying to sabotage my final! I pretty much told her I needed to study and she should call a friend or something to deal with this. I get back to studying (seriously I studied like 12 hours straight that day) and go to bed. 

**EDIT:** *I can see this is pretty fucked up, self-centered, and makes me look like a huge asshole. There is a lot more to our history (infidelity, co-dependence, mental disorders, etc.) that lets me believe that my actions (although dickish and not cool 99% of the time) were warranted. OK, back to the story.*

Saturday morning comes and I'm on my way to my final! Yay! I get to knock this out, go home and Beta test my favorite game, and I'll smooth things out with my girl. Well, I hydroplane on the freeway and smash my car to bits. Luckily I was not hurt and no other vehicles were involved. I call the police, then my parents (I would have called my girl too, but phone was dying and I needed to call the essentials. Plus I didn't want her to worry), we get my car towed, dad drives me to school (had a paper to turn in) and my professor lets me retake the final 2 weeks from now.

So I get home and first thing I do is call her. Right when she answers I can tell she was pissed from last night. She has a very passive-agressive, monotone voice (the one that lets you know you're in trouble). That's okay, once she hears about my traumatic car crash I'm sure the compassion will flow out of her. 

It didn't, I get the same fucking passive-agressive tone, almost like ""that's what you get!""

**""Are you hurt?"" **

""No, not really. I mean I totaled my car, but I'm just a bit banged up.""

**""That's good...""** Then that waiting silence, like when you are waiting for someone to say something. 

But seriously, I was expecting at least SOME compassion. She's my girlfriend for fucks sake! When I told my friends they were like ""Holy Shit!!! Are you OK man?!?! How did it happen?"" 

So I just did the ""OK, well I guess I'm going to go"" thing, she responds ""bye"" (same tone and everything). 

The whole thing just put our relationship in perspective. She would rather be a vindictive little brat than a compassionate partner. Later we talk and I found out it was because, ""you weren't there for me when I needed you on Friday."" Okay, there's a fucking difference between her being sad and lonely since we didn't hang out all week, and me smashing my fucking car into a wall at 65mph. 

Later she tells me she couldn't be compassionate because she was out at the mall with her friend (some guy she used to fuck), but she wanted to come right over and take care of me. She cries and says if I wanted her to come over I should have asked her, yadda yadda yadaa. I feel like this was a dealbreaker for me. If someone I date can't get over their petty squabbles and care for me when I need it, then they aren't worth being with.

So I washed my hands clean of her. Haven't talked with her since last Sunday. Monday I had surgery, so I've been doped out on pain pills all week (probably why my writing is such shit. Sorry and thanks for getting this far). Am I overreacting to the situation? Writing it out kinda makes it look smaller than how it feels. I am still super angry about the whole situation, but I'm starting to wonder if this is just a fight couples go through. Your thoughts?
---

**tl;dr**: Friends show more compassion than girlfriend, who uses my car crash in a passive-aggressive manner to mirror how she felt when I didn't support her when she was sad. halp?"

The job listing seems to be a mass recruitment for several disciplines so they do not specify a lot on the skills/requirements or job description. Also I don't have any work experience besides an internship. Thanks in advance.

Letter:

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the &lt;Job Title&gt; position (Job Number &lt; &gt;) which was listed on the &lt;Company&gt; website career opportunities section on the &lt;Date&gt;. &lt;Company Abbreviated&gt; is of particular interest to me due to the opportunity to be involved with a company known for its wide range of businesses, offering world renowned engineering technologies and services. I believe my academic background, skills and experience make me well suited for this opportunity and will allow me to make an immediate and valuable contribution at &lt;Company&gt;.


I have completed both my Master’s and Bachelor’s degree in Chemical Engineering from the &lt;University&gt;, &lt;City&gt; with high academic achievements (M.Sc. GPA &lt;&gt;/4.0 and B.Sc. GPA &lt;&gt;/4.0). Throughout my academic studies, I was involved in traditional coursework and team-based projects covering Chemical Engineering topics with special focus on the Oil and Gas sector.


I have developed both my group oriented and communication skills thanks to the multicultural and diverse community at the &lt;University&gt;. I have consistently shown strong leadership when I was in charge of several projects. The largest team I was involved with consisted of seven members, including myself, for a project that spanned over one year in which my team was able to score the highest grades among the class. For this project I was responsible to oversee the work of my colleagues, assign work according to their strengths, schedule regular meeting sessions to ensure deadlines were met and to address any issues which came up. Furthermore during my Master’s, I was able to carry out independent research work, learn to operate and maintain different equipment, and collaborate with different research groups on their work.


Based on my knowledge and skills I am enthusiastic about this opportunity and I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your time and serious consideration.


Sincerely,

I studied computer science, and most classes involved exercises of some kind (programming, math problems, etc.). After I had completed a problem or taken an exam, it felt very good to have accomplished something.

After my graduation, I'm now doing my PhD and I find difficult to find the same incentives for work. I now need to work fixed hours and have to do more exploratory work - i.e., think more creatively, pursue several potential research directions and decide which are going to be useful. I've also done internships in software engineering, and felt pretty much the same way about work.

How do you motivate yourself for a job that is not based on specific goals and concrete problems to solve?"
1rtyg4,4,2013-12-01,"[FR] My 2nd time in the club (20 yrs. old, after practicing day game)",GrayFoxHops,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1rtyg4/fr_my_2nd_time_in_the_club_20_yrs_old_after/,"Please feel free to give feedback and question any of my logic. This post in mainly for me to think through things and provide an example of relative success to struggling deltas.

**Backstory**

This is my first time posting in a while... I have been working in the field a lot. I got my first K-close at a party a few months ago, which I was glad to get out of the way.

About a year ago I was completely fucked up in terms of social/life skills. I was determined to *not* want to execute myself, so I started talking to people in elevators and in lines to work towards fixing my personality. I let myself have anxiety attacks while talking to beautiful women until it was habitual to talk to beautiful women. I started getting phone numbers like crazy by approaching on the lakefront, at coffee shops, and on the train.

Then I realized that none of the girls that I got the number of wanted to see me again. I still don't know exactly where the hole in my day game is, and the problem is unresolved.

Regardless, learning pickup has taught me the social skills that I needed to keep my shit together in everyday life and secure an internship. So kudos to the PUA community.

**Field report**

My 21st birthday is in a couple of days, so I am starting to think about applying game to actual clubs rather than day game. I went to a popular club 2 nights ago masquerading as an assistant to my friend who is a photographer, which made opening the easiest thing in the world (it also got me in without ID). After we had taken pictures of/with some girls, I put down my gear and approached two extremely attractive women in the mid-twenties who we had gotten a pic of earlier. They were nice to me, but started to dance together away from me after I had done some dancing/spins with them and talked a bit. We exchanged names. Let's call them blonde and brunette. Whenever around blonde for the rest of this FR, note that I had my hand on her back whenever I was talking to her, and had a good kino vibe going.

Later, I ran into them again and made sure the one that I liked, blonde, remembered my name. This time, she was more receptive and we hugged upon greeting. I tried to kiss her cheek but she turned and I kissed her hair.

We then met a DJ, and he said he was going to find his girls to take a picture with (at this point we were taking photos again). He was unable to find them.

A third time, I ran into blonde again (note: I was approaching other girls the whole time, not just focusing on the one. This one is the only one that interested me a lot though). I expressed interest in hanging out with her, and she invited me to come along with her and brunette. Blonde held brunette's purse while brunette used the restroom. I asked her about her profession, and she was a promoter for the club. Then she told me to wait right where I was while she followed brunette somewhere for a minute. My photographer friend was also headed that way, so I followed even though she told me to wait. It turns out that blonde and brunette were there as the DJ's girls. It made sense since they were the two hottest girls in the club besides the bartenders. Upon learning this, I lost all interest in blonde. Something about the fact that she was there for the DJ really turned me off, but I kept kinoing when I talked to her anyway. I asked for her last name as I held her hand up in mine, said I'd add her on Facebook, and walked away. The DJ laughed at the spectacle. Later, after Facebooking/googling, it would turn out that the last name she had given me was fake, but I didn't stay around long enough for her to tell me it was a joke/get her to not lie to me/actually want to see me again. The problem here is that I had come to view phone numbers as being completely useless because girls never text back to me or they just have excuses. The take-away: **get the number, even if you recognize that it doesn't guarantee anything.** The number is essentially meaningless, but you should still get it if you want any hope of seeing a girl again. Trying to add her on Facebook without actually pulling up the Facebook app then and there on my phone was stupid. I was also *too* willing to walk away. In the end, she didn't really like me that much and my game wasn't 100%, but I did everything that I meant to and I feel good about my performance. In comparison to my first time going to the club (awkward dancing and zero approaches), I did a pretty good job.

*end of main story*

- Before going out, I challenged myself to kiss 3 girls on the cheek and 1 on the mouth. I ended up kissing 4 different girls on the cheek (mixed in as part of conversation or a greeting) but that's still a sort of record for me and more than I would have ever been able to do a year ago. With every girl that I talked to, I was able to get my hands on her while seeming natural. Even though I didn't f-close or anything, I felt accomplished at the end of the night because I had zero AA and expressed what I felt without being stifled by insecurity. Even when girls reacted negatively in any way, I didn't care, but there wasn't a lot of that. I ended up with 2 different professional quality pictures of me with an attractive woman, both of which were ones that the given woman had suggested taking. One of those women also wanted me to send her the picture, so I got her number and we have been in contact over text.

- *Anecdotal Story*
While standing with a friend at the club (who I haven't mentioned thus far), a girl took his LED foam glow stick thing. He let her. I stopped her and told her not to steal, and that she had to give it back. She tried to BS me but I wouldn't let her. She turned around and begged my friend to keep it, and he agreed. She asked me why I was being mean to her about it, and I told her because ""I'm an asshole."" I told her, ""he is way nicer than me, talk to him."" She turned around and shook his hand, but then immediately her attention snapped back to me. I teased her about how I didn't think she deserved her magic wand (the LED thing). She ended up kissing me on the cheek and telling me that I am awesome, yet the entire time I was just trying to act like a dick in order to entertain myself, while my friend tried to please her. I understand the underlying psychology behind this, but this kind of thing has made it hard for me to trust or respect women. Take-away: **women like assholes more than they like guys who are pushovers.**

**TL;DR**
No matter how bad you are, even if you have ""social anxiety disorder,"" you can make progress towards good game. Pickup has given me foundational functioning skills that have allowed me to become more successful in every aspect of my life.

Right now I am struggling with confusion about why girls that I approach from day game, 9 times out of 10, won't want to reply or hang out at all. Applying my skills at the club has been much more fun and rewarding, not to mention with hotter girls, but I still want to know how to fix my day game. I don't think I want to be with a girl that I found at the club. Generally, I don't kino during day game because I would be on the train. An average interaction lasts about 4 minutes, and I usually stop talking to a girl if she starts to get suspicious of me in any way because I don't want to deal with trying to justify to her why it is totally fine that I am talking to her.

Again, feel free to criticize or question any of my statements in regard to

- my day game
- my club game

or provide general feedback. This post is meant to be a think-tank.

Thanks in advance."

Close to completing my degree in appropriate IT field

3 years experience in helpdesk for a very large company

A+ Net+ Sec+ Server+ certs, studying for Microsoft Certs pertaining to Win7 (70-680 and 70-685 to become MCSA:Windows 7) and Server 2012 (70-410, 70-411, 70-412 to become MCSA:Windows Server 2012)


Hardworking, motivated, very passionate. I am very customer service orientated as well which helps me to be patient, diligent, and understanding. I'm the guy who will bother to ask questions and find out answers but knows to at least take the time to google something or ask a peer before opening my mouth every five seconds. Not afraid to raise my hand but smart enough to know how to at least answer the silly questions to myself. I can work independently or as part of a team with no issues. I function well both in a micromanaged position and in ad-hoc scenarios (I'd love to elaborate on this if given the chance). I have a home lab to use so I can study for my certs and apply the knowledge I'm learning. I don't want to be just a 'Paper MCSA' or 'Paper CCNA'. It's EOL cisco routers/switches and Server 2012 on my desktop PC. Fun stuff, makes me very excited.

I can commute! I'd love an opportunity be it part-time, full-time, or internship. I am currently employed full-time. 

I am local to New Haven / Fairfield counties but am also pretty close to the Waterbury/Hartford area as well. Commuting isn't a problem for me. I've been talking to two recruiting agencies who seem to be taking their sweet time in placing me in a job because ""I'm employed already"" so I'm apparently not a priority. Using reddit amongst other websites and job hunting tactics to widen my search.

Thank you for your time. I'd happily submit a cover letter, resume, references, LinkedIn profile, etc. I will pass a drug test and background check tomorrow if need be. 

I love my bosses and current company culture but the daily work is absolutely dreadful and I'm done being cussed out by clients/customers on a daily basis because of poor infrastructure. Looking for something that is a bit more friendly to it's employees on a daily basis. I'm great being customer-facing if that's the case but I would love to work internally given the chance. 

Edit: update 12/30: Still searching for new employment opportunities. Thank you to those who have contacted me on here!"

However I wish to be an SDE. Since I have a large educational loan to clear and support my family, I have decided to graduate and work. I couldnt get much interviews due to time constraints in searching for the job. The SDET role is an average paying job of ($105k) in the bay area in a reputed company.

1. How does it affect my career as an SDE?
2. When should I change positions and what are the strategies I must pursue.
3. How to prepare for the change?

EDIT:

I have come out here as being as not open minded. But I have to make that correction. I have been an intern at this very same position and I enjoyed it a LOT. It was fun every day once the work started it did challenge me. My team is very cooperative and I got along very well with everyone. In fact every one was happy with my job and asked me to join back (and ofc I know that there was a requirement too). I donot hold any sense of superiority, and infact I am humbled by my mentors who have over a decade of industry experience. My Job is 60% coding with 10%of manual testing and the rest spent in meetings.

I do want to try SDET position and really give it a shot. But how much of it will affect my ability to switch to a SDE/Dev position is my main concern. Whats the sweet spot (1yrs? 2yrs? 4? ). I may be over exaggerating my concerns.

Also How is my base salary level ($105k) comparable for the bay area ? I have no full time experience. However my profile is above average, but not exceptional.

Thanks."

I also don't know what to do this summer. At this point, I don't have any experience in the real world and I don't think I will be able to get an internship because I don't have any professors I can ask for recommendations (all my classes are large and I'm very shy). Any suggestions?

Original Post:
""I've burned out early this semester which sucks because I have 4 exams and 2 projects in the two weeks to study for and I'm rethinking my motives for wanting to major in Computer Science or a different type of engineering because I am just being way too hard on myself (I'm in community college hoping to transfer somewhere besides my local state school so I can't just be content with passing classes with a C).
On one hand the math gets interesting once I've put in the time to understand how everything works, but I don't see any real benefit of making myself take all of these hard classes. I don't even want to be an engineer, I'm just terrified of not having a good job to out of school since I've lived my entire life in low-income family (when you live with money problems for as long as I have, soon its the only thing you can think about when it comes to something like this)
I started the CS major because I really liked The Social Network and bought into the glamor of the tech internet startup space but there have been many times this semester where I have been miserable playing catch up with the rest of the class. I do have fun programming sometimes, but it's so hard to get started because of the whole ADHD/procrastination thing and it's not really something I dedicate a lot of time to get better with on my own
If I had to pick a major for fun it would probably be industrial design with a minor in accounting (or vice versa) since those are skills that would help me pursue my interests (starting a business, designing products and user interfaces, etc. etc.), but I also am too proud to think that I don't have what it takes to be an engineering/CS student. I've always been a visual person anyways (been drawing since I was a youngin) but to me there's no point going to college if I'm not going to be a doctor or engineer
This may not be ADHD-relevant per se but I've seen some horror stories posted on here about people who are in college for six years not close to graduating and switched their major X amount of times- or dropping out altogether -and I just don't want to be in that position""


my response was:
I am studying Product design, which is essentially interchangeable with Industrial design, and minoring in Business. I have to say I think it is the perfect combination for me, but there are often times I wish I had something more engineering focused, like mechanical engineering, but then I wonder if I would have been able to keep up with the rigorous math courses, because that has always been a problem for me. That's why I think design is great, because you get to build and create things, but you don't need to take as many math classes in school. In the real world, it will really come down to who you network with, and if you can convince a company that you are the man for the job, it becomes less important what you actually studied in school, as long as you can prove you can do the job they need you to do. I know many people who have studied things like architecture, but ended up getting an (slightly better paying) IT job, that would normally be a position for someone who had studied CS. I would worry less about the title of your degree and more about the knowledge you amass, and how you can prove this knowledge to future employers. try to network and make as many connections as you can with people in powerful positions, and you will be able to get a job where you won't have to stress out about money all the time.  if you want to get into design, use your computer skills to learn how to use programs like the Adobe Suite (photoshop, illustrator indesign), CAD software like Solidworks, AutoCAD, Rhino. if you learn how to use those, and create a portfolio of good work, you could easily get a good internship an a design company, or a design internship at a manufacturing company, and these internships are your key to a job in the industry, and they will like seeing someone who is that good at something they didn't even major in because you now know more about CS than other strictly design applicants, which can be useful.
Good luck, and do what you enjoy!

It was quite lovely. My n-mom and devil's-helper dad were nice and calm and my n-mom even teared up when I left. That is probably because I hadn't seen her for so long and I was only there for about 2-3 days.

Now I'm home for thanksgiving break for about a week and my N-Mom's comments are coming out of nowhere. It has been two days and she has already:

- criticized my choice of moving away for college instead of attending the university in my hometown (said I would regret it and I have to live with the bad consequences of taking out loans)

- said she didn't think I was thankful to her for the times she saved up for my Florida Prepaid College Plan (emphasized how she had struggled but always paid the plan through the years like she was a victim in all of this)

- said she does not choose to help me through college to teach me a lesson about responsibility (I don't have a car, work, have an internship, pay for my room and board, food, textbooks, and have a superb GPA) 

- then claimed that she could not possibly help me at all financially (she takes international trips every year to her country of choice and bought 3 used cars in the past three years)

- when I put on make-up she made a comment that I look tired

- I was on the computer in the living on a couch next to my mom for about 2 hours and she gave me evil glares until she began criticizing how much time she thinks I spend on the computer and asked me if I spend all day on facebook at school. She didn't stop until I shut it off.

- Before we ate dinner, my dad said the customary, always-the-same prayer and my brother didn't participate and began eating (he is atheist). When my dad finished she said ""AMEN!"" loudly and stared at him.

- At dinner, my mom made a comment that she didn't realize sounded humorous so my brother and I began laughing and she got angry and left the dinner table. She claimed we always laughed at her and not her comment. 

- 
This is only the beginning I presume.

[Hi Alex, I just wanna say thanks so much for doing an AMA! What was it like to see some of your productions become big?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rxnqp/i_am_alex_da_kid_multi_grammy_award_winning/cdryc6t?context=5)|Well I'm dead inside so it didn't really affect me. lo. lo is the new laugh out loud. I'm laughing out. just not loudly.
[How did you get the attention of Eminem and Dr. Dre?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rxnqp/i_am_alex_da_kid_multi_grammy_award_winning/cdrxfdn?context=5)|A guy called Riggs who works for Eminem heard my music and played it to Marshall, then Marshall heard Airplanes and showed it to Dre. 
[Hey Alex,  Thanks for your time today. I have a question on how you select layers to develop sounds - is the final sound of your mix almost exactly what you came up with in your head before creating in the studio of how you wanted the song/instrument to sound, or is it developed in trying different samples and seeing what fits during the creation process? How much of it is your say vs. the band/artist?  Also, how long did it take for you to become comfortable, confident and satisfied with your mixes?  Love your work, keep doing your thing. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rxnqp/i_am_alex_da_kid_multi_grammy_award_winning/cdrxcda?context=5)|It's definitely trial and error 90% of the time. When you're in the creative part of writing, I try different things and some make sense and some don't.  My mixes, it took me around three and half four years. 
[ off, huge fan Alex. How did ""Wicked Ways"" come about on the new Eminem CD?  I heard you made it on your mother's couch, true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rxnqp/i_am_alex_da_kid_multi_grammy_award_winning/cdrxko0?context=5)|I did that like, three years ago. Um, It was just a track and a hook, I gave it to marshall and he wrote verses. No, it wasn't written on my mother's couch. I can't even remember where I made it.

I make a track which can take two or three days, then we write to vox which can take a day to a year and then we record which will take a couple days. and then we take it to Manny Maraquin to do his mix magic (SHOUT OUT TO MANNY!) which takes a couple of days.

[Would you ever consider releasing stems of your mixes? or, better than stems, full PT files for prospective producers and engineers to see your process and get a little insight. I'd absolutely love to see how you created your drums on the Imagine Dragons stuff, they're huge. Assuming you own the rights to the songs, since it's your label, is that something you'd be interested in sharing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rxnqp/i_am_alex_da_kid_multi_grammy_award_winning/cdrxs0w?context=5)|HELL NO.

1rxynu,1,2013-12-02,How to get started in the CS field?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1rxynu/how_to_get_started_in_the_cs_field/,"I am 22 and 4th year sophmore at a pretty good public university. It is one of the top 10 CS schools in the Southeast I believe and is located in a major city. I have been undeclared up till this point, but I am at a point where I NEED to pick a major and start taking core classes. 

I am wondering if a career in CS is right for me. I have been browsing job listings over the last year trying to find a career path that interests me and I have found I am most interested in software development, web development, and app development jobs. The office environments seem pretty cool, I think I could be good at it, and the pay is attractive, plus there seems to be no shortage of jobs available (PS, am I right about all this?) 

I am an average programmer. I understand the concepts but I have a lot of learning to do. I don't think I could code anything from scratch at the moment. I took a java class in high school, and I did really well in Intro to Comp Sci last semster (Python with robots), and I've made a couple basic websites for myself, but that's the extent of my experience. If I were to pursue a degree in CS (it may take me about 2 years to finish), realistically how soon could I start working in the field? What positions would be available to me, and how could I pursue them? Would I be able to find an internship within the next year?
 
Please be as thorough as you can, and if you know of any books, article, etc that may be helpful to me please post a link. Thanks!"
1rxyjs,7,2013-12-02,I lose in the end. The clock is ticking and the inevitable will be staring me in the face. That's life.,GabrielGray,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1rxyjs/i_lose_in_the_end_the_clock_is_ticking_and_the/,"I feel like i've already lost. All my friends are getting job offers, getting into long term relationships, laughing, talking, making the smart financial decisions and generally being who they should be. 

But i'm not. I don't know how I got here. I sit in class and wonder why i'm even here. I'm an idiot, and pretending to think that i'll measure up to any of the other people in my major when it comes to grades or job searching is a fucking joke. I look around campus and all I see are these well adjusted individuals that can balance work, school, relationships and still get amazing internships and job offers. 

What am I even doing? I don't have a boyfriend (I'm gay btw) and I wouldn't even know how to begin to start dating. It's just meaningless sex and I probably have HIV anyway so I don't see why I even make future plans. I do bad in my classes and when I get my exams all I do is question why i'm even here because it doesn't matter. 

I'm my family's only hope to getting out of the ghetto but i'm such a goddamn failure and they have no idea. My sister's degree is useless, my mom strains herself so much to take care of us. And for what? To have a gay, depressed failure of a son that will do nothing but be a financial drain until she can't work anymore? Why?

I don't get it. I didn't ASK to be born so why is this happening? I feel like I am my own worst enemy and I don't see how humanity even evolved to have this kind of capacity for self-hatred and self-sabotage. It's maladaptive. I'm maladaptive. I feel like i'm here just watching the world pass me by and sinking a little more every single day. 

I'll never be like them. I feel like my family is going to starve and all i've had to show for it how ""bad"" I felt about myself so I never accomplished anything. Graduation is right around the corner and the futility of job searching will begin. I'm a fraud and any job I get through a miracle will know soon enough. "

I don't know if its the same for other schools, but basically 7-8 companies come together and ""donate"" problems for a team of undergrads to solve.

Why I want to take it: I don't have any internship experience. I was pretty sure I wanted to get a masters, and wasn't confident in my abilities to get an internship.

Why I don't want to take it: It's a pretty big time commitment, and I still have four more CS classes to take, two per quarter. Two tough courses, a GE, and a project course seems a little overwhelming, especially as I continue my job search, and interview prep.

Any advice?"
1rxpep,2,2013-12-02,To include ACT score or not?,Skoodilypoop,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1rxpep/to_include_act_score_or_not/,"I'm a junior in college studying CS and Statistics and I'm applying for an internship this summer at a company that makes supercomputers. I'm wondering if I should include my ACT score (I got a 33, which puts me in the top 1% of test takers and top 10% of my university). Some people have told me to include it because it is fairly strong, and if I don't include it, the people looking at the resume will assume I did poorly (the same way recruiters get suspicious of resumes without a GPA noted). Other people tell me that while the score is okay, there are lots of smart people in the company, so it'll just look like I'm bragging about something that isn't that noteworthy."

My background; I'm at a top-10 university in my program, I have a 3.3 GPA and 8 months of internship/co-op experience. I have an interest in controls engineering, but as I apply to jobs, I am not discriminating the type of work I apply for.

That said, I also have an interest in developing keen programming skills. I am considering applying to a computer science program in the area near where my parents live, in the hopes that I can get another B.S. while living at home and working as an engineering intern or something part time. Ideally it would take no more than 3-4 semesters, if transfer credits and all that jazz works out.

What would be the career benefits of holding two B.S. degrees, one in MechE, and one in C.S.? Can anyone offer insight into a specific field or job that would utilize both skill sets? I am also curious about details like salary, career trajectory, etc.

I greatly appreciate any advice, anecdotal information, or opinions. Thanks! "

I am posting this question today because I have a ton of questions and this is the one most pressing.

Without going into any details my academic record is not amazing and I took a leave of absence for a year to figure some things out. I made the decision to continue with medicine and am glad for it. I have only recently restarted rotations again as of last month. I need to complete only 4 months worth of rotations and 6 of those weeks are surgery rotations (and I have no plans on entering that field). Currently, I would like to graduate at the end of May. I am eager to move on to the next step which is internship but I honestly do not know if my skills are up to par because of the time off. Also, there is no way for me to be sure I will be up for the challenge of internship year by the end of May.

I am nervous, as I am sure many other fourth years are, but I do not want to wait until I begin working at the hospital and clinic to see that my skills are weaker than my colleagues. It is because of this that I am seeking out advice on a transitional year internship where I may have the chance to be in a hospital environment and sharpen my abilities and gain the confidence I need.

If anyone can provide their thoughts and websites I should check that would be great. I also am not sure how to even sign up for a transitional year. Also, if you have any ideas that you think may be worth considering I am definitely interested.

Thank you."

I am 21 years old and have been working as an intern for a company for the past 2 and a half years.  Since then, I've had a 401k started through the company.  I've included some stats about my account below.


Current Balance of Fidelity Account : $4000


Percent of Paycheck Going into Fidelity Account : 15%


Right now i'm on the ""BTC LIFEPATH 2055 Q"" plan.  This plans seems to have : 
    - 60% domestic stock
    - 25% foreign stock
    - 15% bonds
    - 0% short term

All of these values can be changed.  My current plan is labeled as 4/5 of the high risk scale.

I just want to make sure that I'm investing my money the right way and that i'm making the most bang for my buck.

Feel free to ask any more questions you have.  Thanks in advance!"

I googled around and found the average salary for a similar position was 90k-110k from Indeed.com and Glassdoor.com 

They offered me 85k base with a $8,500 bonus which he said is ""basically guaranteed."" So who knows what the bonus actually will be. I'm waiting on the written offer but assume health care and benefits will be among the offer.

Some of the qualifications:

* Formal Education: BS in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering or equivalent experience 

* 3+ yrs experience in software development technologies, design patterns, application development and full-life cycles. 

About me: Just graduating school with Computer engineering degree with 3+ years experience developing in Android. I have had 3 software engineering internships so I have prior work experience on top of the education.

All things considered is around 85k a competitive offer for a software engineering in NYC?"

I'm an Illinois Resident transfer student who was admitted to UIUC's CS program for Spring 2014. I've also been accepted to UIC's program and I wanted to get your opinion on weather's UIUC is worth the extra ~20k I'd pay in housing/food/driving over 2 years.

I would basically be paying no commuting costs for UIC because I am in a unique situation where my dad works downtown and I could drive with him everyday and live at home.
I know the top companies recruit from UIUC and UIUC's program is ranked 5th in the country whereas UIC is 57, but I've heard from other that where you went to school doesn't matter after you 1st or 2nd job. Also based on UIC's COE career fare page it seems like Microsoft, Motorola, etc also recruit from UIC, but no Google/Apple like UIUC for internships.

Can any Target School CS students and alumni advise me on if it was worth the extra money going to a top school or if I should just go to UIC and save the extra money (how have you seen the unknown school CS alumni fare in the career world compared to yourself and other top school alumni?).

When you guys were doing your internships, did you see many no-name CS students as well?

Thanks guys!"

I see a lot of companies have started to open up their applications, but pretty much none of them list any deadlines to apply anywhere. 

I would go ahead and apply now, but I'm always working on personal projects/open-source contributions to better my portfolio, and over winter break I plan to spend a lot of time working on bigger projects that would really be beneficial to showcasing my skills. So the question is what is the usual deadline for internship applications? I know it's different for each company, but if there's a general consensus I could get a good idea. If it's the end of the year I might as well submit now, but if they're going to be open till February/March, I could spend all that time working on things, which would defintely help strengthen my applications. 

Some example applications with no deadlines so you can see what I mean:

1rwk1c,2,2013-12-02,I had an affair and I was the other guy. I'm trying my best to end it.,Affairmanmanman,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1rwk1c/i_had_an_affair_and_i_was_the_other_guy_im_trying/,"We went to school together and became fast friends.  I knew immediately I was going to fall in love with her but I couldn't stop it.  

Her husband makes a lot of money and provides her with a comfortable life, although she's young and driven to succeed.  Over the summer, she had very little work to do while I had a steady job.  We would meet during my lunch hour.  

After the summer, I quit my salary job for various reasons.  Now I'm unemployed and looking for something, while she is a highly paid intern at a reputable company and a graduate student.  So who has more time on their hands has completely flipped.  

We decided about a month ago that we can't continue anymore.  We've been trying to be friends.  But it's just extremely difficult to have that work.  

There was talk about her leaving her husband but it just wouldn't work right now, financially.  I don't have a place of my own at the moment and going through a divorce isn't going to help her through graduate school or her 30 hour a week job.  

We have some mutual friends that we like to hang out with on occasion and group text.  I told her again for the second time not to talk to me anymore.  (The last time I cracked and unblocked her on chat--then she proceeded to message me.)  

She is upset.  She feels as if she is doing everything that she can to keep me in her life without crossing boundaries anymore, both talking wise and physically.  We've been leaning on each other as every day talk buddies and more for about 6 months.  I know she counts on that and I hate to take that away from her.  I know it's devastating to her to lose me.  But I know that I can't be her friend right now.  I have to cut her off for a while.  The friend thing just isn't working out yet.  

There is more.  Most of her family is involved in medicine, and I don't think I'd be acceptable to her family.  I think that is a large part of it.  She used to say that she loves us both, but that we connected on a level that she didn't think was possible before she met me.  

Anyway, it's over for now.  I know it's killing her because she is waiting for me to get my financial situation together before she makes a decision about leaving her husband.  She can't come over to my place right now, and I obviously can't come over to hers.  We've never been to a hotel room or anything because that just seems like a completely different level of wrong.  I haven't ever given her an ultimatum because I don't think it's fair at all to choose at this point.  She wants to keep me in her life for support and friendship and to see if I develop.  But I can't keep my feelings in check.  And I constantly drag her into conversations that wear both of us down.  I know the best move right now is to cut off all contact.  I might even move away, soon, for a job.  

Maybe I can get over this and we can be friends sometime.  Or maybe she'll want to be with me sometime and she will reach out to me.  Either way, I have to do this right now--but it hurts."

The only reason I can think of is that everyone that know me in real life doesn't really know me. I want someone to know the real me just in case that voice cant convince me one of these days.

I was raised in a small, extremely conservative rural town (less than 2000 residents). The nearest Wal-Mart was a 45 minute drive, and if you wanted to go the movies theater you had to be up at 7am to make it there and back before 7pm. This was the type of small town where opportunities were based on the importance of your last name. If your weren't Catholic or your last name wasn't seen on at least 5 gravestones in the Catholic cemetery, you weren't really part of the community. It took me a while but by high school, I had been more or less accepted by the kids who had roots in the town, in particular a pair of individuals that I will call David and Kate. David's family had a hand in almost every part of the town; his father was on the school board and his mother was a secretary for one of the town's few major businesses. His family is very large and very Catholic. David lived to excel, he served in various roles within the church and was known an loved by almost everyone that he deemed worth knowing and is very handsome. Kate's is a similar story except she rejected the whole ""I'm -----'s- daughter, treat me special"" idealism that is the town's life blood. She and I were a lot more close than David was to either of us. Then there was me. I was always interested in things that were seen as ""stupid"", ""gay"", or ""pointless"" by my friends. Things like video games, reading books for pleasure, asking questions about things that contradict certain beliefs; all of these things were considered social suicide. Because of this, as time went on I developed two persona's, there was the me that enjoyed big trucks, Sunday mass, drinking copious amounts of shitty beer in some pasture that David's uncle owned, football and all of those types of things. Then there is the me that played MMOs, read Terry Brooks novels and wanted to know why Jesus seemed to have no problem helping Tim Tebow win a football game but had a bit of difficulty with the whole Africa situation. My family, friends, hell even my coworkers only know that first me.

When we graduated high school David went to the state's big conservative university while Kate went to the more liberal university of the state. Both of them received enough scholarships from an agricultural program in our school to go to college two times over. All three of us were leaders in this program and were heavily involved throughout high school. We all applied for the same scholarships with the assistance of the teacher that was head of the program and had similar GPAs, however unlike them, my parents were not able to pour large sums of cash into the program . I was not awarded any scholarships. Because of this I find my self at a second tier satellite school seven hours from ""home"". 

I spent my first semester of college in a deep state of depression. I was living in a huge, strange city surrounded by more people than I'd ever seen in my life. I knew absolutely no one, and my roommate didn't seem like the type of guy my first persona would associate with. I spent most of my free time locked in my room playing video games and the rest of it sitting in the back of a classroom alone trying to figure out what the professor was talking about. I didn't get to see David and Kate as often as we had hoped when we all went off to school, but we still kept in regular contact and would coordinate our weekends home to hang out with each other.By the end of the semester I was 10k in debt and had no grades to show for it. I took responsibility for my failure and managed to get straight A's the next semester and have done pretty decent since then. However that by failing those classes in my first semester I pushed my graduation date back by a year. 

Over the last three years Kate and I have developed a sort of dysfunctional relationship. When she is sober we are just friends, that go to parties and social functions together and I would be perfectly fine with this if that was all it consisted of. However, she has developed a drinking problem since entering college. When she drinks she says romantic things to me that she never says when she is sober. A typical night involves showing up to a gathering and socializing for about an hour before I realize i don't see her anywhere and go searching. Usually i find her either passed out, throwing up, or surrounded by several guys looking for an easy catch. Each time this happens I have to remove her from the situation and take care of the after math. Keep in mind that we only see each other maybe one weekend a month, so I'm sure during the other three weekends there are things happening, but I'd rather not know about them. She is graduating this week and informed me over Thanksgiving break that she is moving to Los Angels to pursue a job at a social media company after Christmas. I fear for her, and its really hurting me in a way I've never felt before, but there is nothing I can do to stop it.

I had a realization back in August and since then I have begun caring less and less about life as a whole. By the time I am done with school next year I'll be 60 thousand dollars in debt and entering a job full time (currently I am only an intern) where for nine hours a days a week I will sit in a vanilla office building with a bunch of people who are just as miserable as myself, plucking away at a keyboard so that I can help maintain some CEO's standard of life. I will do this for around 30 or 40 years, retire, and spend the rest of my days as a middle class retiree whose name will be forgotten in just a few generations. And thats assuming I am continually employed and the government doesn't self destruct before then. Its an unimportant, meaningless existence and I just feel so insignificant in comparison to the rest of reality. I'm in my fourth year of college and find lacking friends, motivation and an excuse to wake up in the morning. I know the same amount of people at my university as I did the day I walked on to campus, and this semester I've sank back into my old habits. I find myself sleeping 12-15 hours a day, only getting up to go and sit in class and pretend like I'm paying attention. I go to the library almost every day to catch up on work I know I need to do, only to leave after 20 minutes of looking at Facebook on my phone and wondering how everyone can smile so much. I spend every waking hour hating myself and wishing I could just close my eyes and let go. The real kicker is that everyone that people usually go to to talk about these things has no idea I'm even capable of thinking this way.

I told David some of this over Thanksgiving break and his only advice was to stop being a selfish asshole and put my faith in God. 

Thats when the other half of my brain kicks in and I think about the millions of people all over the world that are dying of starvation, or being bombed because some fucker needs to fill his SUV up and drive his five kids to soccer practice, or the people being put into forced labor camps in North Korea, or those four people that died on their commute home today in New York. I think to myself, ""What the fuck are you complaining for you spoiled fucking bastard?"" 

All of these things are happening and all the rest of the world can focus on is whatever bullshit headline the media machine can churn out for the day. I am powerless to do anything about these things, but hey at least I can help Frank in Engineering find a purchase order for some flanges that were supposed to be at the job site three weeks ago but got delayed because the biggest typhoon on record stalled the shipment in the Philippines until January, so there is that.

I doubt anyone has made it this far. If you did I thank you, and truly hope you are one of those people who still has the ability to smile."

1rwetz,4,2013-12-02,Choosing Audit Internship between EY/KPMG/Deloitte,njriot,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1rwetz/choosing_audit_internship_between_eykpmgdeloitte/,"So I have a bit of a dilemma in that I really can't pick what firm to intern with, and I was hoping some people here with experience can shed some light.  All 3 offers are for audit in New York, NY, and I've chosen the metro/commercial side of audit over FS. I'm between EY, KPMG, and Deloitte for now.  I've somewhat ruled out Deloitte, simply because during the internship process they did not really give us a big opportunity to learn about the firm and meet people that work with the firm, so I'm not very familiar with Deloitte.  

Between EY and KPMG, I'm somewhat stuck.  The impression I've gotten from KPMG is that the people seem very laid back and pretty fun, but they sort of seem like the younger brother of the Big 4 that doesn't get taken as seriously or get respect.  I'm also a bit worried that the impression of ""fun"" and ""laid-back"" was just a result of them trying to market themselves as the fun firm that everyone wants to work for, while it's not as true in real life.

For EY, I get the sense that they are very well respected and have an extremely strong audit client base, especially in New York.  They didn't seem quite as fun or energetic as KPMG, so I'm not quite as sure what to expect.  But I feel like EY would be better for my future career than KPMG would.  Another factor is that I know EY audits most of the big sports leagues (NBA, NHL, NFL), and I would love the chance to get put on one of those teams, even if the chances are small.

Sorry for the length, but this is obviously a very big decision for me!  I go back and forth between the 3 :("
1rwa0c,4,2013-12-02,I'm faced with so many big decisions and choices that I can't even function properly anymore.,ginsbergonthemoon,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1rwa0c/im_faced_with_so_many_big_decisions_and_choices/,"I've been completely consumed with the dilemmas I'm facing to the point that it's completely pushing schoolwork, studying, my writing, and even just being happy completely out of my head. I can't stand it anymore, and while I would normally talk to my boyfriend about it (he's my best friend and whenever one of us has a problem we go to the other to try and sort it out), but it's the holidays, so he's with his family and I'm with mine. We're 1700 miles apart and we both agree that it's important to have these discussions face to face.

Plus it's Thanksgiving and he *loves* Thanksgiving. He loves all the winter holidays and I don't want to ruin his family time with my panicking.

So I'm waiting to talk this over with him until the day after I arrive back to college in his state. But for now, I can't even function unless I tell someone and try to get some advice. I *need* advice and I really don't have anyone I can ask right now. I know reddit isn't a great place for advice all the time but I really just want someone to talk to about this. Anyone.

    *    *    *    *

I could talk about the problems I've been having with my family in detail but I've put that in another post somewhere. I can link you to it if anyone wants some context. But I'm really terrified of the fact that at 17 I am being faced with making some choices that could radically shape my life and I have no idea what to do.

I currently attend college in another state. It is my dream college, and I pulled my grades out of the gutter and busted my ass to get there. I get half my tuition in scholarships and 25% in subsidized loans-- the rest my parents are paying. And it's a lot. This school is the tiny private college of my dreams in the location that has everything I want in terms of one of my vocational options-- history and museum studies.

Unfortunately my relationship with my mother (which hasn't been good since the third grade) is spiraling downhill. She's always been a little bit controlling but now that I'm living essentially on my own she's kicked it into hyperdrive. I know I'm living on my own but it's excessive, and not helped by the fact that I've never been very close to my family. We have just never understood one another very well, which has led us to cause all sorts of hurt to one another. I don't think it can be fixed and at this point I really don't want it to be. This sounds horrible but I've come to the realization that the only way for me to be emotionally healthy and pursue my dreams with any sort of sanity I need to walk away for a while, and give myself the chance to come back on my own terms.

Which is where the problem is rooted.

I'm home for the holidays and it's been both good and bad. I've missed my sister and my dad and my dog, and even to an extent my mother (I love her still, even with everything that's happened), and the people I worked with back here as well as my teachers from high school who mentored me and helped me through so much.

But I can't sleep. My stomach is going crazy, I'm nervous and falling back into the depression I thought was gone when I left for school in August.

So here's the issue: I rely on my parents to finance my education. I can't make enough on my own to pay for the college I love and want to attend (not to mention the fact that my mother has been holding my social security card and birth certificate hostage because she doesn't want me to have a job my freshman year, even though I've made it clear I don't feel comfortable asking them for money), but I also want to finally be free of my ties to my parents. I don't want to give up on my education, or put it hold because I know that taking two years off to save up money could turn into three or four, and I don't want to disappoint everyone who's helped me get this far and wants me to do well (teachers, family members, coworkers-- everyone). But continuing to take money from my parents means I have to continue to lie to them about my boyfriend, about my sleep habits and everything else about my life simply because they won't approve of what I'm doing. I hate lying to them, and it's been killing me for months that I have to do that-- that I've been lying to them about a lot of who I am for my whole life.

But the alternative is giving up. Giving up on shaping who I want to be as an adult. Giving up on my dreams of being a scenographer or screenwriter or having any work in entertainment. Giving up on my boyfriend.

I know, the *boyfriend*. We're both young, and even though he's my best friend and I trust him with my world we haven't been together long. But if I give up then we'll never have the chance to see if we could last. I've been in other relationships (I started too young, learned my lessons, gotten hurt, and gotten stronger for it), and he is the best thing to happen to me in a chain of wonderful things since starting school. He's my best friend, my alter ego, my counterweight and balance and compass. We're so alike and yet our upbringings have been so different, so he's in many ways the perspectives I sometimes miss. He puts up with my problems (mood disorder and psychological traumas), and helps me through them and still loves me after having seen my crying and a wreck and scared.

He's seen me exhausted from volunteering, emotionally broken after a fight with my mother, manic and bouncing off the walls, puking from a stomach ulcer, crying when my favorite character died, over the moon excited about a good test score, so upset with him I wanted to hit the wall and so in love with him I was completely silly. He's sat by me when I worked on papers for my plethora of classes, eaten cup o' soup with me when I couldn't afford anything else for a week, even talked me out of my stupid pridefulness long enough to take me to breakfast when I was hungry and make me take his help (his family has a lot more money than mine, and even if I felt comfortable accepting my parents' money he'd still be better off than me).

We've had ups and downs and will continue to have them, but I feel like there's a chance we may be together for a long time, and I don't want to give up before we've had the chance to try. We're young but we're in love and I want us to have the *chance* of working out together, even if that means things get tough. We've talked about being together in the future and know that it would require some hard times and a lot of hard work and understanding and communication (we're all about communication, sometimes bordering on too much communication)

But to stay with him, to retain a ideological independence that is incredibly important to me, I would have to make a hard and potentially idiotic decision.

I've applied for nearly $40,000 dollars in scholarships for next year. This would be enough to cover my tuition for two years but I know how many people apply for these things and I know how likely it is I won't get any of them.

In this case I'd have to take two years off to have any hope of saving up to pay for another year of school. I walked in as a sophomore and I skipped a grade so I have some wiggle room-- I'd simply be graduating a year later than expected and a year after my boyfriend. Unfortunately, to try and get the most money in aid possible, I'd have to apply as an independent student. I wouldn't be 24-- the only way I could be an independent student is if I was married. It's foreseeable that maybe we *could* be in a place where we'd be ready to make that commitment-- likely even. But I am uncomfortable forcing my boyfriend into making that choice now. So much could happen in two years and I don't want him to shackle himself to me now when anything *could* change. I'd hate myself forever if he stayed with me out of guilt-- I love and respect him too much for that and I want the absolute best for him, even if that means ending the relationship (I'd be crushed but I'd still be his friend).

Taking two years off would mean two years of internships and working my ass off every day. I'm not a stranger to that-- I worked almost 40 hour weeks all summer and worked for all of my senior year. My parents are working class and frankly I like hard work. Nannying, retail, waiting tables, cleaning toilets, sweeping floors-- I've done it all before and while it would be really tough I'd do it if it meant I'd be independent. I am prepared to write and rewrite and submit my writing to all sorts of people and be rejected and rewrite again. I'm prepared to take crap jobs in a theater or productions studio or what have you if it means getting my foot in the door. I'm not scared of hard work and I'm not scared of failing and having to pick myself up and try again.

I've been compulsively researching apartments and craigslist and help wanted ads and free clinics and credit unions and historical houses and Virginia's government assistance programs and community colleges in the area of my current school-- mostly because I want to be as prepared as possible, but also because it helps put my mind at ease to feel like I'm doing something, even if it's just planning. It's gotten to the point that I know all the bus routes in my city and how much it would cost to buy a bike and how far away all my potential places residence are from my potential jobs from my boyfriend's dorm. Excessive. I'm prepared for the hardship of living alone at 18. It would be rough, but I've handled rough before and gotten out on my own. 

    *    *    *    *

In essence, I'm ready for how tough it would be to try and save up enough to put myself through school. I'm prepared to put in the hard work to keep my relationship with my boyfriend. He's helped me through so much and has said over and over that he'll support me through whatever problems I may encounter and to help me through them, and I'm ready to help him in any way I can. That being said, I know sometimes shit happens. I'm also prepared for how I'd keep myself going if our relationship were to meet and untimely demise. I have backups in case I fall on hard times and need a hand. I have dreams and ambitions and ways to continue on my path toward attaining them. 

But I am still scared of disappointing everyone who has wanted me to succeed in life-- to make it through school in four years and go to grad school and make something of myself. 

And above all else, I'm scared that I won't be able to make it through the four months ahead until I turn 18. I don't know if I could make it through having no freedoms and no ability to be my own person for four months if my parents were to find out I plan to do this and pull me out of school. Especially as that would mean tearing me away from my boyfriend and my best friend all at once.

If I could just tell my parents to screw off now I would. Were it not for the fact that I want one more semester to help myself prepare for living on my own and to give myself some more time in this relationship I would. As soon as I have the money I want to take the loans they've taken out for this year of education on myself-- around $7,000-- or if I can talk my father into it pay every cent back to them when I can.

But I just want to get it over with. In the course of writing this post I've come to terms with the fact that this is the decision I've made, and I'm willing to live with it however it goes. I'll talk it over with my boyfriend as it concerns him and I want him in my plans but other than that, just writing this has made me feel a lot better.

I'm still scared that I'm fucking myself over forever, but a little more at peace about all of this."

Things were great, we were always involved with each other's families, all of that. Everything was going great, even after we moved in with each other. Eventually we each got kind of bitter, started bickering because of silly home issues (cleaning/bills/etc), but we still got along and had fun. 

We had a fight around Halloween that almost led to a break-up, but decided to try again and work things out. Cue to today: we are putting up the Christmas tree, and an simple argument arises. Afterwards I ask him to sit down and ask what was wrong, and see if we can come to a compromise. He tells me he doesn't think he wants to try fixing the relationship and that he wants to break up. I'm sideswiped, but whatever.

The issue is that he is the one who pays the rent. I'm a student with an unpaid internship that's required for my degree. He's gracious enough to do this while I agreed to keep the house clean, take care of our animals, pay the utilities, Netflix, all of that jazz.  This was all agreed upon and had no issues besides the 'money is a little tight' stuff. 

The question is, what do I do? I can't move back in with my mother, it's almost impossible to get a job with my school/internship schedule, and I can't afford a place on my own. He did agree to continue paying the rent until he either finds a new job and moves away (He is living in my hometown, about an hour away from his) or I find a new place to stay. It's going to be AT LEAST a few months before I can even do anything. Thankfully he's kind enough to not throw me out. Has anyone gone through something like this before? What should I do?

edit: I don't want it to seem like I'm callous to the situation. I'm actually really upset, but I still have to worry about the 'adult' issues.

I love him but it is getting to the point that my family and friends are concerned and I am emotionally exhausted. How do I explain to him the severity of the situation without giving him an ultimatum?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1rvhvv/my_19f_boyfriend_20m_is_extremely_insecure_and/,"We have been together for 14 months after meeting the first week of college and falling head over heels in love. I have never been in a relationship that has caused me to mature so much and made me feel so supported in my issues (I'm the child of a broken home that is still extremely stressful and admittedly have an overwhelming desire to please all parties in any given situation). When we were first together it was like no one I had ever been with. He was extremely attentive, interesting, and passionately in love with who I was, including my downfalls. I was honest with him about having cheated on a boyfriend when I was 16, but have explained many times that the circumstances of that relationship were riddled with insecurity and immaturity. I would never cheat again, which is something that anyone who knows me well takes to heart because cheating was such a traumatic event for me. For the first six months of our relationship everything was perfect: we traveled together, had the best sex of my life and he motivated me to pursue what I am now studying which had completely changed the course of my life. 

I first noticed he had problems with insecurity when I started to reach out to girls to form a friend group at our university. Because we met so early on, my friends at school were mostly my roommate and him for the beginning of the school year. I was starting to feel lonely and realized I needed to have a female support system, so made moves to gain one. When I started to be a part of a close knit group (although he still filled 90% of my time outside of class) he began to text me incessantly and freak out when I would not reply quickly because I was with my girls. He would accuse me of putting my girlfriends before him when I would leave to spend 45 minutes with them and because of my desire to please people I mostly internalized this and tried my best to be with him to avoid him feeling bad. My roommate began to express concern particularly because we started getting in bad fights when drinking but it was not until over the summer that it became apparent to me that he had a real problem. I had an internship on the west coast for the summer (where my mother lives) while he was in New England where he lives and we both go to school. Though I spent each day working from 7 AM to 6 PM and would go home to enjoy some herbs in my mothers basement before an early bed time, he was ridiculously insecure about me not texting him back quickly and began to really frustrate me. We would get in huge explosive fights that would ordinarily end with both of us coming to some concession but no real progress or change. I realized that my personality as an extremely outgoing individual as well as my tendency to dissosiate from stress might have been hurting him and worked hard to think about what I could do to make things better though at the end of the summer when I was visiting friends from high school, he called me and we got in a screaming match in the middle of a town fair because he did not believe I wasn't hanging out with guys. 

Coming into our sophomore year I was ready to be serious about my studies and therefore have spent almost all of my time with him, whether it be studying or relaxing. We have not moved in together but might as well be. His insecurity has not improved at all though I am doing even less without him than I used to. I have tried so many times to explain to him why I get frustrated and that he is irrationally insecure but he avoids accepting it. Simple things like me friend requesting a gay friend from high school have made him scream at me for hours and accuse me of cheating. It is like 80% of our relationship is awesome but the 20% is so bad that it is becoming unbearable. The most recent event is that I was with my two best friends for one day during Thanksgiving vacation and he texted me nonstop and then accused me of cheating and has gone into a full on paranoid delusion since then about my behavior. At this moment he has called me 25 times in the past hour and texted me 200 times when I have told him that I am with my father and can't sit on my phone or escape to call him. I don't know how to make him understand that I am 100% honest and faithful and he should feel confident enough not to become so paranoid so quickly, particularly when I am with people who are so nonthreatening to our relationship. 

Am I being an idiot and staying with someone who will never change? I have tried really hard to examine my part in all of this but I have made so many sacrifices for his insecurity that I have a hard time feeling like I deserve any blame. My family is worried I am putting my own needs aside for his, and so am I. But at the same time, I love him so much when things are great and I know there is a reason we have such a strong connection. Please, help. 

**TL;DR** Extremely insecure boyfriend, going on 7 months of battling unjustified jealousy and desire to control balanced with an intense connection. Don't want to give up, but I'm afraid I might have no choice. "

Junior developer (for purposes of this post)is a developer with &lt; 2 years experience programming in industry who have an interest in sharpening their technical skills.

I recently graduated from Stanford with a degree in Computer Science. I’ve been programming for 4 years and feel comfortable claiming ~1.5 years industry experience through summer internships, failing as a solo founder, being a lead engineer for a startup, various freelance gigs, and my current position at a mobile health startup I helped found in December.

I think that I'll just go through the [recruitment policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/NAEGold/comments/xzsh3/recruitment_policy/) point by point.

1) I'm an avid redditor since 3 years!  I'm a mod at /r/mathmetal but nothing really goes on there...

2) I'm from the east coast of north america : Quebec.  My first language is french, but as you can see I can speak english.  I watch competitive CoD online too, so my call-outs are in english.

3) I'm turning 25 this saturday, december 7th.

4) I play every week days after work (i'm doing an intership right now) and every week-end days, so pretty much every day.

5) I have a headset with a mic.  I must specify that is does not do all those crazy sounds like some do.  When I play it will be very quiet here.  No background music or people talking whatsoever.

6) Short Bio : I'm taking chemical engineer right now.  I'm graduating next year.  So I live in Sherbrooke where I go to school.  My family is from Montreal.  I have travelled a lot in my life ( been europe twice, western canada to live there 8 months, been to California, been to Peru)  I like cooking good food.  I love metal music, listening to Gojira right now.
CoD bio : Got hooked up on MW3 when I was doing an internship with a guy having the game.  When I came back I bought myself a PS3 solely to play MW3.  I had a ratio of about 1.5.  Then I gamed black ops 2, a lot.  I improved my game again.  Now I'm on ghosts, almost 3rd prestige.  KD of 2.1+ and win loss just under two but I play mainly solo at the moment.
I will play it smart, I will go for the objective.  I watch Crimsix, Clayser, mBoze, etc.  I love playing search, dom.  Blitz is a pain without a team.

I've been reading the sub since about a week.  I am here to be judged!  Ask away your questions.  I will send you a friend request on psn as of now.

I am just such a mess, I really think I am a complete fuck up. I do not see happiness in things I used to. I do not see any point to the things I am doing now. I have no sense of accomplishment. I am not proud of anything I have done. I have felt like this for at least 4 years now, but I never vocalized it until yesterday when I went for a visit to an on campus counselor.

I am 21, male, and will be graduating college in May if I survive that long. I am a very introverted person, so normally I do not bother people with my thoughts or feelings. I see my feelings as an option when it comes between my friends, family, and me. What I mean is, I have always felt the need to sacrifice my own happiness in order to make my family and friends happy. Their happiness used to bring me happiness.

I had a girlfriend for 10 months. We just broke up 2 weeks ago. She was one of the last things that helped keep me emotionally stable when in doubt. I took her for granted and treated her terribly for a month and, in a moment of anguish, I let her go. She deserves so much better than me, so that's what I explained to her. I feel so terrible about it, but I cannot shake the feeling that it was the right thing to do, no matter how terrible it makes me ache now.

I do not know when I first realized I had no happiness left in me. My dog, Sophie, recently passed away over the summer. I was on my way back home from an interview for a job in a pouring rain storm when my mother called me. She could hardly talk. She told me nobody else would go with her to the vet, and she asked me if I would. When we got there, my mother completely broke down. There I stood, emotionless again. I watched one of the things that brought me happiness for 10 years of my life get put down in seconds and couldn't even show her the respect she deserved with even one tear.  I cry every time I think of Sophie now. I can never stop crying.

Being in college used to make me feel powerful. I thought I truly had grasped life by the reigns and that I was in control. I just don't care anymore. I'm not sure I ever did. I get good grades. I landed an internship next semester. I've gotten Dean's List every semester. It doesn't matter to me anymore though. 

Every time I think about my life, I always was the kid that smiled and was there for others. I treated everyone I ever met with the utmost respect. There is only one person I ever met whose intentions were so pure and right that it makes everyone else look like a murderer. It's so depressing when the people I think are my friends turn around and make fun of me, judge me, disrespect everything about me. I only have one true friend in this world and it makes me sick to think I have only one.

I don't find conversations interesting anymore. They are boring. They are redundant and repetitive. It's part of the reason I broke up with my girlfriend. I just wish I woke up one morning and there was nobody around for hundreds of miles. I just wish I was alone and had to do nothing.

I've thought about running away about a hundred times. Sometimes, I have had voices in my head that tell me to crash my car into an embankment or oncoming traffic. It tells me nobody would ever know it was intentional. I could make it look like it was an accident and just never have to deal with the pain anymore. I see how my parents would react though. I see their faces in my head. I think if anything would ever happen to me, my mother would just die altogether. I can't be responsible for that. It's the only thing that has ever stopped me from doing it.

My life has been full of death. I've dealt with about 5 friends in my life who have committed suicide. My grandfather died very suddenly and unexpectedly one morning a few days after he was hospitalized. I remember being so sad and mad. The doctors said he would be fine. I went to a funeral for my grandmother's cousin, whom I had become so close to unintentionally. Everyone was joking at her funeral, but I sat there staring at the coffin wondering how I had survived longer than she had.

I honestly do not know what is pushing me to move on anymore. I am on the verge of a complete mental breakdown and I do not know when I might get pushed that one step too far anymore. I talked to my counselor at school. I usually lie to him about my life because I do not want to be there talking to him normally. Yesterday, I completely opened up everything that was happening and could not contain my sadness in front of him any longer. He thinks I am severely depressed and need to consider taking medication soon if I do not improve. I think if I get to that point, I will lose it. I might actually lose it all.

I could never let anyone know this is how I truly feel inside. I am that kid that always smiles and is there for everybody. I don't want people to think I'm even crazier than I already am socially. I don't want my parents to know their prodigal son is a complete, psychotic mess. I just don't know what to do anymore.

**TL;DR** I have reached the all time low of my life. I do not see how to come back from it, and am not sure if I can. Nothing seems to matter anymore. I just want the hope and happiness back in my life, but it keeps getting taken from me."

1s0ji0,3,2013-12-03,"Loneliness, among other problems",advicethrowaway07,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1s0ji0/loneliness_among_other_problems/,"Alright, I’ll try to start at the beginning.


I’ve been going to college out of state for a year and a half now, I’m a sophomore. I had a pretty close friend group growing up, we did everything together and I’m still friends with most of them, we talk through VOIP software and play games nearly every day despite being 200 miles away. But at college itself, I’m lonely. I made some friends the first year and lost them just as quickly, or I should say they just kind of faded away. 


After the first year I was getting bored. I started trying drugs. Weed and some psychedelics. Most of my friends back home smoke themselves, so sometimes we would chill and get high over the breaks. I found caffeine improved my mood, so I started drinking a lot more coffee and just consumed more caffeine in general. 


There’s a group of people down here that will occasionally invite me to big get-togethers, and I have a good time. But I don’t REALLY know any of them. They’re little more than acquaintances. We see each other less than once a week, minus passing hellos in class. My friends are at home. My roommate is more of a loner than I am. We haven’t said words to each other since the beginning of October.


I was able to keep my weed habits secret to my acquaintances at college, that is until a few weeks ago. One of them, a nice guy that I was hoping to get an apartment with next year, found out and acted ambivalent at first. Ok, fine, I thought. Until I found out from someone else that he was having doubts about getting an apartment with me in light of that. Haven’t talked to him about it yet, keep putting it off. But the time to sign a lease is fast approaching. 


And as it tends to do, the gossip that I use marijuana is now all over the group. People treat me differently. I’ve become the punchline of certain jokes. “Haha, oh advicethrowaway07, are you sure you weren’t just high?” So I just smile and laugh along, and they don’t see that it hurts me when they give me that look, that derogatory, condescending look, and what pisses me off most is that they never would have known if they weren’t told. I never mix weed and going out with them. But now I’m the group stoner.


Now, heading back after thanksgiving break, I nearly had a breakdown. A combination of needing to talk to the person closest to a friend I have at college about an apartment, a lot of stress related to final projects, realizing that I’m going back to a practically fucking mute roommate and a fucking box of a dorm room, leaving the family that I love and feel I’m becoming more distant from. I’m seeing the people I know down here less and less. I’m realizing that I’m not even halfway done with college and I don’t seem to have a passion for my major. I’m going through more weed than I used to, feel tired if I’m not on caffeine, and I’m legitimately scared that I won’t even able to get the motivation to work on everything that needs work. I missed a deadline for a summer internship already.


I’m a kissless virgin that has never had a real girlfriend, and I’m scared that I’m not interesting enough, not attractive enough for one. I’m scared that I’m going to go through college without experiencing intimacy with another human being, just like I went through high school never experiencing teenage love. And then where are the opportunities after college? I’ll never have a chance to find a significant other as good as this again.


Today I wanted to lie on my bed and scream that I didn’t want to go back. I didn’t want to go back there, where I’ve lived virtually entirely on my own for 18 months with breaks in between. I don’t want to live like this. I’m supposedly smart, but I can’t figure out how to fix my goddamn life. 


I want to be able to make friends, enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning without having to ingest more caffeine every 5 hours, and get high responsibly when all my work is done and not feel judged for it. I want to have sex and be able to hold her in my arms, knowing that the person I just made love to loves me back. I want to enjoy my major and what will probably be my career.
Most of all, I just want to feel normal, like I’m not three steps behind every other person on this fucking planet. Everyone seems to KNOW how to do things. I don’t. I don’t have fashion sense, I don’t know how to flirt, I don’t know how to make new friends since I haven’t had to do it since middle school. I don’t see my path changing. How am I supposed to grow as a person when I can’t bring myself to leave my room for anything other than class, exercise, and the occasional social get-together? Where would I even go?


I’ve already written a giant wall of text and feel like I could write more. Sorry if this is rambling on, I’m not sure what advice I’m really asking for here. More than anything I think I just need to get this off my chest. But, if any of you can offer advice, please do. On anything. Thank you for reading.

(sorry if I'm vague at any point, but I need to protect my offline identity)

WALL OF TEXT:
I graduated from an Ivy this year and I've been searching for a job almost constantly to no avail. My majors were in environmental/earth science and political science. I have a lot of technical course work, two papers published, and some relevant internships. I've been applying for jobs in environmental consulting in the US and abroad because I only have a bachelors and anything else seems to require a PhD. (I wanted to work before doing grad school since I have no idea which part of my majors I would continue and it seems like I'd waste even more money just randomly doing something.) I have several job applications pending with the government, the UN, and in various places across Europe. Mostly though, I've had rejections. I am still actively searching every day. 

Right now, its difficult to even find openings in my field so I make sure I apply to a job if it seems I might be even remotely qualified. Still, I honestly thought I would have a job by now, and I'm kind of shocked that I don't. I've gotten so many rejections because I'm overqualified or under-qualified or they just won't take someone from the US (this has been especially true of UK positions - a shame because this is the country with the most opportunity for someone in my field starting out). I'd been having trouble finding openings I'm qualified for in the US (am I looking in the wrong places? I'm not saying no, but the career services at my school tried to help and had the same problem). I don't have a car and can't afford one, so I'm limited to looking near cities for a job. So, now I'm applying anywhere in the world that I might be able to qualify for. I just didn't expect it to be so hard to get a job abroad. (As for applying abroad, I've looked at positions that want English speakers mostly, but I've also freely applied in Germany because I have family there and speak some German.)

Now, this week, the bills started arriving for the student loans I took out, lets say a round $100,000. I need to call and see if I can get a deferment but that still only gives me another three months. And the main problem of not having a job remains. I am currently living at home to save money but my parents definitely can't help with loans while paying for my brother's school. 

So what do I do, reddit? I've been looking but am having trouble finding a job. (I have some interviews coming but they're unpaid internships) I have bills arriving for loans that I cannot pay off. I have no clue what to do. I am stupidly overwhelmed. 

TL;DR Graduated with BSc from a really good school, can't find a job (anywhere in the world), and have student loan bills coming in and no clue what to do.  Please Reddit, I need your advice.  "
1s08l5,93,2013-12-03,I'm [30/M] and recently realized I've been in an abusive relationship for the last ~10 years. How do I get out?,isittimetogtfo,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1s08l5/im_30m_and_recently_realized_ive_been_in_an/,"I'm [30/M] and recently realized I've been in an abusive relationship for the last ~11 years. How do I get out?

Honestly, I don't know why I'm writing this here. Partly to share my story in case it helps others. Partly for validation and to vent, I'm sure. Partly because I don't know the best way to get out of this relationship and would love some advice. 

Damn, this ended up being way longer and more disorganized than I'd hoped, but I don't have time to edit it now.

I'm a 30yo man married to a 30yo woman. We've been together since we were 18, married the last 5 years. Writing that makes me feel sick because it feels like I've wasted a lot of years. 

Anyway, I always knew my wife was somewhat controlling, but over the last year, I've realized her behavior was far beyond what is normal. Here's a highlight (lowlight?) reel of her behavior that I suspect is abusive.

Years 1-5 of our relationship: She has a lot of conflict with my family members. Including a physical altercation which she instigated. She assumes the victim role in all interactions with my family members (and all people in general, actually), and forces me to ""take sides"" with her. I slowly become distant from my family in this time, and move in with her. I miss holidays and birthdays with my family and become socially isolated. 

She also finds problems with all of my friends, and I slowly become distant from them as well. My social circle shrinks from being pretty large to being basically just her. We live together and spend almost all of our time together. We have some fun times, travel the world, and other good things, but I feel a bit as though I'm just along for the ride. She also finds fault with many aspects of my personality. I'm ""too outgoing and embarassing"" and she tries to reel me in constantly, compares me negatively to people I don't admire. I should note that I get along really well with people in general, and my friends would describe me as likable and kind and funny. I'm also handsome, and women tend to take notice of me, but I never engage with them. At this point, my wife seems to like the attention I get from other women, and doesn't usually act jealously. I feel like a trophy boyfriend who she likes to flaunt around. 

She constant brings up the ways that I ""need to change"" which basically means I need to become more like her, and more socially isolated. I regret it now, but I went along with this, and tried to please her and change for her. My self esteem went from being quite high to very low. If I don't act the way she wants me to, she threatens to leave me and/or kill herself. She attempts suicide a few times with pills, but they're half-hearted attempts. When I try to call the police or poison control, she becomes rageful and threatens me, specifically she threatens to publically humiliate me and also to lie to the police and say that I hit/raped her (which I have never ever done and would never do). So, I never report anything. 

Mental illness runs in her family, and unfortunatley her schizophrenic brother muders someone at this time. It becomes national news for a few days, and she is quite traumatized by this incident. (We all are.) Life generally returns to normal after a year or so, but the negative aspects of her personality (controlling, anger, jelousy, verbal insults toward me) seem to intensify after this incident. 

We graduate college and move into our own apartment. I start a business and she jumps from job to job. Then she enters graduate school to become a therapist. (Her brother's crime and mental illness make her more interested in psychology.) I support her while she is in grad school. I have almost no friends other than my consulting clients who are much older than I am. She has a budding social circle from school. I become mildly depressed, and go to therapy on my own, which helps tremendously.

Years 6-10: I spend my days working in my business, and my evenings with her and our dog. She is in grad school and has conflicts with her professors, fellow students, supervisors at her internship. She frequently complains about them. While in school to become a therapist, she hones her verbal insults on me. Instead of just saying ""you're just a piece of shit like your father"" (her old go-to), she'll scream ""you need help for your anxiety/OCD/personality disorder/bipolar/aspergers!"" She labels me as having conditions for which I show no symptoms. I also studied psychology in school and realize she is likely projcting onto me. I begin to suspect she has borderline personality disorder. She belives she is perfectly normal, and I am ""fucked up"" and says I have ""no social skills"" despite my ability to work well with others and make friends quickly. I have almost zero conflict with other people, while she has conflict with nearly everyone she interacts with (excecpt for certain friends who enable her). She bounces from job to job every single year, sometimes quitting after a month or two, always because she feels a supervisor is persecuting/targeting her. It sounds to me like she's just creating conflict with people, but I try to support her and take her side. She always says I don't do enough for her, I don't make enough money, I'm not supportive enough, she wants to quit her job and have me support her financially forever so she can stay at home and read celebrity gossip websites. (her words)

After she threatened to leave me because ""we didn't travel as much as she wanted to"" one year, I made the mistake of marrying her at City Hall. Then we bought a house together. And we have a dog, who I love very very much. Our lives became more entwined. From the outside, it looked like we had the perfect relationship. I had a successful business, we had a house in the right part of town, the dog, lots of international trips. Except I had no friends and was constantly berated when I didn't give in to her. I've literally never won an argument in our entire relationship because anytime she realizes she's wrong, she screams and threatens me with suicide or divorce until I decide it's not worth it and just give in. I hate myself for giving in to her. 

Yada yada yada. This last year:
At the beginning of 2012, I started to get somewhat depressed. I think the weight of the previous 10 years just finally caught up to me. I'm a very resiliant person, but I'd enabled her for so long that our relationship dynamic was harmful to me, and I was very socially isolated. I became unhappy, and after 10 years of being told I was a bad person who needed to change, my self esteem was pretty low. I decided I wasn't going to just give in to her every whim anymore. I started to make some new friends. My spouse seemed supportive at first, but quickly became jealous of the time I spent with other people (maybe 3 hours a week, while she was at work). 

I was sort of astonished because these people were smart and successful and kind, AND they seemed to like me as my real self. I'd hidden away my personality for so long with my wife because she'd convinced me there was something wrong with me, but these new people seemed to embrace me, including my flaws and awkwardness. I started to become happy for the first time in 10 years. And, I realized that my wife had been manipulating me into thinking I was a fucked up/bad person with no social skills. 

I started to spend more time with these friends, and I told my wife about them. She started to pick them apart, saying they ""sound like losers."" My wife saw that I was becoming less depressed, and said that my new friends were shallow and empty, and ""if those losers make you feel better about yourself, it's because you're a loser too."" She accused me of being bipolar because I was suddenly happy after being depressed for so long. She tried to get me to stop seeing my new friends.

Back in May, I was at a meeting with a client and ran into two of my new friends after I left the meeting. We decided to go hang out in the park for about a half hour before I headed home for the day. I texted my wife that I'd be about 40 minutes late, and she demanded to know why. I said I ran into Friend1 and Friend2 (both male), and was going to hang out for about a half hour. She seemed irritated with me, but I didn't want to give in to her. I went home after about 30 minutes, and she picked me up from the train station and was beligerant with rage. She screamed at me that I had ""lied to her"" about when I was going to come home. She screamed at me that she hated me and that she wanted me to kill myself, told me I was a waste of life and she never loved me. I was crying because she was saying hurtful things, but she didn't care. We got home and she tried to throw my clothes out the window of our highrise apartment. I kept trying to calm her down and defend myself and diffuse the situation. I even apologized for seeing my friends. Then she locked herself in our bedroom for an hour and I left her alone. We had concert tickets that night, and it came time to decide whether we were going to go to the concert or not. I knocked on the bedroom door and said I wanted to get along and have a positive experience, and asked if she would consider going to the concert with me. She came out and seemed much calmer and said we could go to the concert. She also seemed somewhat out of it. I asked her if she took pills or drank poison (things she'd tried in the past) and she said No, repeatedly. But she was lying. While at the concert, she lost her balance and threw up 160 advil that she'd taken in a suicide attempt. I said I wanted to get her medical attention, but she screamed at me that she would tell the police I had raped her (completely untrue) if I called them. She vomited all night, but survived. I stopped loving her completely that night.

Since then, the cycle of abuse has continued. There has been a lot of screaming and threats on her part. My social circle is gone again. She tracked down my friends via social media and publically humiliated me. She sent emails to the spouses of my friends claiming I was a bad guy and bad influence on their spouses. She's threatened to kill me and herself countless times. She claims that my new friendships consititured an affair and a betrayal (I've never had an affiar) because they took me away from her.

She claims I need to ""buy her things and make a grand gesture to repair the damange"" I've done to the relationship. I just want out, but I'm scared as fuck to leave. She's said she will kill herself if I leave her, and that she will ""ruin me"" financially and publically humiliate me. I've stalled for months on this, and am once again socially isolated and depressed. My work has suffered and I'm starting to have financial problems. It's clear that she's going to make it as hard on me as possible when I leave, but I can't take it anymore. We co-own a house with about $150k in equity, and a car which has a $12k loan balance, and a dog who I love. I want it to be a clean exit, but am realizing it may not be possible. Her name is on the adoption papers for the dog. If I could walk away with some pocket money and the dog, I'd be really really happy. 

[edit: she's begun to attack me physically in the last few months, has started punching me and throwing things at me while in her fits of rage. I'm a really big guy and she can't hurt me, so I just sit there calmly asking her to stop. I've never reported her (I know, I know) because she's threatened to lie to the police, and I believe she would]

Oddly, I don't harbor a ton of resentment toward her (even though I know I should, possibly because I've been emotionally abused for so long?) and hope she lands on her feet someday.

WTF should I do, Reddit?


tl;dr - accidentally married abusive crazy person, became emotionally co-dependent, not sure how to leave without serious negative consequences

I'm an undergrad CS major and I've already completed my first internship. I'm interested in completing my second at a different company and I wanted some feedback on listing the newly gained experience on my resume. 
GPA is 3.0. Currently omitted, but I'll be adding it later.

Questions:
Are the experience/project descriptions worded oddly? 

I opted to list the user functionality (User can do X, Y, Z). 
I've read that you should write ""Accomplished X by implementing Y, which improved Z"". I'm having difficulty wording it like this though, as I've coded everything in both projects.

Is the listed project too trivial? 

I just wanted to back up my listed skill set and show that I'm proficient in it. I'm slowly adding new features while tracking my changes with version control. I've also included the github repo incase they'd like to browse the code.

Finally, would you hire me based on this resume? 

Obviously you would have to test my knowledge in an interview, as well.

Thanks!"

While this is maybe not the most dramatic problem, I would really like to hear some outside perspectives. I'm sorry for the complete text overload, typing this out feels cathartic, like writing a diary entry.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years, typical first high school romance - he asked me to be his girlfriend at prom. He is my first boyfriend, I am his first (serious) girlfriend. We have had ups and downs, including a six-month break about a year and a half ago, but we got back together.  Currently, I just started the sixth month of my six-month-long internship abroad in Southeast Asia. The internship was an unbelievable opportunity for me, it was a competitive process for only two available spots but it was the perfect marriage between what I'm studying in university and my future career ambitions. There was never any question in my mind that I would not apply out of concern for being separated from my SO for that long or anything like that. For his part, he never once breathed a word of dismay or reluctance; he has been 100% supportive of me taking advantage of this opportunity, knowing full well it would mean a separation of 6 months.

About a month before I left, he sat me down for a serious talk about our future together. At first I didn't want to hear it, on the grounds of ""why mess with a good thing?"" But we did talk and came to the realization that our lives were slowly but inexorably heading down different paths - he's an electrician by trade trying to get established in our hometown and looking to invest in property within the next year, while I'm in the last year of my BA in a major that will not guarantee me a job and will likely require that I move away from our hometown (which I actively want to do), and I'm also interested in working abroad. He has zero desire to move or travel. Neither one of us was willing to sacrifice our life goals for the other, nor did we WANT the other to go through that sacrifice! After a lot of heartfelt declarations and weeping, we agreed that our relationship would end when I left the country.

The month that followed was magical and intensely passionate; pretty much we were high schoolers falling in love all over again. In retrospect it was probably so amazing because we let go of all our pet peeves and trivial squabbles because we wanted to get the most out of our time together... Basically when it was time for me to leave, I didn't want to end the relationship and neither did he. So we decided to go long distance.

Long distance was a challenge because the time difference made it difficult to find a good time to Skype that fit both of our schedules. We started off strong, but I guess we got derailed. Writing and spelling aren't his strong suits (he is much better with verbal/oral stuff) which means he's very poor at texting and messaging. Here are some examples: ""nice i hope ur swell"", ""oh thats great u must be stoked"", ""it wad good thank people ate nice not a lot of stress"". I am a very writing-oriented person so it's a big disconnect for me. To be fair though, I have missed a few scheduled Skype dates, either due to me forgetting to wake up earlier or falling asleep too soon, so I'm also to blame for our poor communication.

Anyways, it's been a slow, drawn-out process but last month I pretty much realised that I wasn't in love with him anymore. I don't desire him anymore or particularly miss him. It seems kinda like the natural end of a relationship that began when we were at pretty volatile and hormonal ages. I wrote a list of reasons to continue trying and reasons to end it - reasons to end it was much longer. I don't want to go into more detail about my reasons (although I can if I needed) but basically I have no doubts in my mind that I no longer want to be in a relationship with him.

We talked on Skype and I brought up our lack of communication and other issues. It was his morning though and he had to go to work, so we agreed that we would take some time to think, and Skype again in two days. For me, it seemed inevitable that when we Skyped again, it would be to break up.

Day of the planned Skype date, I receive a text from him saying he wouldn't be able to Skype because he just totalled his car in an accident but not to worry because he was fine. Obviously I was worried, I snuck out of work to call him on my cell right away but no answer. He continued to text me though and from what I gather he IS okay but I have no idea if he is downplaying the seriousness of the accident. He said the hospital released him without needing any treatment but still.

I feel horrible for him and now I feel guilty for wanting to break up. As well, a couple months ago he was laid off from his electrician job which he took really hard, PLUS his birthday is coming up (a week before Christmas!!). I come back to our hometown on December 31st. To be perfectly frank, I don't have a problem staying together for now. I have never cheated nor had the desire to, and although I'm gallivanting abroad there is no temptation here - the area I'm living in has a small, tight-knit expat community who are mostly in the late twenties/early thirties and see me mostly as their kid sister, and there is a language barrier with the locals - so it would be no effort for me to stay the course for now.

But then I'm thinking, once I come home I would break up with him, and now it seems like no matter what I do, inevitably I will hurt him - either I break up with him now, post-car crash/job loss and pre-birthday/Christmas, or wait and break up with him after he spent 6 months waiting for me. For me it's that stereotypical ""I love him but I'm no longer IN love with him"" but after typing this out I'm starting to think I need to bite the bullet and break it off sooner rather than later? The thought of him being so happy at my return only to be dumped seems intolerably cruel. At the same time though, we have both previously acknowledged that our futures were not going to be together, so it's not like this is coming completely out of nowhere.

For what it's worth, my friend's opinion was to wait it out until I come home, because her view is that I might only be feeling like I want to end the relationship due to the difficulties of long distance, and when I come home everything will be back to normal. I disagree because I feel 100% that I'm not in love with him anymore. At the same time though, I don't want to cause him unnecessary pain by being an insensitive boor!!  

---

**tl;dr**: Coming home from an internship abroad, was thinking pretty seriously about breaking up but he got into a car accident the day we were meant to Skype - should I still go through with it or wait less than a month for when I return?"

I'm an Illinois Resident transfer student who was admitted to UIUC's CS program for Spring 2014. I've also been accepted to UIC's program and I wanted to get your opinion on weather's UIUC is worth the extra ~20k I'd pay in housing/food/driving over 2 years.

I would basically be paying no commuting costs for UIC because I am in a unique situation where my dad works downtown and I could drive with him everyday and live at home.

I know the top companies recruit from UIUC and UIUC's program is ranked 5th in the country whereas UIC is 57, but I've heard from other that where you went to school doesn't matter after you 1st or 2nd job. Also based on UIC's COE career fare page it seems like Microsoft, Motorola, etc also recruit from UIC, but no Google/Apple like UIUC for internships.

So UIC CS students and alumni, would you recommend UIC in terms of employment/internships compared to UIUC? Have you guys been able to get the same internships/jobs at UIUC graduates/students?

When you guys were doing your internships, did you see many UIUC CS students as well?

Thanks guys!"
1rzox6,4,2013-12-03,"am i depressed, or just a bit mardy?",clownpiratepossy,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1rzox6/am_i_depressed_or_just_a_bit_mardy/,"I made this throwaway account to ask this question; I can't explain why I did that, I guess i'm ashamed somehow, I don't know. 

Before I start, I am well aware that this is a really whiney post. I think I know the root cause of the problem but I don't think it shouldn't be as big a deal as i appear to be making it, and that's why I don't understand why it's getting me down as much as it is.

Anyway, so I'm going through a weird phase at the moment. Things are technically going reasonably well for me at the moment. It's probably easier for me to start for the beginning.

So from September last year, my gf broke up with me, I was pretty fucked financially and I struggled with my studies; I was in a really rough place until easter time this year, and then in the months leading up to june, I grafted harder on my uni course than i've ever worked at anything. Nailed all my exams and managed to get an amazing internship at arguably one of the best companies in my industry, in the world, in June. Worked really hard for it and I got it. So i'm living away from my uni friends and set up a life in a new town for a year and made some new friends. I've been working out a lot and i'm in probably the best shape of my life. 

One could say things are going really well for me at the moment, and I guess on paper they are. This is what confuses me. Why the fuck do I feel so unhappy? Well, I've pinpointed my unhappiness to stem from feeling lonely. I see people with their partners and It hurts to know that I don't have that. I can't deal with being single and going out on the pull and ""loving single life"". I can't/don't want to go out and get with random girls on nights out. People keep telling me that I should just be patient and things will happen when they're supposed to happen, but I can't logically figure out when that would ever happen. At the moment, I only ever get with girls when i've been introduced, never off my own accord. And when I do, in my head, i latch on to her (not in a creepy obsessive way) but because I worry that this could be my only opportunity and so I should try and make something of it. 

It's not just the idea of not having someone. It's feeling that I don't really have anyone. I mean i've got friends, and i'm not on a constant downer all the time, I do go out and have a laugh with people, but when it comes down to it, I don't feel like I have anyone that I can truly count on. The few guys that come close are finishing uni this year and i'm not going to see them much after they finish (so i'm spending a lot of time with them at the moment). At the moment, it feels like i'm never really missed by anyone.

As it is, I go to bed every night and I go to bed thinking about how lonely I feel. I lie there wishing I had someone next to me, or at least a mate in the house that I can go chill with when I'm down like I did with my uni mates. These thoughts are usually followed by me mocking myself for being so fucking pathetic and desperate and needy, and that this isn't a real rut, its just me feeling sorry for myself. I find myself upsetting myself a lot.

In the past year, despite all the things that I've had going for me, there are very few times when I can honestly say that I feel happy. There has always been something missing. I'm worried about myself. I'm worried that at some point, these occasions when I can ""enjoy"" myself are not going to be sufficient pick-me-ups.

I don't expect many people to read all of my ramblings, and I thank anyone who did. I know this is pretty minor compared to other people's problems but I just needed to get this out."
1rzlge,1,2013-12-03,I don't know what else to do...,lmcr,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1rzlge/i_dont_know_what_else_to_do/,"Hello, I'm not sure if this is the appropriate subredditt for this (new to reddit), but I really need to rant and some advice. 

A little backstory: I'm on my second year of a 5 year engineering program. Both of my parents have doctorates in engineering and taught at the University I'm enrolled in.  My mom still teaches here and is in the same department (mechanical eng.) She was very proud of me choosing this major, partly because it's what she teaches and because of the little amount of female representation in the area. However,  she it's pretty determined that i graduate a squick as posible and with the highest GPA i can.  Since i go to the same University that they teach, they decided that there was no need for me to move out to an apartment or get a car,  so I ride with my mom to the University every day. I'm very involved here, have a group of friends, a very supporting boyfriend,  I work on projects in the department,  and have already secured an internship with a big name company for this summer. My brother did not go the engineering path,  and so I'm the youngest and only child posting this career. 

The problem is in the academic side and my home life. During my first year, i did very well in my classes and got mostly straight A's. This semester has not been going so well,  it's a well before finals and I'm probably going to end up with B's in most classes. There are several reasons for this: these are tougher classes, I'm adjusting from seeing my bf every weekend to getting to see him every day,  and (mostly) I've lacked the motivation to study for most of this semester. At home and on those drives to the campus,  I'm continually interrogated as to how I'm doing in my classes, if I'm studying,  etc. I know parents commonly ask their children these questions,  but the frecuentes and the way they're voiced is staying to drive me insane. When I'm home,  I often get asked if I've studied, if I did my homework,  etc. On the car ride i get long speeches on how I have to dedicate myself to school, how I can't let my GPA drop. Even though she likes my bf, she still says we go out too often (once a week) and that's time I should focus on studying. Any time I mention getting a party time job (so i can earn my own money and be more independent) she says that I have to focus on studying. For any idea I have that she disagrees, she often makes it clear is her way and her way only. 

I understand she and my dad are this way because they feel is for my own good,  but they don't realize how is actually hurting me.  Every day, I feel the weight of their expectations and I feel like they're trying to control me,  not letting me make my own mistakes or live on my own. They don't seem to realize I'm not a child anymore and that I should be free to make my own decisions. I feel like part of my lack of motivation is because of all of this. I know that B's aren't bad at all, but she feels that 'I'm too smart to be getting B's and I should study more'. I would study more,  if I felt I was doing it for my own good,  not just to appease her. 

I've tried every way I can think of to get her to understand my side with little to no success. It's getting to the point where I'm constantly in the verge of tears, sometimes I feel really empty inside,  just a complete lack of happiness.  Most of my friends have an idea of how my mom is, but they don't know the extent of it.  The only one I've told is my bf, who comforts me and tried to help me the as much as possible. Right now, it's seems like I'll have to just grin and bear it for the next four years until I graduate and move out,  and I honestly don't know if I can last that long. 

Have any of you gone through something similar? Any advice on what I could do?

Thank you :)"

During an internship I used SPSS Answertree to create CHAID decision trees to predict the responses of, say, a direct mail marketing campaign.

Given a set of related variables, how would one use Python (via scikitlearn or other) to create decision trees, random forests etc?

How do you use these to predict for new data? (I am asking because Answertree used to output SQL rules and yet what I read about Python this isn't how you do it)

Is it possible to tweak the decision trees at all to create better fits? (This is probably done automatically with random forests, but we did a lot of manual tweaking at my internship :/)"

1rzj0g,15,2013-12-03,Doctors are telling me I might have Crohn's Disease...I have no insurance,[deleted],MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1rzj0g/doctors_are_telling_me_i_might_have_crohns/,"I went to the hospital last night...for the second time in a month. It started out as terrible stomach pains the last time accompanied by diarrhea. It was the same thing this time, only I waited longer to go because I was hoping it would go away. Nope. It only got worse. I'll spare you all the nasty details, but everything came back negative. Still, they gave me some antibiotics and pain medicine and sent me home, but since this was the second time in a month that this was happening, they advised me if it happened again, I would need to seek out a specialist because I might have a chronic stomach disease, such as Crohn's. He mentioned another one, but Crohn's just happened to stick out. 

But see...if a diagnosis like that was the only thing wrong, it wouldn't be so bad...at least, I'd be able to give all these stomach issues a name. I don't have any insurance. 

I'm 27 years old, just past the cut off date, and I am *very* close to finishing my degree. I have about 5 months to go, that is, if I pass all my classes this and next semester. I'm hoping at that point I'll get a decent enough job and *have* access to affordable health insurance. But until that happens, and if this stomach thing keeps happening, I'm screwed.

My boyfriend had to pay for my medication tonight because I have no money. It ran almost $40 and that was because I opted out of the nausea medication (I still had some from last time). I have no money at the moment because I only make $400 a month. I can't get any more hours at work because it's work study and I can't take a second job because I have to work an internship in order to graduate. But I figure even with obamacare, I still won't be able to afford it. I looked at the website and the cheapest option they have is $110 a month, and at this point, even if I were to make any extra money, it would be going towards food. 

I just don't know what I'm going to do. This is a lot of stuff for me to be dealing with right now, especially with finals coming up. I want to graduate and do well so bad, but I'm afraid all these financial and health issues are going to end up getting in the way of that and I'm just gonna end up struggling for the rest of my life..."

You guys give some great advice so I'm hoping you can help me out. Throwaway because a friend knows my account name.

My relationship with my mom is complicated, to say the least. My parents got divorced when I was 8, my dad remarried but she didn't. They divorced because my mom cheated on my dad with one of my friend's dads, but they're no longer together.

Until I was 18, I lived with both my dad and my mom, switching from house to house almost every other day. I think that I have some resentment that I grew up like this- I always had to bring my makeup bag, straightening iron, etc. to school because I only had one of each. My parents live about an hour away from each other, and my school was 45 minutes away from both houses. A lot of traveling.

I've never had a stellar relationship with my mom, but we were kind of close until I turned 16. At that age I got my first job through a friend from school, and it was really close to my dad's house, so I started spending a lot of my time during the summer there. She used to get really pissed at me because I was spending more time there, and couldn't understand that I wasn't necessarily spending more time with my dad- basically waking up, going to work, and then going home to go to sleep. This is when she first started fighting with me about how much more time I spent there, and it's continued until now.

When I was 17, I didn't have a car yet so I used my parents cars whenever they were free. I specifically asked my mom if she had fixed the registration on her car, because I knew she had problems with it in the past. She said she did. One night I got pulled over because the tags were 'hanging weird' on the car, and it turns out my mom didn't fix the registration on the car, she just tampered with the tags. Which I got arrested for, as well as some other charges having to do with the car. My mom had to drive almost an hour to pick me up from the police station (borrowing a friends car), and spent the entire ride back telling me it was my fault that she couldn't pay it cause she ""had to pay for my prom dress"" and all this other shit. Then she told me I wasn't allowed to tell my dad that I got arrested. I waited until I got to my dad's house and told him everything. He was able to take care of it (he's a lawyer) and it never went to trial because I had no idea that the tags were tampered.

So that was the summer before I went to college. If you're still reading I appreciate it, I now realize this is going to be a long post haha. The next two years I spent living at school (an hour away from my dads, two hours from my moms), still having some fights with my mom that I didn't see her enough (I didn't have a car on campus, she visited me once). I was still working at the same job close to my dad's house, and she would always try to convince me to quit my job and get one closer to her house (even though she knew how good the money at my current job is). Holidays have always been dreadful, because my mom complains that I don't see her enough and I spend all the holidays at my dads (my dad has a large family that live close to home, my mom doesn't, but I still saw her every holiday). 

Earlier this semester I got a call from a debt collection agency saying that I owed Verizon $400. I've had Sprint for 2 years, and have never had an account with Verizon under my name. They said the account was opened in 2006, and after telling them that I couldn't have opened an account when I was that young because you have to be 18, they told me my identity had been stolen. After some lying, my mom admitted that she used my name and my social security number to open an account when I was 13, and hadn't paid the bill since January. Obviously I was fairly pissed with her, and that led to a huge fight, which caused her to tell me ""I know that I messed up, but I feel like whenever I do anything wrong you hold it against me. I do so much for you and its never good enough.""

At this point I should probably mention that I have a younger brother, 17M, who my mother clearly favors over me. We'll call him T. She chose to use my name for an account, not his, and screwed up my credit. Also, she doesn't do that much for me. She pays half of my doctor's appointments, and fills out FASFA once a year. My dad pays my entire tuition (around $15,000 a year), pays my car insurance, gives me money for gas since I'm commuting this semester, the other half of my doctor's appointments, and basically everything else. He also paid my entire high school tuition (around $40,000 total). I now commute from my dad's house to school and live primarily at his house.

So this brings us to Thanksgiving. My mom's birthday was two days before, and my schedule worked out best if I spent the night at her house the night of her birthday instead of Thanksgiving. I have a lot on my plate right now, including school full time, work part time, internship part time, and having a boyfriend who lives an hour and a half away who I try to see once a week. She knows how busy I am, and it just worked better for my schedule if I saw her on her birthday. I drove 2 hours to her house (I left straight from school), got her a pair of nice earrings, and had dinner with her. She said she had a great time and I ""made her birthday"". Fast forward two days later, and she texts me telling me she's pissed that I didn't spend any time Thanksgiving with her. (Note that she didn't get pissed that my brother spent the night at a friend's house on her birthday and didn't see her) I told her that we discussed it was better for my schedule if I saw her on her birthday, an argument ensued, and she told me to have a nice life.

It's sad that I'm used to this kind of shit happening every holiday, even though this was the first holiday I didn't see her. I guess my question is, what do I do? Part of me wants to cut her out of my life- she causes me so much stress and always tries to make me feel guilty every time I talk to her. But she's still my mom. I do try to spend time with her, but it seems like its never enough. How do I fix this relationship?

tl;dr: I've had a strained relationship with my mom for a very long time, and I don't know how to salvage the relationship and stop her from constantly making me feel guilty/ruining holidays for me."
1ryz9n,1,2013-12-02,Where I'm at,Mouse-A-Million,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ryz9n/where_im_at/,"I just need a place to vent about my feelings for now. I'm 21 years old. I've just moved into an apartment with my girlfriend of 4 years. I have left behind a life that would have led to no where. I have just started a new real job that I have achieved all on my own today that pays well and is in my field.  I'll be graduating school in half a year and will already have 3 1/2 years of experience in the field. I will now rant about the topics above.



My career:

I have been in my field of work while going to school for about 3 years now. I taught myself at 18 and started small work immediately.  Over time I took an internship and 2 other job offers other than freelance work and have confidence in my abilities. The only problem is that my brother who is in the same field as me, has always played a part in my jobs. I finally have gotten one that pays far more than I could imagine at my age and is within my skill level.  I've done it on my own for once and I'm scared that I won't be adequate enough for the position. Today was my first day and I couldn't help but shake the feeling that I won't be good enough for the position. That I'll be fired for being slow or not as productive as I should be. Or even for not knowing something. I hope that the new few days or even weeks lead to a change in this feeling.

I used to work at a small start up that only had 2 people working there.  The owner and myself.  The owner hardly ever paid me on time ( I'm talking about months late ) and made me feel quite guilty about the amount I was charging ( about $10 dollars an hour Cheaper than the going rate ).  After not being able to pay my bills and getting sick of my living situation I found myself a new job! I however still feel guilty about leaving, even though I know that my new situation is far better for me.



School:

With teaching myself everything I needed to know while going to school, I've generally been a step ahead in all of my classes.  While I learn a lot from being there and it helps me with formalities. I'm starting to get quite tired of having to do a bunch of homework when I have a full time job to take care of. Even though I only have a semester left, I just want to be done with it all, it feels like such a burden on my schedule.



Home:

As mentioned before I used to live with all of my childhood friends and girlfriend. I've been dating my girlfriend since we were in high school and my friends never really liked her much.  I love her to death and really enjoy the time we spend together, but she's shy and my friends didn't enjoy the fact that she took up my time leaving less for them. Being young and terrible at relationships I really didn't know what I wanted or how to handle a serious relationship. My friends played a big role in pushing me to break up with my girlfriend after 1 year. During the down time that we weren't together, I ended up getting too far into weed. I started being very apathetic all the time and my priorities were out the window. I was flat broke and had little to show for myself.  Eventually my girlfriend and I got back together, she pushed me to stop smoking weed and showed me that I wasn't always apathetic and off. After a while I came to my senses and stopped smoking while trying to get my life back on track. I moved in with all of my friends due to a very cheap opportunity to live in a family friend's farmhouse.  After a few months my girlfriend moved in and it was awesome. My friends however only cared about partying, drinking and smoking. The house that I lived in was NEVER cleaned by anyone but my girlfriend and I.  The dishes were always dirty and never done, they were even left randomly throughout the house with food on them.  None of my friends bought groceries, and they hardly paid me back or pitched in for any that I had bought. Yet somehow they always had enough money for weed or alcohol, funny how that works huh? Anyways, after too long of living there, I finally had enough money to move out with my girlfriend! We have an amazing apartment with our cat and we are still unpacking. My friends didn't even offer to help me move, they actually sat on the couch and played WOW while I moved boxes in front of them. I've known most of my roommates for quite some time, and the one I've known the longest was the worst about everything. He likes to think that I didn't want to leave and that my girlfriend was forcing me to. I had actually sat him down and told him my reasons for leaving and he still acted the way he did. I feel extremely frustrated for the lack of respect and courtesy after what I've given my friends over the years and I'm not sure I'd like to see them again.



I finally feel like I'm getting my life on track and yet the people that I thought cared about me don't seem to support it or say much.  My family supports me and thinks I'm doing great, yet most of my friends don't give a shit and aren't happy for me even after giving them that respect on their decisions and accomplishments. I really just needed a place to rant and talk about my situation, feel free to leave me comments. If you made it through this novel, thanks for reading it."

1ryl3n,3,2013-12-02,How do I properly counter offer?,gutupio,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1ryl3n/how_do_i_properly_counter_offer/,"I recently received an offer from one of my top prospects. I'm stoked, but I'd like to extend a counter offer. Here's the story:

Last January I did a week long project for a company. After the project they extended an internship to me. Meanwhile while waiting for summer to come, a friend of mine applied for an internship to the same company and was accepted. We worked the summer together and even carpooled out there most days. After the summer our internships ended. We both received notices from the company asking us to apply for new grad positions. 

My buddy applied and was offered a position. I got really busy working two jobs and taking a full course load and never found time to apply for the company. A few weeks ago, the recruiter for the company who had set me up with both the project and the internship called and asked me why I hadn't applied yet. We had a conversation and a verbal offer was extended with the promise of a formal offer coming after thanksgiving break.

I received the offer today, and it's for a decent amount. I do have qualms with it though. My friend was offered more than me but I feel as though I have more to offer the company. I have a higher GPA (by almost a point) and more experience with the company. Plus the company recruiter is clearly interested, since he called me. My other qualm is with the length of time for the offer. The offer expires on Dec 20th, in only 18 days. My friends offer was valid for 60 days. After the conversation with the recruiter I applied for a few other companies, and I would like a little extra time to see if any other companies extend offers.

So how should I go about counter offering? The formal email was extended as a letter sent over email as an attachment. How appropriate is it to ask for an extension on the acceptance date? I don't know if I'm comfortable suggesting I know my friend was offered more, but how acceptable is that as a reason if they ask me why I believe I deserve more? Is there a general format for counter offers? 

One last thing of note is that the company uses a 'wage calculator' to determine the offer. They claim it makes if fair for all incoming new grad positions. Has anyone had success or failure in counter offering with this situation? "

How would I go about applying to the smaller places? The bigger companies have a pretty straightforward intern application procedure, but I don't know how to apply to the smaller places that don't attend recruiting fairs. Just send them an email/cover letter with my resume?

1ryhj8,4,2013-12-02,Tips for reducing clerical errors?,mrbazooka,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1ryhj8/tips_for_reducing_clerical_errors/,"Hi there /r/AskEngineers,

Something that I have always struggled with ever since grade school is making very small clerical errors. A simple example of this is saying that 2+3=6. Now, I KNOW that 2+3 is actually 5; no one needs to remind me how to do basic arithmetic. These small errors, however, are causing me some enormous trouble.

For example, I had a Fluid Mechanics test the week before thanksgiving break. I started studying a week ahead of time for an average of about 2 hours a day. I went over all the homework problems covering the topics that were to be presented on the exam, and met with a study group the night before the exam for 3 hours to discuss any difficulties we might have had.

Unfortunately, things didn't pan out so well. I got a 76%, which is just barely good enough for a B. Had it not been for a clerical error I made on one of the problems, I would have gotten an 84%, and my professor is unwilling to negotiate on his grading methods. 

Student services set me up with a tutor for this class. The tutor told me what I already knew: I know the material just fine, it's just the tiny clerical errors that are the problem.

This is a big deal for me because I need a 3.0 in order to be eligible for the internship I want this summer. Right now, I have a 2.99. The fact that I am also considering grad school makes it even worse.

Are there any exercises that I can do so that I may get better at catching these mistakes? I'm convinced that I can get at least a 3.5 cumulative GPA if I can reduce the frequency of these mistakes. Any help is appreciated.

TL;DR I make lots of tiny mistakes in calculations. I otherwise know the material very well. I am looking for exercises to do so that I can reduce the frequency of these mistakes so I can bring my grades up. Any help at all is appreciated."

I made half ass attempts to get a job, and I saw my friends who have graduated with me immediately get six figure salaries I was too lazy to do anything. For the next year and a half, I manage to do odd jobs at gas stations, driving cars for people, etc,  borrow money from my parents and live off my friends. Actually I was offered a job right out of college but I was fired immediately since I overslept on my first day of work and didn't show up.

After nineteen months of this, one of my friends manages to hook me up with a $10/hr internship at a firm, in their finance department. Two months into it, I fuck up so bad that I am about to be fired. However, my bosses feel that I have potential and instead move me to the Operations department as an intern there. Over there, fortunately I clicked. It was a small company, and I was the only ""tech"" guy in Ops, and I manage to vastly improve many of their processes and prove invaluable to their department. Two months later, I am offered a $30K full time job, and earn a somewhat stellar reputation for my work and my ideas within the company. I have already turned my life around a bit at this point, and I keep doing better. A year later, I am offered a $70K salary at another firm. My company does not want to let me go however, and matches it, so I stay. At this point, my company has already done so many things that seem very improbable, like not firing me after my fuckups, and moving from 10/hr to 70K in less than 2 years. 

I am very good at what I do, and I take on unofficial roles within the different departments, especially tech. I become one of the most knowledgeable people in the company about our company's systems, databases and processes in general and part of the new hire orientation for tech guys are a few sessions with me to learn some of our systems. I'm the only Operations guy to have full access to all the databases and internal systems, including root access at many places. I (well, *mostly* me) design a few upgrades and methods which the firm later applies for patents for. I get about 10-15 people on average a day asking me questions about our company's systems, or just help with their computers in general. I am managing a team of 10 people, mostly interns, at this point. This is when it gets into my head, and my performance nosedives. Slowly I start coming to work later and later, or just skipping entirely. I oversleep everyday, manage to reach work anywhere between 10 am to 1 pm, and take 3 4 days off a month on average since I woke up just too late for me to go to work. My boss gives me a lot of shit for it, but I promise him to improve starting ""tomorrow"", but never do. This goes on for another year. Yes, I know, how many jobs are out there that will keep you for that long after you go to work 1-4 hours late? My work is still good, however, but I lose a huge part of my bonus because of this. In fact, I recieve a $20k paycut and now I'm making $50K. 

Did I mention that all through college and up to this point, I never had a girlfriend? The first and last one I had was in high school. Over all these years, I have had 1 one night stand and 1 week long fling, and that's about it.

In December 2012, I meet this amazing girl who is just a godsend, and who I'm planning to marry in January 2014. This was decided in August 2013, and at that point, I decide that it's time for me to find another job. Over the few weeks, I manage an $50 hourly job which translates to about $100,000 a year. The first few weeks, it was all good. I used to come to work on time and all, but then it started again. One day a week on average. Everytime it's something. Doctor's appointment, root canal, fire in the house, death in the family, you get the point. Slowly my boss has begun to catch on. Still, I come to work between 10-11 everyday instead of the usual 9. I do stay a lot late to make up for it though. All this because of oversleeping. 

Last night I was watching Netflix till 7 am. At that point, i felt like sleeping for just 10 minutes and then getting ready to leave for work. Bad idea. I woke up at 11:40, said fuck it, and went back to sleep. Every hour that I miss at work is $50 I am losing. I have about $65 (down from $80 K at graduation) in student loans and so many responsibilities that I cannot afford to piss everything away, and yet I do not realize it. 

I'm getting married in Jan. I had hoped to lose a lot of weight by then, but looks like there just isn't enough time anymore. I can't seem to stop smoking even though I have spent hundreds of dollars on nicotine gum and lozenges, which work pretty well most of the time. My room would qualify to be on Hoarders, although since I live with roommates, the common areas are under control. I'm planning to go to Europe for my honeymoon, and I have $60K in expenses coming up over the next 3 4 months. I have $65K in student loans and $15 K in credit card debt (0% intro period expiring this month). I have $30K in savings, and I'll be taking on another $30K in credit card and personal loans)

My financial situation is pretty okay at this point, but if I lose this job, I'll lose everything. My marriage will have to be postponed and everything will take a turn for the worse. Why? Because I could not wake up on time and go to work, like I did today. I am averaging reaching between 11 and 12 when I actually do go to work, and it was almost three weeks ago when I was there at 9 am sharp. That too, I managed only because I did not sleep at all the earlier night. "

Throwaway for obvious reasons.  In my third year of undergrad with offers for 2014 summer software engineering internship at MSFT (Bing Ads) and FB (not sure, but backend services).  Obviously this is a good problem to have, and I probably can't go horribly wrong either way, but I'm still having a lot of trouble deciding.  Would appreciate any input, especially from those have worked at one or both.

Specific questions:

1. Is the culture at MSFT as corporate, political, and bureaucratic as it's made out to be?

2. Which has more interesting work and responsibility (especially as an intern)?
3. Maybe a silly question, but which company has the better name/reputation?  That is, which company would set me up better for the rest of my career? I imagine it's a wash between the two. But I've also heard criticism that Microsoft's hiring bar has suffered in recent years, and a lot of top talent has left. 

Any other input of any kind would also be much appreciated.  Thanks! :)"

I was able to get a demo version up and running locally. But if I try to edit the files directly and save them, the changes aren't reflected in the browser. In the same way, Django-CMS will let me edit text and save changes in the browser, but when I check the actual template files, the changes aren't being reflected there.

I got the medication I needed and the counseling that helped me get out there into the world. It wasn't an overnight thing but it certainly showed me a way of living I never thought was possible for me. I started doing real well in school, I got great internships from a couple of pretty big fortune 100 companies, I became social and active, and finally had a group of friends I could trust and rely on (not just acquaintances I called friends but real friends who accept me for who I am). I  finally stopped living by myself and got a roommate who knows me from the inside out and who I know looks out for me (we're in a platonic co-ed living situation). 


Things started to change a few weeks ago. It felt weird, and I started having spells of self-doubt and uncertainty. I shrugged it off at first as stress from school. However, it subsequently started getting worst. I became afraid, panicked, I started to think everything about my life was wrong. The voices started coming back to my head telling me I wasn't worth shit and I should just give up on life.


I started ruining all the progress I've made. I began sabotaging my schoolwork, doing stupid things with my relationships, and just last night I had an episode where I just destroyed and threw everything around my room out of anger and desperation for myself. I downed 8 mg of Klonopin to try to calm myself, but that didn't even seem to work. I curled up into a corner. I didn't want to talk to anyone. I don't want to do anything. I just want it all to stop and take the easy way out. I'm getting more and more desperate as time goes by. Some big things have happened in the past few weeks that might be catalyzing this episode even more (but that's another novel in itself). It just feels as if the meds have stopped working and I'm in a place a lot worst than from where I started.


I'm tired. I'm desperate. I'm beginning to intentionally ruin all the progress I've made because I don't believe I deserve any of it. I'm just useless and I don't know what to do."

Am I being selfish for not wanting to?,bandzmakeme,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1s2blf/my_boyfriend_wants_me_to_follow_him_for_med/,"My boyfriend is in his second year of med school, and I am currently interviewing. We've been together for roughly a year now, and for most of the year, it was long-distance. I got an interview at the med school that he goes to, and my boyfriend straight up today me that he really wants to me to go the same school.

The problem is that the med school he attends is in a city that I don't particularly like and the student body is way too cutthroat. Also, it was never one of my top choices to begin with, so I don't want to make a huge career decision based off my relationship.

I know the distance has been taking a toll on my boyfriend, but I'm pretty set on the fact that I don't want to attend the same med school. Am I ruining the relationship?

**Edit:** Wow I did not expect my post to get this many responses. I've read pretty much everyone's response, and I generally agree with y'all.

I noticed that most of you guys said that my education/career should always come first, I feel as though it is really that simple when you're 18 and just going into undergrad. But I'm 21, and my boyfriend is 25.

(I used a throwaway to protect my identity, but then I realized that my boyfriend barely uses Reddit anymore, so I feel fine with sharing details about our relationship.)

I've known my boyfriend for most of my life, but we didn't really become friends until I went to college. My parents and his parents went to med school together, so when they found out that I was going to same the college as him, they told him to take care/watch out for me. I ended up pledging for the sister sorority to his fraternity, and so we were in the same general social circle and went to the same parties/events. He ended up asking me to his formal, and he was my date to my formal. My second semester and his last semester, we ended up casually dating/hooking up. He already got into med school, but decided to take a gap year to go on a medical mission trip. He bought me a ring and asked me to wait for him. I ended up saying no because I was too young and wanted to enjoy my undergrad years.

My sophomore year and while he was away in Haiti, I ended up in a relationship with his little. It was short and pretty much lust for both sides.

While he was in Haiti, we didn't talk at all. But after he got back, I ran into him at the grocery store. We ended up getting coffee and catching up. Seeing him made me realize how much I actually missed being with him. I asked him if he wanted to give us another shot, as I felt that I had grew a bit and was more serious about us. He said yes, but wanted to make sure that this time I was ready for the commitment. Therefore we both decided that we would each fly out once a month, so we could spend at least 2 weekend a month together. This past summer I ended up getting an internship in the city that he is in. It was really nice to spend time with each other almost every day and actually grow in our relationship.

I guess that's why I am having a hard time deciding what to do. I really want to make it work and can see him as my husband, but I just don't know if I am willing to make what I think is a huge compromise before I am actually married to him. I feel as though if I wasn't willing to go to the same medical school or be in the city as him, he would take this as me saying no again."

Since then I had one design internship that was cut brief due to a lack of personal finances and lack of proper work coming from the company (small/sort of start up). 

Once the internship was completed it was the start of 2013 so I decided to retouch my portfolio and sent out several cover letters/emails/resumes etc for other jobs/internships. I got roughly about 8 interviews out of 50 applications. All rejections unfortunately. Now we are coming up to the end of the year and I am pretty discouraged about my recent loss of creativity/motivation. I basically wasted a whole year wallowing and I hate myself for it. 

Luckily a friend gave me a job at a restaurant to hold me over while I try to get my design life back together. But working 40 hours in food service and trying to stay creative is somehow troublesome for me. I find myself not caring anymore and just want to quit everything. It also does not help that many of my friends got design jobs out of school and I cannot help but feel even more disappointed in myself.


These days I try to just sketch something everyday, but I am finding myself really frustrated by how shit things turn out. And I am totally aware of the fact that talent does not just appear out of thin air and requires lots of patience and practice. These days I feel like a spoiled child who just wants everything to come to them easily without earning it. I do not know how I can push myself and learn to not care if something is not so great initially, but know that if I press on things will get better. 

I feel like I currently have the worst case of creative block along with a mental barrier I have placed for myself because I feel like a failure. I am in a hole that I have dug myself deep into and I do not know how to get out.

For you professional/current students/recent grads, how do you keep going? I seem to have forgotten how to do any sort of work without the structure of school or a boss in place. Unfortunately I am my own boss now and I am terrible at my job.

tl;dr I need help finding a job and I suck at motivating myself. How do you all do it so well?"

I've done some research and came across bitmap images (bmp), which would make sense for this application. I was going to initially start with an arduino to construct an n x n matrix but it's limited by its 14 digital output, which would ultimately correspond to a matrix location. Now, although that would be a good start, it seems rather straight forward and just come down to programming some code. There's also the arduino mega with 54 outputs, but surely there a less straightforward way then individually programming each output.
I would much rather skip this limitation and proceed to a higher n x n matrix, but have no clue to the hardware that could ultimately achieve this.. I've pondered in regard to perhaps using a series of muxes to differential between the individual LEDs and increase the refresh rate (if that's even possible with an arduino) so that it would appear as a full matrix to the eyes (which I just learned is known as multiplexing). Ultimately I'm trying to figure out how to differential between LEDs and colors. If someone could perhaps steer me in the right direction in terms of hardware or anything else that would be useful, I would be forever grateful..

Lil background.. I'm currently a junior in EE in some-would-say ""prestigious"" university with a &lt;3.0 GPA and have no engineering experience beyond my curious nature toward engineering or internships [yet] so I'm hoping this would be a great project to set me a part once I'm on the market."

I don't want to look ""old,"" but I don't want to draw extra attention to how much younger I am. He's already one of the youngest in his department, so I imagine there'll be a lot of people in their 30s and 40s there too.

Despite being pretty lean compared to most girls, I either don't fit in most ""classy"" dresses (which often have high necklines and stiff fabric) or if I do, I can barely move my arms and it's extremely unflattering, making my shoulders and back look even broader. It also doesn't help that I'm really flat-chested. Dresses that are looser up top also look bad too, because if it isn't fitted at my waist, I just look blocky and fat.



One idea I had was wearing a red, stretchy long-sleeve bodycon dress made of a thicker fabric paired with black opaque tights and black ankle boots. 

Any other thoughts? Suggestions? Store recommendations? I'm super clueless about this sort of thing and I'd appreciate any help!

1s1ogm,1,2013-12-03,I [21/M] have been having second thoughts on and off about my relationship with my SO [20/f],[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1s1ogm/i_21m_have_been_having_second_thoughts_on_and_off/,"Good evening all!

I have been dating a wonderful, passionate girl for about 6 months now. We met at our community college at the beginning of the summer. However, she is still there and I am now at a 4 year uni with 1.5 years left here (about 150 miles away) to finish my degree.

Things have been moving really fast in my life, and I feel like its outpacing our relationship. I went from living with my parents to being on my own. I now have an internship lined up for the summer at a huge corporation where I'll be meeting new people, I have rekindled my love for old hobbies, all while coming out of a pretty bad period of my life circa 2012.

As much as I love her, I just don't know if we're at the right point of our lives (hope that doesn't sound cliche). We both work really hard to make this long distance relationship work, but when we're not together texting just drains me. I always tell my friends how much I hate being glued to my phone and thats what a long distance relationship pretty much consists of. She doesn't like to facetime or skype because she thinks shes ugly (which obviously from my point of view is NOT the case). 

Another thing is when I'm in a relationship I am very reluctant to go outside my comfort zone. I typically stop trying to make new friends and just get complacent with my life and that is NOT something that I want to do for the remainder of my college career. I want to be able to go out with my friends, meet new people including girls without feeling like I have to go report to someone when I get home.

On the other hand I really do love her, which totally kills me when I even think about breaking up with her. It makes me feel guilty but every relationship I have been in I never considered my own happiness. I always tend to do everything to make the other person happy while forgetting about myself. I do not want that to happen this time. It is hard to focus a lot on myself in our relationship because she requires a lot of attention and work. She does not pursue any hobbies, she's reluctant to meet new friends, and she wants to spend every waking moment talking to me if she isn't at work or school. While this is all very flattering, its is also very overwhelming. 

Anyone with similar experiences or any insight please let me know what you have to say, and feel free to ask me any detailed questions! Thanks :)

**TL;DR**: Having second thoughts about my relationship with my g.f because we are 150 miles apart and my life is drastically different, and we also have different views on life."

My coursework and research have been focused on machine learning and natural language processing, and I'd like to get a job in that area. However, it seems like 95% of data science/machine learning jobs require a PhD in CS, so I don't qualify for them. The jobs that don't require a PhD often require ""X years of industry experience,"" which I don't have. (The classic job experience Catch-22.)

For the past few months I've been looking/applying on Monster, CyberCoders, and KDNuggets, and there seem to be very, very few machine learning-related jobs out there for someone with just a master's degree and no industry experience besides software development internships. How exactly does one break into the field without their PhD? Or should I just apply for a PhD program?

For my efforts I was also given a letter of recommendation from the person supervising us. Due to the lack of work experience on my resume other than the internship and a class final project, this *has* to be included as it showcases some valuable skills. 

I have also been doing an internship this semester and this volunteer work happened in the same timeframe as the internship (but wasn't a part of it). How should I put this on my resume since it was only one day and it happened at the same time as my internship? Also if you have a letter of recommendation do you mention it on the resume, and if not, is it wise to send a scanned copy of it with an online application?"

This is my first semester in grad school for Computer Science. I'm deciding if I should register for classes next semester. I'd like to start a career in application development, but I'm a little afraid of getting overqualified and don't know how needed it really is.

I went straight from my undergrad in CS to grad school. The only CS work experience I've had was a couple years at the university helpdesk. I'm currently doing a data entry internship. I honestly kind of hate the job, not because it's hard, but because of the environment and my co-workers. That said, it waives my tuition and gives me a $1,000/month stipend for 20 hours of work per week.

I've been applying around for all kinds of work- internships, contract work, and permanent jobs, but haven't had much luck. I'm not sure if I should list that I'm a grad student on my resume or not; if I got a job, I'd probably continue grad school later down the line. 

Also, a little unrelated, but should I list my GitHub on my resume even if it only contains two small projects? I don't have a huge portfolio of projects, to be honest. A lot of my undergrad work was in networking until I decided I preferred programming right near graduation, so most of my projects are pretty basic demonstrations of data structures and not big, useful programs. I haven't done any academic programming this semester in grad school either, oddly enough, so nothing from there to put on it. Just my personal projects.

There's a few other factors involved, but since this is the CS career questions subreddit, I'll leave it to that. Any advice?"

***'Ninety'***

**JACK(26)** is adrift in life. He does not seek to challenge himself in anyway and is content to stay within the comfort of his own barriers. He studied sound production in college and while he retains an interest in it, he cannot take any pride in the small achievements that he is part of. Currently unemployed he makes half-hearted attempts to get a job but is unconcerned with his lack of success, if not relieved. After a meeting with a friend he resolves to give it a go. Not that he expects it to result in happiness but out of a sense that it will confirm to him that he is right. He sees an ad seeking a sound man on a short film and applies.

**SHAUNA(24)** is mindlessly travelling from one day to the next. Working in retail her days are mostly subjected to disparaging comments for her boss. Her interactions with customers rarely go any better. She has a very strong interest in fashion yet has no faith in her designs. She is also slowly drifting away from her friends. Their interest in going out, all dolled up, seems to be a superficial veneer on the emptiness in their lives. She decides to take a leap of faith, applying to the same ad as Jack for the role of the short films costume designer.

The shoot goes without incident and afterwards Jack is responsible for giving Shauna a lift back to a friend she is staying with. They make small talk. There is an attraction but neither is too sure how much of it they are imagining. There is definitely something there. Later at the wrap party their previous subtle steps lead to Shauna going back to Jack’s house. The next morning they know everything has changed.

The both of them begin a whirlwind romance. Shauna seems to open up a bit more than Jack. After hearing about Shauna’s interest in fashion Jack manages to get her an interview for an internship in a company. Shauna is daunted but with Jack’s encouragement she goes and impresses, gaining the position.

They celebrate with a few drinks where they meet Jack’s sister. She seems hostile to Shauna and Jack moves away from the table to talk with her. Jack sister urges him to call his mother. Shauna wonders what she has done. Jack just tells her that his sister is just looking out for him. Lying in bed Shauna confesses her love for Jack. Jack tells her he feels the same. That night he gets a phone call. His mother has passed away.

Shauna attends the funeral. She feels a little out of place but she wants to support Jack. She starts talking to Jack’s sister and discovers that throughout the romance of the last week Jack’s mother has been slowly dying. He never went to see her.

Jack’s grief now comes out over the next few days in a confusion of hurt and anger at himself. His pronouncements are profuse and he lacks honesty with how he feels. He tries to continue the romance that was present but the forced desperation of it disgusts Shauna and eventually she leaves. They plan to meet later in the week.

Jack stands at the train station and looks at the schedule board. Walking away from the train he takes out his phone and texts Shauna. Shauna is with a few friends when she gets the text. She reads it as one of her friends makes a joke. She realises that she does not want to see him. She cannot incorporate him into her life. She texts back ""Yeah, this weekend isn’t good for me either.""

Shauna returns to visit Jack. He desperately tries to convince her it can work. As Shauna leaves his apartment that night she hears him crying but there is no reason for her to stay. Everything is gone. 

Shauna drunkenly kisses a guy back in her home town. Jack deletes Shauna's number. Jack ventures out on his own and ends up drunk and buying drugs.The same night Jack staggers into a hospital reception. The nurse on duty can't understand his desperate pleas to see his mother. Jack goes into shock and falls unconscious.

Standing by his mother's hospital bed Jack reaches out his hand. His mother embraces him and he breaks down into tears. They comfort each other.

Jack wakes in a hospital bed. His sister is holding his hand. She shakes her head as tears fall down her face and she smiles. She is so happy to see him and he tells her everything is going to be ok.

Jack takes on a volunteering role in a local community centre. He joins a gym, starts to eat healthy and turns his life around. He takes his guitar playing more serious and joins a local band.

Playing on stage to a large crowd, Jack sees Shauna. Their eyes meet and he puts down his guitar. The crowd parts as Jack starts to walk towards her. We hear a heart monitor. He takes her into his arms and kisses her. The heart monitor flat lines. The crowd cheers."

I'm not exactly sure how to describe my role, 'everything electronic,' should do it.

One of the duties that is not outsourced to another group is setting up new workstations to company specs, and so far it has been handled by previous interns by just manually installing everything and calling it good. I am cool with that, but I want to expand my experience and learn a few new tricks. Plus, they are having me write a step-by-step IT Manual to be used by following interns, and a one/two step process would be easier to write.


So far I have thought of the following:


**1) Setup a group-policy in Active Directory for all workstations with the baseline programs needed.**

-My concern about this is how it would effect existing users, I don't want to break something in the process of making something faster.

-Never done it before.

**2) Create a baseline image from an existing workstation, and use it every new workstation that is added to the fleet.**

-My concern on this, there is no uniformity in hardware here, just buying whatever is available at a given time. Hardware differences could cause problems right?

-Also, I have never done this before. I got this position on being eager to learn and a CS major.



This position is not out of my league, but I feel woefully under prepared. I am basically learning everything I can about networking, sysadmin, and stuff.

Thoughts and advice?

Keep em coming... still have 10-15 spots to fill, interviews are moving along quickly. 

Alright reddit, help me out here!

A client of ours is having a huge hiring push, they're looking to onboard 30+ Inside Sales reps *by the end of the year!*

This company is in the high-tech/software industry. They're looking for new grads/entry-level candidates to join their Inside Sales team.

The ideal candidate will have recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree, and possibly have sold something in the past. Summer internship selling college painting services? Encyclopedias? 

They've had success in the past with candidates who have held some sort of leadership role in school, i.e. captain of the team, fraternity, etc. and love to see that on resumes.

They need **hunters**... someone who is eager to get on the phone and SELL. Someone who can develop relationships with clients. You can't be shy for this role!

They're actively interviewing and hiring for this role... if your resume stands out, they've been setting up interview the same/next day. Ideally candidates should be able to start ASAP, but anyone graduating this month would certainly be considered as well.

These are perm positions - not contracts. Starting base salary is around $40k with an awesome commission plan, and great benefits. 


**Please note:** They're also hiring people with a few years of previous high-tech sales experience, although the recent push is really for entry-level people. If you've had a couple years experience I still encourage you to contact me, however it's not likely that they'll want to see anyone with a well-established sales career. Sorry sales vets :(


So, spread the word, I need resumes ASAP! If you're interested PM me for contact details and I'll follow up with you quickly to go over the details. Thanks!

Her lips are warm and eager, and your skin tingles when her soft red crescents touch gently against your flesh.

Her long brown curls tickle and tease your skin, and her hand moves between your legs. Painted fingernails trace deliciously along the sensitive skin of your inner thighs as the kisses continue, and you feel goosebumps on your flesh as the soft, light touch dances along in unpredictable patterns.

Like the strings following the woodwinds, her tongue emerges from behind her soft lips, and her mouth moves in concert with her second hand as it comes into play, seeking your most intimate places. The warm, yielding tongue slips along sensually as the delicate, dexterous fingers add a counterpoint to the pleasure, both yearning to earn your moans of ecstasy, to satisfy that burning in your loins and eagerly lap up the resulting nectar.

But it is not time for that. She eyes you with desire alive in her honey-colored eyes, a passionate fire with a hint of mischief that sparkles as she gathers up the disparate elements of her erotic assault on your self-control. The tempo increases, and you feel crescendo off in the distance.

It is then she stops and eyes you hungrily, enjoying your arousal. She sees it in the beads of sweat popping up on your skin, and every time her skin touches yours she feels it in the heat of your flesh. The tremble in your hips and the look in your eye add to the picture of your excitement, but most of all she can feel it in the power and pace of your pulse when her tongue touches you. She takes a satisfaction in your arousal, your pleasure sends shivers shooting down her spine and makes her grow inside her panties.

The delay continues, the ache and crescendo building as she eyes you: hands, lips and tongue all paused, poised on the precipice of pleasure.
________________________________________

So, I’m looking for detailed pen pals for ongoing role plays. When I say pen pals, I mean messages may not come more than once or twice a day. Sometimes more, sometimes even less. I also want to delay the sex. Really set a scene, establish characters and then create a connection between those characters.

I am looking for eager role players and passionate writers with an attention to detail and a working knowledge of the basic rules of grammar. I am a busy person with a life and a job, and I know you are the same. I won’t feel bad if it takes two or three days sometimes, but I’ll be glad on the days we exchange a whole flood of orange-reds. If you aren’t as into the roleplay and buildup aspect as I am, we probably won’t connect.

I’m trans by the way, so though I look and act female and have breasts and such, I still have a cock in my panties. Please don’t call me tranny or shemale or anything like that, thanks.

Further, I am looking for detailed scenes with a unique twist. I don’t want to do barroom meetups or office romance. I have a couple of scenarios I've thought of listed below, but I am open to and would LOVE suggestions--as long as they are unique, fresh and filled with potential.


I realize this is all quite specific, but I thought I’d give it a shot.


We are two friends traveling the world. We were part of a larger group of college students or 30-somethings or whatever, but we did our paperwork by hand and everyone else let the travel agency do theirs. There was some snafu at a border and they couldn't carry on. We'd prepaid, and now it's just you and me on a series of foreign stops. We fall for each other as the trip progresses.

The other is, maybe you'll think it's silly, but about intrigue. I'd like to be spies, or ideally members of a resistance movement in an occupied country. Maybe court members Game of Thrones style. But mainly I'm thinking a sort of Noir' early '40s occupied Paris and beyond. I'm a young German-American girl with a flawless accent and memory sent to help the resistance infiltrate German communications in Paris and if successful, beyond. My local, bodyguard or military escort or teacher spy or fellow German infiltrator or whomever you'd like to be, and I fall for each other.

Another is to be on a boat. I'd prefer something like a research vessel or small yacht tour of an area to something big like a cruise ship. But just an extended dynamic at sea. Whether that's coworkers on a small but cozy research boat or teacher and student on an internship class studying Greek mythology on the Mediterranean or whatever or even performers on a luxury cruise ship... It's all groovy, just as long as we are on a boat and its warm.

Fourthly, we are on-air TV journalists at rival networks in a big market, New York, LA, Chicago or the like. We are seated at the same table at an annual awards banquet. The table is empty except us due to a series of events that don’t matter, and we hit it off and sleep together. This kicks off a very carefully kept secret romance. We aren’t rivals, but our stations are and our job is to beat the competition.

You are a world renowned actor/actress rock star or something similar, and since you are hopelessly disorganized and far too famous for details, you have a personal assistant follow you everywhere. I am reserved and shy but beautiful, and eventually you decide to pursue me, try to warm up the cool, professional exterior.

I thought I should post this in r/MontrealJobs, but it seems like most of the posts there are catered towards Hiring/Being Hired, and I think that my post is slightly different in nature, so I might as well post it here.

I'm in a bit of a peculiar situation at the moment. I have a DEC in Information Systems (Informatique de Gestion) from the Cégep of Trois-Rivières, I have two internships in my pocket, and the Cégep hired me for two Javascript/PHP development contracts after I finished my DEC, which I both shipped successfully.

I finished my first year at Concordia university, and at the end of October this fall, I disced my courses because I was overworked, because I took five courses which included a lot of team projects. I needed a break.

I've tried looking into employment passively for the last three weeks on Workopolis, Monster, Job-espresso, Emploi-Quebec. I've applied on about fifteen jobs I was somewhat eligible for, I sent my resume and a different motivation letter for each. I doubt I'm going to get any replies from them, in fact, all I got was a phone call from a ""recruiter"" who was a scammer and tried to steal my social security number.

I've skimmed through a lot of job offers, most of them require you to have 5 years of experience with a very specific programming language and a bachelor. Even if I had the bachelor, I wouldn't be eligible.

I need to pay my rent, I need to buy food, and sitting here either programming on personal projects or sitting around doing nothing because I know barely anything about this city is starting to get to me, I'm seriously about to just start applying on retail jobs to at least have a salary.

Can I please have some advice on what I could/should do?"

[long],[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/1s5fs6/transwoman_for_any_the_devil_is_in_the_details/,"“The devil is in the details,” she says as she drifts deliberately downward, descending along your abdomen to drizzle kisses around your hips.  Her lips are warm eager, and your skin tingles when her soft red crescents touch gently against your flesh. 

Her long brown curls tickle and tease your skin, and her hand moves between your legs. Painted fingernails trace deliciously along the sensitive skin of your inner thighs as the kisses continue, and you feel goosebumps on your flesh as the soft, light touch dances along in unpredictable patterns. 

Like the strings following the woodwinds, her tongue emerges from behind her soft lips, and her mouth moves in concert with her second hand as it comes into play, seeking your most intimate places. The warm, yielding tongue slips along sensually as the delicate, dexterous fingers add a counterpoint to the pleasure, both yearning to earn your moans of ecstasy, to satisfy that burning in your loins and eagerly lap up the resulting nectar.  

But it is not time for that. She eyes you with desire alive in her honey-colored eyes, a passionate fire with a hint of mischief that sparkles as she gathers up the disparate elements of her erotic assault on your self-control. The tempo increases, and you feel crescendo off in the distance. 

It is then she stops and eyes you hungrily, enjoying your arousal. She sees it in the beads of sweat popping up on your skin, and every time her skin touches yours she feels it in the heat of your flesh. The tremble in your hips and the look in your eye add to the picture of your excitement, but most of all she can feel it in the power and pace of your pulse when her tongue touches you.  She takes a satisfaction in your arousal, your pleasure sends shivers shooting down her spine and makes her grow inside her panties. 

The delay continues, the ache and crescendo building as she eyes you: hands, lips and tongue all paused, poised on the precipice of pleasure. 

---

So, I’m looking for detailed pen pals for ongoing role plays. When I say pen pals, I mean messages may not come more than once or twice a day. Sometimes more, sometimes even less. I also want to delay the sex. Really set a scene, establish characters and then create a connection between those characters.


I am looking for eager role players and passionate writers with an attention to detail and a working knowledge of the basic rules of grammar.  I am a busy person with a life and a job, and I know you are the same. I won’t feel bad if it takes two or three days sometimes, but I’ll be glad on the days we exchange a whole flood of orange-reds. 
If you aren’t as into the roleplay and buildup aspect as I am, we probably won’t connect. 

I’m trans by the way, so though I look and act female and have breasts and such, I still have a cock in my panties. Please don’t call me tranny or shemale or anything like that, thanks. 

Further, I am looking for detailed scenes with a unique twist. I don’t want to do barroom meetups or office romance. I have a couple of scenarios I've thought below, but am open to and would LOVE suggestions--as long as they are unique, fresh and filled with potential. 

I realize this is all quite specific, but I thought I’d give it a shot. 

We are two friends traveling the world. We were part of a larger group of college students or 30-somethings or whatever, but we did our paperwork by hand and everyone else let the travel agency do theirs. There was some snafu at a border and they couldn't carry on. We'd prepaid, and now it's just you and me on a series of foreign stops. We fall for each other as the trip progresses.


The other is, maybe you'll think it's silly, but about intrigue. I'd like to be spies, or ideally members of a resistance movement in an occupied country. Maybe court members Game of Thrones style. But mainly I'm thinking a sort of Noir' early '40s occupied Paris and beyond. I'm a young German-American girl with a flawless accent and memory sent to help the resistance infiltrate German communications in Paris and if successful, beyond. My local, bodyguard or military escort or teacher spy or fellow German infiltrator or whomever you'd like to be, and I fall for each other.


Another is to be on a boat. I'd prefer something like a research vessel or small yacht tour of an area to something big like a cruise ship. But just an extended dynamic at sea. Whether that's coworkers on a small but cozy research boat or teacher and student on an internship class studying Greek mythology on the Mediterranean or whatever or even performers on a luxury cruise ship... It's all groovy, just as long as we are on a boat and its warm.

Fourthly, we are on-air TV journalists at rival networks in a big market, New York, LA, Chicago or the like. We are seated at the same table at an annual awards banquet. The table is empty except us due to a series of events that don’t matter, and we hit it off and sleep together. This kicks off a very carefully kept secret romance. We aren’t rivals, but our stations are and our job is to beat the competition. 

You are a world renowned actor/actress rock star or something similar, and since you are hopelessly disorganized and far too famous for details, you have a personal assistant follow you everywhere. I am reserved and shy but beautiful, and eventually you decide to pursue me, try to warm up the cool, professional exterior.

1s5er9,2,2013-12-05,Ariel: Diary of a Short Film - Episode 1,ronincreative,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1s5er9/ariel_diary_of_a_short_film_episode_1/,"Ariel: Diary of a Short Film - Episode 1


Hello.  My name is John Hidalgo.  I am a film student at Austin Community College.  I am starting this diary to record my experiences while making my new short film, *Ariel*.  My hope is that it will give people an inside look at what goes on in the making of a short film.  It is also for those who may support me to see where that support is going.


The idea for *Ariel* had been with me for about three years.  When it came to me I had already written, produced and directed a couple of student projects for Austin Community College’s radio, television and film program.  I knew that at some point in the near future I would produce it.


*Ariel* came from a combination of things.   A long time ago I had gone through rape crisis intervention training through the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault to supplement assault prevention classes I was teaching.  I had been studying martial arts in the Bujinkan Dōjō system for quite some time.  My motivation for teaching assault prevention classes was partially because I wanted to bring more students into our class but also because I had a number of friends and family members that had been assaulted and felt pretty strongly about the subject. 


There were other inspirations for *Ariel*.  Without giving too much away there were a number of lessons and concepts in the Bujinkan martial arts that I always wanted to see on film.  I should note here that the martial arts that makeup the Bujjinkan system come from traditional Japanese martial schools.  The movement while being very utilitarian is not particularly flashy and difficult to portray in film.


I don’t recall exactly when I first had the idea for *Ariel* but once I did it was with me almost everyday.  Often, as I was on a long drive or laying down for bed, I would play the movie in my head, refining it and working out all the plot points until, in September of this year, it was ready to be written and written it was.  It seemed flowed onto the page.  While not perfect, I felt really, really good about it.  I have since shown it to some people and received good feedback.  I’ve got some rewriting to do but I feel the core of it is very solid.


In October, I was busy as an intern at the Austin Film Festival and did not get to work on Ariel as much as I would have liked.  That being said, I was still indirectly doing work that would later be applied to what I am doing now.  Working at AFF gave me great insight into the world of film festivals.  I was also afforded the opportunity to attend the festival. There were a number of great panels but the one that really stood out was one on film financing.  At this particular panel was John T. Trigoinis, author of the book “Crowdfunding for Filmmakers” (see: [http://www.amazon.com/Crowdfunding-Filmmakers-Successful-Film-Campaign/dp/1615931333/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1386229683&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=trigonis](http://www.amazon.com/Crowdfunding-Filmmakers-Successful-Film-Campaign/dp/1615931333/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1386229683&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=trigonis) ).  He had some great advice.  One of the nuggets he shared was to not focus so much on getting the money but instead focus on building an audience and, further, building a relationship with that audience.  He also advised taking great care with the experience the audience members had with being a part of your project.  I came out of the Austin Film Festival pumped up and ready to go.


Starting in November, I started doing all the preliminary logistics that one normally does for a film.  I consulted with both the Texas Film Commission and the Austin Film Commission and found them to be extremely helpful.  I did some preliminary research about insurance and right now have my eye on Fractured Atlas.  I also started location scouting for which I still have a lot to do.  I am luck in that one of the locations is the dōjō where I used to teach.  That one was easy to secure. 


Starting in November I started getting the word out about auditions.  Fortunately, from previous productions I had built up an extensive list of actors.  In addition to that I did the obligatory craiglist.org post, posted in a number of places on reddit.com and made a posting on shortfilmtexas.com.  Lastly, I got on stage32.com, a new social media platform for filmmaking, and sent individual audition notices to every actor in Austin.  It paid off.  My original expectation was that I would be doing good to have twenty people respond.  As of today there are sixty-two people who have said that they are coming to the audition this Sunday.  Wow.  That was much better than I expected.  Now, with any audition, there is always a difference between the number of people that say they will come and the people who actually show up.  Still, that is pretty good.


November was also when I started laying the ground work for the social media that will be used to promote the film and the crowd funding campaign.  I want to say for the record that I have just about overdosed on social media.  In the course of about a week I got a secondary Facebook page with the page for Ariel tied to it, a blog and three twitter accounts. There is also the before mentioned Stage32 account.  No joke.  Social media can easily be a full time job.  I got to the point where I have put it aside for the moment so I can focus on all the preproduction stuff that needs to be done.  Then, of course, there is the web site which right now is just the audition notice.


There is so much to do.  The storyboards are only a quarter of the way done and the script needs revisions.  I still need to find the main location.  Furthermore, there is a pitch video that needs to be written, storyboarded, rehearsed and shot by the end of the month.  Of course, I’ll need to get the crew together to shoot said pitch video. I need to get to the bank make sure that everything is in place to receive the crowd funding and then get everything set up with Indiegogo. 


If it sounds like I am complaining, I’m not.  I am very happy with the work I am doing.  It is work, but it is good work.  I am looking forward to the process and especially to see the finished film.

She constantly reminds me that I mean more than the world to her. She is always happy to see me, like a cute puppy. She even told me I have a beautiful soul and it is just tearing me apart because I don't feel the same way about her...

I do love her, and I do care about her, otherwise this wouldn't be so hard. Its just that our life isn't what I want. It just isn't. I gave up so many dreams for her thinking that a healthy long-term relationship was what I wanted. During Thanksgiving break, I visited my extended family. My aunt (who I haven't seen in several years) asked me why I wasn't a soldier yet, since I had been gung-ho about it before meeting my GF. I felt weird about it. My grandmother took me aside and asked me if I was really happy with my life. She told me that I need to take charge and enjoy it while I can because I shouldn't give up on my dreams and regret it for the next 60 years of my life. I nodded and smiled and reassured her that I was going where I wanted to go. She also asked me about my girlfriend and why she seemed immature and overweight. She talked about how beautiful my mother was the first time they met and how she wishes the same kind of beautiful, confident girl for me.

The more I thought about what she said, the more it hit me. I'm not happy. I don't want to be in college. I never wanted to go. I always wanted to be in the military since I was a boy. I started thinking about my girlfriend and what she had said about her. And she was right about that too. My GF has gained over 60 pounds since we started dating and blames it on iron supplements, despite constantly eating out. She wont accompany me to the gym. She slacks off on her grades. She slacks off on her hygiene. She starts fights with her sister. She whines and whines and whines about everything under the sun. She always asks me to do everything for her because she doesn't want to get off the couch. I starting realizing that all she does is annoy me. Every time I'm around her, I just want to leave. Every time I'm alone, I worry about when I have to go see her again. I stay up until ungodly hours just so I can make up for time lost during the day. Then I started realizing that I'm not attracted to her anymore. I very rarely initiate sex and when we do it, my head is barely in the room with us. I am constantly wishing I could meet other girls and establish a relationship with a healthy girl who can take care of her own and knows where she is going in life. Someone who can take charge and roll with the punches.

I want to join the military. Maybe not active duty, but I do want to have that experience and say I did it. I want to make a legacy and have my future children look up to me for it. I want to do something exciting and different while I'm still young. I've been looking into the National Guard, both Army and Air Force. I just don't know when to do it. I don't know if I should graduate and then go to BCT or go to BCT and then graduate. I'm on track to finish next December, but my last semester is an internship with a police department. The police department is ultimately where I want to end up down the line. I was thinking I could do BCT/AIT in the fall and just delay my graduation until the following Spring or Summer.... But first that means breaking up with my girlfriend and breaking the news to my mother. My father is already aware of everything in this post since I called him up last week all upset...

Well anyway, thanks for listening."

1s4tkx,2,2013-12-04,seeking advice on UNC grad schools! also on working with: adolescents/anxiety-autism/hispanics,[deleted],socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/1s4tkx/seeking_advice_on_unc_grad_schools_also_on/,"Hi any help I can get is much appreciated! I am very thankful for this community and read frequently- I will try to keep this brief and have a tl;dr at the bottom because I know that social workers lead rather busy lives.

I am undergraduate junior psychology student at UNC Asheville- I have some internship experience with autistic adolescents/youths (age 5-16) and plan to do another internship next semester hopefully with a hispanic population, ideally adolescents because I'm spanish-american and bilingual, and I have experience with autistic youths already. After completing that internship next semester I would ideally want to work with the same population again in a first semester senior year field work placement, and then that way I will have experience when I apply to grad school that pertains to the population I want to work with- just to provide some background info. 

For monetary reasons I'm planning on staying in the UNC system, so if anyone has experience with these schools and working with kids, especially hispanic populations, that would be fantastic. As far as general knowledge though, I have also had difficulty finding out the exact costs of most programs - I've heard bad things about how expensive it can get.. but I haven't seen that so far..

for example:
http://ssw.unc.edu/files/web/2012%20Welcome%20Weekend%20-%20Financial%20Aid.pdf

according to this the complete tuition for the entire program for a resident is 31,000~? I apologize if I am being dumb I just don't understand these things sometimes and if anyone could help me with the costs of these schools that would be great but mostly I just want advice on the programs in general, the money is secondary (as long as i stay within state!)- so heres some of the other ones I've been glancing at:

East Carolina University, Appalachian State University, UNC Charlotte... can't think of or find any of the others in the UNC system that offer MSWs right now

I do have some concerns about getting into these schools, because I have a 2.8 gpa although last semester I got all a 3.5+~ and plan to continue to do well until I finish so that my last 3 semesters gpa when I apply will be above 3.0 at the worst hopefully.. close to 4.0 ideally- also my internships should help the fact that I have a poor overall gpa- As far as I can tell UNC Chapel Hill has the most prestigious program, so if anyone could tell me if I have a shot or not that would be comforting, as I have had difficulty finding people talking about that sort of thing (their gpa/types of internships or experiences that got them in)

and I've looked at the different concentrations of each briefly but they ultimately seem pretty similar in alot of ways, all of the UNC schools.  I would like to do a concentration/masters that leads me to direct care / private practice setting but would also allow me eventually go into HR/management/non-profit settings. Is this something I should worry about? Any detailed or general info/experiences would be greatly appreciated

Also, I worry that working with a latino population will be  low-paying and stressful, but I feel that I clearly have an advantage in the field/with the population given the language barrier and I would love to be able to help hispanic youths integrate into american society because I experienced many speech/cultural problems as a result of my spanish-american descent and upbringing, and would've loved to have such an opportunity. I am also interested in working with anxiety related issues/populations and would be interested in any advice concerning that.

I apologize for rambling, any advice on these topics would be helpful even if it is not area or population specific.

TL;DR: I am a bilingual psyc Undergrad - If I have a shitty GPA (..3.2~, lets say) and have 3 semesters worth of internships working directly with youths/people do I have a shot at getting into a decent msw grad school? UNC-Chapel hill, specifically?
Are any of the other schools in the UNC system really good/bad? 
How expensive / hard to get into are these schools? 
Any of them have field work that you guys know of that works with hispanic youth populations? 
Any advice on why I should or shouldn't specialize in / work with hispanic populations? 

thank you for your time and any advice!

1s4jmq,2,2013-12-04,Advice on dealing with mounting pressure and feeling undervalued in work?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1s4jmq/advice_on_dealing_with_mounting_pressure_and/,"Hey guys, I'm hoping someone here could give me some perspective and advice. (Essay, but there is a TL;DR below)

I'm an intern in a rapidly expanding media company. I've been here three months and I enjoy the work but the workload and deadlines are immense. I came in with the understanding I would spend 6 months improving my video editing and graphic design skills. After that I would be introduced to project management, with a view to be overseeing projects by the end of my first year.

The company's client list is expanding rapidly (great news) and the work is piling in. I was started managing projects for international clients within my first month. And not just one project, **I was given multiple projects to be delivered simultaneously with little training or experience.**

Now I'm an intelligent, hardworking guy, I know I am getting valuable experience and I'm being tested in a way I haven't before so I've thrown myself into it. I've pulled late nights, weekends, 60-70 hour weeks to get shit done. I've also had to put any of my own media training on the back burner over and over again.

I just delivered the first two of my projects. One of the other editors called it the best stuff they'd ever produced but I didn't get a response from my manager or my boss. Not positive or negative, but nothing. I'm not looking for balloons and a cake but after managing a team of six guys for 2 months to deliver something huge for a big client I expected some sort of feedback.

**I earn about 200 bucks a week, I have quit my other commitments to make time for the job and I feel undervalued, unguided and out of my depth at times.**

The boss took me aside last Friday because he is concerned that I don't know how to handle pressure and that I'm looking stressed. I am a positive, upbeat influence in our production team and I have managed to deliver the projects earlier than deadlines. I don't think that he gets to see me enough to make a judgement like that but if he said it then it must be apparent every now and again.

How can I deal with mounting pressure in work? I work hard to keep things in perspective and to take time away from work but I am having a hard time keeping positive and managing effectively. I haven't been able to improve my editing skills and I rarely see friends or family.

How can I balance my work life, my social life and training myself in the craft?

**TL;DR: I'm under pressure in work, not getting paid for 60 hour weeks and I want to know how to manage the pressure and the workload, be a positive and effective asset to the team.**"
1s4bod,1,2013-12-04,I'm [M18] and my ex [F18] broke up with me a couple of months ago and I'm still not over her.,Throwaway0958,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1s4bod/im_m18_and_my_ex_f18_broke_up_with_me_a_couple_of/,"I just want this pain to go away we were going out for what would've been 2 years next month.


She broke up with me and moved abroad for an internship a couple of months ago only telling me that she had the same time she broke up with me and I thought with her out the country it would've made it so much easier but it hasn't.  I've also been doing the whole no contact thing and I feel like it's been helping, but I just want to talk to her so much and ask how she is and how she's doing but I know it'll only make it worse.


My mother is also Bipolar, which doesn't help as she has had one of her off weeks and is trying to sell her car and guess who she rings? My ex's uncle who's a mechanic and has a go at him when he can't help her. So I have to sort it out by ringing my ex's family, which destroyed me emotionally talking to them. 


I've been told by friends to just do things that I enjoy and think about myself for a while, which doesn't help as everything that is me and I enjoy I used to do with her I mean like I used to practically live at her house I did everything. Which means when I try to do something all I can think about is how we used to do that, which is really cliche I know. 


When it first happened her best friend ( I dated her for like a month like a year before me and my ex got together) started to talk to me, which was really nice asking how I was and generally talking to me which was helping. Until recently it just kinda seems like she's interested in me again because we were talking one night and she asks me after we're taking about how she thinks I seem happier and more free to which I respond with
""yea the freedoms nice but I'd happily go back""
She asks
""Would you still choose to get back with her""
I replied with
""Yea I guess if she came back because it wasn't working out over there""
She replied back so hmm okay speak tomorrow. 
this was at like 10pm


And there's just other little things she's said that's makes me think that she might be interested again, which I'm absolutely not as I'm not ready for another relationship. 


I just don't know what to do and would like some advice as to what to do in my situation. 


Tl;dr been broke up with my ex girlfriend of about 2 years for a couple of months still hurting; my mother is bipolar and isn't helping the matter at all by causing situations and think her best friend (another ex) might be interested in me again, which I'm completely not ready for. I just don't know what to do about anything anymore and need some advice.

1s9wg6,1,2013-12-06,"I'm lonely, fuck my life",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1s9wg6/im_lonely_fuck_my_life/,"First of, pardon my bad grammar and spelling, i'm no native speaker. But i kinda just need to get this out of my system right now.

In a couple of hours i will turn 24, and looking at it realistically i've not accomplished anything in my life. No proper relationship, no job, no education. Nothing, really. That in itself is saddening enough for me, however, i felt things going upward for me again lately, just to realize that it hasnt as much as i hoped to. Maybe i have too high expectations or hopes.

When i was in the 10th grade my mum passed away unexpectedly due to a lung embolism. No time to say goodbye, it came as a complete shock. Basicly my dad woke me up at 6 in the morning that day asking me wether i'm completly oblivous to the fact that my mother is getting reanimated in the room below me. That was also the day she died, no chance to say goodbye properly. From that point on i kinda spun out of control. Not to blame it solely on her death - something which people around me like to do and that shit infuriates me kinda, cause i know its not true, but it was the final nail in the coffin for my psychological wellbeing. I already had my fair share of issues beforehand though.

I passed the 10th grade just narrowly and basicly on the grace of the teachers because they knew what happened. My friends didnt know how to deal with the situation and with me shutting myself more and more off from my surroundings. When the elevent grade started i started skipping days more and more. Until i was too afraid to show up at school anymore, literrally being unable to get out of bed in the morning. Needless to say, i got kicked out of school, however, they were gratious enough to allow me to re-enlist in the next year so i was basicly given half a year to sort out my issues. I tried, but honestly, i tried halfassed. And so the attempt of getting back into school was doomed from the start and resulted in me leaving school after just another couple of months again. My Dad couldnt handle the situation and kicked me out. I should have seen the warning signs comming, but i was too deep in my own shit to see it comming. Until the police was at our place one morning, moving me escorting me out of the house and issuing an order to stay away from home. That being said, i wasn't violent, i didnt steal, i wasn't involved with drugs - i was simply just depressed. I'm not blaming my Dad, he didnt know how to help himself anymore with his wife of 20 years passing so early and being forced to raise three kids on his own from one day to another and things spinning out of control.

I moved in with my best and only friend then, his parents were nice enough to let my sorry 18 year old ass stay under their roof. I did a 6 month civil service then as a nurse, and during that time things went up for me again. I was able to get on my feet, or well, at least i was occupied for the time being and i felt that i was doing a positive impact on peoples lifes that were off worse then mine. I was enjoying the job, so much that i wanted to make it my profession. The clinic i worked in was more then pleased with me and asked me to renew my contract to the maximum of 18 months. However, since they are a private run clinic of a small size they were not allowed to give me a spot as an apprentice. And stupid me thought, well, rather get an apprenticeship. Mistake two was that my Dad saw my ""recovery"" and asked me to move back in. Which i did, and then i fell back into my old habits. I started working in a factory on minimum wage to support my dad while looking for an apprenticeship as a nurse, were i got more and more depressed again, to a point were i stopped having the mental strenghts to get myself out there anymore. I dropped that job, and my depression got so bad again that i was basicly just slobbing around for another 2 years. Doing the occassional job here and there, but nothing of substance. It got so bad, that i had the medical service from the state come to my house and basicly give me a nugde to start on antidepressants. Once i started taking meds, things went uphill again. I secured myself a internship at another clinic that basicly told me if i do well, i would get an apprenticeship there. Fair deal, i started working my ass off there, seeing the ""light at the end of the tunnel"". But doing so, i completly forgot how to life. I went to work, came back, slept, repeat. No strenght to do anything else with the day. It got so bad that i didnt have enough power in me to get to my doctors appointments to get my antidepressants. Soon after, i was done completly and had to drop out of that internship because i just couldnt do it anymore.

Back to square one, im 21 at that point. Again, doing the ocassional job here and there, applying for apprenticeships which got significantly harder because of my age, holes in my resumee and bad grades from school. Despite having really good written work resumees from both clinics. Honestly, the second clinic would have probably taken me on again, but i was to embarassed to go back there again. Took me two years to regain my composure basicly, until i realized i wont get shit done myself. So i wrote to the court in order to get a supervisor that would take a bit of baggage off me. A pretty humiliating experience, because doing so also forces me to give away some of my rights to said person. However, it helped. But more on that later. In the meantime i was also trying to get help from our state work agency on my quest to secure myself an apprenticeship. However, they labeled me a nutcase pretty much and marked me as unfit to carry do an apprenticeship. Which also meant that i wasnt getting half-orphan rent and childsupport anymore - which also ment that i would drop out of our healthinsurance - aka no chance to get the meds anymore i so needed. Not even speaking about therapy.

My after 4 months of going through medical and psychological tests i finally got my supervisor. From then on shit went uphill. However, with the apprenticeships for that season already being giving away and me not wanting to waste another year doing nothing i decided to apply to a school instead. I always wanted to study nursing management after finishing my apprenticeship anyway, and the school would take the same ammount of time (3 years) as the apprenticeship aswell. Plus i would be able to not just study nursing management, but also medicine or even psychology if my grades are good enough. Also i thought to myself it would maybe be a nice end to my odyssee, finishing what i couldnt before. With the support of my supervisor i was also able to get my own place which ment i could get out of the enviroment that drained and enabled me so much before. Breaking the circle pretty much. I got accepted to the school in a bit of luck, and im doing good so far on terms of grades aswell as actually showing up and working hard, instead of just slacking off.

However, something which i hoped for, kinda a new start is not working out for me as much as i hoped. And thats whats getting me down really. After completly isolating me for a long time socially, i just have that one strong friendship with the guy mentioned earlier going for me. Roughly 2 years ago that guy got into a relationship with a superawesome girl aswell, im geniounly happy for him and she quickly became one of my good friends aswell. Though, both of them carry their fair share of experiences with depression and baggage with them aswell. While i managed to get a bit of upwind going for me, for both of them, especially my best friend its been going downhill lately. Needless to say, they are pretty isolated themselves, he is battleing with sociophobia and she moved here for him, but doesnt know anyone really here except me and her boyfriend. So, as egoistical as that sounds, i'm faced with a dilemma. My old friends are long moved away from this shitplace to study and frankly we've grown apart. My only two friends have no contacts either. In turn, im lonely. I do hard with getting to know people. But i thought maybe i could get social contacts at school going, to get back into a social life, starting to live again. However, there is the issue of the agegap. While im turning 24 in an hour as of now, the next oldest in my class is 19, then two 18 year olds and the rest being 16-17. And as much as i try i dont seem to fit in. It doesnt seem to be a problem in school, quite the opposite. However, when i was feeling bold a last week to invite the people from my nursing-curse to my homewarming party i got great responses AT school, but ultimatively only 2 showed off. It doesnt really help that im one of the only 5 guys among another 24 girls, but you get the deal. No big deal i thought, especially since people asked to come to my birthday. So i thought, well, lets just go for it again this weekend. Invite a couple of people who seemed geniounly intrested, people confirmed they would come, so i bought some drinks and shit, only to find out all 7(!) invited people cancelling on me an hour before the supposed start. Great. Doesnt help that neither my best friend nor his girlfriend made the effort to come over either - and they literally live next door to me. We're prolly going out tommorow, but it doesnt help with me just sitting here and realizing how fucking lonely i became. As much i want to life, enjoy myself and being awesome, there is noone that is willing to do so with me. Its a weird feeling of dont belonging. I cant relate to people in my agebracket are unintrested in me because were not on the same page in life, and the people that im on the same page with are not intrested in me because of the agegap and difference in maturity (or maybe the harsh truth is that im just an unintresting weirdo).

Fuck my life. Just needed to vent this out

You immediately noticed how small your hand felt in mine. I'm a young black law student applying to work as your summer intern. I'm wearing a slim fit navy suit, a plain white shirt, and a tie. My head is shaved, and I have just a shadow of facial stubble.

You're a successful lawyer, and you've invited me to interview to intern with you in your office overlooking the city. You've spent the morning interviewing potential candidates, but have been annoyed with the low quality of the interviews so far. Frustrated, you initially hoped to finish my interview quickly so you could go to lunch.

I've impressed you, though, with my quick wit and good sense of humor. I've even made you laugh a couple times. You've warned me about how much work I'm going to have to do and the long hours I'll have to stay, but I've responded with the appropriate acknowledgement of such difficulties, noting that I'd be more than willing to work that hard for such an attractive boss.

You thought you saw me sneaking a peek at your cleavage, but you couldn't tell. The mere thought of a good looking black man taking an interest in your body excites you just enough to make you blush.

The interview has come to a close, and you have lunch scheduled immediately following. We stood next to your desk to shake hands, and I leaned in to give you a peck on the cheek. Of course, that's usually not how an interview concludes, so you were a little thrown, but strangely comfortable with it. We continue to stand there for a moment, looking each other in the eye, not saying anything, neither of us releasing our grip of the handshake . . .

What happens next? PM me to continue.

1s8l6i,6,2013-12-06,How can you tell if you're actually depressed or just being weak? + wall of text...,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1s8l6i/how_can_you_tell_if_youre_actually_depressed_or/,"I'm currently a college student in my last year and I struggle a lot with reality. The past four years of my life have been a blur... most of my time was spent in my room gaming. I'd occasionally go the gym to play basketball. Outside of that I didn't really do much. I didn't go out to meet new people.  I didn't join any organizations. I never seriously looked for any work opportunities. Maybe this was because of social anxiety...I'm not sure.

Suicide has always been lingering in my mind. I had no internship or coop that semester (I've worked before but nothing really significant or related to my major) so I just went home and did nothing. After messing up my first semester of school I thought that I could fix it next semester. Then I screwed up the next semester... and I continued to do worse and worse every semester. I had just finished my senior year so I was getting to the end of college. Well honestly I should have probably graduated already... Anyway I'm pretty sure I was a huge burden to my parents, who are really supportive. The only thing they ask for is that I do my best in school and I couldn't even do that. Gaming was getting old as a lot of my friends had quit or were playing other games. Maybe I was just losing interest. With nothing to do I had a lot of time to think. And my bumming around eventually led to arguments with my parents. All of this began to force me to face reality and I didn't like it. I had been avoiding reality for so long that I was overwhelmed. I wanted to permanently run away... I had a handful of pills ready, but I just couldn't do it. I broke down realizing that I wanted to live, yet I didn't know what to do. 

At 22 years old I should be grown up, but I feel as if I'm a high school student, maybe younger. I missed out on a lot of growth opportunities by staying in my room. I couldn't get out of my comfort zone. I had/have very low confidence. This could be because of image problems I had... acne, clothes, body issues, etc. Anyway after a lot of prodding from my parents I ended up applying and getting a job that forced me to communicate with customers and coworkers. I worked in high school, but it wasn't really a serious job (I did ""tutoring""). For a time I was actually happy. A huge problem for me was just admitting that my people skills weren't there. I was able to improve my people skills a bit. 

Then the Fall semester began. I was ""optimistic"" but within a month, maybe two, I had screwed up already. I ended up dropping a course and quitting my job as I thought it was taking up too much time. Still, I was optimistic... I had a fake-it-till-you-make-it attitude. I tried to study more and I was meeting people. (Also this is a bit random to mention now but I was also doing better in my faith. I'm a Christian but I never really practiced all that much...went through the motions though) I did fairly well on my tests. I was studying a day or two in advance and getting sleep before a test which helped a lot. (Before I would pull all nighters learning the material for tests) Then I started slipping... I began to miss lectures and start homework/studying late. I felt very inadequate with respect to group projects. I didn't see a point in trying anymore as I kept thinking that even if I could graduate, I wouldn't be able to find a job. Fast forward to the present and my finals are coming up next week and I'm a wreck. My sleep schedule is severely messed up and I'm feeling overwhelmed. I keep thinking that I'm going to fail so why even try. This has been a reoccurring theme in my life. I honestly don't even know why I'm typing this. I think originally I was going to ask a question, but ended up typing up a wall of text. I'm missing a lot of things but this is basically my situation. I apologize for the terrible writing. 

Oh the question... how does one know if they're actually/(clinically?) depressed. I've always wondered if maybe I have some mental problems but then again maybe I'm just weak. My father does take meds for depression but I don't think it's hereditary."

I need a webhost that is at minimum capable of the following:
1. Embedding some of my game works Unity Webplayer and/or Flash Shell.
2. Showing off my works in an image-heavy format and .zip downloadables. (for people unwilling or unable to use the webplugins to view the web versions of the works.
3. A blog to show the updates on my current work.

I have coding experience related to game development and design, but haven't done any webdesign before.

[24/m]",helpyall,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1s8cxo/19f_potentially_breaking_off_my_first_longterm/,"Okay, so... this is quite the story, but I hope that someone will be able to lend a word or two of advice.

I am a 19 year old young lady currently residing with my boyfriend, who is 24, in North Carolina.  Our two year anniversary is coming up on Tuesday, 12/10, and we first started dating when I was 17 and he was 22; he took my virginity after about 8 months of friendship/on-again-off-again dating, and we started officially dating the next day.

When we first started dating, I lived in a dorm, and since he had an apartment, we practically were living together from the very first day of our relationship, and we ""officially"" moved in together the May following.  When we first started dating and moved in together, I started experiencing severe depression, and I thought it was just a symptom of the change to college, since I was a Freshman, and all of the stress that as I was under.  At the time, my boyfriend (22) was not in school at all but had taken a few courses at the local community college in the past.  He was a manager at Dominoes though, and had to make up for the hours that I couldn't work (and thus, the bills that I couldn't pay) because of school.  He also had a pretty bad drinking problem.

We have since adopted a doggie, Ruthie.  This year, my bf is finally back in school (because I filled out his application and FAFSA for him) and is taking ONE online class while continuing to work at Dominoes.  Despite experiencing severe disagreements and even dealing with some ""manic"" episodes of my boyfriend (since he is diagnosed with bipolar), I no longer feel severely depressed or seek services for depression, and my boyfriend's drinking problem has gotten much better.  However, at the moment, I am taking 18 credit hours (double major and a minor) as well as working as a waitress, and holding the position of President for an organization on campus as well as an internship.  With all this going on, I am keeping up my grades fairly well and am doing my best to keep myself and my life balanced, but I still feel like I am having to provide constant support to him because of the stress he's under from work and his one, single class.

I don't mean to act demeaning or anything about it, but honestly I feel exhausted by supporting him and I don't feel like he understands the amount of responsibilities that I'm currently taking on.  Because of this, a lot of resentment is created and for me, it almost feels like a chore to even spend time with him anymore.  For the past 8 months or so, our sex-life has been practically nonexistent, even though we used to be very active and healthy about it; I just haven't been interested (and we were also going through a period of hormonal issues because of birth control problems) but I am still not interested and could almost even describe myself as ""uncomfortable"" in some (NOT ALL) situations when he's coming on to me.  I don't feel like I am giving him the support he needs, and I feel like I need to return to the single life for a little while to take some time to really be comfortable with myself and appreciate myself and appreciate the life I'm living and give it my best effort, after all... I'm only 19 and I have a lot of life ahead of me, and suddenly a lot of paths that are opening up.

However, on the other side of the story: as frustrated, upset, or ""uninterested"" that I become, he is still my very best friend.  He is the one that I feel like I can talk to without inhibitions, that I can be totally open with, totally gross with, and totally myself with, free of judgment (most of the time).  He's the man I share my bed with, my house with, and we even have a dog together.  It is really, really hard for me to imagine my life without his presence in it.  He's been practically all that I have had over the past two years until just recently.

Not to mention, I don't know where I would go, considering none of my friends have extra rooms in their apartments (not that I mind couch-surfing, but I can only do that for so long), and my waitressing job doesn't really afford me a big enough budget to afford a place on my own (or even a dorm on my own).  I'm afraid I would lose the confidence that I've recently acquired, and I also worry that the problems we are facing could be (and should be) fixed and that that is what it takes for a real relationship to work.

(But then I ask myself if I even want a real relationship.)

I feel like I'm facing a lot of teen angst, and I really need some advice as to where to go from here.  I have no idea how to break it off with him or how to followup to secure my own basic needs, but I am feeling like I just have no idea how to handle all of these conflicting emotions or this large of a problem by myself.  I don't want to hurt him because I genuinely care about him, and I don't want to throw him away since he is my best friend, but it's starting to feel like it may not be in my best interest to stick around.... help?

If you need more details, or if there is a better place to post this, please let me know!

As the title says, trying to decide on some options. My girlfriend will need a car for 6-8 months as part of an internship this coming January (we're both college students). However, I'm trying to figure out the best possible option for her.

A friend of mine is going to lease a car from VW and then they'll buy back the lease from him at the end. I think it's costing him somewhere between 5-8k for the entire 6 months. Part of me thinks that this is somewhat a good deal in terms of getting a brand new car with limited mechanical issues. However, it is very expensive to walk away with nothing at the end.

I'm also evaluating purchasing a car. However, the budget is around 4-6k and she would prefer something high up (Family has a Pilot and she really likes it) that can handle the snow in Boston. The commute would be around 20-30miles every weekday for 6-8 months, so reliability is important. Looking at the usual suspects (Camry/Corrolla/Accord, as well as RAV4/CRV/potentially Cherokee [but reliability could be so so]). The car would most likely be sold at the end of use, so this is the cheaper option, but I'm just worried about not finding a decent car for the price.

If any of you guys have any ideas for a short term car use, I'd really appreciate it! Thanks guys! Let me know if I've forgotten any details."

I work for an HCM Consulting company, but a bit more on the technical side. My major was in the business school, but focused on information technology. I had an internship last summer where I pretty much strictly wrote VBA in Excel. It got me a lot of experience, and I have started using it at my new job. I'm quickly earning the reputation of Excel guru at my already technically savvy company. I enjoy writing VBA, but I know it can barely even be considered the tip of the iceberg. I took a class each on VBA, VB, and Java in college, but that is about the extent of my education. I've started the Stanford C-Objective course on iTunes U in my spare time.

That's just a bit of background. Basically, I'm enjoying the technical aspects of my job. I know it is still very early on (only 6 months in), but I can't help but see myself more and more interested in programming. I currently work from home once a week, and I enjoy the independence. My family is very entrepreneurial and I can't imagine it will be long before I start something on the side.

I'm here looking for recommendations on how to develop myself as a programmer. Would a Master's in CS be beneficial to me? I can't help but see it as a waste of money with all the online (free) resources. Of course the resume builder is a huge part of it. My basic plan right now is to start learning as much as I can about different languages and find what I like - then I can go from there when I have more information. Am I underestimating what is involved in starting a CS career?

I feel a lot more naive about the world of programming now than when I started writing this post. Thanks for any input!

EDIT: TL;DR: I majored in IT, have a job, but quickly becoming more interested in programming. Where do I start?"

I'm writing as I go and as what little I can think does come to me. I'm to the point where I understand I need to write; however, I'm apathetic to my own cause; so please accept my apology if this isn't concise nor brief. Background: Well this started about 2 years ago when I first went to college at a small school only about two hours away from my home town. I was dating a girl at the time and had been doing so for about 3 years when I left and she stayed to attend a nearby state university. I arrived at college having the impression that making friends would be easy, school hard, ready to take on the world and having someone behind me. I received a scholarship to run at this college and assumed that the team would be like a fraternity of close friends. Oh how was I wrong. Also, i decided going in to college that I was going to be a chemistry major, placed out of the freshmen classes for chemistry, and went straight into organic chemistry, at a school known for its academic rigor in chemistry. Pretty much I surreptitiously created my own perfect storm. Within the first week I quickly realized the juxtaposition I was placed. While participating in freshmen orientation events we, other freshmen on the team and I, planned to bail and attend a fraternity party that the upper classmen, on the team, were apart of. As it was approaching the predetermined time to leave, I told the guys I was going to participate in one final event and then we could head out- they agreed. Well, I went and did whatever; however, by the time I finished (no more than 2 minutes later) I saw them entering the dorms (appx. 75 meters away), look back, look me in the goddamn eyes, and then leave. One of these guys I was living with at the time as well, so our relationship was a little strained out of the blocks. This was not the only occurrence of something of this nature, but week after week I would get left out of team activities-per not even getting an invitation. Normally running was a good release for me; however, I had a nagging injury from high school that prevent me from really running all that well, so that didn't help the situation. School: Well, taking organic as a first semester freshman in college is no joke as I found; also discovered I was only one of a handful to ever do so in the schools almost 200 year history. Well, instead of trying to go out and make new friends, I studied: 6,7,8 hours a day just grinding away in the library, trying to pass this damn class which just put more strain on everything. Girlfriend: This girl was my rock, i confided every aspect of my life with her; however, she had her own attachment problems and has a myriad of other mental issues. Well, she wasnt taking the distance too well and i didn't want to burden her with my issues, so I decided not to tell her, but rather would be verbally abusive to her via anger about my situation. I wouldnt tell her exactly what was going on, just be angry about everything and anything by holding in all my frustration with everything where I was, which put a strain on our relationship and thus everything else. Religion: I was also going through a spiritual crossroads at this point in respect to morality, my relationship with my girlfriend, my personal choices, my thoughts and actions, and just a slew of everything, which put a strain on my mental state, my work, my nonexistent friends, and my girlfriend- yes I had the perfect storm for everything around me to collapse- and it did. My girlfriend and I broke up, I had to-unsuccessfully- call out my teammates for their bullshit, I had to call home in tears that I couldnt make it another day at this place that was suppose to make me stronger. It just goes downhill from here. Within 24 hours of breaking up my ex-girlfriend fucked another guy and within  a month she started dating him- after 3 1/2 years. Oh, its just starting-

So, surprisingly after all that, it didn't really mentally hit me until the spring semester when I spiraled into an intense depression and my grades deteriorated- However, I joined a fraternity but didn't really know anyone in it until I was almost done pledging; joining has been good and bad. Depression: Well, I think depression sucks: the best way to describe my mind when I had depression was this: ""let's say that a normal persons brain is an open field and rays of sunlight are coherent and progressive thoughts. Okay, now my brain is a dense topical jungle on a foggy day; aint no sunlight getting through that."" As a person who values intellectual progression, thought, and philosophy, its very difficult to be unable to think in any way shape or form- I couldnt even think my own thoughts, but rather they would get lost in the clouds. of nothingness that enshrouded my mental psyche. During the second semester my rapport with the team improved and my social network expanded slightly due to the fraternity; however, only a few of them could I really call close friends. I did start running well which really helped and by the end of the semester I was able to see the light at the end of my own fog. 

However, that was just the beginning- for the next year or so I was rather maniac depressive for a few days to a week or so at the time; with the semi state of fog dipping in and out and, I feel as though, just the normal struggles of anyone my age. So, what this post is really about is this semester. **sorry this is so long**

Over the summer I worked as an intern at a church, hanging out with middle schoolers and really helping them in any struggles they had or questions they had pertaining to anything really. Well, problem one was I was struggling with my own spirituality still, so it was pretty much the blind leading the blind in that regard; well sort of, because I know the text of the bible well enough to lead anyone who asks a question in the right direction. I digress. I also started ""dating"" this girl over the summer who was great for me considering the circumstances. I came back from school very much a college student, cussing more than someone should, and had other just poor habits. She was the type of person to call you out on any bullshit. It was great, except we knew the end: that I was returning to college and she was going to stay where I lived and teach (she's a 5th grade teacher)-  After a few weeks back at school, we met up and she broke up with me. I accepted this because I knew it was probably for the best.(*ill address this more later**) Towards the end of the summer I noticed the fog coming back, usually just a few hours at a time, then a day or so, then when I got back to school, it really hit full force- like right out of gate. I pretty much was unable to study, unable to think- I'd sit in the library and just stare, not thinking or contemplating, just thinking about absolutely nothing- unable to think about anything. I tried to keep my head high for as long as I could until I started failing my classes- not C and D failing- straight up had a 50% in two of the three classes I am taking. I communicated this to my mom and she told me to get tutors, study, and get my shit together, but she was supportive. I told her it was pretty much impossible to study and tried to explain the situation I am going through to her. I told her I wanted to leave, take the rest of the semester off and try to do some soul searching- really remove myself from the situation and see if any improvement would occur- unfortunately my tuition had already been paid and my parents said I have to at least finish up the semester. However, I did schedule an appointment for therapy at the school- at least realizing that that may help. At this point its about 3/4 of the way through the semester and I'm still failing 2 classes and my grade in maybe a C in the other-so its not really looking up. I once again talk to my mom and she says she'll send me some of the younger sister's ADHD medication (vayarin) to try and help, thinking I may have ADHD. Long story short- after a few weeks on the medication, I can think some days(!), but still probably only about 60% of myself on average. The doctor diagnosed me with depression and prescribed me anti-depressants.

 However, my real problems lie within the depression itself- the clouding causes me to have anxiety, maniac mood swings (mainly anger- angry at myself for doing this to me, angry because I dont think I deserve, angry because I cant think, angry because I cant progress, angry because I'm scared ill be like this forever, angry because of the uncertain future, angry because I can't feel, only lust; because I of my lost drive,angry because of my utter lack of self-confidence, angry because my running sucks, because I can't be self-reflective, introspective, or progressive, angry because I am the cause of all of it), completely and total apathy toward almost all aspects of my life. Last night, as i broke down, I realized that I am empty inside. Empty because my thoughts are not progressive, I do not think forward, I can not think about something and then be creative and raise a problem, I can only react to what is previously stated and be somewhat reflective on the implications of that thought or statement- and to that, only in a superficial way-only think in the since that I can absorb information- I can absorb knowledge and regurgitate facts if I truly put all the mental power I can gather and focus on one goal- which I can barely do, as I am writing this it is taking more or less all in power not to turn away and just sit and do nothing, just lay in my bed and do absolutely nothing. I realized yesterday when going through r/sad and r/ morbidreality- because I wanted to force myself to cry to feel something- that I haven't truly cared about anything or anyone in 2 years- I may convince myself I care about something or that something is important to me, but at the end of the day, I am apathetic towards just about everything- I.E. when I was failing two classes, I actually didnt really care at all- it was my parents who cared, who wanted me to get tutors, who scheduled the therapy appointments for me, who sent me the medication. Towards that end of apathy, the girl I dated over the summer- I didn't care if we broke up or not- at first I was angry about it because I did nothing wrong to end the relationship, but then I realized I was not angry about ending the relationship, I was angry because now I didn't have someone that I knew 100% percent thought and truly cared and would understand anything that would I would go through. I realize that I didn't care for her- well I did in some regard- but not as much as I would like to think I did, and that this lack of caring stems from the ideology of someone like her- someone who loves me. It scares me to think that I won't have someone like that, but then I realize that it would be okay if I didn't and I would get by. I've hooked up with a few girls since then and realize that I don't want a relationship from any of these girls, just a physical reaction was enough and then I was done with them- i will admit that having lust fulfilled by someone was nice- but its odd(well typical for me) because I didn't even think of that one person while I was with them, I was able to think about nothing- I don't fantasize anyone of being with women, when I do whatever its just empty thought and the motion. It's rather pathetic and just leaves me angry at myself and even more hollowed. 

But the emptiness, I realize, has crept in me. I really didn't notice it until this semester: I used to be an incredibly competitive person- I.E. running- I could not give a shit whether I run well or not, I set goals that I know mean absolutely nothing to the core of my being. ""Yea! I want to run that time this year!"" in reality I dont give a flying shit. Friends, I'm all about some friends, I love having friends, people to talk to you, fill up time, but I've told two friends about what all is happening and that was months ago- I haven't updated them about therapy or the new ""revolution"" that occurred to me. I love friends, but im too lazy and just don't care enough to try and put in the work to maintain a truly valuable relationship- so in a way im self sabotaging, but its okay I guess. Not really. I guess that's about all I've got to say- finals are approaching quickly and I should be studying, but im too reoccupied with nothing on my mind- ha(jokes).  I'm not really looking for a solution- just a reflection of what has happened, something the core of my being felt needed to happen. I'm sorry it was so long and I'm sorry its rather depressing, but its face value. There's much more detail and so much more that I could write a book on- that anyone could write a book on- their personal life that is. I guess that is another realization im facing- im really not special- no one is. We are all just grains of sand on a beach making up this world that we have deemed so special. Any story anyone has, about a million people have identical ones. And through everything I've gone through every persons life is just as complicated and every person has just as long, sad, or happy a story that comprises their being. "
1s7j1v,20,2013-12-05,Me [28 M] with my GF [23F] 3.5yrs. She wants sex but not with me. She thinks its my looks. I started to think it's my personality.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1s7j1v/me_28_m_with_my_gf_23f_35yrs_she_wants_sex_but/,"I need to go as back as when we first got together because it was very unromantic and might be the root of what is happening now. 
Basically we were just friends from college and hung around at both her or my place. One day we realized that we both in some way were interested in each other. By that I mean we really just TOLD IT to each other, we didn't realize it by ""feelings"" somebody sends to you or something like that. I think you get what I'm trying to say (I'm German). So we literally ""agreed"" to give it a try and so we kissed and yeah, while it was all good and fine it was very much lacking any passion whatsoever. Very awkward first kiss.

But it didn't really matter for a long time because only a few weeks later we were totally in love. Even up to this day we still love each other dearly. No day had passed that we weren't at least talking over skype (we later both studied at different cities, 2 hour car drive apart, but saw each other almost every weekend). This year I even spent 4 months in China for an internship and it didn't seem to affect our love at all. So until recently we were quite sure we will spend our lives together. We talked about future often, about a house, jobs and kids and we shared the same opinions, so ALMOST everything was quite perfect.

But even then, Sex was never great. When the semester already started, I sometimes complained about her lack of interest in Sex, because we'd only have it about 2-3 times A MONTH. But since she always was someone who couldn't focus on anything but her studies, I just blamed her school and waited for the semester to be over, hoping it'd be all better. We would then have sex more frequently but sometimes I couldn't help but think she forced herself into it, making it all less enjoyable. 

Now she is in Finnland for an exchange semester and she has much much more time at her hands and also meets a lot of new people. This is at a high contrast to what she is used back at home. She even had trouble keeping in touch with her long-time friends because of her studies, so this was almost a new ""old"" feeling for her. 
With all that, her sex drive also kicked in and she told me she is in ""real need"" and sometimes can't focus on her studies because of that.

So I visited her a month ago, I stayed and traveled with her for about a week. I booked a ship from Finnland to Stockholm. We had a fancy room in the ship, it was better than any hotel room we ever had. It was all perfect, we felt great. 
But then she just couldn't get ""into"" it. I waited for her to get out from the shower, expected her. Kissed her, etc etc. she even had to ""try"" to enjoy it but couldn't. That was when she for the first time told me that she seriously thinks somethings wrong with her (or with us). She knows she is generally super horny these days but she couldn't help but feel that I am unattractive. 

What followed was the worst trip I've ever had. Every day and evening we spent in Stockholm and back in Finnland this was the only topic to us, impossible to enjoy the city. The first night after that ""revelation"" she basically told me I should probably loose weight (I was always a little on the heavier side, didn't change ever since we met). And maybe get some muscles. Not much, but just a little. She even pointed out that my little ""pouch"" right above my penis (i think a common issue among chubbier men) is a huge turn-off for her. Moreover she wants me to get rid of all of my bodily hair I have on my chest, stomach and some on my back, permanently (she did that to her legs before by some laser treatment).
This really irritated me. I know she always wanted me to be slimmer and I think it's something I really should go for anyways. But when she asked me to remove all hair, to get some muscles and told me that that area above my penis was so ugly to her I felt insulted. It's not like I didn't look like that before. I was always like that. But she never told me it would bother her THAT much. And as of now I just can't afford laser treatment (that would as expensive as 4000 Euro). She cried because she knew she's saying shocking things she just wished it wasn't like that, but it was what she really thought at that point.

Again, this might also just come from that unromantic way we first met and her long-time busy student life where she didn't care much about sex anyway. So I probably shouldn't be even blaming her for not telling me earlier. 

Days later on the trip then she once mentioned that MAYBE her issue is because she realized that she's missing out on something. Hanging out in a foreign country with more guy friends than usually, she started feeling attracted to them even if she in her mind knew its not right. There she told me that she wished she had only met me LATER in her life, because at that age of 20 to 23, she would have enjoyed having a good time before engaging to something that serious like me.
This was another punch-in-the-face kind of feeling to me. Again, she hated herself for thinking like that, she just couldn't help and tried to be completely honest with me.

I then told her to make up her mind and decide wether she wants to be free, because I wont hold her back then. But she didn't want that either. She would now say that she truly ""knows"" that it's me who she wants and not that kind of freedom. 
I'm still not sure wether she made that decision because she was truly convinced or just out of regrets by breaking up.

So there we are now, she's still in Finnland until Christmas and we're just trying to get rid of our problem as soon as she's back. But we both have no idea of how to do that because we both know I wont and can't change myself in the near future anyway. 
While we still love each other very much, we both feel that our relationship is just on life support right now, waiting for either turning it off or for finding a different solution. I still don't know wether I should give it all a chance, just to realize that even AFTER transforming myself into an attractive looking guy, I'm just not her type? She can't guarantee that it'll be all fine after that, it might as well not. She can't tell if its my character, if I'm just not man enough for her.

On a last note I should add, I was never great at picking up girls. While I'm great socialising with girls and people, I never made it to attract girls generally. Infact, I was virigin until the age of 25 (when I met my current GF). So I'm definitely not looking only at my GF's issue, but also at myself. Wether my type of personality is just bad with girls in general. 
I personally started to think I lack the passion, security and a lot of ""manly"" features that girls find truly attractive, totally aside from the look. 

And considering this in addition, it just makes it all more complicated and struggling to me in personal.

**TL;DR** We're a couple with real deep love but lacking real passion. GF has intact sex drive but is not interested at sex with me, she thinks it might be because of my body and looks but she can't really tell for sure. Both worried it wont change but I'm worried that even if I'd go for all the trouble in changing myself in becoming attractive it might be a waste of time and efforts and maybe our relationship is doomed anyway. Personally started to blame myself as a man in general as a possible reason, since I never was good with the girls.
 
 
 
  
(Sorry for the wall of text :( It felt good just writing it all down, though. I couldn't talk about this to anybody without feeling even less a man than I already do. My parents just had to see my brother separate from his wife. Brother himself was never a great guy to talk about stuff like this and I don't know anyone to talk about something as intimate as this. )"
1s7hmj,11,2013-12-05,GIS Internship Interview,[deleted],gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/1s7hmj/gis_internship_interview/,"Hi fellow GISers. Coming up Tuesday, I have an interview at city administration for a GIS internship. This is my first interview for an internship. I have no idea what they are going to ask me and I am totally nervous. I have no work experience (except for working at fast food restaurants) but all the requirements I qualify for. Also I have that extra perk of doing a lot of computer programming, if they need me to.  I believe that in this internship, I'll be working on a pedestrian bridge project.

What kind of questions do you think they will pose for me?

1s7fge,1,2013-12-05,Very close to 30 days,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1s7fge/very_close_to_30_days/,"My biggest streak was 30 days this summer.  I'm getting close to pushing past it.  However, I am really struggling.

I am ridiculously horny.  I hit on every woman I see.  I'm almost obsessed with meeting a girl, getting number, trying to get laid.  

It is all I can think about.

I work with an extremely hot student intern and I end up fantasizing about her in so many ways.

I feel like I can not rest until I meet a hot girl, date her, and have sex with her.

I've decided against my old booty calls, but this new obsession will not die away.

I am really trying to channel it into other activities but it has recently clouded every thought that I have.  I work out, try to read, go out....nothing helps.  I've also been eating terribly and smoking occasionally to compensate.   Damn!

What do I do?  Please help.

As a producer, I have created economical sales packages to entice the interest of local actors to participate as extras, with perks ranging from free professional modeling photos to free hair and cosmetic makeovers with to no additional cost to the production.  

As an editor, I have experience in cutting together narrative short films, documentary styled shorts, news packages, and TV commercials in addition to helping out other professionals with pacing, color correction, equalizing sound levels, and with the creation of soundscapes.  I am very familiar with transcoding digital assets to suit various needs, exercising proper video file organization techniques, and know the importance of backing up all data.    
              
I have directed films with as many as 70 people involved and have gained invaluable knowledge under “The Last of the Mohicans” prop master Vern Crofoot while serving as an intern on a professional film set.  At UCF I was trained by industry professionals such as Barry Sandler, Ula Stoeckl, and Jesse Wolfe in all manners of production.

I currently reside in Orlando, Florida.  However, both my girlfriend and I are looking to relocate. 

I own a Mac OSX dual monitor desktop computer for editing with Adobe Creative Suite CS6 installed as well as Final Cut Pro 7.  I also own an H4N Zoom audio recorder and anticipate owning either a Canon T4i or 60D in the near future.

I believe I could be of great service to your company and would love to have an opportunity to discuss with you any ideas for the position you may have available.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

1scklm,21,2013-12-07,"[CC] I was going to enter the Drunk Writing Contest on r/writing, but I drank a bit too much and went WAY over the limit. It would be cool get some feedback though.",urgent_detergent,WritingPrompts,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1scklm/cc_i_was_going_to_enter_the_drunk_writing_contest/,"Don't laugh, this shit really happened.

I was dead - for like forty-five minutes.  My car flipped four times in mid-air before spinning to a stop upside down in the median of the interstate.  I had just finished up my cooking shift at the restaurant in the hotel and was on my way home when this drunk son-of-a-bitch ran me off the road.  Since I'm making an attempt to be honest here, I'm not really a cook so much as a cook-trainee.  I always wanted to be a cook, but couldn't afford the school so I hounded the head chef at the hotel until he succumbed and gave me a paid internship.  Hey, it's minimum wage, but I'm a shitty cook too so it all works out in the end.   Well, I am becoming *less* shitty.  Just throwing that out there, for honesty sake you know.

The doctors didn't call it an out of body experience, they called it a ""hallucinatory dream-state"" or some shit like that.  The serious ones said that my brain was traumatized and randomly pulling together elements of my subconscious mind to try  and make sense of everything.  The others - the  assholes - just laughed.  So don't laugh, asshole.

Imagine, one second  you're driving down the interstate and, boom!  Next second, you're opening your eyes in Hell.  Yeah, *Hell* - you know, Satan, demons, souls being tortured - shit like that.  For real.  

The problem though, is that Hell is nothing like you would expect.  Oh, it was real alright.   This was no hallucination or fucked up *dream-state*.  Maybe it's an individual thing, mapped out according to your fate or DNA or whatever.  Maybe it takes the form of the world that your are accustomed to, otherwise it might not make any sense to you when you get there.  How can you be tortured when none of the torture makes any damn sense?  That's my current take on it anyway.

Alright, here it is.  Do with it as you will.

Hell is a lot like a hotel.  When my eyes opened, I was laying face down in the lobby with people walking all around me.  And bags, lots and lots of bags next to me.  Glancing to my left I saw a huge revolving door that was spinning like Beethoven listening to Justin Bieber.  Right about this time, the sparkling cufflinks caught my eyes.  A suit?  I don't even own a suit, why am I wearing one? 

""So you're the new cook?"", said a voice somewhere above me, or behind me, not quite oriented yet it was hard to tell.  It was British though, a distinctly British accent.

""What?  Chef?  Where am I?"",  or something vaguely similar to that dribbled out of my mouth while attempting to stand up.

Staggering to a standstill and brushing myself off, I notice the man standing to the right of me.  He sort of looked like he would be the perfect casting choice for the role of Alfred in a Batman movie.

""The new cook, sir.  That is what you're here for.  Perhaps your epiphany hasn't quite occurred yet.  It takes some people a little longer than others.  Give it a few minutes and you should be just fine."",  he said as held out his hand.  ""My name is Malcolm, you are Phillip, correct?""

How the hell does he know my name?  I thought as my reflexes automatically projected my hand out to his.

""Yes, um, how did you know that?"", I stuttered.

""Oh, there's lots that we know Mr Jerrison."", said Malcolm with the big, warm-hearted smile of a preacher at Sunday dinner.

He knows my last name too, I thought.

How are there so many people coming through that revolving door?  Jesus, this hotel is enormous.  I can't even see the end of the hallway in front of me.  And then it happened.  The epiphany that Malcolm was talking about.  I knew where I was.  This is it - Hell.  My mind is flooded with all the mean and stupid shit that I did as a kid, and as an adult.  Laughing and poking fun at the retarded kids.  Using phrases like ""retarded kids"".  Trying to finger my fifteen year old girlfriend during church service.  Taking a piss in the Baptistery waters.  Shooting my neighbors yapping dog in the balls with BB gun.  Shooting my yapping neighbor in the balls with BB gun.  Telling dirty jokes about slanted Chinese vaginas and Indian pussy with dots on the clit.

What a jackass.  Nobody deserved it more than me.  My mum always warned me, and now here it is, my judgment and sentence:  Hell's cook.

""It just happened, didn't it?"", asked Malcolm, probably sensing the drunken vacancy in my eyes as the moment of Epiphany.

""Yes, yes Malcolm.  I understand now."", I began, ""But, chef?  I think there may be a bit of a misunderstanding.""

""Well, sir,  you were a  cook at a hotel in your former life, correct?"", asked Malcolm.

""I suppose you could say that,"" I said, ""but it's not what you think.  I was actually a train-""

""Sir, are you implying that the Dark Lord, our Omniscient Overlord, the Emperor of the Evil Empire himself has made a *mistake*?  That he is less than perfect?"", asked Malcolm with a cautionary tone.

""Are you talking about Satan?  The Devil?"", I asked incredulously, ""I thought that was just anthropomorphism - some kind of symbolic representation of evil?""

Malcolm glared, ""That's quite a vocabulary for a chef, sir.  But I assure you, He is real.  However, those are just your names for him.  Here we tend to be a bit more reverent.  A bit more grandiose.""

""So what do you call him here?  What is the *Dark Lord's* real name?"", I asked with the all the weight of this terrible new knowledge bearing down on my chest.

""His real name, sir?  Teddy.  His name is Teddy"", said Malcolm with the most stern and stoic of faces.  ""Now, let us get you to  your room, shall we?""

-----------------

We walk up to the main desk of the hotel, Malcolm following behind with my luggage on a large squeaking metal cart.

""Name sir?"",  asked the demon behind the computer terminal at the desk.  For some reason, I just knew he was a demon.  Although he only had tiny little horns that protruded slightly above his temples on either side of his head.  They were probably more pronounced due to his receding hairline.

""It's Phillip, Phillip Jerrison.""

""Ah, here you are.  New arrival I see?,"" said the man again.  ""Looks like you will be in, room number one""

""Room number one?  Are you sure that's right?  I mean, there are an awful lot of people here.  How is it that I get assigned room number one?""

A short bald demon with a nametag that said *Truman* stood up on some sort of small platform and poked his head out from behind the counter.  

""We really have to get maintenance to fix the recorded announcements.  This is the eleven millionth, four-hundred and sixty-two thousandth, and thirty first time I've had to explain this today."", said Truman with an annoyed and  strained nasally voice that I would have associated with one of the seven dwarfs.

According to Truman, Hell has an infinite number of rooms.  So, logically, there would always be an open room at the end of the hallway that you could assign to new arrivals.  But, since this is Hell, that's not how it works.  Every single current *guest* of Hell must move down one room in order for each new guest to take room number one.

""Isn't that a huge inconvenience and just a generally pain-in-the-ass for everyone involved?""  I ask ignorantly.

""Yes, of course!,"" said Truman, ""Thank you so much, we thought so too.  It's diabolical isn't it?"", he said, rubbing his hands together and revealing a toothy grin full of large white fangs that belie the size of the little creature.

""Well, sir,"" intoned Malcolm, ""now that we have your room, perhaps we should take your things there and get you ready to see the kitchen.""

--------------------

The room was large and extravagant, with a jacuzzi, a beautiful balcony, and the largest bed I had ever seen.  It had to be a double king size at least.  I had just finished unpacking my bags and hanging my clothes in the closet when a knock came at the door.  It was Malcolm.

""Sir, have you unpacked and gotten everything ready to go see the kitchen?"", he asked.

""Yes, Malcolm, I think I'm all set.  I must say, this is really quite a surprise, I wasn't expecting Hell to be so..."", I began but was cut off by a stern Malcolm.

""Excellent, now before we go you will need to pack up all your things and move to room number two in order to accommodate our newest guest."", said Malcolm.

""What?  I just unpacked."",  I said incredulously.

""Sir, that is the way it works here.  Didn't you hear the front-desk manager when he explained it?  You'll need to hurry, we only have ten minutes before you have to begin cooking the Evil One's lunch,"" Malcolm said as he glanced down at his wrist watch.

Ten minutes?  Ten minute's before I have to cook for Satan?  For Teddy Himself?  I ran like a mad man through the room grabbing clothes and hangers and soap and whatever else I needed and threw them haphazardly into whatever bags were available.  Then, dragging the bags twenty feet down the hallway, I stopped behind Malcolm at the door marked *Room 2*.  The door of this one didn't have the same ornate gold and ivory etchings that the first room did.  Instead, it actually seemed to be made out of some kind of rotting plywood.

Malcolm unlocked the door and gave it an abbreviated push, as if to avoid contact with the inside of the room.  The door gave a loud - almost intentionally annoying - stuttering squeak as it opened.  Walking into the room, there's a noticeable difference between these living quarters and the first one.  There's no jacuzzi, just a rusty, mildewy faux porcelain tub in the corner of the room.  Well, I say *room*, but it's more like a large closet.  Next to the tub is a bucket that has *For #2* written on the side.  I don't see a toilet, but I really want to believe that this means that it is reserved for room number 2.  The floor has no carpet and is rotting in certain places.  Are those termites under the tub?  

""This can't be right,"" I say to Malcolm.  ""We must have the wrong room.""

""No, this is the right one, sir."", says Malcolm.

I continue my protest, ""But the first room is so nice.  It's like a penthouse suite for kings.  This place - with all due respect Malcolm, this is a dump!  How is anyone supposed to live here?""

Malcolm clears his throat with a couple of short crisp grunts, ""With all due respect, sir, keep in mind that this *is* Hell.  Just wait till you see Room Number Three.""

""Jesus Christ, it get's worse?"", I muttered under my breath.

""Sir, we really should be off to the kitchen.  There are only a few moments remaining before the meal is to be prepared."", said Malcolm, and we began our journey to my new workplace.

-----------------

As we approached the entrance, we heard a commotion coming from Hell's kitchen.  

""What are we going to do, Herb?  This is the worst possible situation!"", said a panicked voice behind the door.

Malcolm opened the door of the kitchen and we walked into a magnificent room filled with every cooking device you could dream of.  Behind the cooking area there were long aisles filled with produce, meats, butter, breads, cooking oils, and spices.  It was like an enormous grocery store.  This was the greatest kitchen imaginable, and it was in Hell of all places.

Lenny was a tall, extremely skinny demon who was obviously stressed out about something.  He was facing another demon with a name tag that said, ""Herb"".  Imagine a basset hound, wearing a chef's hat.  That's probably the best description of Herb.  

Malcolm began, ""Hello gentlemen, I've come to introduce our new head chef.  Lenny, Herb, this is Phillip.  He will be taking over cooking duties after the incident with Jeff.""

""Jeff?  Who's Jeff, what happened with Jeff?"", admittedly it was rude to interrupt, but I couldn't contain myself.

""Jeff was the former head chef."", Lenny stated as if this was old news.

""So, where is he now?"", I continued to probe.

""Jeff ain't here no more."", said Herb with a long slow southern drawl.

Malcolm held up a hand to the basset hound-like demon, then looked directly at me, ""There was... an incident."", he said.

""An incident?"", I inquired.

""There was a spinach soufflé that didn't quite turn out so well, and so..."", began Lenny.

""Now he's got to spend five-hundred years in the chamber of the Spider Wasps."",  Herb blurted out through his bouncy southern demon jowls.

""Spider Wasps?  What the fuck?"", I didn't even try to hide the disgust written on my face.

""Never mind that, we have a new problem.""  said Lenny.

""What seems to be the problem gentlemen?""  asked a cool, calm Malcolm.

""Our Dark Lord,"" began Lenny.

""Teddy?"", I asked.

""Yes, of course, our Magistrate of Manevolence"", said Lenny incredulously.  ""He doesn't really *prefer* Teddy though.  You should probably refer to Him as 'Dark Lord', or 'Master', or at the very least 'Ted'.  Anyway,"" Lenny continued, ""the Great One has made a *request*.  A very unique request I might add.

""What's the request?""  I asked.

Lenny reached over the counter and picked up a small book.  Then he handed the book to me.

""He wants this."", Lenny said.

The book's title was, *Chicken Soup for the Soul*.

""I, I don't understand.  He want's a book?"", I asked trying to piece together the issue.

""No, he wants the soup."", said Lenny matter-of-factly.

As it began to dawn on everyone, Malcolm simply said, ""Oh dear.""

After a moment, I said, ""So you're telling me that our Dark Lord, our Master of Puppets, or whatever you call him.  Satan - he want's Chicken Soup for the Soul?""

Everyone nodded.  

""Yes,"" said Malcolm, ""that does appear to be the case.""

""You see,"" Lenny started to explain, ""there appears to be a misunderstanding.  I think the Great One saw the book, and misinterpreted it as being a recipe.  He thought it sounded delicious and so requested it for his next meal."", he paused for a second, ""Our new chefs first assignment.""

Things aren't going well.  Within the last hour, I woke up in Hell.  I realize that I have an infinite number of ever-shittier rooms to spend eternity in.  And now, now I have to find a way to cook Chicken Soup for the Soul - for Satan himself.

Malcolm takes me aside, ""I don't normally do this, sir, but there's a possibility that I may be of assistance here.""

""What are we going to do?  How the hell - pardon the pun - are we going to make Chicken Soup for the Soul?  Wouldn't we have to make it out of chicken souls?  Chicken's don't have souls!"",  my panic is becoming infections as Lenny starts to fidget nervously again.

""Well, actually sir,"" Malcolm started with a curious gleam in his eye, ""chickens do have souls.""

""What?  What are you talking about Malcolm,"" at this point I don't know why I expected anything to make sense.

""Well, as it turns out, our Magnificent Overlord - brilliant as he is, mind you - is unaware of something.  Something that is so great, and so important that everyone is afraid to tell him.  No one wants to be sent to the Chamber of Spider Wasps, or the Piranha infested Acid Pool, or the Razor Mountains because they made our Dark Lord look foolish."", Malcolm began explaining.

""Razor Mountains, what on Earth is that?"", I said.

""Well, have you ever gone up onto a mountain and taken in a big, refreshing breath of air?"", asked Lenny.

""Yes."" I replied.

""Ok, now imagine that  you take in a breath of fresh air, and all the oxygen suddenly turns into razor blades.""

""Jesus!"", I shouted.  ""So what's this *secret*?  How's it going to help us?""

Malcolm went on to explain the ultimate secret.  Chicken do indeed have souls, but Satan doesn't know it.  In fact, because no one is fighting over chicken souls, all chickens go to heaven.  Thanks to all the earth's fast food restaurants, heaven has been amassing a gigantic army.  An army of chickens that have been trained to bring down the Dark Lord in the forthcoming war between Heaven and Hell.

""Ok,"" as ridiculous as this sounds coming out of my mouth, ""if we need chicken souls to make this soup, and all the souls of chickens are in Heaven, and we are in Hell, how in the name of all that is unholy are we going to get them?""

""I have a secret too.""  said Malcolm quietly and with a sly grin.  ""This is a seasonal job.  Heaven is also a hotel and I work there on the side.  Pack a bag and I will make some calls."""

I have directed films with as many as 70 people involved and have gained invaluable knowledge under “The Last of the Mohicans” prop master Vern Crofoot while serving as an intern on a professional film set.  At UCF I was trained by industry professionals such as Barry Sandler, Ula Stoeckl, and Jesse Wolfe in all manners of production.

I currently reside in Orlando, Florida.  However, both my girlfriend and I are looking to relocate. 

I own a Mac OSX dual monitor desktop computer for editing with Adobe Creative Suite CS6 installed as well as Final Cut Pro 7.  I also own an H4N Zoom audio recorder and anticipate owning either a Canon T4i or 60D in the near future.

I intern part-time as a Junior Business Analyst in downtown Fort Worth. I love animals, wine, board games, baking, and crafting. I enjoy photography in my spare time. I like to go out to bars or parties on the weekends, but I like staying in to cuddle and watching movies just as much. I'm a big believer in work hard, play hard. But enough about me...


I'm looking for a relationship, not for friends or just to hook up. A good old fashioned relationship, where you open doors and court me until I fall for your charm and become your girlfriend :) Here is a list of things you should be! You should be between the ages of 20 and 25. You should have a college degree or be actively pursuing one.  You should be ambitious and career-oriented. I plan on being very successful and wealthy one day, and I want a man who can keep up with me. You should like to have fun and laugh. Getting me to laugh is really the way to my heart. You should not be afraid to make a commitment to the right girl. And bonus if you have brown hair. I've always had a soft spot for y'all!

If that all sounds like you, and you think you might like me, please send me a message! I'd love to hear from you and your pic gets mine :)

I am looking for local only!! (Meaning DFW only)

Edit: Still looking for someone to take me out :) If this post is still up, I'm still looking!"
1scfm2,5,2013-12-07,"Me [22M] with my girlfriend [19F] of 2 years, sudden breakup.",throwuhiev9v,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1scfm2/me_22m_with_my_girlfriend_19f_of_2_years_sudden/,"I met my girlfriend 2 and a bit years ago, when I was 20 and she was 17. I hadn't had a girlfriend, but we seemed interested in eachother and had a few awkward dates. 

6 months after we started seeing eachother, she won a place to go study at a university an 8hour drive away. She asked if I still wanted to stay together, and I said yes. By this time I was very close to her family (I come from a broken family, and only have a brother and sister in this country), and I was pretty much in love. Despite this, I knew that it might be doomed from the start. But her parents, being incredibly wealthy, fly her back for a weekend once a month, and I go down to visit her once a month. This, combined with holidays together, meant that I still saw her often, and we stayed like this for 2 years. I never thought about anyone else.

I got an internship at a city which is close to her city (and thus far away from mine), which I'm still on. She visited me this weekend and we had an awesome time together. As soon as she headed back we were texting again saying how much we miss eachother. Then I didn't get any texts from her for a few days. On Friday she sends a text saying 'Hey can I ring you? We need to talk'. I assume this is about her exam results. Breaking up was just something I wasn't considering. But, then she rung, and 'I can't do this any more...'. Bam.

She didn't really have any reasoning. She just said that her life was getting too stressful. I have a feeling that the real reason why is because I'm definitely not an A+ boyfriend. I tell her I love her and I try to make her as happy as possible, but I do make insensitive comments. For example, she says 'oh my god I haven't been to the gym. You must think I'm so fat', and I would say 'yep!'. In a clearly sarcastic way, but I guess it might have got to her? I've also told her I don't like holding hands all the time. I still hold her hand around town, but she'd insist on even on the smallest walk from the TV room to the kitchen on holding hands (god how I wish I didn't say that now). 

She deleted me from facebook, but still had a few texts. She says she wants me to be happy with someone else. I say I'll wait if that's what she wants. And she replies 'I don't know what the future holds. I never say never, I just want you to be happy now'. I also sent a farewell email to her father (who she's very close to), and he sent back a very touching email. Here is the relevant part:


""Thank you for the email, its very thoughtful. Don't beat yourself up. **** has been very happy with you, And we have really enjoyed being part of your life. I think the pressures of the study and distant relationship are just too much for her to deal with. She is still very young and I think she just needs to be on her own to focus on her studies for the foreseeable. Who knows, things might be different in a few years.""

I then decided to do what I thought was the most rational thing and I got drunk with some friends. I've only met them a couple of weeks ago (I've only been on this internship for 3 weeks), but they were all very supportive. However, they don't really know her, and the first thing that jumped to their mind was that she met someone else. After 7 or 8 drinks, they said 'dude, you've got to check her facebook'. So I did. More specifically, I typed in the password for them, and they checked.

This is definitely the worst thing I've done, and I know I need to tell her. But I was drunk and desperate. But I only feel worse knowing what I saw.

She was talking to a friend who had just been in a car crash. There was a tirade against me, saying that I was incredibly inconsiderate and not wanting to hold hands is an equivalent of saying 'I don't love you'. GF then told friend that she was sad I didn't tell her about the internship, and that she was so young when she first met me. However, she then started to say 'I still love him..."". And her friend continues to rock the boat, saying things like ""Ditch him. I wouldn't be surprised if he's cheated on you"". 

GF never once said anything mean or bitter about me. She just quietly voice a few complaints. After I've been so insensitive to her. God she's made of gold, and I love her so much. Which is why I don't want it to slip away this easily.

Why her friend made this massive character assassination on me I don't know. GF's parents tell her that they don't like this friend, and that she is spoiled to the core. I also told GF my opinion of her, but I don't want to seem controlling, so I didn't voice an opinion on her unless asked. What's more, friend moved away from her and broke off contact from GF, and only made contact with her after the car crash because she needed support. I was livid that she'd use my GF like that, but she's obviously the kind of person that would. And GF is the type of girl who would help and support anyone that needed it, regardless of what they do to her.

So, after that wall of text backstory (apologies), I need some opinions on what to do. Both GF and her dad both made vague references to 'the future'. But she still has feelings for me, and I love her so fucking much. I only want to get back with her if she's happy with me. I know I can improve and be more returning of her affection. But I just have a feeling her 'friend' had stirred the pot, and I didn't even get a chance to talk about it to her face to face. 

I'm also in a new city, isolated from any long term friends (I only have a couple). I have done well on this internship and met some friends, but obviously it's hard to be close to someone you've only known 3 weeks. So it's very isolating here.

My current plan is the usual: letters of reassurance, asking to get back together, recording me playing the guitar for her. Anything to show her I love her. In between her last text saying 'I love you' and the Friday 'we need to talk' only had 2 days apart. I can't believe she made the decision so quickly.

She said she is young, and needs time to sort herself out. I'm going to give her that. She's going to a New Years party, and she voiced a worry about being the only girl with a boyfriend. So I'm going to at least give it until New Years for her to figure it out, if she wants someone else. I won't make contact with her until she's back from New Years. If she finds someone, then I won't contact her, because I do want her to be happy. But I know I can make her happy. 

Advice/suggestions please? It's a lonely place I'm in at the moment.

tldr: girlfriend breaks up with me, 2 days after last text expressing being happy and in love. Her friend obviously played a large part in the decision. Both her and her father made references to 'the future'. Overall I'm confused and lonely. I've lost not only my girlfriend, but my family. Please advise me :("

Here is my traveling for the year 2013.",[deleted],travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1scd75/dear_rtravel_community_you_gave_me_the_courage_to/,"Since I graduated high school over four years ago I always wanted to travel.  Everyone wants to travel, but many people are unable to for many different reasons.  I had two major reasons as to why I hadn’t traveled anywhere. The first was not being able to save enough money and to get off of work.  I worked throughout high school and on my breaks from college as most of us do.  The second reason was that I couldn't find anyone who was willing to go with me.  I couldn't find people with the same traveling interest or anyone who were willing to spend the money.  

In order to tackle reason number one I decided to finally start saving.  Easier said than done, but it hit me one day when I got sick of looking at pictures of beautiful places and saying to myself that I will go there one day.  But I never saved.  I started budgeting.  I had no specific trip I wanted to take, but I had money slowly but surely being stored away for when the time had come.  I finally was able to overcome reason number two early this year after joining this subreddit.  I have seen many comments encouraging people like me to travel on your own.  It gets tricky when you need to rely on someone for your travels.  If it’s just you, you can go where you want, when you want.  Come February of this year I decided to say fuck it and I bought a plane ticket to Italy.  That was all I needed to kick off my travel binge.
Enough of the background stuff here is a brief summary of how my year of traveling went:

All costs include EVERYTHING (airfare, trains/buses, car fuel, hotels, food, souveniers, etc.)

**Italy (Minturno, Rome, Florence)**
*March 7-15*
*Cost:  ~$1800*
I split the time up between visiting my family in Minturno, Rome, and Florence.  I had places to stay with my family and I had a friend studying in Florence.  It’s true what they say, there’s no feeling quite like traveling on your own.  You truly learn about yourself.  Yes, it was very intimidating, but that feeling was gone the second the plane took off.

**Cross Country Road Trip Around America**
*June 3-July 12*
*Cost: ~$3000 (for me)*
I actually had one of my best friends willing to do this with me.  We took my car and left after we both graduated.  I believe he had spent more than me, but not too much.  Let me say first and foremost, $3000 is probably the bare MINIMUM you’d need to do what we did.  We went to many great places, but I did not buy many souvenirs nor did I pay for many of the attractions the cities had to offer.    We also have friends and family all throughout the country.  I’d say it was an even three way split of staying with friends and family, camping, and hotels.

Here is a link to the map of our route.  We started in New York and headed west: 
[Road Trip Route](http://imgur.com/2NHR7sI.jpeg)

**Israel**
*August 5-15*
*Cost: ~$200*
Yes that is correct.  $200.  If you are unfamiliar with Birthright it is a program funded by the Jewish community (not exactly sure who) where if you are Jewish or have Jewish relatives you can apply for a free 10 day trip to Israel.  The trips are designed for people ages 18-26.  You do not have to be religious.  I do not practice the Jewish religion, but the idea of a $4000 trip for free was too hard to pass up.  I caught the travel bug and there was no stopping me.  It ended up being a great experience.  You are stuck with a group of 40 or so kids and six Israeli soldiers your age as well for 10 days in a bus as you travel all over Israel.

**Paris, Venice, Milan**
*October 27 – November 4*
*Cost:  ~$2000*
This trip was not originally in my plans.  I had been talking to a girl whom I met last October who I ended up dating since I've been back from the road trip.  She was and currently is spending this fall semester studying abroad in Milan.  Round trip tickets were super cheap for this time, only about $600 so naturally I went over.  We stayed in apartments using airbnb.  Venice was a day trip.

**So about money……**

I want it to be known that I do not come from a well off family.  As I stated before I worked and saved for years.  I had a well-paying engineering internship since sophomore year of college so saving was not too difficult for me after that point.  The spending of these trips came strictly from my pocket.  For the most part at least.  Israel was mostly free as I have said, but when I got back from Israel I was unemployed and fresh out of college.  I did graduate with a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering.  For the mean time I waited tables at a friend’s restaurant to get by.  I got a job offer in the beginning of October and accepted it.  Upon looking at plane tickets to Milan and seeing how cheap they were I decided that, with my new job starting mid-November that I was going to get my first credit card and use that to pay for the entire trip.  I only did this because I knew I would be able to pay it off quickly with a full time job lined up.  

*Be smart!*  You really must know your budget.  No matter where you travel to you will need money.  Life will continue on no matter where you go and when you return home, so I highly suggest not taken the path I took with the credit card if you have no certainty that you will be able to pay it off.

I really hope you enjoy these pictures I have selected and I appreciate your time in reading this.  I have 1000’s of pictures and am willing to show more upon request.  Instead of listing a bunch of random tid bits I figure I’d let you guys ask any questions you may have and I will get back to you as soon as I can.  My life has changed significantly this past year.  The moments and sights I have seen are invaluable when compared to the money I have spent.  You won’t regret spending the money it costs to travel.

I believe I am a strong programmer, but only have school work to prove it. I've gotten a good amount of C/C++ and Java and a little bit of R from school. Should I use my time to teach myself a new language, or try to build a project in one I already know, or perhaps combine that and create something in a new language? 

Or do you have an interesting book recommendation (I read an article today claiming it's a good idea to list ""favorite books"" on a resume)?

The time I started having feelings for her, I was already in the middle of my commitment to be single for a year (started after ending a shitty relationship to protect myself and other women from the rebound). 

Actually, maybe that wasn't the first time I felt something toward her. I remember an old roommate, soon to graduate, talking about how he wanted to date her. She was a freshman at the time; he was a senior and a seriously weird dude. He wanted to stay up late talking me through his thought process on whether he was going to ask her out or not. I remember feeling a little upset in the back of my mind and hoped he would just chicken out on the whole deal. He did. But that was the extent of my feelings until 2 years ago.

As soon as my year of singleness came to a close, I approached her and told her I wanted to go on a few dates to get to know each other better. She said she doesn’t feel anything towards me yet, but isn’t opposed to the idea and is willing to give us a try. Woohoo, right? Well, scheduling was terrible. I’d call her up, but she was busy all the time: Homework, group projects, leading bible study, etc. The only time we’d talk one-on-one was when we were carpooling to a ministry class we were both taking on Monday nights. I was beginning to think she was trying to avoid me because she never offered alternative times to see each other, but she assured me one evening she is really sorry she’s never available and that she really does want to get to know me better. This made me feel a little better, but it was still tough. When we would see each other at social gatherings, though, she began to seem distant and uncomfortable around me. I just said to hell with it, maybe we aren’t compatible. I even told that to those of our friends who were pulling for us to work out. It wasn’t until later I found out she has never dated anyone before, which would explain the awkwardness. But everything was still super awkward, so I moved on.

We both serve in a campus ministry as bible study leaders. At the end of that school year, we had a retreat for those of us on the leader team. At this retreat, she seemed… different. She was more bubbly and joyous around me. It was like the wall of awkwardness between us had crumbled. I figured one of our mutual friends told her I wasn’t pursuing her anymore and she felt “safe” around me again. Dating can be scary for someone who isn’t used to another person wanting to be with them. I had been there once in my life too. Another girl on this retreat pulled me to the side on our second day. This girl is notorious for being very unobservant of her social surroundings. But she straight up asks me if there is something between the other girl and I. This took me by surprise because I made sure not to do anything that looked like interest in her because I wasn’t pursuing a relationship any longer. So that must mean this girl saw behavior in the other girl. Very interesting, I thought. And then I began to notice it too. It was more than just feeling “safe”. This left me very confused.

Over the last summer, I met a girl in Mexico on a mission trip. She obviously liked me and I thought she was pretty cool. It was easy, ya know? A lot easier than this thing with the girl at school. She lived about 7 hours from me in the states, but I figured why not see where this goes. We talked for a while and started dating. Once this school year started, though, I knew my feelings for the girl at school weren’t over. That, paired with the fact that the Mexico girl ended up being kind of annoying when she came to visit me, caused me to break up with Mexico girl. Since then, the girl at school has been inviting me to do stuff with her and we’ve been talking a lot more. It’s really nice.

I decided I’m going to ask her out again at the start of the next quarter. We’re both seniors, so who knows if we’ll continue our friendship after graduation. I figured why not take the risk again? What would I be trying to preserve?

Tonight, she asked me where I’m going to be after graduation. She’s asked questions like this to me before, and each time I wonder if she’s weighing her future. I told her I’d probably stay in the state (WA), but I think it would be cool to move east and see more of the country. She suggested Tennessee, one of her favorite states. I asked here where she wants to be and she responded Tennessee, Colorado, Louisiana or Virginia. She said she wants to do an internship with the campus ministry we’re a part of and those are the areas she wants to be in. I instantly lost some hope, though. I love that she’s a woman of God, but some of the internships have funny policies on dating. It’s either they can’t date or they can’t begin to date someone while in the internship (I can’t remember the exact policy). And also, if we start dating and I get a job somewhere and she gets sent somewhere else, how would we do that? I’ve done long distance dating a few times before and it sucks! 

I figure I’m just going to ask her out as I already planned and cross that bridge if we get there. I don’t want to regret not asking her out. Here’s a quote that always drives me in risky situations:

“Don’t be afraid to go out on a limb. That’s where the fruit is.”

I remember feeling a little upset in the back of my mind and hoped he would just chicken out on the whole deal. He did. But that was the extent of my feelings until 2 years ago.

As soon as my year of singleness came to a close, I approached her and told her I wanted to go on a few dates to get to know each other better. She said she doesn’t feel anything towards me yet, but isn’t opposed to the idea and is willing to give us a try. Woohoo, right? Well, scheduling was terrible. I’d call her up, but she was busy all the time: Homework, group projects, leading bible study, etc. The only time we’d talk one-on-one was when we were carpooling to a ministry class we were both taking on Monday nights. I was beginning to think she was trying to avoid me because she never offered alternative times to see each other, but she assured me one evening she is really sorry she’s never available and that she really does want to get to know me better. This made me feel a little better, but it was still tough. When we would see each other at social gatherings, though, she began to seem distant and uncomfortable around me. I just said to hell with it, maybe we aren’t compatible. I even told that to those of our friends who were pulling for us to work out. It wasn’t until later I found out she has never dated anyone before, which would explain the awkwardness. But everything was still super awkward, so I moved on.

We both serve in a campus ministry as bible study leaders. At the end of that school year, we had a retreat for those of us on the leader team. At this retreat, she seemed… different. She was more bubbly and joyous around me. It was like the wall of awkwardness between us had crumbled. I figured one of our mutual friends told her I wasn’t pursuing her anymore and she felt “safe” around me again. Dating can be scary for someone who isn’t used to another person wanting to be with them. I had been there once in my life too. Another girl on this retreat pulled me to the side on our second day. This girl is notorious for being very unobservant of her social surroundings. But she straight up asks me if there is something between the other girl and I. This took me by surprise because I made sure not to do anything that looked like interest in her because I wasn’t pursuing a relationship any longer. So that must mean this girl saw behavior in the other girl. Very interesting, I thought. And then I began to notice it too. It was more than just feeling “safe”. This left me very confused.

Over the last summer, I met a girl in Mexico on a mission trip. She obviously liked me and I thought she was pretty cool. It was easy, ya know? A lot easier than this thing with the girl at school. She lived about 7 hours from me in the states, but I figured why not see where this goes. We talked for a while and started dating. Once this school year started, though, I knew my feelings for the girl at school weren’t over. That, paired with the fact that the Mexico girl ended up being kind of annoying when she came to visit me, caused me to break up with Mexico girl. Since then, the girl at school has been inviting me to do stuff with her and we’ve been talking a lot more. It’s really nice.

I decided I’m going to ask her out again at the start of the next quarter. We’re both seniors, so who knows if we’ll continue our friendship after graduation. I figured why not take the risk again? What would I be trying to preserve?

Tonight, she asked me where I’m going to be after graduation. She’s asked questions like this to me before, and each time I wonder if she’s weighing her future. I told her I’d probably stay in the state (WA), but I think it would be cool to move east and see more of the country. She suggested Tennessee, one of her favorite states. I asked here where she wants to be and she responded Tennessee, Colorado, Louisiana or Virginia. She said she wants to do an internship with the campus ministry we’re a part of and those are the areas she wants to be in. I instantly lost some hope, though. I love that she’s a woman of God, but some of the internships have funny policies on dating. It’s either they can’t date or they can’t begin to date someone while in the internship (I can’t remember the exact policy). And also, if we start dating and I get a job somewhere and she gets sent somewhere else, how would we do that? I’ve done long distance dating a few times before and it sucks! 

I figure I’m just going to ask her out as I already planned and cross that bridge if we get there. I don’t want to regret not asking her out. Here’s a quote that always drives me in risky situations:

“Don’t be afraid to go out on a limb. That’s where the fruit is.”

1sb3z3,2,2013-12-07,Feeling lost... (long post),[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1sb3z3/feeling_lost_long_post/,"This is a long story because i want to give you all a decent understanding of my context.

**Work**
I am a 26 year old male living in India. I was diagnosed with Bipolar Type 1 about 8 years ago while i was in another country.. India has a very indifferent culture towards any sort of psychological condition. My own parents deny the existence of my condition. Which is ironic coz they're doctors. &lt;sigh&gt; My own mum has gone so far as to call me schizophrenic and has said that i deserve to be locked in an asylum with a straight jacket on. My dad seems to have a lot more empathy but i see that it tested his patience whenever i talked about it.

I had been keeping my mood swings relatively under control for the past few years with some thought exercises and a lot of self-control. 

2012 was a good year for me. I got a really good job at an organisation that i liked, doing research and teaching. I also moved to another city away from my mum. My dad lives in the city i moved to. I had no no major swings that affected my functioning. i built up a strong group of friends, i call them my family :). 

Then, about 4 months ago, i was shit-canned for flippant reasons. I have maintained contact with a few friends from work and they said that i wasn't the only one. Apparently, people who didn't fit with the cliquey culture of the senior researchers were slowly pushed out.

The past few months have been hard, with my swings affecting my life and also any efforts that i make to find another job. i have on more than one occasion thought about ending it all and freeing myself 

**Thus ends the part of my work**

**Personal Life**

My mum and dad are together. On paper. That's all. She has been cheating on him since i was 4 years old. an impressive 22 years. My dad made a conscious decision to move away from the house when i was about 12. She was very good at hiding it from me and my dad (bless him) didn't try to turn me against her and doesn't to this day. In fact, we just dont talk about it. an unspoken pact b/w father and son. I guess the shroud of innocence that marks a child gave way when i was about 16 (about a year before i was diagnosed). I understood the situation and was destroyed. I stopped believing in relationships and withdrew from my friends. It took me 2 years (18y/o) till was able to maintain healthy relationships with friends and with the opposite sex.

Late 2008 (20 y/o), i started a dating a wonderful girl. Lets call her ""N"". N was amazing, she got me, she balanced me when things started getting unhinged. For the first time i felt that i could be normal and that i could be with her for the long run. Then, as with all things that define my life, disaster. She lost her grandmother at the same time as a massive depressive swing for me. I knew i had to be there for her. I tried. But i believe, what seemed to be an effort for me just wasn't enough for her. The power of hindsight allows me to tell you this.

Soon after that , around mid-2010, we broke up. I was broken again. I started my graduate degree around this time and i was occupied with the school work. I drowned myself in work. I received an internship in France. Before i left, i did a stupid thing and asked N to marry me. She said no.
Despite that, my internship went off well and i came out my graduate degree better than i had entered it.

I moved to the new city for my job and it was here that i met another girl. Lets call her ""A"". She seemed interested in me and had all the right reactions to my advances. She even spent a few nights at my place. We did not have sex. She was interested in getting into a relationship and everything seemed to be on the right track. My friends loved her. Her friends liked me. Then, one day, around the same time as i was getting laid off, she sends me a text claiming that she felt pressured into getting into a relationship with me by my friends. Bollocks. Being the chivalrous dweeb that i am, i respected her wishes and backed off all the way.

**Thus ends the part about my personal life**


Personally, I just feel my sanity slipping away bit-by-agonizing-bit. Without work, i am unfocused and all over the place. The phrase ""All play and no work makes Jack flipping insane"" applies to me.

I dont know what this post will accomplish personally. Maybe tomorrow, i'll regret it and delete it. Maybe, i'll be better for it. Bleh.

1sazk8,1,2013-12-07,Time for other things?,the_slender_whale,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1sazk8/time_for_other_things/,"I hope this is the right subreddit, sorry if it isn't.

I'm currently a freshman in engineering, looking into electrical/computer engineering. I attend very highly ranked school, I'm doing well with my grades, and I'm not worried about my job prospects when I get out of college, the opportunities will be there if I keep my head on straight, I know that.  But, I'm really scared of something else.

Ever since I got here they tell us how we have to have an internship, a co-op, research opportunities, everything possible to make us stand out, every single summer and off-semester.  I had to have a resume three weeks into school to attend a giant fair and sell myself to companies, but I didn't even have any skills to sell yet. It's just what is expected of us, that every moment of our lives is dedicated to preparing to get us into grad school, or a job in the future.

For the most part, that's ok, I like the hard sciences, I find coding fascinating, and the idea of me designing things and helping to better the world and all that is an attractive one.  But its not all I want.  I don't want to only live looking to the future.  I love backpacking.  I want to travel.  I want to meet people and go places without necessarily knowing where it is I'm going or what exactly I'm doing.  I would love to do these things when I'm still young.  I had to pass up a 45 day backpacking trip in Alasksa with some of my best friends this last summer, because I would have missed the first week of college and didn't feel I could afford to get behind.  I regret that decision more than any other in my life, and I know I'll never get another opportunity like that one again.  

I don't want to make that same mistake twice.  I don't want to throw away all these other things I want in life.  You can't make a living backpacking and traveling, engineering is a practical solution.  I'm lucky that I enjoy it.  Still, its not everything I want.  

I know this is a little rambling, but I guess what I want to know is, with how competitive engineering is, and how time consuming, how do you have time to do the things you really dream about? The traveling, the stuff that really sounds like living, making you feel really fulfilled?  Don't get me wrong, I like where I am and what I'm studying, but I just can't shake this feeling that I'm going to miss out on everything else there is out there.  

Sorry for the long post, but its an important question I think."
1sav1n,3,2013-12-07,Internship with a small company or large well known company?,Jakor,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1sav1n/internship_with_a_small_company_or_large_well/,"I know any answer to this will be very opinionated, but I am reaching out to get as many opinions as possible on my situation.

I am a junior in Mechanical Engineering, and I have just been offered my first Internship to work at Cummins. Additionally, one of my bosses got me an interview with a small local Engineering contracting company (about 70 people in the facility). I am almost certain I will get an offer for this one as well, as in the interview they told me multiple times they look forward to working with me, and they don't typically do internships from what I gathered.

For the smaller company internship, they expressed to me how they really wanted to make sure I spent most of my time doing hands on work, so that I can learn as much as possible while I'm there, with minimal paperwork and looking at drawings, etc. They all seemed like great people who were very laid back, and they even had an archery range in shop the owner and some others would use occasionally to relax a bit. They do both research and production of their products, so I could have the chance to see both sides of my field of interest (thermal energy systems). They also gave me quite a list of projects that I could expect to be helping out on

However, I also just got an acceptance offer from Cummins as a Thermal Fluids Performance Engineer. I don't know as much about what exactly I could expect to be working on, but the pay is plenty fine, my college resources provides reviews for internships with them that were overall pretty positive, and I know that Cummins typically uses an internship as a chance to find full time hires.

One (very slight) decision that sways me is that the smaller company is only about two hours away, so I could come back on weekends to see the girlfriend and friends and whatnot. The other offer is in the headquarters of Cummins, about a 6 hour drive away. 

So here is my question:
In your opinion, is it better to have an internship that may give more hands on experience and (maybe) make me a better engineer, with possibly references I would get to know better, or should I accept the offer of a big company name to possibly make my work experience on my resume look more recognizable?

TL,DR: Small company internship or Big Company internship?

Thank you for your time!"

What is on there now?  

With R&amp;F taking over a 3-4 hour time slot, there's a lot of time to fill. 

I wouldn't be surprised to see the Davey Mac show come in for the morning. Followed by Ron Bennington, with interns, Shelby / Kokomo (Pips replacement), Pepper and Fez rotated in on a supporting role and guest co-hosts. Callers will continue with the reoccurring caller characters providing their usual roles (Paul O, Hard Rock Johnny, Janice, etc.)

I assume with the focus they put today on not pulling old bits out of the vault, I think we'll see a little bit of the R&amp;F classics to fill time. 

There's also going to be special events.  

And some kind of ""indie"" comedians focus to promote themselves.

Is this enough content to fill all the slots? What else do we think there will be?"

After lurking this sub for a while, I've gotten the impression that you absolutely need a few internships if you want to get a decent job (or even interviews) after college. 

However, I definitely don't feel like I know enough to be useful to anyone. I have learned the amount of C you can learn in a college class, and I've been teaching myself Python through codecademy. 
By the end of the next semester, I'll have basic knowledge of C++, C, and Python, at the very least.

What should I do to get that internship for the summer and/or next year?
Also, where do I look for internships?

I live in West Palm Beach, Florida, which is not exactly a technology/software hotspot. All the local jobs on Craigslist required experienced software engineers or are dumb marketing jobs."

I could do everything with her, I could talk about anything with her and the other way around. Just this year we went on a 2 month trip in a small 2 person tent and didnt have a single argument. I love her to death and so did she..


A month ago she left to another continent to fullfill an internship for her master thesis. She would be away for 3 months. I was oké with that. Sure, I was going to miss her, but you have got to do what you have to do, and I didnt want to keep her short. I trusted her.

Now, 1.5 months into her internship she texted me she needs to skype. She tells me that she had sex with another guy the day before. Im broken, I cannot function.
She is my everything.
Everything I do, I do with her in my mind.
She tells me she is sorry and dont know what to say. She missed me so much. She tells me I am the only one for her. She tells me she was really drunk when it happened and did regret it immediately after. She tells me she wants me and only me. She wants to fight for me and wants to give everything she has for me. She asks me if I still want her.

1.5 months to go until she gets back.

I don't know. Yes, I want her, but I don't know if I can forgive her.. I love her I hate her. She kissed another guy.. Then had sex with another guy.. SEX!

Help.

**tl;dr: GF had sex with another guy while being far away. Confessed a day after through Skype. What shall I do?**

I'd like to share here, sorry in advance for the wall of text (enter key doesn't seem to make white rules appear in final text..?) or my spelling, English is not my native language.

---


Me and my girlfriend are nearing our one year anniversary at the end of this month. I'll start at the beginning.

---

I met her through work. She was an intern at a different department. She organized a dinner for all people of the company who wanted to come. So we went out for dinner at a restaurant with about 15 colleagues. It was a real fun night, and after the dinner we went out for drinks. Long story short, this is where the tension between us started. She had already added me on Facebook way before this evening so we could talk a bit and we had exchanged numbers a while after. After this evening we talked even more and I asked her out on a date.

---

The date was really fun, she seemed like a really intelligent, fun and social person. I have a close friend which is also my colleague (at yet another department) which told me that this girl seemed nice, but that I could do better looks-wise. I didn't really care, the girl seemed to have an awesome personality and we really had a ""click."" Long story short, I kissed her on the first date and I saw a potential girlfriend in her.

---

After a lot more dates and about two months later she would fly out to northern Europe to visit one of her friends (21/F) there. Because of a storm her flight got canceled and she was pretty bummed about this. She was then looking for a hotel in our country so she would still go on a sort of a holiday. I made it pretty clear that I'd like to go with her, and she was fine with this. We went out to a wellness hotel where we would stay for one night. We'd sleep in one bed, so I figured ""well, we've been dating for two months, I guess it wouldn't hurt to try and make a move now"", so I did. Without sharing too many details: we were both in our underwear making out when I noticed something was off. I asked her if something was wrong, and she said she didn't know if she really wanted this to happen right now. So I immediately stopped and tried to figure out was exactly was wrong. Turned out she was still a virgin. In my mind I jumped a hole in the roof. A 22 year old girl with an amazing body and personality who was still a virgin. Holy shit.

---


At the end of that month (the hotel was at the start of december) I asked her to be my girlfriend, she said yes.

---

I tried to give her all the time and space she needed before trying to get into her pants again. I frequently asked her if she wanted to try having sex when we were making out, but when she would say no I'd stop trying. Two months later, she said yes. She finally felt comfortable enough to give it a shot, so we did.

---

Everything went fine, it hurt for her, but I told her to just tell me when she would want me to stop and I would. We would keep trying and we kept it to 2 sex positions max. (this was something she wanted) and focused on making it less painful for her.

---

We don't really see each other a lot, most of the times one or two times per week, and when we do, we go out into the town a lot. So we didn't really get to practice a lot.

---

Two months later, I noticed something odd. Went to the doctor, turned out I had HPV. It's an STD which you can get from just about anything. It appears on the genitals, but it's such a contagious virus that can even spreads through door knobs, towels and a hand shake. I told my girlfriend immediately, I explained that I didn't cheat on her and that it's a virus which you can get from just about anything. She remained very calm and we looked up some more information about the virus and agreed that it would be for the best if we didn't have sex for a while. She didn't have any symptoms, so we didn't know if she had the STD, and I didn't want to infect her.

---

Fast forward to the summer and the virus was gone. We had sex again. It was painful for her again, because we didn't had sex for a few months. 

---

A month later I get symptoms again (the virus is pretty tricky, apparently in about 90% of the cases it returns within a year) and I go to the doctor again. We stopped having sex again.

---

A month later, symptoms are gone again. This time it is gone for good. We have sex again. Still focusing on trying to make it less painful for her instead of experimenting. 

---

Fast forward to current time. We are still having sex, but it's not happening a whole lot since we don't see each other that often and when we do, we're not at home that much. She started to show more interest last month, where she would be the one buying condoms and lube, and even a little vibrator (which she still didn't use. I would be fine with it if she did, I want her to start enjoying sex). 

---

It's not that painful for her that anymore, only at the start. With lube it has improved a lot. We still didn't try out more than 2 sex positions and the penetration part isn't lasting that long because she's still tight as fuck. I didn't have any problems with lasting long in bed with my exes, because we would do it a couple of times per week and they weren't as tight. With my current girlfriend however, we're having sex about 4 times a month max.

---

If I look back to my exes, we would have sex multiple times a week and we would experiment a lot. I know that I can't (and shouldn't) compare people, but for me sex is really important. I've been really patient with my girlfriend and I want her to start enjoying the sex, but it just isn't happening right now.

---

She really loves the foreplay (like 20-30 minutes of it), but doesn't seem to enjoy the penetration. The more foreplay we do however, the less I last during the penetration. If I look back to our holiday together, we had sex every day and it was amazing. I would last a whole lot longer and she seemed to enjoy the penetration on the second day and after. I want this situation back, having sex a few times a week and we both enjoy it a whole lot. 

---

I'm getting sexually frustrated because we don't have sex that often as I'd like to, as long as I'd like to, and we're not experimenting which I'd like to.

---

Take last week for example. We saw each other two times. After going out we went back to her place and talk for a bit. I initiate the sex, and she breaks it off saying she's too tired after a long day. 
At this point all I can do is sigh and sit there frustrated. She notices and asks what's wrong. I explain the situation and she explains that she wants it too, but not just right now because the day was pretty long and she doesn't enjoy it and it hurts even more when she's tired..

---

***TLDR: She's a great girl and I'm really in love with her, and everything is going great, except for the sex. I was really patient with her and after a few months she lost her virginity to me. Because of an STD we had a long break of not having sex, and recently started to have sex again because the STD is gone. After a few months it's not getting any better than before our break: I'm getting sexually frustrated because we don't have sex that often as I'd like to, as long as I'd like to, and we're not experimenting which I'd like to. ***

I speak several languages like English, German and French so i could do it in several countries. So, people who did fun internship how did you find it?"

Ill be graduating this year but due to transportation limitations I was not able to work an internship this last summer. I am in a finance group on campus and take as many finance related classes as I can, but I know these things are not substitutes for in field experience. My question is, what type of position I should be looking for once I graduate? Should I still be looking for internships or should I try and find a full time position and explain my circumstance? (Assuming I can land an interview) Also I know IB positions have interviews that start as soon as January if not sooner, and was wondering if this the same for wealth management positions? If so, should I be looking for opportunities now knowing that I wont be able to reliably get to and from work until I move after graduation?"

So, I have to fill up this employment form where I need to write down my desired salary. I couldn't find much on glassdoor. Any ideas?

P.S. In My last internship in IT support at my university, I was paid $16/hour.

P.P.S. The employment agreement form has a huge section about doing a background check on me. Not that I have anything to hide but what if one of my previous boss' is having a bad day and says that, I am lazy or don't know my stuff. Does that mean, I will Immediately lose the offer?"

Within a few weeks he had me buy him a computer and build it for him.  Yay! Another holy convert praise GabeN!  But my brothers this was not the end.

My name is Joseph and I am a video production assistant at the Orlando Sentinel, a freelance video producer for the internationally award winning animal shelter the Halifax Humane Society, and a graduate of the BFA Film Production program at the University of Central Florida. 
            
As a producer, I have created economical sales packages to entice the interest of local actors to participate as extras, with perks ranging from free professional modeling photos to free hair and cosmetic makeovers with to no additional cost to the production.  

As an editor, I have experience in cutting together narrative short films, documentary styled shorts, news packages, and TV commercials in addition to helping out other professionals with pacing, color correction, equalizing sound levels, and with the creation of soundscapes.  I am very familiar with transcoding digital assets to suit various needs, exercising proper video file organization techniques, and know the importance of backing up all data.    
              
I have directed films with as many as 70 people involved and have gained invaluable knowledge under “The Last of the Mohicans” prop master Vern Crofoot while serving as an intern on a professional film set.  At UCF I was trained by industry professionals such as Barry Sandler, Ula Stoeckl, and Jesse Wolfe in all manners of production.

I currently reside in Orlando, Florida.  However, both my girlfriend and I are looking to relocate. 

I own a Mac OSX dual monitor desktop computer for editing with Adobe Creative Suite CS6 installed as well as Final Cut Pro 7.  I also own an H4N Zoom audio recorder and anticipate owning either a Canon T4i or 60D in the near future.

I believe I could be of great service to your company and would love to have an opportunity to discuss with you any ideas for the position you may have available.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

1scwwv,2,2013-12-07,How soon is too soon to attack internships?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1scwwv/how_soon_is_too_soon_to_attack_internships/,"(Posting here because /r/internships is *incredibly* slow)

Hey gang. In the past year I have changed my course of study from Psychology to Information Systems. Knowing Ill come out with skills I can fully get behind and positively market makes me very confident about the future so to make things seem even brighter, I want/need an internship. Next week will mark the end of my first official semester in IS and the midway point of my 3rd (Junior) year of college.   
I not 100% certain how a company will view me having spent such little time within the major and whether or not Ill be competitive with 2nd 3rd or 4th year applicants.   
My ""weapons"" in the intern application fight - I'm very much a self learner and my resume can reflect that ( 1 lab assistant/managing + 1 independent research gig) and Ill have had an almost L1 tech support job for 1 semester now.  Thats about as I can supply here aside from a resume.

Any thoughts? Should I give myself another semester go full steam ahead into the search?"
1scrhd,1,2013-12-07,My girlfriend of nearly five years and I broke up almost three weeks ago now and I'm still getting through it.,helpme12345,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1scrhd/my_girlfriend_of_nearly_five_years_and_i_broke_up/,"It was a very messy break-up. Basically, she left to go abroad for a while, turns out her internship was basically shit and that she only stayed so she could enjoy some new freedom and paying nearly 12,000 in the process. She made friends and, even though I told her I felt very strange about the whole thing, I tried to support her as best as possible.

While she's gone I begin to fall for another girl here. We talk, have a lot in common, and even though it's just a crush at first, I begin to feel more in tune with the new girl. My girlfriend comes home and suddenly everything is wrong. I don't feel for her and, through very reliable sources of information, I know that she's in the same boat. A few days after she gets back, I tell her I need a break to sort things out in my head. I tell her that I have feelings for this other girl and that, after everything in our relationship (which consisted of me going through a lot of pain for her, trying to impress her half the time, getting her to communicate with me in a way a couple should, etc.) that I needed to see if my feelings for her would come back.

After a few hours, she decides she doesn't want to wait. She comes over and breaks up with me. I don't feel quite as bad as I thought I would at that point. Fast forward a week and I find out she's already slept with one of my ""friends"" and fooled around with another ""friend"". There's already drama brewing between those three and I suddenly become outnumbered in who used to like me versus who chose her ""side"".

It's been almost three weeks now and I'm going through strange phases. I miss her at points, feel angry at points, and then just feel empty. I poured so much of myself into her that now that she's gone I'm not sure where to expend my energy. She's trying so hard to get everyone to hate me and I understand that she's hurt but right now, especially after learning everything, I'm dealing with pain too.

I don't know what to do. All our relationship I gave my all and she only returned some. I sacrificed everything and when I realized I wasn't very happy and found someone who could make me happy (something she's done to me multiple times), I'm the villain, although when she put me in the same situation, I gave her time and space. 

Fuck these people. I've always tried to be a good person, so why is it that I'm being crucified?"
1scoi0,1,2013-12-07,How much do I charge for a basic restaurant web site?,killahbeeyall,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1scoi0/how_much_do_i_charge_for_a_basic_restaurant_web/,"I've been asked to create a website for a restaurant in my city. It needs to have photos, a menu (changes every week or so), hours of operation and a contact page. All of them need to be easily updatable by the restaurant owner. Because of the simplicity of the site and the requirement that it be easily updatable, I've been leaning towards WordPress for its development. The restaurant is sort of a classy place, so the website also needs to be visually appealing (I assume I would just use a WP theme to help with this). My questions are:

* Is WordPress the right choice for this kind of thing?
* How long would it take the average developer to build a basic web site like the one described? (I have experience with ASP.NET MVC and Ruby on Rails, but I've never used a CMS like WordPress before as my framework)
* What is a fair total price, or hourly wage, to ask for?  I'm still a student, but I've been employed as an intern web developer in the past at a local software company and at that point I was earning $22/hr. Would that be a fair amount?
* Does the owner even need someone like me to set up this site for him, or is WordPress simple enough that he could do it himself?

Thanks for any help you guys can provide :)"
1scnx8,141,2013-12-07,The Dirtsheet Round-Up - December 7th 2013,LegaleseFalcon,SquaredCircle,https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1scnx8/the_dirtsheet_roundup_december_7th_2013/,"* Rob Van Dam was asked on Twitter if he was coming back to WWE. He replied ""Soon enough, but not too soon."" So the Royal Rumble then!

* Lanny Poffo has been ranting and raving again about his brother, the late Randy Savage, being included in the Hall of Fame to ShiningWizards.com. Basically, he says WWE has disrespected Savage's memory by doing the Nacho Man and the Huckster and the Hulk Hogan(HBK)/Larry King thing which happened six years and 18 years before Savage's death so I'm not sure if Lanny knows what day it is at the moment. He closed the interview about the HOF saying they can do it but he won't go, won't take the 30 pieces of silver ""because that's what it took for Judas Iscariot to betray Jesus."" He did talk a lot about other stuff like how the best thing about wrestling is it's non-smoking and he has google maps now so he wouldn't get lost. 

* So Universal Studios may be making an announcement about its CityWalk that MAY be a WWE physical Hall of Fame building but MAY not be that and might not be wrestling related at all. The sheets are speculating that it would mean TNA would have to vacate Soundstage 19, the current iteration of the impact zone but it could all be bollocks!

* TNA Spoilers? TNA SPOILERS! DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW HOW THE WORLD TITLE TOURNAMENT ENDS. You were warned. [Jeff Hardy was written off television from December 26th because he can't travel to the UK for the UK tour and tapings. There is speculation that he could actually be done with the company as he ""retired"" at the taping. His deal was signed up to January 2014 but an option year was available to take it to 2015 but again, no-one knows what's happening.](/spoilers)

* OTHER NEWS THAT IS ALSO A TNA SPOILER INVOLVING THE WORLD TITLE: [AJ Styles is reportedly done with TNA having lost to Magnus in the title unification match recorded for January 9th and gave a speech to the fans saying ""storyline or not"" Dixie can forget about him and that it's real life and that he's thankful for the fans and TNA for letting him wrestle. Outside of the ring, Styles and TNA have been negotiating over a contract but as of this week's tapings, no deal was reached and the main issue was money. Styles wants a lot more than TNA is able/willing to give him and it seems that Styles may be done. He is already taking independent bookings now anyway so we'll see.](/spoilers)

* Back to the nitty gritty, generally speaking, the people who are not going anywhere any time soon are Big E Langston and Nikki Bella. The pair are extremely close to John Cena who is apparently now the Triple H of the WWE locker room. EDIT: For clarity, the part about Cena being Triple H is my assessment of it because Triple H was the guy you needed to be in with like ten years ago or so the story goes.

* Richards and Edwards are working as ""interns"" at NXT until March. Basically, I don't think WWE is paying them but they're getting to work at the PC and there's possibly a job for them with actual money. They've been described as model employees and it's been said that they were destroyed by The Ascension to see how they'd react but they just got on with it. Quite the contrast from what was said about them after they left ROH earlier this month.

* Tons of Funk and the Funkadactyls were to all turn heel in the near future but now that Total ~~Dipshits~~  Divas has been renewed the production company told WWE to keep the funkadactyls as likeable as possible. Tons of Funk will be turning heel though anyway and becoming a ""top heel tag team."" I guess they realised that they have a lot of face tag teams and like two heel ones if you count the Shield.

* Orton is seen as more likely to win the title(s) at TLC than Cena because Cena won't be beaten clean because he just needs to not grab the title first and it won't mean anything if he loses. 

* WWE has been polling fans on what they'd like that isn't standard wrestling media and activities. Such ideas include a WWEShop like a Disney Store, a WWE animated movie ""for all the family"" (Pixar's Superstars anyone?), a WWE Fitness DVD hosted by people like Triple H, AJ, Stephanie McMahon and Randy Orton (or a pair of those, one male, one female - all heel, because only bad guys work out) and WWE Charity dinners - pay $50 and you can have dinner with wrestlers and what not to raise money for charities and stuff.

* Big news about WrestleMania XXX-1, WWE is set to announce that at the Santa Clara Convention Center that WreslteMania 31 will be held at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara while the Hall of Fame will be held at SAP Center in San Jose. The Levi's Stadium is currently unfinished but is set to open in July of next year. The 49ers were apparently key in the successful bid. It will also host the Superbowl in 2016.

* Alexander Rusev has been working on WWE Live Events without Lana, his PR assistant or whatever she is. He tapped out Zack Ryder so he could be on his way to the main roster sooner rather than later.

* Sami Calihan, now known as Solomon Crowe, seems to have some sort of hacker gimmick which he has been trying out at NXT Live Events. Crowe appears to use a tablet to take out the lights and stuff and beat up people then manipulate stuff so he can escape. It's all very 1999.

* There is speculation that some matches for Mania might be set in stone already. The feeling is that Triple H vs. CM Punk is a likely match to happen between now and Mania or at Mania. Other rumoured matches include Triple H vs Cena and Lesnar vs Taker but the only source I have on those matches is some website called ""dailywrestlingnews.com"".

* People with common sense work in WWE! Despite what WWE App voters decided to call the champion - the WWE Unified Champion - they are probably just going to call it the Undisputed WWE Champion. 

* WWE has signed Randy Orton's 18 year old cousin Jasper. Didn't Scooby Doo have a cousin called Jasper?"
1si49x,141,2013-12-09,I can change passwords...with my mind.,restart_first,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1si49x/i_can_change_passwordswith_my_mind/,"Some back story....I worked as an I.T. intern for (a City) for about a year.  Loved every second of it.  Almost.  Anyways, about 6 months into my internship I was given the opportunity to lead a PC replacement/Windows 7 upgrade project.   I basically created the Win7 image, decided how/when to deploy, contacted users, etc.  By the time this story occurred, my team and I were rolling through replacements.  We set everything up at the shop and the users pretty much watched us swap their PC, logged in, tested their apps and they were good to go.  

So...we get to this one department, everything is going fine until we get to the secretary.  We will call her G. I had seen her a few times before, she was always pleasant, and seemed really easy going when I told her it was time to replace hers.  In about 10-15 minutes time I'm ready for her to log in and start testing.  Here's how the conversation went:

Me: ""Ok, G, you're all set let's just have you log in and test out a few things.""

*she types in her username and password* 

**Username or password is incorrect**

Me: ""Hmmm, ok try again.""

*she types in her username and password* 

**Username or password is incorrect**

G: ""It's not working.  What did you do.""

I lean in and with my specialty eyeballs I can see a big ol' glaring space right before her username.

Me: ""Looks like there's a space before your username, why don't you try typing it in again?""

She slowly highlights her username...and then..

G:"" WHAT, YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TYPE?  I PUT IT IN RIGHT.  YOU MUST HAVE CHANGED MY PASSWORD.  WHAT DID YOU DO.  SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH IT.""

Me: ""Ok, why don't I try logging in to make sure I can get in.""

I do this for two reasons.  To prove nothing is wrong with the computer, and to erase her username so she has to type it in again.  It works fine.  However, this somehow is proof to her that I changed her password.

G: ""IF IT'S WORKING FOR YOU YOU MUST HAVE CHANGED MY PASSWORD.""

I consider explaining that I am an intern, I don't know her password, I don't have rights to change her password, and I have **no reason** to change her password.  But I simply say:

""Why don't you just try it again...""

She does.  It works.  Proof that I didn't change her password.  Or not..

G:""I KNOW I TYPED IT IN RIGHT THE FIRST TIME.  YOU CHANGED IT SOME HOW.  I KNOW ABOUT COMPUTERS TOO.""

I kid you not, she insisted that I changed her password (for no reason), then magically changed it back WHILE STANDING OVER HER SHOULDER.  She then proceeded to refuse to let me touch her PC and called the Help Desk to complain about me.

I just ended the 1st semester of my 2nd year in EE, and I currently have the choice between one of the following:

* Work for 16 months starting next summer, then come back to school and finish my 3rd and 4th year (with a 4-month summer in between).
* Do 3 internships as scheduled by my co-op program - 1 4-month internship next summer, 2 8-month internships in my 3rd &amp; 4th years.

I have an interview with someone who wants me to work for them for 16 months. The position is in an area I want to work in at a large company.

I know different schools have different lengths of co-op work terms/internship lengths - what have some of your experiences been working for longer/shorter periods of time?"

I have been fairly proficient and interested at programming since middle school, so when it came time to graduate high school and move on in life, I decided to study Computer Science in college. A year and a half in, I became discouraged with book work and not being able to do well on tests, while at the same time, doing fantastic on lab projects. Around this time, I discovered I had a knack for IT related projects (fixing and exploring new hardware, building systems from scratch, etc), so I focused on getting by in college, and using my co-ops doing IT jobs (helpdesk and net-sec). When graduation came around, I had no problem finding an IT job, both with my degree and experience. Cycle around to today, three years later, and I hate working in IT (it's a great hobby!) because there is little room for creativity in this field (things have to be done a certain way to work with other things), and I am completely burnt out basing my day to day work reactively, instead of proactively. On top of that, having to be aware of all issues 24 hours a day, 7 days a week is really getting to me. I want to go back to programming. However, this poses a few issues:


* I have zero professional experience programming other than some simple bash/perl scripting, writing Nagios checks, and crafting Puppet modules, none of which are very high level skills that would help me get a programming job.
* I was discouraged from book learning in my Comp Sci classes (hey, I was going to have a great career in IT right?!), so my knowledge of related topics is not very in depth. I understand basic fundamentals like object oriented design, classes, recursion, etc, but I remember/understand next to nothing about higher level things such as algorithms and data structures.
* I don't do well under pressure. Deadlines and completion dates for projects are one thing, but every time I have to sit down and complete a task for a test (i.e. interviews), I freeze. This has only happened in my programming interviews. Every IT interview I have been on has been a great, comfortable discussion between the interviewer and myself.


What I do have going for myself is that I am a very quick learner. I picked up bash scripting within a week (to the point where I understand the layout and functions of the language, I still require reference for the syntax about 60% of the time, but that gets better the more I do it), same with Nagios and Puppet. I also love learning new things. I currently have a CentOS box sitting in my living room that I use to host game servers that I built from scratch for fun, just so I could learn the ins and outs of the OS and what it takes to get things to run in Linux.


I know I am not doomed to be stuck in a IT related position forever, however, I have no idea what my next steps are to get out. I also would like to do it as soon as possible, I am planning to move away from Boston to either New York or San Francisco as soon as possible, hopefully using this career change as the final catalyst to push myself to move. I understand that I could look for more internships, but unfortunately I am stuck in the loop of extremely high student loan payments, so that is financially unattainable. I also understand that I could move to a place that isn't as expensive as where I have my sights set, but mentally that won't work (depression is a cruel cruel bitch).


**TL;DR: I am 26 years old, burnt out from working in IT already. Graduated with a CS degree from a decent private school three years ago. Want to switch to a career where everything I do isn't reactionary on a day to day basis, preferably in software development. I don't know what to do to get there. I am hoping this subreddit can give me some advice/point me in the right direction on my next steps.**"
1shvo6,19,2013-12-09,Did I pick the right major? Wrong school?,whatitdo54,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1shvo6/did_i_pick_the_right_major_wrong_school/,"I'm a 3rd year Computer Information Systems major and I keep thinking to myself, did I pick the right major? Some background: I have never been great at C++ programming. My introductory comp sci course was in C++ and I understood most of it and had an easy time until we got to some of the more complicated stuff like arrays, still passed class with c+. My intermediate programming course I struggled in a lot and got a lot help from a friend who was at the time in upper division CIS. I relied heavily on his coding and became reliant on it by the time I made it to my advanced programming course, data structures.

I have had two internships at the same hospital every summer so far doing some light .NET and ASP.NET programming as well as some web work - HTML, CSS, and some database work. I picked up HTML/CSS relatively fast and I really enjoy making web pages. On the other hand it took some mentoring from a coworker at my internship to learn .NET and databases since I hadn't taken any courses in either yet. After about a month or so I was a lot less reliant on my coworker, and understood databases fairly well. I'm not great with C# but I can manage. I will most likely have an internship there again this summer and start my career there after I graduate.

Fast forward to now and I work at the university I attend as a part-time web developer, and I enjoy my work and got a pay raise within the first month I started work. I'm currently taking a class in assembly language and digital circuits and I'm not doing so hot. I didn't have too much trouble with assembly language but I struggle with sequential circuits, flip flops, you name it. I'm also taking a networking class where we've had to do a few projects in C++ and again I have relied on my friend who is now almost graduated, however, I do really well on the tests in that class and will most likely pass with an A.

So basically, I suck at C++, digital circuits are not my thing, I'm ok with C#, I enjoy web developing (HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript), and I know what I'm doing in regards to databases. My main concern however, is that my university bases many of the courses on C++ and my friend won't always be around to help me when it comes to C++. Did I pick the wrong school? Wrong major? (business courses that go with my major come easily to me so their not an issue)"

1sh6nq,30,2013-12-09,[Advice] My parents for the past 2 years are becoming more and more disappointing and disapproving of my lifestyle even with all my accomplishments (24 M),magnumstg16,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1sh6nq/advice_my_parents_for_the_past_2_years_are/,"Sorry this is so long but I think I need to be descriptive..

I come from a pretty religious and strict (immediate) family.  My dad is now a retired cop, mom is recently retired, brother is 26 with a kid and married and pretty religious.  I am 24, still in school, with a bachelors in criminal justice and getting my masters degree in CJ.  The serious ""shit hit the fan"" talk happened during my graduation weekend from undergrad two years ago.  Some history during my college years: partied a lot - joined a fraternity freshman year, graduated with a 3.86 magna cum laude, was Vice President of my Fraternity two years in a row, involved in numerous organizations/groups/honor societies, completed an internship with a federal law enforcement agency who gave me the highest marks, and was appointed to the most prestigious student position at my university that is appointed by my States Governor.  We had a party with 4 of my best friends and our families after graduation to celebrate during the day.  It was really the first time my parents were around all of us drinking and telling stories and having fun.  Come to the next day my family and I go to church, then out to eat with my parents (they tell my brother and sister in law to go somewhere else so we could be alone).  My parents pretty much break down at the restaurant telling me how scared they are of my lifestyle and friends, that I'm an alcoholic, have no religion in my life and don't seem to care about anything.  They tell me that they won't support me financially living with my buddy I plan to move in with because of the stories they heard about him.  We're all crying and it was pretty fucking upsetting to me, I still get uncomfortable thinking about it.  I still decide to live with my buddy and I'm now graduating in May with my Masters degree and a 4.0 gpa (I'm also a graduate student teaching classes and going to school for free).  

Since I'm graduating soon, I've been job searching and I was in the process of getting on with a state police department.  I completed the polygraph (2nd stage of the process) and received a letter from them indicating I wouldn't be considered for the position.  My parents brought it down to me at college and we had another talk.  They again voiced their disapproval of my lifestyle, lack of religion, life choices, etc.  They also voiced their concerns about how secretive I am about my life at college, I call them a lot with ""updates"" but I never tell them my feelings, concerns, doubts, etc.  My dad indicated that if I didn't make it with this agency, I need to reconsider my choice to go into law enforcement.  This talk, as you can imagine, came at a shitty time since I was just rejected for in my career field.
My 4 friends are all successful and graduated with better grades than me.  They graduated with me and are doing great in their careers, getting promoted, etc and I still visit them, hang out party, etc so its not like they are bad people, bringing me down or bad influences on me.

So my frustrations are that I'm just confused.  I don't live the same lifestyle as my parents, they are socially quiet, religious, and more or less boring.  I love to socially drink with my friends, I am an Atheist (though I haven't told them yet in fear of more disapproval and more financial restrictions, I have told them I am currently struggling with religion), I love to be involved in school and stay busy, I put my schoolwork about everything, and I am determined to be successful in my CJ career.  I'm also not the kind of person to share feelings or talk about those kind of things, I usually think about them internally or I don't even think about it at all, this is pretty different from my brother who is more open.  I'm interested to see some outside opinions from reddit on the situation, what can/should I change to appease my parents and what should I keep the same so as to not change ""who I am"".  I have made some mistakes, sure, but I think my track record is pretty damn good so whats going on? 

TL;DR: Parents disapprove of my lifestyle, yet I excel in everything I set my sites to.  Should I change anything to appease my parents expectations/requests?   

Edit: I really appreciate all the responses they have helped me think about this more objectively!"

Basically I recently graduated from University with a Master's (I think Master's degree has same meaning in Europe and the US ? Basically five years in University and now my studies are over) and now I'm looking for a job. Many (if not most) of the ads that I've seen on various sites require at least 3 years of experience ""in the field"". That makes me sad because obviously as a ""just-graduated"" person, if I'm being honest I have at most 6 months of experience (my end-studies internship).

But still I've worked on university projects as well as personal ones, so it's not like I've ""never done anything"". How ""flexible"" are those requirements ? Is it pointless to apply for something that requires, say, 2-3 years of experience or is it just their way to ""try to attract good candidates"" ? Obviously I am not going to apply to any job with ""senior"" in the title because that makes no sense, but honestly I have seen perhaps one job title that explicitly said ""0-2 years, intended for people who want to break into the industry"" (not going to lie, it's the videogame industry since I have a programming and AI background, if I can't get a job in this industry though I'll broaden my search for other programming/developing jobs but... I know I'd get crazy or depressed if I worked for something like a bank)

Side questions since I know at least half of Reddit is from the US : how low are my chances to be hired by a US-based company as a European (French) citizen ? I've seen some company explicitly mention that it is possible (such as Riot Games), but most don't mention it at all. I've emailed a few of the ones that interested me about it but there's no guarantee that I'll receive an answer after all.

Thanks for your answers, and sorry for the wall of text."

Before I give my tip, I want people to understand we're always going to be striving. I still have stuff I have to work on, and I keep feeling like I've made no progress. But then today I actually stopped and looked at how far I'd come in terms of discipline over the past 2 years. The results are awesome, even my close friends comment and draw inspiration from me. Sure there are still a tonne of stuff I feel awful at, but as my bodybuilder friend keeps saying ""In my head I'm still that skinny 16 year old.""

Anyway onwards,

About 4 months ago I got into the habit of carrying out a [quick 7 minute workout](http://lifehacker.com/this-7-minute-research-based-workout-exercises-your-wh-498676327) every other morning. This was huge for me, I'd never done any exercise in my past consistently. I carried it on for 2 months until my internship, as I had little time nor willpower in the morning for it. 

2 weeks ago I felt the winter blues start to kick in. Knowing exercise is an effective aid to depression, I chose to start working out again. Surprisingly even though it's been 2 months, I've been able to get back into the groove easily. 

It's like riding a bicycle, your brain never forgets. 

This is awesome, because it means if we build habits, and abandon them because of circumstances (this has happened alot to me), we know they'll come back easily if we start working on them.

Obviously I'm not going to go into the neurological reasons for this, if you've read the*Power of Habit* you can probably fill in those gaps yourself. 

Addendum: This probably works with negative habits as well as positive habits. This can be used to explain why when addicts relapse it gets quite bad. Whether it's diet, alcohol, drugs or porn. My achilles is snoozing my alarm for more than an hour after it goes off (yes it's really bad). I'd conquered this a few years go back, but alas I've relapsed back into it. Currently working on fixing it. It means though we should always be wary and conscious of us slipping back into old habits."

It's been a long time since I posted here. I have to admit, I thought I would never set my foot in here again, because I didn't believe I could make it anymore.

I have started nofap just before the summer and had great successes. I've gotten an internship, exercised reguraly, was eating healthy and socialized a lot more. I have gotten a job after my internship and recently been promoted. I have started meditating and got a goal to become as spiritual as possible. A lot of good stuff happened to me. I am also less sick now.

Now about the downside of my journey. When autumn began, my classes began too. With my new job I had a lot of stress and couldn't manage my time so well. I have stopped exercising. Slowly started giving up on other good activities. Started fapping again. Less frequently, but with bigger binges. Also with my desire to have multiple orgasms I started training myself to have an orgasm without ejaculation. I gota hang of it which led me to binges like 10 orgasms in one day or even more. 

I was still meditating almost every day. But I started using meditation as a pleasure tool. Trying to achieve an orgasm with only my mind (which I almost did). The need for pleasure still lives in me and is taking control by any means possible.

I am slowly losing the control of my life. I am trying to bring it all back at once and it is impossible to do. I realise now I need to go slowly, step by step.

I admit, I had a lot ot dark times and days, where I would binge on everything I could (fapping, food, internet etc). These were usually the days when I would give up on one of my activities and slowly give up on everything else. I think the real goal of trying to beat your weaknesses is to continue with your productive day once you've failed at one of your addictions.

I know my post is not a very well written. I have a lot of mind jumps and can't control my words. I am very far from my ultimate goal - being the best man I can be. Yet I still have hope and it keeps me going even tho I am failing more than I would like to admit. No matter how dark it gets - there's always a light in the dark. Find it and it will bring you back to your goals."

Me and my girlfriend are nearing our one year anniversary at the end of this month. I'll start at the beginning.

---

I met her through work. She was an intern at a different department. She organized a dinner for all people of the company who wanted to come. So we went out for dinner at a restaurant with about 15 colleagues. It was a real fun night, and after the dinner we went out for drinks. Long story short, this is where the tension between us started. She had already added me on Facebook way before this evening so we could talk a bit and we had exchanged numbers a while after. After this evening we talked even more and I asked her out on a date.

---

The date was really fun, she seemed like a really intelligent, fun and social person. I have a close friend which is also my colleague (at yet another department) which told me that this girl seemed nice, but that I could do better looks-wise. I didn't really care, the girl seemed to have an awesome personality and we really had a ""click."" Long story short, I kissed her on the first date and I saw a potential girlfriend in her.

---

After a lot more dates and about two months later she would fly out to northern Europe to visit one of her friends (21/F) there. Because of a storm her flight got canceled and she was pretty bummed about this. She was then looking for a hotel in our country so she would still go on a sort of a holiday. I made it pretty clear that I'd like to go with her, and she was fine with this. We went out to a wellness hotel where we would stay for one night. We'd sleep in one bed, so I figured ""well, we've been dating for two months, I guess it wouldn't hurt to try and make a move now"", so I did. Without sharing too many details: we were both in our underwear making out when I noticed something was off. I asked her if something was wrong, and she said she didn't know if she really wanted this to happen right now. So I immediately stopped and tried to figure out was exactly was wrong. Turned out she was still a virgin. In my mind I jumped a hole in the roof. A 22 year old girl with an amazing body and personality who was still a virgin. Holy shit.

---


At the end of that month (the hotel was at the start of december) I asked her to be my girlfriend, she said yes.

---

I tried to give her all the time and space she needed before trying to get into her pants again. I frequently asked her if she wanted to try having sex when we were making out, but when she would say no I'd stop trying. Two months later, she said yes. She finally felt comfortable enough to give it a shot, so we did.

---

Everything went fine, it hurt for her, but I told her to just tell me when she would want me to stop and I would. We would keep trying and we kept it to 2 sex positions max. (this was something she wanted) and focused on making it less painful for her.

---

We don't really see each other a lot, most of the times one or two times per week, and when we do, we go out into the town a lot. So we didn't really get to practice a lot.

---

Two months later, I noticed something odd. Went to the doctor, turned out I had HPV. It's an STD which you can get from just about anything. It appears on the genitals, but it's such a contagious virus that can even spreads through door knobs, towels and a hand shake. I told my girlfriend immediately, I explained that I didn't cheat on her and that it's a virus which you can get from just about anything. She remained very calm and we looked up some more information about the virus and agreed that it would be for the best if we didn't have sex for a while. She didn't have any symptoms, so we didn't know if she had the STD, and I didn't want to infect her.

---

Fast forward to the summer and the virus was gone. We had sex again. It was painful for her again, because we didn't had sex for a few months. 

---

A month later I get symptoms again (the virus is pretty tricky, apparently in about 90% of the cases it returns within a year) and I go to the doctor again. We stopped having sex again.

---

A month later, symptoms are gone again. This time it is gone for good. We have sex again. Still focusing on trying to make it less painful for her instead of experimenting. 

---

Fast forward to current time. We are still having sex, but it's not happening a whole lot since we don't see each other that often and when we do, we're not at home that much. She started to show more interest last month, where she would be the one buying condoms and lube, and even a little vibrator (which she still didn't use. I would be fine with it if she did, I want her to start enjoying sex). 

---

It's not that painful for her that anymore, only at the start. With lube it has improved a lot. We still didn't try out more than 2 sex positions and the penetration part isn't lasting that long because she's still tight as fuck. I didn't have any problems with lasting long in bed with my exes, because we would do it a couple of times per week and they weren't as tight. With my current girlfriend however, we're having sex about 4 times a month max.

---

If I look back to my exes, we would have sex multiple times a week and we would experiment a lot. I know that I can't (and shouldn't) compare people, but for me sex is really important. I've been really patient with my girlfriend and I want her to start enjoying the sex, but it just isn't happening right now.

---

She really loves the foreplay (like 20-30 minutes of it), but doesn't seem to enjoy the penetration. The more foreplay we do however, the less I last during the penetration. If I look back to our holiday together, we had sex every day and it was amazing. I would last a whole lot longer and she seemed to enjoy the penetration on the second day and after. I want this situation back, having sex a few times a week and we both enjoy it a whole lot. 

---

I'm getting sexually frustrated because we don't have sex that often as I'd like to, as long as I'd like to, and we're not experimenting which I'd like to.

---

Take last week for example. We saw each other two times. After going out we went back to her place and talk for a bit. I initiate the sex, and she breaks it off saying she's too tired after a long day. 
At this point all I can do is sigh and sit there frustrated. She notices and asks what's wrong. I explain the situation and she explains that she wants it too, but not just right now because the day was pretty long and she doesn't enjoy it and it hurts even more when she's tired..

---

***TLDR: She's a great girl and I'm really in love with her, and everything is going great, except for the sex. I was really patient with her and after a few months she lost her virginity to me. Because of an STD we had a long break of not having sex, and recently started to have sex again because the STD is gone. After a few months it's not getting any better than before our break: I'm getting sexually frustrated because we don't have sex that often as I'd like to, as long as I'd like to, and we're not experimenting which I'd like to. ***


I love this girl and I can imagine a future with her, but I'm getting sexually frustrated right now and I want some advice on what to do before I do something stupid."

Now the fun part!
I am currently studying Software Engineering in my 3rd year at UBC, (featured in Travis and Doublelift vs the World) and home of the UBC Esports Association featured here http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/community-programs/collegiate-game-changers-ubc and I have been playing League of Legends for two years now, and I have never fell in love with a game more. I love video games, but the reason why League of Legends is almost like the perfect game is because it connects the most casual gamer to the most hardcore professional gamer. In addition, rather than games appearing as a geeky hobby, games are being now seen as a legitimate and important aspect of life, and League is starting to make games matter more than they have ever did in the past. I can go on, and on of how League of Legends brings people together, creates friendships, and even makes people belong and accepted to a community, but I'll leave that for my cover letter ;)

Part of the reason why I made this app is get more people interested in League of Legends, give new players assistance, learning basic in game mechanics like ""last-hitting"", and help those getting started with ""ranked"". It is an overall better experience when more of your friends are playing, which is what I've noticed, and getting more of your friends playing (whether it's ranked/normals or ARAMs) is what SoloLegend is set to achieve.

Another big reason for why I made this app is as a compliment to my resume and transcript when I apply to Riot Games for an internship in the summer of 2014. I called the app SoloLegend because, if anyone has played Solo Queue, it is mainly about improving personally as a ""solo"" player, and not blaming your teammates or anyone else. Also my summoner name is ""SoloLegend"", which will be good if Riot associates my summoner name with my app when I apply for an internship ;)

This app took me about 1 month to make by myself while taking a full course load, but with the help of the League community, it can be better! If you're a computer graphic artist and can produce Better artwork for icons, missile and particles, sprites, the app can have so much more features that are mostly limited by art (e.g. baron/dragon smiting practice, skill/damage simulators, etc) PM me if you would like to help out with this app, with art or in other ways.

**FAQs:**

*Q: In the Team Builder, could you add Kennen to the list for Top, Annie to Support, Fiddlesticks to Support, etc.? Or maybe enable all the champions as sometimes there will be ordinary picks.*

A: You can change it via the Champion Info. Go to Kennen's/Annie's/Fiddlesticks page, toggle whichever roles you want a Champion to be under ""Roles Played"", and press Apply Changes. Or in Team Builder press Top twice, or the character portrait twice and All champs will be listed. This feature will be made clear in future versions.

*Q: Android plssss?*

A: Working on it! Will definitely see if I can get any Android Developer friends to help me port this quicker/easier.

TL;DR
Download SoloLegend on the App Store, hire me as an intern Riot =D, and if you want to contribute to this app (art, ideas, bugs, etc) PM me."

I'd just like to know if anyone could recommend a place to look for an internship or apprentice program if I'm not currently in college. I'm willing to relocate to just about anywhere in the country. I'm currently in Southern California.

1sfsw9,4,2013-12-08,Worried About Future Work Environments,PrettyDown,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1sfsw9/worried_about_future_work_environments/,"Hi TwoX, 

Let's start from the beginning: Last summer I scored my dream job (a summer internship in the history field). I'm currently a university student earning her BA and I wanted to be able to graduate with experience in my field (which is quite competitive). I worked hard in the years up to getting the job and did lots of volunteering to build up the ol' resume. When I finally got the job, I was overjoyed!

But things didn't go so well once I started. I knew my boss before being hired because I did volunteering for the organization I was hired by and he had recommended me for the new position, so he definitely thought highly of my work (he said so himself). However, when I started the job, things got really awful. He seemed to harbour some growing resentment towards me. The organization had been hit by hard times three months previous and it had definitely taken its toll on the few employees it had. Despite the organization's problems, I showed up to work everyday with a smile on my face, ready to deal with patrons and the like. This seemed to annoy him.

My boss was not a very excitable guy, which was fine to me, but he started treating me with some contempt. Initially, he just wouldn't really respond with much thanks when I would gladly volunteer to put in extra hours or help with building maintenance and the like (I wasn't looking for special treatment anyway, I just wanted to do my job well), but later on it became much worse. Every time I attempted friendly chatter (even as small as ""Good morning, how are you doing?"") he would treat me like a small child. It was so subtle that it nearly escaped my notice. 

One part of my job was to design a small project for the community. He refused to provide me with any guidance or critique despite the fact that I was supposed to be completing the project under his supervision. Instead, he treated me like I was nagging him each time I asked for feedback (each time I walked into our shared office I found him watching TV shows on his computer, so he wasn't too busy). I finished the project, which the organization required me to do in 4 weeks rather than the allotted 10 given to previous students in my position. I got lots of positive feedback from members of the community and loved making connections with local historians, but my boss declared it a failure on my part. Instead of admitting that he had not provided me with any guidance, he blamed me and treated me like an idiot for the rest of the summer. 

On certain occasions, I worked with a male employee of the same age and my boss always spoke to him with the utmost respect. I liked my fellow employee and it hurt that despite working every bit as hard as him I was not given nearly the same respect. 

At the end of the summer I was asked to give feedback to the organization. I had performed my job well and always maintained my professionalism despite everything. I told my boss directly that I felt he needed to work on his communication skills, which he accepted somewhat reluctantly (but I doubt he got the message). I told the organization that I enjoyed the work (which I did) but did not appreciate the work environment. 

It's been months now since I ended my job. I truly loved the work involved, but I hated the people, the environment, the way I was treated, etc. Now that I'm nearing time to graduate, I'm getting really nervous about future workplaces. I expect that I'll have to start at the bottom of the totem pole in the workforce and that's fine, but I cannot deal with the amount of anxiety, humiliation, and emotional pain that this job brought me. The everyday tension actually impacted my health towards the end of it.

I guess what I'm looking for here is some reassurance because I'm feeling pretty down. Any words of comfort or advice? Any personal experiences similar to this? How did you recover?

Thank you all for taking the time to read this. I appreciate it very much.

TL;DR: Got my dream summer internship. Turned out to be a nightmare. Boss was unhelpful and treated me poorly. I'm now worried about my future jobs in the same field.

I've failed before, and I'd bet I'd fail again.

I hide my ~3 g/day habit from everyone, which is easy since I have no social life outside of work and nobody sees my apartment to realize there's more drugs than furniture. Which is seriously not an exaggeration. I've spent a 1/4 of my income as an intern on weed.

I feel extreme anxiety about my drug use, the smell, my eyes, the neighbors.

Outwardly, I think I look okay. I'm in a relationship with a beautiful woman who loves me, although distance is straining that relationship. I'd like to blame weed, but I've just always been a fuckup. I have a nice job. I'm relatively more washed/employed than most men in their mid-20's. I have a bit of extra weight, but I'm tall and I have a fair bit of muscle.  

Recently, I've stopped smoking during the day. It's been helpful, given the increasing stress of my fucking job. Which likely contributes to me getting baked every night.

I'm just... I'm scared. I have no idea how to cope without fucking weed. I have no coping mechanism left. Exercise can only do so much. I have ZERO support. There is no way I could go to NA, because I wouldn't be anonymous. Also, I've read the literature and it sounds like some hardcore faggotry. Real Jehovah's Witness stuff. 

So where do I go from here?"

However, to be accepted into the major I have to apply, and applications can only be submitted ones the prerequisite courses have been taken. Seeing as how I am a freshman who just turned 18, I am not exactly close to being in the major. The potential internship is aware of this, and didn't seem to care whatsoever. I told him that I understand if he is looking for someone with more experience as far as coursework is concerned, but he said it's totally acceptable and he wants me to interview Tuesday at 12 and discuss the logistics of this internship. I know nothing, other than I want to do advertising. I want to either copywrite or be on the accounts side. When I told him this, he said ""we're a small firm with about 10 employees so we all operate as a team. So we'll all be working together. I need someone mainly to help me secure new clients. How good are you with computers"" I told him I was great with word and excel (lol) and he said ""perfect"".

I hate how I compare other women to her. It's so goddamn unfair. I met someone else who is probably an amazing person, but I can't emotionally recognize that because I'm still thinking about *her*.

I hate how this is making me sad, because there are so many things going in my life for me.

The reason is because i think php is messy, and everything we build on it end up messy as well (we use wordpress and yii).

1sl9pm,3,2013-12-10,Left Army/Navy Recruiter's Offices With More Questions Than Answers (Intelligence) (USA),militaryquestion7,Militaryfaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Militaryfaq/comments/1sl9pm/left_armynavy_recruiters_offices_with_more/,"Hi Everyone. I am going into my last semester of my senior year at a top 15 university, and I am interested in enlisting in either the Army or Navy (would consider other branches, but this is where I started) in the Intelligence (or similar, like PSYOPS for the Army) field. I have strong analytical and critical thinking skills, along with communications skills that I have developed over the last 4 years in various internships, which I believe would make me an asset to the military. In addition, I have played high level soccer for most of my life and as such I am in good shape.

I have a strong desire to serve my country, and at this point in time (while I'm young), I believe joining the military is the best way to do this. Today, I went and met with recruiters from both the Army and the Navy, and I brought these issues up and got no satisfactory response, so i was wondering if anyone can shed some light on it. 

* I unfortunately have had a few injuries over the course of my soccer career, namely a separated shoulder (NOT dislocated), partially torn ligaments in one of my knees, and two concussions. None of these currently impact me and my activity level, and I have suffered no post-concussive issues. My orthopedist said that my shoulder is just as strong as it would be before the injury, I just have an ugly looking bump. Most athletes choose not to have it surgically repaired because there is no functional difference in the shoulder, just cosmetically with the bump reduced. When I asked the recruiters about these injuries, they said not to bring them up because it ""just complicates things"" and that they would only need to see medical records for my shoulder because it is noticeable.

* I used to smoke marijuana from my sophomore year to end of junior year in college (and used magic mushrooms twice). It was not an everyday thing, but it was multiple times a week so I don't believe it would fall under the ""experimentation"" label. I asked about this, and both of them said something the lines of ""i'm not advocating for you to lie...but they can't really prove how much you have smoked so just say you did a few times."" 

Like I said, the few injuries I picked up over the years have ZERO impact on my physical activity. I have no post-concussive issues, and my knee and shoulder are just as strong as they would be pre-injury. In addition, I have quit smoking and have absolutely ZERO desire to start again, and have not stayed in contact with my so called friends who I used to indulge with. However, I feel extremely uneasy about even slightly fudging the truth if I take the next step and move on in the process to enlist. 

If the result of my choice to smoke marijuana and my few injuries means that I am ineligible to join the military or get a job in the intelligence (or related) field, than I understand that this is the consequence of my actions. I do not, however, want to lie about anything that will go in my record, because I think that the consequences my lying and getting caught far outweigh anything that I could do otherwise. 

Sorry for the wall of text, and I would really appreciate any feedback and insight on my situation."

One coworker swore I was 22, 23 at most), he suggested I look into updating my makeup routine (wearing lipstick, for instance).

After avoiding lipstick like the plague for years, I took the plunge and bought this Beauty is Life Kingdom lipstick. And I'm in love!

I'm wearing it today: http://imgur.com/vTQh75f

My question is...what type of blush should I pair it with? I'm probably going to stick with the drugstore price range for a bit until I get more comfortable (and have more money saved), so anything within that price range [I looked up the HG Master List Drugstore List so I know brands, but I'm a little lost with the color aspect of it].

I am currently a first semester sophomore CS student. I am taking the Spring semester off for personal reasons. Although I plan to get a job (part time or full time), I'll still have plenty of time that I think can be used productively. I have only taken Computer Science I, and we learned C++ (we stopped at two dimensional arrays). I liked it and got an A.

I was thinking of learning a language or something, or continuing with C++ with a book. I was not really sure since I am leaning towards web development as an interest. But I was also thinking about learning more abstract but crucial subjects such as Algorithms/Data Structures. Or at least trying to get a basic understanding of them. I really do find the math behind CS to be interesting and useful. Anyway, sorry for rambling. What am I asking here is for resources/books/ideas of how to make the most out of the semester and summer I will be off, so that maybe next school year I can land an internship or at the very least have a better résumé and knowledge of computer science.

1sklyq,3,2013-12-10,Are internships or github projects more beneficial for a computer science undergrad?,AManWhoSaysNo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1sklyq/are_internships_or_github_projects_more/,"I'm sure this has been asked before, but I can't come to a conclusion. I'm going into my sophomore year as a Computer Science major, and I've looked around the subreddit for awhile now and 90% of the suggestions for people seem to be either: ""Look for internships"" or ""Start some gitHub projects."" So I was wondering which of these would help me to learn more of what I need to know. I suppose pursuing both is an option, but I've already got a part-time job and school, so I'd rather just focus on one to keep me from being stretched to thin.

I'm leaning more towards just starting my own projects, because I feel that I would lack the necessary knowledge to gain/complete an internship. I'm only 3 semesters into my Comp Sci Degree (My Gen Eds are finished though.) and to make matters worse I'm attending a Community College, so I'm worried that what I've learned so far is inadequate (I've only learned C/C++/Python). When I actually type this all out, it actually feels silly to even consider an internship, but I had to ask. Any advice is greatly appreciated because as an inexperienced 19-year-old, I feel like I have little to no direction at all right now. I'm also terrified of not being able to have a job (compulsively), so I'm more than willing to do anything at all to better myself in this aspect. Thanks in advance."

Been following since your excellent live feed from OWS during the November raid.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyd9wb?context=5)|I think the role of the journalist is to collect as much information as possible and share it with the world so that they can decide what they think is best.

[As an independent journalist who has previously worked for little to nothing, how do you feel about the practice of unpaid internships in news media organizations?

 |Its important to know that no one thinks they are fascist though.
[The one time I visited Ukraine it appeared to be run by gangsters everyone else appeared to be struggling to get by.  It also seemed to be closed to the western world I saw no other tourists.

[Besides the riots, how do you like Ukraine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyfi3p?context=5)|I wouldn't call them riots but other than that the food is really great!
[Even if the protests bring about new leadership, do you think Ukraine can ever leave behind the culture of corruption left behind from the Soviet Union?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdydte7?context=5)|Its hard to say, many people here hope that the EU will wash away the corruption.
[Would you say that Ukraines past experience as a satellite state of the USSR is a major influence on the anti-russian sentiment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyfxan?context=5)|There are a few signs that say ""no to occupation, yes to integration"" and the word occupation has the sickle and hammer on it and blood dripping from it.
 |Personally I would say that sentiment is definitely here, but how pervasive is hard to say.

Don't lose focus and don't give up, as long as you keep producing work eventually people will find it.
 |Might not be the best answer but there isn't a secret other than work+sacrifice+luck.
[Thanks for the ama! Do the Ukrainian protesters, in general, seem more upset at missing a chance to become a part of the EU OR are they more upset about the government appearing to cozy up with Russia? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyfo90?context=5)|In the beginning it was about the EU but it seems now its more about corruption, less about EU or Russia.

[I can't recall where I read this, but is it true that there is a not so small presence of far-right, nationalistic and possibly neo-nazi groups involved in the protests? Golden Dawn-esque type?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyh16t?context=5)|Im told there is a group here affiliated with the Golden Dawn. In terms of nationalistic, many people here are singing the national anthem and waving the Ukrainian flag. It reminds me a bit of Tea Party rallies.
[How is this different (or similar to\) the protests in Turkey?  Meaning that this seems to be a protest of the current generation; does it resonate at all with older folks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdygp64?context=5)|Well for one political parties are backing the protests here.

[So many of us take this for granted but seeing a thread where someone is essentially broadcasting live from a news location and receiving feedback in real time is incredible.  In my case from someone with a phone in a pub.  It drives home how far tech has come and how versatile it can be (over the last ten years certainly, but I'm 40 and things have moved apace all my life\).

What advice can you offer me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyiy5g?context=5)|The people here corrected me many times, they want it spelled Kyiv. Also on google maps its spelled Kyiv.
[Also why did you choose to title this using the Ukrainian ""Kyiv"" instead of the more internationally recognizable ""Kiev""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyiy5g?context=5)|Before VICE I was just roaming about the US and Europe(a bit) reporting on events I saw as important.

 |The government wants to hold its ground and wait for the protests to fizzle out.
[Is it just stylish for us to start spelling Kiev as Kyiv now?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdygxb1?context=5)|People here have asked me to stop typing Kiev and start typing Kyiv. If you look at Google Maps it says 'Kyiv'

It looks good and pays good for an average internship.  Plus it's in a field I wanna continue.  
But I've been taking hard classes and working 15 - 20 hours a weeks.  I was already a busy person.  Involved in a club and intramurals.  It's killing me.  My GPA took a good hit and I failed my math final so I probably will get a D and have to retake it.  I'll pass two of my CS classes will a C and one with an A. I'm pretty stress out since I'm probably retaking my math course because of a test.  
Anyways my GPA was a 3.5, after this semester it'll go down to a ~3.0.

the build should have been an exact replica of a build on youtube (which works), but the shop where i ordered didn't have the graphics card of said build. therefore they offered me to upgrade to another graphics card for the same price, and they upgraded my powersupply too so the new graphics card gets enough power.

i leave you with the parts i picked and hope that one of you has a clue where faults may be:

Intel Core i5 4570 4x 3.20GHz So.1150 BOX

8GB (2x 4096MB) Crucial Ballistix Sport DDR3-1600 DIMM CL9-9-9-24 Dual Kit

Samsung SH-224DB/BEBE DVD-RW SATA 1.5Gb/s intern black Bulk

530 Watt be quiet! Pure Power L8 CM Modular 80+ Copper

3072MB PowerColor Radeon R9 280X OC Battlefield 4 Edition Aktiv PCIe 3.0 x16 2xDVI/1xHDMI/1xDisplayPort (Retail)

--------
-i checked that the mainboard is short-circuit free. i tried out the mainboard + 1 RAM stick + the graphicscard + the intel chip outside of the case (so the minimal components inside the mainboard), powered it up, and the on-and-off-turning-problem still remains.

things i checked/noticed to solve the problem:

-i checked that the mainboard doesn't get short-circuits from the case.

-the graphicscard AND the RAM-sticks are perfectly in place. yes, they are completely pushed in.

-all fans are turning when it's ""on"" for a short time. when the pc shuts down the front fan of the case stops first, then the fan of the powersupply, then the rest of the fans stop. (the case has 3 fans, the chip came with one fan to cool it, the graphicscard has 2 fans an there is a fan inside the powersupply)

-i kept myself anti-static during while working on the pc

-the intel-chip was put onto the mainboard with caution. no pins are damaged on the mainboards chip slot OR the chip.

-CPU power cable is plugged into the right spot on the top right of the card.

-i checked the ram sticks in all possible configurations with both a single stick or both sticks. the pc stays much longer ""on"" when only one stick of RAM is in the RAM slots.

-the fan that came with the intel chip is properly plugged in (i heard it can cause short-circuits) and receives power from the right mainboard slot (i heard some PCs don't turn on when the CPU-fan isn't powered).

questions i have:
-what faults could i have made with the wirering of the fans/HDD/DVD drive? could this be the problem?

-is my mainbard broken maybe?

-is the 530W of the ""BeQuiet!"" Powersupply enough for my Graphicscard? On Phone i was told that the upgrade i got would be enough. did they trick me? 

-is there something i could have done wrong elsewhere? i read the manuals off all the parts, but still, may i have wired something wrong?

-could the problem be a short-circuit somewhere (if yes, where could they occur?)

PS: sorry for the wall of text :S
PPS: i am german, my english might not be perfect. the youtubevideo i mentioned is on german too.

I've all but decided that I no longer want to pursue academia. As such, I am now in a somewhat awkward position to enter the actuarial workforce. 
  
Some (maybe) relevant facts about myself:

1. I'm 28 (I got a late start in university).

1. I graduated from a liberal arts college in a major US city with a double major in economics (honors) and mathematics (GPA: 3.95/4.00).

2. I passed P/1 Winter 2012.

3. I'll be sitting for FM/2 in February 2014 (I expect to pass).

4. I have working knowledge of C++ and Java and have recently spent some time learning SQL and SAS.

5. I have no internships or industry related work experience.


Some questions and concerns I hope reddit may address:

1. The job market seems to heavily value internships but the internships are almost exclusively reserved for undergraduates. Is there a workaround for this other than to simply spray and pray, ie. apply everywhere and contact working actuaries directly via SOA/CAS member logs?

2. How will potential employers view my entering a PhD program, staying for a year, then saying, ""this isn't for me""? Any ideas on how to best approach this topic?

3. Is it worth it to finish a master's degree while continuing to sit for exams before I attempt to find an entry level actuarial job? I worry that this might put me in a category of people whose education is extremely mismatched with their experience (a master's and, by graduation, three or four exams but zero real-world experience, actuarial or otherwise). 

4. Any general advice and/or thoughts are, of course, welcomed. 

Thanks all :)

1sju5s,6,2013-12-10,Having a lot of trouble trying to start a career in development; getting my first job. Is it better to have knowledge of many languages or high proficiency in a one or two?,Ziberzaba,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1sju5s/having_a_lot_of_trouble_trying_to_start_a_career/,"I just turned 30, and received my BS on physics last spring.  I did a 2 year internship that involved learning Python and MATLAB in my last year there.  This is where I discovered and fell in love with programming.  I find it to be an excellent mesh of creativity and problem solving.  I have been trying to find an entry level dev job since August, and so far am having very little success.  When I do get call backs they ask about skills/languages I never listed on my resume or stated I knew in my cover letter.  They then thank me for my time and tell me I'm not what they are looking for.  
  
This has happened probably four or five times now, and it is getting really frustrating.  I have continued to improve my Python skills; and am becoming very proficient, but recently I've been dedicating my time to increase the number of languages I know.  I've learned SQL, HTML / CSS over the past two months, and I'm about to start either PHP or JavaScript.  The problem is that while I'm learning syntax and commands, I'm not really ""working"" with these languages.  So my experience remains very superficial.  Should I be worried about this?  
  
So I here are my questions.  Is it better that I dedicate my time to becoming an excellent Python developer, or should I continue down the track of learning as many languages as I can as quickly as possible at a more superficial level?  Secondly, where should I be looking for these types of positions?  I've been applying to dev jobs on Dice, Indeed, and Sologig, with little success.  What are some other options?  Has anyone had luck finding entry-level work through consulting firms?  I'm really becoming scared that I won't find anything."

1sjn88,0,2013-12-10,Any advice for a recent graduate? Am I being pigeonholed?,nice_apple,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1sjn88/any_advice_for_a_recent_graduate_am_i_being/,"Ok. So I graduated in July with a 2:1 in Archaeology from a top ten university in the UK and basically since then I've only had a 3 day a week internship (which I only managed to get through nepotism). I've been looking for part time jobs in retail and such to help me get experience and enough money to live but I never get even a single reply or interview.

I feel that my background involves too much archaeology and that employers just cannot see it as relevant to them. I was very good with my money throughout university and because my family is poor as fuck I got huge amounts of extra grants and bursaries, I didn't need extra money so I didn't need a part time job. Thats not to say I wasn't busy, I was sailing in the university first team and was their bosun almost from the start of first year. I helped to found and edit an on campus technology and science magazine, hacking my way through red tape every step of the way. I took extra lessons in Russian and can hold short conversations.

In addition to this rather than spend my summers sat on my ass I got involved in a massive archaeological project going on long periods of excavation and doing well, some very physically and intellectually demanding work. In addition to this I continued to help the project during  term time through finds processing, lab work and quite a bit of messing with maps using various programs, in short I've been involved, done a lot and pretty much filled my days, reaching a ridiculous 70 hour week during my third year (I remember a time a long time ago when bank holidays and weekends were a thing).

I havn't done badly with larger companies and grad schemes, I have assessment centres coming up with IBM, Thales, Accenture and the Foreign office, however I'm very aware that my chances of actually getting a job from these is slim at best. 

For part time work no one will take me to even an interview, not even to work over Christmas in some shop, I have got nowhere with applying directly for entry level roles either, is stacking shelves for a few months really worth more to people than anything I have done or do people simply see ""He did archaeology, he isn't relevant to me""? and another thing, why do the larger companies not seem to care so much about a lack of work experience? Why am I less successful trying to get a job serving coffee than serving in the diplomatic corps?"

Need some help!!,[deleted],singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1sjj2p/anyone_worked_for_cmpb_or_knows_anything_about/,"I've searched everywhere but the answers are very vague. I tried calling but they just referred me to the website, even though I said I couldn't get the information I wanted. 

Here are my questions: 

Are the results during the screening instant? As in do I get my PES Status right after I finish, or is it mailed to me etc? I really have no time to return to the CMPB to collect results of my PES Status because I'm on my internship right now and my boss is **chronic** he just can't give a f*** when locals need to do what they need to do man. Just convincing this man to let me go for my medical screening was already a pain in the butt!

I just think it might not be because:

&gt;At the Clinical Laboratory Station blood samples are drawn for G6PD, haemoglobin and blood group typing tests. Simple urine tests to detect the presence of blood, protein and glucose (sugar) will also be carried out for you at the Station.""

Unless these test results are instant? Also are these the same tests used in illegal substance screening? Because if it is, I'm **pretty** sure it would take some time. 

Secondly, I also heard I will be naked with other men, which is a...urghhh. Is that true? 

Please I need some help!

**Edit 2: I'm pretty sure every man has gone through this, therefore my title is stupid and I should kill myself.**

1sjegh,62,2013-12-10,It's your fault that it's broken!,cowbeef01,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1sjegh/its_your_fault_that_its_broken/,"Hello everybody, first story yada yada yada you know it.

Bit of a backstory: I intern at a hospital as workplace manager. I fix computers and everything associated with computers. It's a fun job but the users can be insane.

So a few days ago we got a COW (computer on wheels, a laptop inside a cart) that was broken. The cart was broken, the computer was fine. We send the cart away to get it fixed. A day later we got a message saying it couldn't get fixed. We prepared a new cart for the users to use. This cart is a bit different compared to the old cart though, since you can't turn it back on easily. You have to unlock the cart to turn the computer back on. Of course there's a warning on the cart indicating that you should NOT turn off the computer. Anyway we deliver the COW and everything is great.


Skip forward to today. I got a call saying that the cow turned off... of course it turned off. I arrived and turned it back on and asked the people around if they could send an e-mail to the departement asking if they would not turn it off. I was about to leave when a doctor came and he was shouting saying that this system sucks because when you take away the note you couldn't see the message indicating that you shouldn't turn off the computer. Of course there was another sticker that you really have to force to get off the cart indicating this but the doctor wasn't satisfied. He went on ranting and demanding that they get the old cart back. I simply tell him that we can't do this since the old cart is broken BY THEM and we don't have any spares. He goes back into another room while shouting all sorts of things.


Call closed, mistake by user.


EDIT: Got a phone call from the head of the departement. He calls this situation ""Not possible to work in"" and demands something to be done with... Re-directed him to my boss/internship manager to deal with. (best we can do is drill a hole in the cart just so they can squirm their fingers in when they miss easy to follow directions."
1sjbyx,20,2013-12-10,Anyone ever work with a narcissist?,Jorcky,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1sjbyx/anyone_ever_work_with_a_narcissist/,"I started a new job during the summer, and got on great, loved everyone, got on well with my manager, did better on targets than expected, however the boss was always kind of a pain. Recently, due to the Christmas season, he's been working more and more, and it led to a bit of a run-in yesterday. 

He constantly moved me from the areas I excel at (customer service and sales) to the areas I suck at (stock rotation). He complained that I wasn't carrying enough, then complained that I dropped items when I tried to carry more. At one point I said upstairs when I meant to say downstairs, and he decided I hadn't listened to him, and told me I was being written up and to meet him in his office after my shift.

During this meeting, I noticed some very narcissistic trends in the way he talked. I explained that I had meant downstairs, evidenced by the fact that I then *went* downstairs, and he said ""that's not the point, you hadn't listened when I said it was in the basement"". I again explained that I had, I had checked the basement, I had simply said upstairs out of habit, as the stockroom is located there. He insisted that the proof didn't matter, he was still sure I hadn't listened to him.  

He also complained that I never took any initiative or made any decisions by myself. I pointed out that I have, and he frequently didn't like my decisions, and he said it doesn't count if they're wrong (which I'm sure they were at times, but I did what I thought best all the time), and that I need to start making my own decisions. But only exactly the ones he wants.

Then we talked for a while, and he brought up retraining. I pointed out that I hadn't actually ever been trained, it had been scheduled but due to a busy period, it never happened. He then told me to ask other staff for help if I needed it. I pointed out that I had done this, and one of the managers had given me a sales-line to use, that he had then complained to me for using, so I was confused as to what to do. He kept repeating either use the information in the induction video or ask a staff member, and ignoring me when I pointed out that asking a staff member had gotten me into trouble, even though she was management. 

THEN, he got really narcissistic. He started saying ""I don't know why you're making such a big deal about it anyway, accusing me of coming up to you and being rude and aggressive, I was trying to help"" I told him I know, I had never said he was rude or aggressive (although he was quite rude), I was just using it as an example. He then kept demanding to know why I was even bringing it up, wanted to know did I not care how hard his job was without me saying all these things, how paranoid I was being, and how unfair it was on him. 

I was having serious anxiety by the end of the meeting, so I decided to hand in my notice. I have an internship starting at the end of January, so I had planned on leaving next month, but it was becoming to difficult to work with him. It's a real pity, as I loved my job and I felt as though I was doing very well. I frequently came top of the company for sales, and my customer service record was good too. I made a lot of friends there, and I'm sad to go, but I just can't work under a man who is the same as my mother. 

PS Having talked to other staff about this, I'm not alone. Several are planning on leaving in the new year, many are filing bullying complaints."
1sjamp,13,2013-12-10,Am I asking for too much money as a young web developer?,webdevthrow,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1sjamp/am_i_asking_for_too_much_money_as_a_young_web/,"I'm 17 and currently have a job as a Front End Web Developer for a software company. Here's the facts about my position:


* I wasn't hired as an intern.
* The CEO reached out to me in an email with the subject ""Front-End Developer"", after that my title was never discussed. 
* I was hired at the beginning of last summer but in a few days I'll have been working for them for six months.
* I replaced an adult who had this job.
* I am a full employee with benefits, 401(k), all the amenities my 30+ age coworkers have, etc
* During the summer I worked full time (12ish hours a day) in the office but I now work from home on a computer they've provided me
* Two or three times during the summer (some time after I was hired without mention of internship) I was introduced as ""the summer intern"" or ""intern"", which was off-putting and worrying because I did not think that was my title.
* Before this job I had 2-3 years work experience, mostly in web development, some in android development. I came into the job with ample experience, there was never a big learning curve or a feeling of being in over my head.

Despite all this my hourly pay is $15, or roughly $31k. 

Indeed.com says the average salary in my city for a Front-End Web Developer is $85k or about $44. I understand that being 17 and without lots of experience means lower pay, but I feel like $15 is still too low. I've done contract work for $35 which the client was very pleased with.

The company isn't exactly strapped for cash either. The whole office is Macs, the CEO has a house worth between $5M-$10M, we use $500 a pop stock images, etc.

I have a feeling part of my low pay is how I slipped up in the interview and told the CEO that my parents would match anything I save for college which means he doesn't need to pay me as much (he even made a joke to someone else in front of me about how he did this). The problem is that I no longer plan to go to college (he doesn't know this).

When he told me my hourly pay he wrote it as ""I would like to start your pay at $15.00"" which I feel like implies the opportunity for it to go up later.

Would I be asking for too much by requesting a raise to $30/hour?

I did a quick Google search and looked at a bunch of StackOverflow posts, but everyone is suggesting books... since I'm not much of a reader and more of a dive-right-into-it kinda guy (and I also don't want to be stuck flipping through useless chapters of 'programming basics'), I was wondering if anyone knows of a really good free online guide for transitioning from C to C++? Thanks guys!"
1sja2f,10,2013-12-10,Graduated and unemployed...,yhsf,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1sja2f/graduated_and_unemployed/,"I just wanted to get pen on paper. I know that reading this, it's not exactly the most sympathetic position, but it's consuming me.

I graduated from the top program in my field at a top-10 US university in May. Within this field, most people have jobs lined up months ahead of graduation. I have a good GPA, internship experience, and I was involved in extracurriculars. As an international student, the visa always came up in interviews, and I can otherwise pinpoint where things might have gone wrong. Either way, as we entered November, and then December last year (as all recruiting slows down) I became really depressed and VERY stressed. Sleepless nights, just barely being able to stay awake for classes and then crashing afterwards. Drinking a lot. I talked to CAPS on campus for a while but found that to be not very helpful. 

Surprisingly, a mushroom trip really helped me with depression and I found myself really positive towards the end of the school year. I was in interesting classes, excitement about graduation, etc. I applied for my post-grad visa and stayed in the city while interviewing for jobs in the summer and had some final rounds...but no dice.

Months are dragging on at this point. Visa expired. I moved back home for a bit, but I'm from the middle of nowhere Canada and it was really hard to keep traction going when you're hundreds of miles from the jobs you're looking at. I'm blessed to have the financial support and emotional encouragement of my parents, and moved to the big city last month to continue the search and have boots on the ground to network and meet people.

I swear, if I hear ""You have a good background and you seem like a good kid, I'm sure it'll work out. Just stay positive!"" I might just burst into tears. There is no other option, but I feel dead inside. I booked a flight home for Christmas, and then I'm coming back here afterwards, with all this uncertainty and more financial drain. I feel like a leech. I feel guilty spending time doing anything *but* job searching, but realistically you can only do that so many hours a day. I don't sleep, and then I question whether I'll even be happy once I AM employed, because depression has always been a lingering feeling even going back to middle school.

I know that comparing myself to others is a recipe for failure, but I go on LinkedIn or look at our career reports and I'm astounded by who ended up where, or that LITERALLY almost everyone is full-time employed. Where did it all go so wrong? Everyone is telling me I'm doing the right things at this point, but I feel like a failure. Two of my good friends were still on the hunt and both landed things within the last few weeks in cities where friends are wont to go. I'm happy for them, but I know that their searches haven't been extending for a year+. I dread going to sleep because it means having to face the next day. I'm not suicidal by any means, but I can't help but imagine how nice it would be to fall asleep and not wake up in the morning. I feel isolated and alone, with no real prospects in sight. I've only had two pseudo-interviews in the last three months...my self-esteem is shattered and I put on a fake smile every day and meet someone for coffee and we talk about why I'm interested in their industry and if they have any leads and then I send a thank you email and fill out a bunch of online applications and blah blah blah.

I don't even know if there are concrete suggestions here. I just feel totally helpless.

However, I simply cannot find something that's actually good. My requirement is that it allows me to use my custom domain, and I have no problem paying a couple of bucks a month.

I've tried Blogger and WordPress. Blogger was kind of nice with everything except presenting my content. It's stuck in 2003, template-design-wise.

WordPress was much better at actually managing my content (ranges from articles to images to documents), and presenting it. Also tonnes of plugins. However I managed to mess up several things about the installation, and the server required maintenance every now and then so that proved to be a too high a price to pay in the end. I'm aware of shared hosting WP hosts, but the idea is kind of unattractive to me... I also think WP.com is an absolute robbery.

So are there any blogging services that might interest me?

Things I'm looking for:

1. Ease of management
2. Optimised for different types of content, including CODE (another feature lacking with Blogger)
3. Preferably can upload my files
4. Looks good without requiring three Bibles of JavaScript (Blogger)

I've had my first year in a real office position. In that year I've been promoted from intern, to Marketing Analyst, to Project Manager. With each move I expected something more satisfying but only discovered how depressing and unrewarding my career path has been; I want to correct my direction ASAP. The reality is that I'm over worked, under paid, and don't like what I'm doing. 

*What works*


In the past I've been a political campaign manager, landscaper, and security guard. I like being outdoors, interacting with people, and also helping in some way. I want a job where I'm doing something I'm passionate about(helping people/environment), and that also keeps me moving physically. I'm a hands on person and like to be able to do things rather than plan and coordinate. 

*Things I'm considering*


I'm having a hard time finding a job that would utilize my abilities, experience, and education. I've considered a construction management, but was off-put by much of the planning. I've thought about being a Park Ranger or going into Law enforcement but am uncertain about committing to something I might not end up liking. 


I'm really interested in others input, but it also certainly helps just to get this out there. Thanks. "

[Greetings Dr. Lauretta, i have a few questions, how is 5819 doing and are there plans to probe it too?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxw1gq?context=5)|Asteroid 5819 Lauretta is continuing on its orbital trajectory through the Solar System. My astronomer friends snap a photo for me every once in awhile but there is no plan for a dedicated science campaign.
[How did the idea of a sample return mission from an asteroid came about? What is the inspiration behind it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxw1gq?context=5)|The OSIRIS-REx concept originated with Lockheed-Martin, who is always looking for new Principal Investigators for their planetary science missions. They approached Mike Drake, the original PI, in 2004 about collaborating on a sample-return mission. Mike invited me to be his Deputy at that time - which I gladly accepted. Mike and I worked on the mission concept for seven years before being accepted by NASA. Mike passed away in September 2011 - four months after winning the contract. I was promoted to PI at that time.
[Can we not go faster in going to Bennu? Like less than year. What technogy is need to speed up voyage to asteroid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxw1gq?context=5)|We can go faster to get to Bennu. However, we need to not only get to Bennu - but also go in the same direction at the same speed. Thus, if we get there more quickly, we need giant rocket engines and a lot of fuel to slow down for the rendezvous.
[What is the story behind the name Osiris Rex and its Egyptian theme?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxw1gq?context=5)|I came up with the name based on the mythology of Osiris as the bringer of life to the Nile Valley - Bennu represents the type of object that may have brought the seeds of life to Earth. It is also a crazy acronym - which fits in with the way NASA names their missions,
[What will happen to Osiris Rex after it return, will it remain in orbit or crash or an extension mission will be planned?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxw1gq?context=5)|OSIRIS-REx will eject the sample return capsule four hours before the spacecraft hits the top of the atmosphere at 27,000 mph. The spacecraft will then perform a deflection burn and be placed into a stable heliocentric orbit that will not intersect any object of astrobiological interest (planetary protection requirement). It may be available for an extended mission at the discretion of NASA.
[Will you be able to study fragments of the Chelyabinsk meteorite? Why was it not detected earlier? Thanks in advance. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxw1gq?context=5)|We have fragments of Chelyabinsk in our lab at the University of Arizona and are actively studying it. It snuck up on us because it came out of the Sun and it was a relatively small object - we are mandated by Congress to detect objects 140-m in diameter and larger - the Chelyabinsk bolide was ~20-m across.
[Awesome work! I'm wondering, how and why was Bennu selected for this mission? Do we know if we will be able to even retrieve a sample from it? (ie: do we know the composition of the surface? Are there enough small rocks on it to collect?\) Also, as a current U of A undergraduate (Aerospace Engineering\), what's the best way for a student to become involved in this kind of work/field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxwys9?context=5)|Target selection for OSIRIS-REx was originally driven by engineering constraints. First, we decided to use a Lockheed-Martin heritage spacecraft. That meant using solar power and trying to keep the thermal control system relatively simple. Using solar power limited how far out into the Solar System we could travel - setting a limit of 1.8 AU on the aphelion of the target's orbit. The thermal control limit constrained how close to the Sun we could go - limiting the perihelion of the orbit. Together these two constraints defined the semi-major axis and eccentricity of potential targets.
 |The next constraint was the total energy of the mission. We needed a target with relatively low delta-V (total change in velocity). We also needed a trajectory that limited the re-entry velocity of the Sample Return Capsule - since we are using a heritage design from the Stardust mission. These parameters limited the inclination of the asteroid orbit to less than 10 degrees.
 |These orbital constraints rapidly collapsed the number of potential targets to around 200 asteroids. The next constraint was on the size of the object. It turns out that asteroids smaller than ~200 meters tend to be rapid rotators - some spinning once every minute or so. We used absolute magnitude as a proxy for size - dropping the number of potential targets to about 20.
 |The final criterion was driven by science. We wanted a target that was likely to be rich in carbon and water - a carbonaceous asteroid. Of the twenty or so targets that met our dynamical constraints - only five were known to have low albedo and therefore likely to be carbonaceous. Bennu rose to the top of the list based on the extensive ground-based data set - particularly the fantastic shape model information that had been obtained from the Arecibo and Goldstone Planetary Radar telescopes.
 |There are three lines of evidence that constrain the average grain size on Bennu. First, in addition to the shape model, the radar astronomy also provided information on the radar polarization ratio. Basically, we transmit a beam with a specific circular polarization and measure how much of the returned energy comes back with the opposite polarization. These data show that the transition to radar roughness occurs at a scale smaller than lowest radar wavelength - 3 cm.
 |Next, we used the Spitzer space telescope to determine the average thermal inertia of the surface. Lower thermal inertia values mean smaller grain sizes. These data suggest that the average grain size on Bennu is on the order of a millimeter.
 |Finally, the asteroid shape reveals a prominent ridge at the equator - suggesting that there is loose material moving around on the surface and collecting at the geopotential lows (the valleys of Bennu) - which lie at the equator.

[What's the biggest challenge in designing the reentry capsule? Also could I get an internet high five?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxwhoz?context=5)|The good news is that we are reusing the capsule design from the NASA Stardust mission. The only modification that is required is on the main deck to accommodate our sample collection device, which is different from Stardust. This is a minor modification - the SRC is one of the easy parts!
[How do you hope to tie in your investigations at Bennu to those of Dawn at Ceres? If so, what are your plans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxw8ju?context=5)|Ceres is a C-type asteroid - so slightly different spectroscopically from Bennu. However, we will have data that is comparable to the Dawn VIR instrument, so that will be an interesting study. We are more spectrally similar to Pallas - which is a B-type asteroid like Bennu. We have no plans to perform the comparative study - sounds like a great opportunity for a participating scientist!
[Did your mission engineers take any cues from the Hayabusa probe? What steps are they planning to take to avoid computer glitches during the sample collection phase?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxw8ju?context=5)|We have studied the Hayabusa mission intently. Our main take away messages are to 1) allow enough time for the team to thoroughly characterize Bennu before sampling; 2) simulate the descent to the asteroid surface thousands of times before committing to the sampling; 3) perform a series of rehearsals for each stage of the sampling sequence - plan on repeating each step if one does not go according to pan; and 4) fly capable reaction wheels - this failure doomed Hayabusa from the start.
[Does the potential for an asteroid collision worry you on an emotional level?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxvvz9?context=5)|I do not worry about getting hit by an asteroid on a daily basis. It is much more dangerous to cross the street - which I do worry about.
[Also, what's your favorite Christmas song?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxvvz9?context=5)|My favorite Christmas is Happy X-mas (War is Over) by John Lennon.
[What is the 2013-2023 total budget? What part of the budget is already secure?  And where does the money come from? Thanks for doing this!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxvz9w?context=5)|The total mission budget (2011 - 2025 - including two years to analyze the sample after Earth Return) is $1.05 billion.
 |Because of the way that the Federal Government operates - the budget is secure through January 15, 2014 - when the current continuing resolution expires. However, we are a high priority for NASA planetary science and have strong support in Congress so we are confident that our funding will continue to be authorized.
 |The money ultimately comes from the American and Canadian tax payers - thank you!
[But how much money is the actual operating budget?  Doesn't the University of Arizona take out a huge chunk?  Also, how do you allocate money to the different instrument teams because your group is working with other institutions. Do their budgets come out of your budget?  Thanks, from a future P.I.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxwvpl?context=5)|The UA charges an indirect cost (IDC) rate of 51.5%. That means that for every dollar of direct cost that I spend at UA - I have to pay an additional 51.5 cents in IDC. These funds cover the cost of the facility, support services like maintenance, and the overall cost of running the University.
 |Most of our money (something like 80%) goes into our labor expenses (which includes benefits and IDC). OSIRIS-REx is all about the people.
 |Every organization has an overhead expense, you can't get away from paying this cost. For-profit companies also include award fee as part of their price tag.
[On a lot of agencies SBIRs we're limited to 40% IDC. The UA got a good deal.  Also the first time I've seen the finer points of federal contracting discussed on here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxzpnh?context=5)|One of the most unexpected results of becoming PI for me - I have to know everything about the federal budget process and cost management. Ask away!
[Hello Dr. Lauretta, I realize that there are many components to this project, but this question is in regards to the possible presence of the building blocks of life. I have read a few papers discussing the resistance of certain microbes to our most robust antimicrobial techniques (ex. UV light, saline solutions\).  How would microbiologists recognize pristine extraterrestrial proteins or nucleic acids?  How will you keep your clean room clean?  --Thank you!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxx7nn?context=5)|OSIRIS-REx has a level-1 requirement to return a ""pristine"" sample of Bennu. We have a pragmatic definition of pristine - which means that no foreign material introduced into the sample will hamper the scientific investigation.
 |We split our contamination efforts into two categories - Contamination Control and Contamination Knowledge. Contamination Control seeks to minimize the contamination of the sample using prudent and established spacecraft fabrication processes. Contamination Knowledge seeks to document any contamination that may be introduced to the sample. Together we can both keep the sample clean and document any foreign material that is present in the returned sample.
 |The spacecraft fabrication clean room is a standard Class 10,000 room. The curation facility will be much cleaner - Class 100.
[What is the plan for extracting the sample from the asteriod?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxwugp?context=5)|We are using a device called the Touch-and-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism ([TAGSAM](http://osiris-rex.lpl.arizona.edu/?q=spacecraftpayload/tagsam)). The basic concept is to contact the asteroid surface with a large air filter (something that would look right at home sitting on top of a carburetor from a '57 Chevy), then blast the surface with a pulse of high-purity nitrogen gas. The gas agitates and fluidizes the regolith, which expands into the TAGSAM device. If we fill the collection chamber - we have ~2 kilograms of material. TAGSAM can collect particles up to 3-cm across. We also have contact pads on the outer edge of TAGSAM. We will collect particles less than 1 millimeter as long as we touch the surface.  
[I read every comment and all of your replies.  This is so interesting, thank you.  I am not an expert, nor a student in this field, but a housewife married to a science fiction fanatic and we have 3 amateur astronomers.  My questions focus on when you are at your described third moment terror (which is my biggest moment of terror for you\)...the moment of TAG, when you send the spacecraft down to the surface of Bennu to collect the sample. What type of suction or attachment, if any, will you be using on the space craft to attach the landing?  Is the landing similar to a plane landing on an air craft carrier? Do you have a plan B in case it sticks too much to the asteroid?  A fun question if you prefer not to discuss my other questions:  What is the most common household item you will be using on this mission?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdy5z4t?context=5)|We do not have any system to anchor the spacecraft to the asteroid during sample acquisition. Instead, we have very tight control on the spacecraft state during the descent. We have to contact with an approach velocity of 10 cm/s (+/-2) and a lateral velocity of 0 cm/s (+/-2). The spacecraft can not be rotating about any of its axes. If we hit the surface under these conditions then our momentum will be absorbed by a constant-force spring in the robotic arm. If we start to rotate, the attitude control thrusters will engage to damp out any angular momentum. After five seconds of contact we fire our back-away thrusters and get out of dodge.
 |These back-away thrusters should be sufficient to unstick us from the surface. In the case where we are totally jammed our only option is to sever the sample head from the arm - but that would mean loss of the sample.
 |As for the most common household item - the spacecraft has a surprisingly large amount of tape on it! Though, of course, the tape is space qualified.
[Hey Dr. Lauretta! Super excited for this. Where is OSIRIS-REx launching from, where will it return, and what parts will be discarded in between? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxwaqw?context=5)|OSIRIS-REx is launching from the Kennedy Space Center on an Atlas V 411 launch vehicle in 2016. The sample return capsule (SRC) returns to the Utah Test and Training Range in 2023. The SRC will remain intact through atmospheric entry with the exception of a small amount of the heat shield - which will ablate in the atmosphere. The main spacecraft will remain in space and likely be available for an extended mission. The SRC ultimately ends up in the NASA Space-Exposed Hardware facility - or maybe in the Smithsonian like the Stardust capsule!
[How did you transition from working on chondrite meteorites to the bigger-picture project of being the principal investigator on OSIRIS-REx? -Arecibo radar minion.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxwhe9?context=5)|When Mike Drake, the original PI for OSIRIS-REx, starting put his team together in 2004, he invited me to be his deputy because of my knowledge of carbonaceous chondrites and the connection to the origin of life. In the seven years of proposal writing between 2004 and selection in 2011 I learned all about spacecraft engineering, mission management, and cost, and schedule control.
[I heard something about how this mission could help us understand how moons are formed.  Can you expand on that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxz1zt?context=5)|OSIRIS-REx will help us understand how asteroid satellites are formed. A leading theory for binary asteroid formation involves the [YORP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarkovsky%E2%80%93O%27Keefe%E2%80%93Radzievskii%E2%80%93Paddack_effect) effect. Basically, YORP acts to either increase or decrease the rotation rate of an asteroid. As an asteroid's spin rate increases - material will start to migrate from the poles down to the equator. This mechanism may be responsible for the observed equatorial ridge on Bennu. If the spin rate continues to increase - the material may be spun off the equator and accrete into a binary companion.
[What is your plan after the O-Rex mission is finished?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxz1zt?context=5)|This work was pioneered by [Kevin Walsh](https://www-n.oca.eu/kwalsh/Research.html), a member of my science team.

[Thanks for doing an AMA. Do you think OSIRIS-REx is the most complex backronym currently operating at Nasa? :-\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxx5xg?context=5)|OSIRIS-REx is both an acronym and backronym. I came up with OSIRIS when we first starting proposing this mission concept to the NASA Discovery program. I was the Deputy PI and my job was to write the science justification for the mission. I started doodling with the key science concepts and wrote down Origins, Spectroscopy, Resources, and Security. OSIRIS jumped right out at me! I then added some vowels to fill out the word.
 |We added the REx when we made the transition from Discovery to New Frontiers. Our previous proposal efforts had scored well - but we did not fit in the cost box. We wanted to keep the OSIRIS brand name but indicate that we were bigger and better than a Discovery mission. The name OSIRIS-REx was tossed out early on - sort of in jest - but the name had a nice ring to it. I came up with Regolith Explorer to back into the name.
[I am a bit ashamed that this is the first time that I hear about this project...

 |The idea of returning precious metals to the surface of the Earth is more problematic. We still produce sufficient quantities of platinum, gold, and other rare metals to cover our needs.

1sipx4,4,2013-12-09,IT intern looking for advice from professionals.,it_intern1,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1sipx4/it_intern_looking_for_advice_from_professionals/,"I'm a business continuity intern for a Fortune 500 outsourcing company. I was brought on after relentless (not sure if that's the right word) looking, emailing, and calling for an internship with this company. Not sure how I ended up in business continuity / disaster recovery, but there it is. I'm always eager to learn new things.

My supervisors have been very open-minded and generous with me (I'm their first intern), however, I don't feel like my heart is in business continuity. They've really tried to get me involved with clients, especially since I have a TS/SCI since it opens up more doors within business continuity. I really enjoy more technical things, such as scripting, administration, etc and I feel like business continuity isn't a great fit for me. I've also interned for a federal agency for IT security, which was great. I got to do some computer and network forensics and I *loved* it. 

I got to tour one of this company's data centers a few days ago and got the chance to browse through their SOC. I was actually pretty excited and super interested. I know the shifts suck (1 AM - 1 PM), but I'm willing to do that because I feel like that's where my career interests lie. 

I feel horrible because my supervisors have been so generous with me and now I want to jump ship into another business unit. If I were to stick with project management / business continuity, I feel like my ""chance"" to get experience in the more technical nature of IT will be lost. I feel like there's this ""fork"" in the road and I need to choose which path to go down. 

They're fast-tracking me into working in project management (which would require me to relocate to D.C. metro for TS/SCI-required clients). On the other hand of all this, I think I should be grateful for them getting me on board before I've even graduated (May). Then again, I have reservations about moving to D.C., because I really don't want to spend big bucks on cost of living. 

TL; DR: Company is fast-tracking me into project management, I feel bad because I want to jump ship into their SOC. Supervisors have been great in PM, so I feel seriously conflicted. 

I would greatly appreciate some career advice. "
1sinwb,976,2013-12-09,Tales from IT: A fatlogic legal meeting!,ohgodwhydoineedthis,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1sinwb/tales_from_it_a_fatlogic_legal_meeting/,"**Oh darlings, look who is back!** And after those terrible tales I brought forth to you previously, I hope you're ready to the hopeful conclusion of this clusterfuck my company has been dealing with. Also, I got married, so that's a plus! 

*Partial truth is that I've known about this for a while, but haven't been allowed to post anything about it until now. Also, I've been drunk off my tits for most of the time, enjoying a honeymoon and many Australian holiday activities, like kangaroo hunting and running the fuck away from snakes.*

For those of you *oh so healthy* people whose knees are too weak to allow them to read through my previous sagas, the last I saw of Lard Lover (our dear, dear fatlogic spewer), she was slumped in the alley way behind my building, passing in and out of consciousness, after assaulting a bouncer, security, and shouting many threats against many people, including myself, resulting in me calling an ambulance for her. Lard Lover is a lovely specimen of a human being that really bolstered my faith in humanity after claiming false sexual harassment on one of my interns, abusing co-workers, not actually working at all, emotionally manipulating a person to the point where he was the only reason she had a job, and running an 8+ year long rouse to keep a good yearly income without actually *doing anything*. She is the pinnacle of fatlogic and laziness, and the reason I at least try and exercise.

&gt;Get into work off the bus

&gt;Slowly heading into summer

&gt;Already getting 30 degree days

&gt;So much for a nice clean shirt in the morning after a simple walk

Another long and arduous day ahead of me, I sit down and begin reading through my emails, sorting out my plan for the week. 

&gt;Dept. Head knocks gently

&gt;""Hey, I figure you would like to know a bit about Lard Lover, and how that is all going. Mind if I come in?

&gt;""Not at all, not at all""

&gt;""Well, I'm saying this now, because you may need to be called in as a witness, depending on how these initial proceedings go. As Lard Lover has not covered her bills for the damage she did in her office, the company gave the issue over to creditors, and now because she still can't pay, it's all going to court""

&gt;""Yes, I figured as much. But she doesn't have anything against us, so why am I needed?""

&gt;""Well, she is trying to get out of the debts she owes by claiming all sorts of things, one of them being that you fostered a hostile working environment against her, and caused her relationship with Mr DesperateRomantic to fail""

&gt;""Oh for fucks sa-""

&gt;""And that's not all. Shes been trying to constantly claim that the claim she made against ShyIntern is real, and she was sexually assaulted, at your orders""

At this point, I had a mild internal panic attack. It's hard to argue against false sexual assault allegations as it is, but if she is claiming all sorts of bullying, she may get through with it.

&gt;""And this is all... like, ALL to get out of her debt?""

&gt;""Yes""

&gt;""How much does she owe the company for the office?""

&gt;""They rounded the damages to about $3000, including the computer, but that is rather weak considering they had to replace the carpet and some of the dry wall""

&gt;""And how much to other debtors?""

&gt;""Well, no one here 'knows', but its looking like it could be heading into the half a million mark, so there is no hope of us getting our money any time soon""

I begin to calm down a little. No one just gets out of a half a million dollar debt over a bullying claim. But there is still a little fat logic to have here, my dears...

&gt;""At least the company can write that off for now. When is this all going to court?""

&gt;""It depends if we can get it sorted out with our lawyers before a court date is even thought of. We definitely don't want to pay her out, but shit... to be dragged through the courts over $3000 when we won't get anything out of it does make it a shitty position""

As we were talking, a super secret lawyer meeting was taking place, regarding the position of Lard Lover. And where did she try and have this meeting? In our building. Did she get her away? You fucking bettcha. How did the lawyers throw her case out and back to the creditors? Well...

*Scene: A penthouse meeting room with close to 360 degree views of the city is occupied by 4 people, sitting down the far end of a fancy table suited for 35, but already looks like it is carrying more than it's capacity by seating one of the occupants...*

*All dialogue has been ad-libbed by myself, after talking to the two lawyers there over a pint, gathering information from them. There were two of our companies lawyers, Lard Lover and her REAL lawyer there*

&gt;""Look, Lard Lover here has clearly had a horrific time at your company, causing her to lose her job due to completely undue bullying, resulting in financial hardship. It's clear that your toxic workplace is the main cause for her current financial state""

&gt;""And we keep saying, it isn't our problem. Lard Lover has used her brother previously to threaten us with many legal suits over the time, resulting in his current investigation by the government, and she has had no evidence to back her claims. We took each claim she made seriously, up until her conduct resulted in her termination, which honestly should have been sooner, if it had not been for Mr DesperateRomantic""

&gt;""You do know that bullying in the workplace is a serious issue... and these many false accusations against her are just preposterous! ""Sex in the bathrooms"", ""Theft of coffee""... How can I believe even one of these when there are so many incredulous ones! I mean, there is no way she could have caused such damage to her office... it seems a lot of these claims are hyped up!""

The lawyers at that point were internally thinking about court dates, as this guy just would not let up. Lard Lover had clearly spun some tight story in which she was not at fault at all, and the lawyer probably just saw the commission he would make on half a million in damages and went for it. She sat there, hair still greasier than a mechanics rag, her smile, smugly painted on her now pimply face, reaking of a mixture of that teenage aresole spray you can buy in a grocery store for $2, corked wine and off cheese. 

&gt;""Look, if you can't take our witnesses and creditors seriously, we're going to have to see you in cou...""

At that very moment, Lard Lover had taken it upon herself to lift up a large tote she had brought with her, in order to retrieve one of her many snacks from it. In the process of rummaging through her stash of sugar soaked goodies, she pulls out a large diet coke and a mars bar, causing the bag to become unbalanced, spilling it's contents onto the table.

What caused the lawyer of Lard Lover to forget about the court date, and rush out of the meeting after glaring at his client? What caused the two lawyers for my company to laugh out loud during this kerfuffle? 

Out from her bag, rolled several company marked pens, pads of paper, biscuit packets (we started labeling with our department names, she had managed to snaffle these ones from sales), and a coffee jar. She had stolen them while her lawyer was on the phone, and she claimed she had gone 'to the toilet'. 

*But it wasn't the stolen goods that caused her lawyer to walk out...*

It was when she began this tirade against the company lawyers...

&gt;""Hey, you have NO right to see what is in MY bag! Turn around RIGHT NOW, so I can have some PRIVACY. All you people want is to JUDGE ME while you provide NO ADEQUATE FOOD for your *GUESTS*.""

She began furiously putting the stolen items *back in her bag*, while yelling at the lawyer to help her gather the stuff up! Her lawyer, looking more and more flustered at each sentence she vomited from her unwashed mouth, tried to then reason with the company lawyers.

&gt;""My client wishes to apologise fo-""

&gt;""APOLOGISE FOR WHAT?! These things are for ANYONE who finds them, AND because they don't even provide BASIC sandwiches for *GUESTS*, I DESERVE to have these things to keep my blood sugar up!""

&gt;""I think my client and I need to consult eac-""

&gt;""NO. We can sort it out RIGHT HERE. These ""LAWYERS"" (she actually made inverted comma marks with her fingers) for this stupid company don't have SHIT on me. We can get what we want NOW.""

She spoke directly to her lawyer, while the other two just sat on the other side and watched, taking notes on everything she said. One even took out his phone to sneekily take a photo of the stuff she spilt onto the table. She acted like the other two just would politely not listen to their 'private' conversation, or look at the items she stole.

&gt;""I've been reading up on fat DISCRIMINATION, and I KNOW that you so called lawyers will do ANYTHING to make sure the public won't know about you hating basically half the population. SO I SUGGEST that you begin talking to accounts and writing me a cheque...""

It was at this point the company lawyers could not take it anymore. Her lawyer was packing everything up and trying to usher her out of the room, and the other two were in absolute hysterics. Before they made it to the lift, one of them rightly decided to call security to call the police for a theft within the building.

The lawyer was allowed to go, but Lard Lover was taken into custody, and charged with theft. Not sure of that outcome, but I hope it's a good one. 

So that is the last I know of the saga. Her brother is still being investigated for his impersonation of a lawyer, Mr DesperateRomantic managed to get another job somehow, and LardLover, before being carted off by the police, was trying to rally up sympathy with womens rights groups, and people like HAES advocates to try and support her cause... and not even they wanted to touch her issue.

1simlr,5,2013-12-09,Hi /r/Diabetes I would like some advice on something(story inside),Souyef,diabetes,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1simlr/hi_rdiabetes_i_would_like_some_advice_on/,"So I just dealt with a hypo I got and im fine and all but it made me realize some stuff and I think im becoming really burned out.

Some back-story first. 3 months ago in October I got diagnosed with Diabetes T1 at the age of 20, at that time I didn't think too much of it and just accepted the fact I had to live with it. Two weeks after that I was told I wouldn't be able to follow the course of the school I was at. I was following the Maritime Officer course and it was a dream of mine to travel the world preferably by ship and check out all these new places, but working in the Maritime world is not possible for T1's and in the 3rd year of the course you have to get a internship on sea for about 5 months(which is cool), but as I said earlier its impossible to work at sea with T1. 

So now im a dropout and for about a month I just sat on my ass playing games and getting used to this whole new diabetes thing, I cut out all candy, soda, fast food and pretty much all the delicious treats one might like for I just feel its easier like that. And since then stuff has been looking positive but not better. I got a part time job I enjoy but I can't seem to find direction in my life.

And then it hit me tonight, the repetitiveness of injecting myself, counting carbs, checking my blood sugar and all that its slowly eating at me, I know see that from here on out its just gonna get harder and harder and eventually my pancreatis is gonna stop helping me and im gonna have to try harder and honestly I just cant see myself getting used to it. Im sad that diabetes took away most of my future and I just don't know what to do, I keep telling myself and others im gonna be fine.... but will I. 

I can't get too see myself doing anything I will enjoy in the future because of diabetes so my question to you guys is: How did you get to life with your diabetes eventually after it restrict you from so many things. 

tl;dr^^

And sorry for my english its not my first language, im off to sleep now so have a nice day everyone!

Yes, but losing a job in these last few months and not getting any support from her, who was my only contact in the area just drove the wedge between us further in. She began to go back to her old party friends and started to drink with them every weekend to escape a lot of times leaving me by myself in this town we had moved into together. She ended up having sex with someone.  This was last friday. Now i have a lot of things to ponder on my mind and i think a large part of me just wants to resolve the hurt. I do love her and i do want a life with her but many of our problems were just us living a life for ourselves not for each other. Coexisting in living quarters and not actively perusing happiness. What's to say were not going to fall right back into that, except with this added level of distrust. Whats to say that if i ever get into another relationship i wont be as equally unloving and selfish? I'm not sure but i sure miss her. our puppy does too. Thats my story give me something good, i could use it."
1si5yn,1,2013-12-09,Making My Masters Count,Grogie,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1si5yn/making_my_masters_count/,"Hello /r/AskAcademia.  I am a 23 year old with an Undergrad in Engineering (B.Eng) and like most people my age I struggled finding a job right out of University.  However, my luck changed when I was offered and accepted (Fully Funded) a Masters of Computer Science and Operations Research (Thesis based).  I am pretty excited for this opportunity and want to make it ""count"" as much as possible.  I was inspired to ask this after listening to the [AoM Podcast with Dr. Jay](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/10/12/art-of-manliness-podcast-episode-51-the-defining-decade-with-dr-meg-jay/) and [the relevant TED Talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/meg_jay_why_30_is_not_the_new_20.html).  

I definitely became a better student over my undergrad (going from a C student my first year to a mostly A student - with a B here and there - my last 4 trimesters).  I feel like I have become a good student and will do well academically.  I had a few internships and was able to learn a lot from them as well.  However, part of the talk focused around ""Identity Capital"", which I didn't fully understand but I believe it has to do with goals.  
I'm not 100% sure of my long term professional goals.  I have talked to another Professor of mine about his career as well.  I feel like I could relate to his story because he ""sort of stumbled"" into an academic career (i.e. it wasn't his goal to be a Professor when he started University).  As a result of our conversation, I have a plan sort of hammered out:

* During the academic year, focus professionally on school.  Funding and savings can cover living expenses
* Obtain relevant summer internships to expand (or maintain) my network and to make some coin for the winter months.

However, I am not 100% sure if I want, desire, or can be successful as Professional Academic (Professor, Researcher, et al.) or if trying to head off to industry in 2 years is the better option.
For me, I believe I have a short term goal, but as my long term professional goals I am not really sure what I want at the moment.  I think part of me that worries about making another long term goal is that where I am now is nowhere near the goal I had set out back when I was 19 or 20 (Which was being an EIT at Rio Tinto).  

So /r/AskAcademia: those of you who ""stumbled"" into the academic world:  

* What advice would you give to someone who is just starting out with his Masters and to make it ""count"" as much as possible?  
* For those who could relate to my story (i.e. hard time finding a job but when back to school right away) how did you make it count?  
* How about those that who can relate and went back to industry after the masters, what can I do to still make my self relevant? 

Thanks in advance!

1snma4,1,2013-12-11,My History with My ACL,albondigassalvajes,ACL,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACL/comments/1snma4/my_history_with_my_acl/,"Here it goes...

I tore my right ACL in December of 2009. At the time I was working an internship and couldn't get anytime off to have the surgery.  After my internship I moved three time cross country in two years so surgery wasn't an option then either. 

My knee had gotten so bad that I tore my mcl and my meniscus as well. I also got to the point where I couldn't work out, play sports, dance, anything other than working or walking. 

I finally had ACL repair surgery this September. It cost me $5000 put of pocket even with my medical insurance. 

A few days ago was coming hope from work and slipped and heard a pop. Went to pt and they think I tore it again. I can't get into the doctors office till next week to get an MRI to see what damage as been done. 

I was wondering if anyone else has torn theirs to quickly after surgery. And what happened. Did you go straight back to surgery. Was it less invasive? 

I am freaking out because of how long I waiting to have the original surgery, how much it cost, the fact that it's December and my doctor is booked solid, and how bad a second ACL surgery is.   "
1snlwp,2,2013-12-11,[nodejs] Request for help with parsing XML to CSV,azngoHAPPY,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1snlwp/nodejs_request_for_help_with_parsing_xml_to_csv/,"Hi everyone, I'm currently trying to learn how to parse the NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD) XML feed to CSV with node.js. I've never worked with XML files before, nor do I know how to parse them--but this is one of the first projects I wanted to do in order to get a better grasp of node.js. The reason why is because this is one of the problems I faced in an internship over the summer and had to request a developer to help me out. He ended up parsing the XML for me since we were on a time crunch. This time around, I'd really like to be able to do this myself.

My programming background includes two Intro to Java courses (one with my CS department and one with my MIS department since I switched majors), a course teaching Intro to Algorithms with Java, and a Systems Programming with C/C++ class--so I am very well acquainted with basic programming concepts and some intermediate concepts. 

So far, I've discovered this node module that allows me to parse XML to JSON (https://npmjs.org/package/xml2js) 

and another module which allows me to parse JSON to CSV 
(https://npmjs.org/package/jsoncsv)

Unfortunately, I'm not really able to understand how to use them due to my limited knowledge of node.js. 

I've also found this small tutorial 

http://sebi2k1.wordpress.com/2012/01/15/parsing-xml-files-with-nodejs/

but it also doesn't really have enough details for me to understand everything.

**TL;DR**: What would you suggest are the resources I need to look at in order to undertake this project and complete it over my winter break? "

I've got a car that's paid off(4k Nissan) which I pay gas and insurance for. I work a part time job with roughly 300$ every other week with little room to move up (grocery store).

I thought I wanted to be a veterinarian but I didn't make the grades to get accepted into vet school, so I left that major after two years to go to Computer Engineering. Why? Because at least there's JOBS in CE unrelated to having your hand up a cow's butt!

But I keep failing. I really enjoy CE but I'm a Super Senior and I still have three semester's worth of garbage to finish. Plus I'm going to flunk out again this semester.  The earliest I can graduate now is Fall 2015. I will be 27. I will have been in college for 8 years. 

In a month I will tell my boss at my internship I'm not attending school this semester and I will loose the only thing I have ever achieved - my amazing internship with an amazing group of people I sorely don't want to disappoint but it's too late now. I've failed. I have worked for them for a year and loved every second. I've been on awesome projects and been given responsibilities most interns just don't get.

Here I am failing again. Reddit, I am so depressed and tired and utterly gutted by college. I want to drop out and get a job. I just want to go and get a job as an engineer, even at half the pay because I don't think I can make it through another two years here.

 I know college is the right thing but after two years of telling my parents and everyone in my family more and more delayed graduation times I just can't do it anymore. I suck. College is not for me. I should never have come here."
1snb21,4,2013-12-11,"Trying to decide if it makes sense to get a Masters in something CS related-- if so, trying to decide between Stats &amp; CS.",jwdink,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1snb21/trying_to_decide_if_it_makes_sense_to_get_a/,"Hi Folks,

I asked a related question recently, but I didn't get a ton of response, and circumstances have changed slightly anyways.

I'm currently in a PhD program for cognitive psychology. Academia's tough, and it would be good to have some marketable non-academia skills, as a backup. Luckily, I'm pretty good at programming, get a good amount of practice with it, and really enjoy it. I also find Machine Learning, algorithms, and AI really interesting (which makes sense, given my interest in cognitive psychology).

So it'd be nice to have the option (if needed) of moving out of academia after I graduate, and into a career in industry, focusing on ML/AI. How can I best set myself up for this? 

Here seem to be my options:

* Focus on the PhD, try and make research more computational, try and work on CS-y personal projects and build up a portfolio of these sorts of things.
* Continue with the PhD, get a masters in stats meanwhile. This seemed like a good option at first. The stats department at my university offers a program for people who are getting a PhD in another department-- for me, just take 8 courses in their department, no thesis even. I have 8 quarters left, lines up nicely. I know that machine learning and stats are heavily related (though it's unclear to me whether AI and stats have much relation). HOWEVER, I missed out on the intro sequence for this year, and will have to wait until next year to take that. Courses that don't depend on this intro sequence are either stuff I'm super familiar with (linear regression) and/or stuff that has nothing to do with what I'm interested in (e.g., meta-analysis). In addition, the director for this program has been very difficult to pin down to talk to, making it difficult to discuss alternative options with him.
* Continue with the PhD, get a masters in CS meanwhile. I would love this-- the courses are explicitly on the topic of my interest (machine learning, AI), and I enjoy programming more than I enjoy math. However, this department doesn't explicitly have a program in place for people in other PhD programs (like the stats department does). Instead, I'd be taking the usual MS requirements, which are a bit heftier: 12 courses OR 9 courses + a thesis. This would be a lot to juggle with my PhD, might be difficult to get my advisor to approve of, etc.

So my questions are:

* **Would the stats degree really help get me into the areas I'm interested in?** I've heard it's relevant for ML, but for some reason I'm second-guessing that.
* **Will potential employers want to know that I've completed a thesis/ master's project anyways?** One of the downsides of the CS is that it's quite a bit more work-- but if this is the sort of thing that employers are going to be looking for anyways (as opposed to ""oh yeah I took 8 courses""), it may be worth it. Or can I be pretty vague with employers on how I got the MS? This is related to the concern that I'll be coming out of this program without any CS internships or the like-- just book learnin'.
* **Are either of these Masters actually helpful? Lately I've been hearing that most ML jobs require a PhD anyways.** Now, technically I will have a PhD-- it'll just be in cognitive psych. Does this help?

Bonus Question: Can someone describe what ""Statistical Computing"" is-- or rather, what a typical class on ""Statistical Computing"" is like? This is one of the classes I could potentially take this year. It seems like its more appropriate for my interests than e.g., ""meta-analysis,"" but I don't know if it'll assume lots of background/foundational knowledge that I'm missing out on by not taking the introductory series this year.

Sorry for the the length of this post. Any help would really be appreciated, I'm feeling pretty paralyzed. I think my heart says CS, but my head says stats."
1sn7yl,51,2013-12-11,My [22/f] Boyfriend [30/m] is constantly criticizing the things I do,dontcriticizemebro,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1sn7yl/my_22f_boyfriend_30m_is_constantly_criticizing/,"Hi r/relationships! I’m using a throwaway because my boyfriend does have a reddit account.


I’ve been dating him for a little over a year. We were friends before we met and just decided to get together one night. We met in a student group at our college (this will matter later). I did not know that he had feelings for me. At first, things were great. He seemed to be pretty accepting of the things that I do. We live together.

Lately, however, I’ve been feeling as though he’s constantly putting me down. He’s constantly making comments about the music that I listen to.  I usually drive places because he does not like to drive. Everything is “terrible” unless it’s one of his favorite bands. We get into “debates” (that turn into arguments) because he says things like “opera sucks” (even though he knows that I studied it for six years and have been itching to study it again). He’s certainly entitled to his opinion, but there’s a difference between having an opinion and constantly making snide remarks. I feel like I can’t even express my opinions because I know what is going to happen.

He does not want me to change my appearance at all. I’ve had a Monroe piercing for years, before we were even together. I got a nose piercing recently, after telling him about it for months, and he hates it, is constantly saying that it’s ugly and that it’s in the way. I get the feeling he hates everything in my face. 

I have curly hair and I was going to straighten it- that’s a “no”, too.

I want to wear contacts and take off my glasses- “No, don’t do that”

I know that I like to change my appearance often but 1. I was doing that before we were dating 2. The things I do really aren't that extreme. It’s not like I’m putting snakes in my hair and using their venom for lip gloss. The piercing thing, sure. But if he asked me to take them out or use a retainer then I would consider it.

I’m really starting to also think that he hates my friends. My friends are older than me (23-25). We used to hang out with them all the time in college, he went to every student group meeting with them, had no problem going to their parties… but now he doesn't want anything to do with them. He wants it to just be us two. We've all calmed down; most of us have full time jobs that don’t allow us to go ham. He doesn't even want to go to my events that I put on through my work. I was an intern with a company that I really wanted to work for and he never went to a single thing I invited him to. He finally went to the last event before my internship was over, but he told me he felt uncomfortable and hated it the entire time. He didn't stay for the whole thing.

I don’t feel like I’m getting any support whatsoever and it is extremely frustrating. I supported him entirely. He was underemployed for about six months after he graduated college (he just start a new job last week) and I supported him financially and emotionally. Even though I was working 7 days a week, I did a majority of the cleaning. I don’t care what he does with his appearance. I always make myself available if he needs it.

Last night, things got really nasty. We were going to play some pool and he starts making comments about the radio. I fire back. The whole night we’re just making comments back a forward. I try to keep my mouth shut and avoid talking back but after dealing with this for months I can’t keep it shut anymore.

We get home, and we start talking about dogs. I say that I want a French bulldog, but if I ever were to get another dog I would go to the pound and adopt whatever dog I fall in love with (all of the dogs I’ve ever owned came from the pound). He completely ignores the second half and starts tearing me a new asshole for wanting a purebred dog. And I understand that these dogs have issues and honestly I would never buy one. I just think French bulldogs are cute for fucks sake. I’m not calling a breeder.

I sit him down and I tell him everything that you just read (minus the friend part). He doesn't really apologize; he says “it’s the way he was raised” and that “his arguments should make me strengthen my opinions”. I tell him that I don’t want his opinions on everything. He says that it “isn't fair” and that I should basically just deal with it. The whole entire conversation I felt incredibly disrespected. He said that he would “try” to be less critical of me, but in the past he’s said he will “try” to do things that he never does. I am skeptical.

Now, r/relationships, I am unsure what I should do. I have the option of spending more time at home, so I was thinking of moving out and splitting my time half/half.  But I am also unsure of any future we have together. I am trying to go to graduate school in the fall and I feel like he’ll just hold me back from that.

Tl;dr boyfriend makes cheap comments, hates our friends, and doesn't apologize when I tell him how I’m feeling. Unsure where to go from here."

How do you prepare for your interviews?

This particular interview is for ""Product Quality Engineer internship"". Summarized description: 
&gt; you will design features that meet customer use cases, evaluate the quality of these features through a combination of manual and automated testing, debug software problems

An example of the questions I was asked in the interview was how I would test a blender?

They don't quite teach Product Quality engineering at my Uni to CS majors (its one of the top UCs).

**Additionally**: How should I prepare for a software engineering internship interview? Or specifically an Android developer intern internship interview? Most frequently the interviews ask me data structure related questions, how can I prepare myself to better answer these -- and brush up on my algorithms as well?

Thanks everyone!"

My ex and I broke up back in October because we were arguing quite a bit and I felt that we needed time apart as individuals to grow up as I was worried that he was making big personal decisions based on making me happy and not himself. I didn't want him to wake up in 10 years married to me and wondering where his life went. 

Over the summer we were long distance and had quite a few problems with him not communicating with me, lying to me, and blowing me off on the weekends to get high with his friends. On several occasions he told me that he was going to change and treat me better because he loved me. He never did. 

It finally got to the point where I could no longer trust what he said and his promises to change only infuriated me because I could see them ending in us having another fight when he didn't keep his word. I couldn't do it anymore and that combined with my fears of him not being mature enough for a serious relationship, as I was always second priority to something: his friends, marijuana, going to the bar, etc. 

It's been a weird break-up because we both still love and miss each other. At the beginning he was constantly showing up to my door drunk and begging me to get back together with him and telling me that he would change. Then when I finally was considering it I told him he needed to stop lying to me all the time, which he has been doing increasingly since the break-up, and that if he really wanted to give up smoking weed than he should go a week without doing it. This led to him smoking and lying to me about it two days later. That is when he told me that he wanted his bachelor years and didn't want to quite smoking weed, to which he then laughed and said ""it's funny because I will probably stop doing this in 2 years anyway."" That hurt to know that he couldn't give up something now that he was going to give up in the next 2 years anyways.

I decided to try to start moving on as he had told me he was getting over me, too. He told me he wasn't trying to meet anyone, though, because he still loved me. This made me think that maybe I shouldn't let go either. After he got fired from his internship I was the person there for him and during our talk he told me he wanted to quick smoking forever because it wasn't good for him and that he made a huge mistake in not wanting to get back together. 

Last night I discovered that during this time of him telling me it was a mistake he has also been using r4r and messaging girls to ""just be friends"" He even sent a picture to one of them. I confronted him about it because I was worried about him meeting people online and because I was confused about him trying to meet girls when he said he wasn't. His story changed so many times during our tear wrenching discussion I don't know what was right. 

By the end of it he was again telling me again that he made a mistake and he misses me. Today I discovered that right after he left my room he messaged the girl he has been talking to from Texas to set up a Skype date and further introduce himself and get to know more about her. What the hell is going on? One minute he is telling me he loves me and that it feels so wrong to not stay the night only to turn around the next minute and set up a Skype date with an 18 girls from Texas. 

Am I wasting my time by loving him? Should I let go? It feels so wrong to throw away all the love we had. Before we had broken up we were working on fixing things (my cousin suddenly died and being faced with my mortality made me want to work things out) and had talked for awhile about the big picture of our relationship, which we both had seen as ending in marriage some day. He even told me, and several of our friends, that he wanted to marry me some day. Now I just feel like a stupid 20 year-old girl.

**TL;DR: My ex keeps telling me he wants to get back together but has also been using r4r to talk to girls on Skype, has a previous history of being a liar, am I wasting my time?**"

My question is with the papers nearly signed.. Am I making a good choice? Would I be able to learn what I should at a start-up company?

1smkaz,1187,2013-12-11,I laugh at your pathetic safety measures!,mismanaged,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1smkaz/i_laugh_at_your_pathetic_safety_measures/,"*""Our systems are down and M says that he got a bad electric shock and that our computers are unsafe!""*

I look at the screen in front of me, look at the screen on the desk opposite. Both display nothing to indicate any malfunction in our systems. I then look back at the worried face of P, the unfortunate messenger of this week's idiocy.

*""Is your system down?""* I ask gently.

*""Well, I didn't look, and if the computers are dangerous...""*, she trails off.

*""Let's go and check shall we?""* I get up from my chair and head determinedly towards M's office space.

As we walk along carpeted corridors there is a noticeable absence of outcry, the air is buzzing with the faint sound of people continuing to work, unhappily eking out the remainder of their lives as tiny cogs in a relatively small machine. The faint smell of biological death from the potted plants fills my nostrils, temporarily displacing the perfumes of burnt dust and blown capacitors.

As we get closer to our destination we begin to hear the chatter and bustle only evident in this office at times of catastrophe or free cake. I soon can make out a voice.

*""I'm telling you, worst shock ever, I've got a tingling feeling all the way to my elbow. Still!""*

*""That's terrible, and really dangerous!"" ""We could get shocked any time!"" ""I heard even a small one can give you a heart attack!"" ""And the radiation you get inside causes cancer!"" ""Could we sue?""*

A small crowd has formed around M, their unlikely martyr. Sweating, pink shirt creased, and with an expression of heroic suffering, M is cradling his hand while he tries to chat up a couple of interns.

*""Yes it hurts, but I do karate, and one of the first things you learn is to control pain, to embrace it as an expression of being still alive.""* He trots out this garbage with a faint crocodile tear in his eye.

*""ooooh""*, coo the interns, (hopefully) feigning sympathy.

*""It sounds terrible. Do you think you need an ambulance? Without care you might lose all use of your hand.""* I pitch my voice to interrupt the ongoing conversation.

Silence falls over the group, I visibly see M weighing the choice between calling the paramedics and attempting to hold up his injury under professional attention vs. staying and continuing his quest of banging an intern, a quest he had been unsuccessfully pursuing for several years at that point.

*""I'm sure it isn't necessary, I have a strong constitution""*, He finally responds.

*""The system is down! Why haven't you fixed it yet!""* Cries one of the amorphous blobs occupying valuable floor space with his cup of tea in hand.

""Is it down?"" I open up the closest machine and log in as normal.

The group goes a quiet.

*""Well it must have fixed itself...""* says the blob, as the group drift back to their seats and back to their work.

M intervenes at this point.

*""Look! Nothing!""* He points at his screen triumphantly, proudly displaying its glossy black surface like a gold medal.

*""I pressed all the keys and checked the monitor and pressed the power button and it doesn't work!""* The triumph in his voice is clear, he, the user, has been unfairly betrayed by the priests of IT and his actions are just.

I walk to the wall socket, turn it on, and turn on his machine. The sound of the windows logon echoes in the now quiet room and all eyes and ears turn to him, expressions rapidly hardening.

*""Ehm, I guess that's all fixed then. Thanks!""* He realises his error is embarrassing, yet another crop of interns are probably lost to his grasping hands forever.

*""Not so fast. I still have questions for you.""* I block his access to his chair.

*""You said you got an electric shock and that our computers are unsafe. Seeing as yours was off at the wall, where did you get the shock from?""*

His answer makes my blood run cold. *""I went down the computer room. I thought I could just reset it from there and it would work. I had a really important document I needed to do!""* his voice rises to a whine.

*""The computer room... You mean the server room!""*

*""Yes, I went in their and tried to do a reset and then I got shocked!""* He pitches his voice at the end, once again trying to create blame. How dare we have electronic devices that might give him a shock!

*""Let me get this straight. You went in the server room.""*

*""Yes""*

*""Through the door with all the electrical warning signs and tape?""*

*""Yes, I took those off because it's obvious a computer room has electricity. The door was also a bit stiff, I don't think that's very safe if there was a real emergency.""*


For clarification, the server room in this case was an adapted supply closet. The door was a normal supply closet door (I didn't have budget and the upper management was unconcerned). The door however, was always locked.


*""That door was locked...""* I think my voice must have sounded like the rasp of sand on stone at this point. Shock had drawn all of my moisture away from the surface to protect my body from the clearly brain damaging gas that must have been present in that room.

*""It can't have been locked. I only had to shove it a few times.""*

*""You bypassed our signs and a locked door and got into our server room. What did you do?!""*

*""Well I reached behind the big computerey machiney thing and tried to unplug it, that's when I got the shock. It really isn't acceptable...""*


My tale ends at this point. Fortunately no damage had been done to our systems, but the server room door had been kicked open (boot mark visible in the crap wood) and needed to have the lock replaced.

A semi-happy ending, while M did not get fired for his actions, he was chastised exhaustively and never bothered IT again. Also, a couple of months later, after I had the chance to outline the damage that could have been done to our Head of IT, the server moved to a real server room, with a proper door and plenty of fancy bells and whistles, where it lived happily ever after.

**The End**

TLDR: Neither shock nor pain nor lock of door can stay these messengers from the swift desecration of our systems.

Greetings dear redditors,

My name is Kristoffer Laukamp and I'm the leader of the non-profit organization FTH in Denmark. Many of you may think ""Hah, non-profit? You've got to be kidding me!"" But no, I'm not kidding you. Since we're accepting bitcoins, it means we can go around the banks and pay with bitcoins to avoid fees and taxes.

**Our Goal**
In Denmark, we have approximately 5.000 homeless people in every corner of our little country. Our goal is to feed ATLEAST 1000 of them, and hopefully even more. 

**How will you feed them?**
We will get in touch with restaurants all around Copenhagen and Jutland and make intern deals with them. We will buy around 100 pizzas of all kind, 100 sodas or water. 
Please note that the money will not be used to buy any of the following:
* Alcoholics
* Cigarettes
* Medicine


**How can I help?**
You can help by sending ANY amount of bitcoin to the QR address below, or by tipping to this account.



Our team currently consists of 5 people.


**Our Story**
It all started back when I, Kristoffer Laukamp, started in school. I was talking to a new guy who started in the same class as me. He told me he had been homeless for 1½ year, and a organization helped him with food and in the end, he got a home and a family. The organization is closed down, and therefore there's no ""real"" organization, that does the same as we do. Please do show your support by tipping or donating to our QR code!

1smi03,0,2013-12-11,Making Myself More Presentable for a Riot Studios Career,2FrostBite,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1smi03/making_myself_more_presentable_for_a_riot_studios/,"After a day of studying and late-night ranking on the Fields of Justice, I decided to unwind and watch a few TED Talk videos. It's become a sort of habit to try to educate myself in multiple areas of discussion every night, due to the lack of attention I pay to the politics and musings of the world. The video I payed a lot of attention to (and actually ended up re-watching 3 times) is titled ""Why you will fail to have a great career: Larry Smith at TEDxUW"" and I'll have a link at the bottom of the post for convenience. The video challenged me and asked me what I really wanted to spend my life doing, and whether I was willing to accept my passions or reject them in fear of failure, public ridicule, etc. 

**It took me a long time to answer this question**; I've spent my whole life barely surviving, motivating myself with what I was taught as a child-- hard work and school. I realized that I never stood up for anything I personally believed in. I followed the bandwagon of my mom's opinion and kept all protest locked up in my head. I lost my passion in the process, concealing it and trying to forget in order to adapt to the lifestyle my mother wanted me to live: school. Now I've reached my senior year in high school, however I'm even more terrified of the reality that I have to face when I walk out of my high school doors with a diploma in hand. Barely passing school and rebelling against my mother had turned me into such a spoiled brat and a procrastinator that I lack a career path. The idea of me returning to schooling to reach a further education completely disgusts me; I disliked school enough as is and returning to school with no objective is highly unappealing. Eventually I realized what I really wanted: **I wanted to study games and immerse myself in a world with people who shared my same beliefs.** I remembered talking with my mom about what I wanted to do, and I gushed in detail why I wanted to make 'cool' games and make people smile with such. She completely rejected me, Darius-dunking (I'm sorry) my opinion, shouting that 'games are only a source of entertainment and an escape from reality', 'making games doesn't make you money and games aren't even popular in the real world'. She had completely deterred me from what I really wanted, forcing me into her own beliefs. Looking back, I don't care anymore: I don't care about the pay, I don't care about the publicity, and I don't care about what she thinks. I want to stop feeling so helpless and powerless in the say of what my life will amount to. I want to do what I love and make others feel the same emotions I feel when I receive a new update on Steam, a patch on League of Legends (Yasuo tho), or a new video game in the mail from Amazon. I want to stop victimizing myself in fear of the responsibility of stepping up to the plate and taking control of where my life leads now.

After putting my passion in priority over other's judgement, I had to decide what kind of direction I'd head from there (ex: what kind of school I wanted to apply to [still not known], what specific genre I wanted to work on, and where I'd geographically be when I focused on my career). I currently live in Los Angeles, California, of what I consider a cultural bazaar where there's a different slice of life offered on every block. I feel as if where I am right now is possibly one of the best areas to be in to achieve my dream of being on a game development team, so I will most likely stay. Next, I had to tackle what kind of games I would want to work on. I had played a diverse majority of video games: beat 'em ups (*Dynasty Warriors* series for PS2), First Person Shooters [FPS] (*Call of Duty* and *Battlefield* series for PC + Xbox 360), tactical shooters (*Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6* series for Original Xbox), stealth games (*Metal Gear Solid* series for PS1 + PS2 + PS3), survival horror (*Resident Evil* series for PS1 + PS2 + PS3), and MMORPGs (*Maplestory* and *Runescape* for PC). I'm going to separately mention MOBAs because they are a game category I had recently picked up over the year and have vastly enjoyed more over the rest, due to its massive incorporation of elements I see from other game genres into one package. I had decided overall that MOBAs were the most enticing genre for me to think about, and the massive amount of effort and coordination required to successfully piece together a MOBA game enticed me farthest more than any genre mentioned. Living in Los Angeles and with the knowledge of the Riot Studios Santa Monica office being only a 20 minute commute away, I have my eyes set on them. Like any other individual who is mesmerized by the production and execution of League of Legends, I have set out to apply for an internship and hopefully a full-time job at Riot Studies (when I'm ready).

In the end, this all boils down to is **I'm no longer afraid of judgement from my mom or my peers for being so in love with the development of games (the mechanical and artistic sides)**, and I'm putting myself out here on full display to take any advice on how to make my childhood passion into a career I can stand beside and protect. If you've made it to this point, thank you so much for reading through this, whether you wish me luck or failure, for it brings me a huge amount of relief to have caught the attention of one individual. If you have any words of wisdom, please do not hesitate to comment below because I will be watching this thread really carefully over the next few days. Thank you for hearing me out, Camron. Oh yeah, my IGN for the NA servers is BIT TRIP.

1sltoo,3,2013-12-10,[Intern] High School Web Developer,QwertyCyclone,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/1sltoo/intern_high_school_web_developer/,"Hello,

Before I get to my background knowledge, allow me to introduce myself. I'm currently a student in high school, but don't get the wrong idea about me. I'm able to communicate professionally, and am very dependable. I've been working with computer since I was in third grade, so there's that. I'm an avid tennis player, as well as a cross-country runner. I spend most of my free-time either playing tennis, programming, or reading. That's the gist of me. 
 
Now back to the topic at hand, the internship. I'm looking for a professional, work environment where I can learn. That's my main goal, in fact. I have background experience with the following.

* HTML
* CSS
* PHP
* MySQL
* Wordpress
* Apache server
* Nginx server
* MySQL server
* Unix shell (CentOS/RHEL, specifically)

Although that is my current skill set, I am more than willing to learn whatever I have to.  
Another thing I should note is that I may be busy every once in a while simply due to school. I'm taking all advanced courses, so it's quite a load. I am generally available after 7:30 PM CST, but I don't mind staying up later if it's required.

Any questions? PM me, or email me at: `nimit (at) nimitkalra (dot) com`.  
Hope to find a place that suits me!"
1slogx,2,2013-12-10,(X-Post from militaryfaq) Left Army/Navy Recruiters office w/ more questions than answers,militaryquestion7,Military,https://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/1slogx/xpost_from_militaryfaq_left_armynavy_recruiters/,"(sorry for the x-post, figured it would get more views here)

Hi Everyone. I am going into my last semester of my senior year at a top 15 university, and I am interested in enlisting in either the Army or Navy (would consider other branches, but this is where I started) in the Intelligence (or similar, like PSYOPS for the Army) field. I have strong analytical and critical thinking skills, along with communications skills that I have developed over the last 4 years in various internships, which I believe would make me an asset to the military. In addition, I have played high level soccer for most of my life and as such I am in good shape.

I have a strong desire to serve my country, and at this point in time (while I'm young), I believe joining the military is the best way to do this. Today, I went and met with recruiters from both the Army and the Navy, and I brought these issues up and got no satisfactory response, so i was wondering if anyone can shed some light on it. 

* I unfortunately have had a few injuries over the course of my soccer career, namely a separated shoulder (***NOT*** dislocated), partially torn ligaments in one of my knees, and two concussions. None of these currently impact me and my activity level, and I have suffered no post-concussive issues. My orthopedist said that my shoulder is just as strong as it would be before the injury, I just have an ugly looking bump. Most athletes choose not to have it surgically repaired because there is no functional difference in the shoulder, just cosmetically with the bump reduced. When I asked the recruiters about these injuries, they said not to bring them up because it ""just complicates things"" and that they would only need to see medical records for my shoulder because it is noticeable.

* I used to smoke marijuana from my sophomore year to end of junior year in college (and used magic mushrooms twice). It was not an everyday thing, but it was multiple times a week so I don't believe it would fall under the ""experimentation"" label. I asked about this, and both of them said something the lines of ""i'm not advocating for you to lie...but they can't really prove how much you have smoked so just say you did a few times."" 

Like I said, the few injuries I picked up over the years have ZERO impact on my physical activity. I have no post-concussive issues, and my knee and shoulder are just as strong as they would be pre-injury. In addition, I have quit smoking and have absolutely ZERO desire to start again, and have not stayed in contact with my so called friends who I used to indulge with. However, I feel extremely uneasy about even slightly fudging the truth if I take the next step and move on in the process to enlist. 

If the result of my choice to smoke marijuana and my few injuries means that I am ineligible to join the military or get a job in the intelligence (or related) field, than I understand that this is the consequence of my actions. I do not, however, want to lie about anything that will go in my record, because I think that the consequences my lying and getting caught far outweigh anything that I could do otherwise. 

Sorry for the wall of text, and I would really appreciate any feedback and insight on my situation."
1slhe5,0,2013-12-10,"How do I know if the # of PCIe lanes will bottleneck my system-particularly Graphics Cards-or not? (AKA, the x8/x8 vs x16/x16 question)",Xirema,hardware,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1slhe5/how_do_i_know_if_the_of_pcie_lanes_will/,"At the beginning of the semester, using leftover money from an internship I worked, I built myself a new computer (for the first time!) to replace my 5-year-old gaming laptop. It runs well and I'm really happy with it, but there was a question that I never found a satisfactory answer to during the parts shopping + build process, and I'd like to know if anyone here has any valuable insight/answers.

In my computer, I went ""economical"" for the motherboard, and went for a board that had two x16 PCIe slots, but which would go x8/x8 if you plugged in two cards. I spent a lot of time trying to determine whether this would affect performance of two x16 cards, and the answers I got were very vague, ranging from ""well, it might slow it down a little"" to ""even the 780 Ti doesn't fully use 8 lanes, so you don't have to worry!"" Needless to say, I'm really not sure which answer is more ""correct"", if either.

So, my question is two fold:

1. **In a General Case**, how would I know if the x8/x8 format is bottlenecking an arbitrary machine to a significant degree (as opposed to a x16/x16 or even a single x16 configuration), and
2. **In my Specific Case**, should I expect any bottlenecking in my specific build? My specs are at the bottom of the post.

Thanks for any and all insight you can provide. Also, if you have any websites/forums that are specialized to questions like this, let me know what they are.

1slfaz,2,2013-12-10,I feel like my [21/M] girlfriend [21 F] doesn't appreciate everything I do for her,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1slfaz/i_feel_like_my_21m_girlfriend_21_f_doesnt/,"Hey all, 

My girlfriend and I have been together for about a year and 1 month now, and I have started to notice more and more of a problem lately. We're both pretty busy people, and I am the only one here at college who has a car. Now, I love helping out my girlfriend. Love her to death and would do anything for her at the drop of a hat. But she calls me up nearly every day, and requests for a ride to somewhere a little bit outside of town, whether to the supermarket, craft store (she's a graphic design major and has to take art classes), and everywhere else all over creation. I normally don't have a problem with this, but it's starting to get to a point where I feel unappreciated.

It's gotten to a point where I'm afraid to say No, because she will kind of huff and puff and give me the cold shoulder and get mad at me. She always keeps telling me ""Thank you so much you're so helpful I'll make it up to you I swear"" and the problem is nothing ever does happen. She speaks so much about how much she loves me but doesn't really show it by doing anything special.  It's always a last minute call, or pretty much telling me to come over to her house unless I bribe her with something special at mine so she comes over, and even then she doesn't even like to walk anymore she insists on me picking her up and driving her. We live about 2 blocks away from each other.

I also always make it a point to surprise her and make her feel special, even if it's the littlest things. Bringing her flowers ""just because"", getting her favorite candy, surprising her by cooking dinner or bringing over a bottle of wine, I literally do everything a girl could ever want because I care about her that much...but I'm worried she doesn't care about me the same way.

I'm at the end of my rope. She's always extremely busy (multiple school clubs, tough major, job and recently picked up an internship) and I understand that, but at the same time I think there's a point where I get to draw the line. I feel like I'm just being used and am putting 70% of the effort into the relationship while I'm only getting back 30%. I tried asking her if we could talk tonight, but she's apparently pulling an all nighter and has something due by midnight. What do I do? I want to put my foot down and stamp this out, but at the same time I feel like she'll just push away like she always does when I want to talk about something serious.

---

**tl;dr**: I feel like my girlfriend doesn't appreciate the effort I put into our relationship and making her be happy and stress-free (driving her places nearly every day on the drop of a hat, always coming over to sleep over, gifts, surprises, etc). I kind of feel like a pushover. "
1sr4wp,1,2013-12-12,"What is the appropriate, professional way to get unbanned from a LinkedIn group?",lilgadget,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1sr4wp/what_is_the_appropriate_professional_way_to_get/,"A while back, I wanted to join a group on LinkedIn related to my field of work.  The group required 3 years of professional experience to be a member.  Looking through my profile, I had over 3 years of experience between my current job, internships, and professional experience with real companies on projects as a grad student.  So, I tried to join and was denied.  Understanding that perhaps the group admin didn't count my grad school experience as ""professional,""  I waited a few months until all my experience outside of that added up to over 3 years.  Denied again.  Ok, I supposed maybe he didn't count internships as ""professional."" so I waited a few months until my current job and an apprenticeship I'd had equaled just 3 years. Denied again and bam! blocked from the group.  

I really wasn't trying to be a nuisance or push my way into a group that I didn't belong in.  I've been in professional industry associations and have worked with companies in the industry since graduate school (and I know several people in the group who could vouch for that), so to me that all counts as professional experience, but the group admin obviously doesn't see it that way.  

I was going to send him a LinkedIn message soon after the ban explaining my position and asking for admittance to the group, but I worried too much that I would be interpreted as a whiny kid trying to get into something she should be in, or challenging his authority too much, or that I'd get some kind of nasty response from him.  After that I forgot about it until now, several months later.  Today, the time at my current job and the apprenticeship adds up to 3 years and 10 months.  

I'd really like to be in the group, so how do I go about approaching this?  Is there a way to ask neatly and professionally if I may join the group now? Do I mention the ban? Play stupid and just say that I can't seem to access the group? Should I just bite the bullet and wait 6 or 7 more months until I know that he can't discount 3 years at my current job? Even then I would have to go through the awkwardness of asking via a message to him...

1sr2x0,1,2013-12-12,I hate myself for staying in my shitty relationship,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1sr2x0/i_hate_myself_for_staying_in_my_shitty/,"Throwaway account.
 Here is my story, and I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity to release this burden.

I was born in raised in the heart of the midwest to a loving family. I was so full of joy and loved to laugh. I participated heavily in theatre, cheerleading, golf, gymnastics. I cried the day I got my acceptance letter to my dream school. 

At college, I joined a sorority and developed a fantastic friendship with so many women. I began my pursuits of becoming a journalist. I met some great guys (and not so great guys), but in the end, my freshman year was quite an exhilarating ride. 

At the beginning of my sophomore year, I met a guy who lived across the country. We met through mutual friends, but at the time, I didn't really think of him as anything more than a stranger on the east coast. We eventually kept talking, and a few months later, he flew out to my school to meet me in person for the first time. We hit it off like you wouldn't believe - it's like we were best friends for years. We understood each other better than anyone else ever has. The weekend he was with me was pure bliss. 

However, that spring semester, things got really ugly. This is where the emotional abuse began. He found out I was still talking to someone from my past (someone before my boyfriend was ever in my life). My boyfriend started to show signs of ""punishing"" me. He called me all of these names and threatened to cheat on me. This really broke my self esteem down... I was being name-called like ""worthless bitch"" or how I deserve to sleep on the floor ""because I am a dog.""

Eventually, I convinced myself I deserved such punishment, and he took over. I was no longer allowed to go out with my friends. I spent every single weekend at home in my bed. I had to tell him where I was going if I went anywhere else that wasn't class or the gym. I had to get ""permission"" to attend my sorority's spring formal. I once told him I needed to go to the mall to buy new jeans (I was losing weight) and he replied that I ""don't need new jeans, people wear sweatpants to class.""

It sounds so silly, but I consider myself a fragile person... one that is easy manipulated out of fear of being lonely. 

We continued to date long distance. I moved in with him for the summer and things started to get a little shaky. I noticed he would start raising his voice at me, and eventually started lightly shoving me when we got into arguments. I found out he was having not-so-appropriate convos with his ex. I moved back in August to go back to school. We had our ups and downs during that fall semester, especially towards the end. My boyfriend would call me names and lash out on me and would blame me for his mistakes. I still wasn't allowed to go out with my friends, or even attend football games or social activities. We decided to take a break.  

During this ""break"" in December, my boyfriend stopped talking to me completely. He had me blocked from all social media and his phone. In retrospect, I'm not entirely sure what caused this. Looking back, I think it was because he wanted to see what else was out there.

 I started drinking - alot. I fell into a depression and couldn't get through the night unless I consumed a ridiculous amount of alcohol. It was finals week and I would go out drinking with my friends until I would black out. I called up my ex and had him meet me at a bar just so I had someone to talk to. I polished off a box of wine in two nights. I felt so alone. I realized I became really dependent on him. 

During this time, I started talking to someone who went to my school. I gave up hope on my boyfriend... he didn't want to talk to me, and at that time, I figured the best way for me to get over it was to talk to someone else (I was 20 and immature, I know). On New Year's Eve, I went on a date with this man, and it made me forget about my boyfriend. He was so kind, thoughtful, intelligent... everything I had been missing. He was such a gentleman too... he didn't even kiss me goodnight after because he wasn't sure how I felt. He later told me that he enjoyed talking to me and would like to go out again.

That night, I partied my ass off with my friends (happy new year!), and had a blast doing it. 

The following week, I went on a date with the new guy again. This time, it was to go to dinner and than watch a program about the presidential election (we were both super into politics). We watched TV and had indepth conversation for HOURS, and I eventually slept with him. 

During all of this, my boyfriend was calling my phone while I was out with this guy. I didn't realize it until I checked it the next morning. 23 missed calls. I called him back, we discussed, I confessed to what just happened, and he told me he actually slept with 2 women and took another one out on a date during this month too. 

I was devasted, and I admit... it made me feel less guilty about sleeping with someone else. I found out my boyfriend slept with these people while we were still in contact. We decided we still wanted each other, and promised to discontinue all contact with our affairs. I quit my sorority, dropped out of school, and moved halfway across the country to be with him two week later.

Now begins my life here, where I still am today. I moved here in 2012, nearly two years ago. The year 2012 can be summed up in one word: hell.

Spring 2012 was interesting. I completely cut off all contact with my affairs. He did not. In fact, he was still texting them asking for sex on his birthday. I discovered he created a dating profile during this time. It wasn't just a quick profile, it was PARAGRAPHS about him, his life, and what he wants in a woman. Of course, I was livid. He apologized, took it down, and blocked the affairs.

Summer 2012 - even worse. The woman he went on a date with was never cut off from him, in fact, she was now his client (he's a personal trainer). Meaning, they would spend time together every week. He lied about this, of course. I only found out when I went through his things. He assured me that she is just a client, nothing unprofessional can happen. It ruined my August birthday.

Fall 2012 - the worst I could have ever imagined. A month after discovering his new client, I find out he is texting her things like how he is ready to have sex with her and has ""been waiting almost a year to do it."" He even goes in detail with her how he loves watching her ass when he works her out. I'm fucking crushed. I tell him if he cares about me, he will let her go as a client. He insists its ""not up to him"" and his boss puts him with clients. I knew this was a complete lie. 

Winter 2012 - He continues to lie to me about this girl. I decide I can't take it anymore, and I move back to my original home and enroll back into my dream school. I had an apartment lined up and everything. After moving, my boyfriend apologized, and to make a long story short, I decided to move back to be with him. He quit his job to start his own business, but couldn't promise me this girl wouldn't tag along. 

2013 was both the best and worst year of my life.

When I moved back, I scored a PR internship in the city for the Spring. I LOVED it. It was exactly what I needed - I felt like I was in my element, I loved my job, I met new friends, I networked. It was the perfect distraction to the past. 

During Spring 2013, I caught my boyfriend in a lie. He was still training this girl, but now he was developing feelings for her. I found out he didn't just take her out on a date that one time, but he actually went to her house where she ""was fooling around"" (yet he insists they've never had sexual contact). I told him he needs to cut off all contact with her. He said he would try to work something out. I eventually found out that she really really liked him. I took matters into my own hands by messaging her myself. She screenshotted it and sent it to my boyfriend, in a joking manner. I also found out my boyfriend re-opened his dating profile. 

Summer 2013 - I landed another internship at an even better company. It was a really great resume booster for me, and I learned so much. I was enrolled for classes at my new college here for the fall. Things were aligned in my life. Except I had a devastating blow - I found out my boyfriend was telling this same girl he had feelings for her. And of course lied about it to me. During the initial fight after I found out about it, I was screaming at him. He threw me into a closet where I bumped my head and my nose began to bleed. It was easily the worst I've ever had.. blood was EVERYWHERE. It looked like a murder seen. It was all over the clothes, the carpet, the door, my face... he got ridiculously pissed because I ruined his clothes. I lost so much blood I eventually passed out. 

When I found more messages the following week, I screamed at him. Flipped out. He got so mad at me that he picked me up from the ground and threw my body onto the concrete in the basement. I landed on my arm and I was certain it was broken - I couldn't move it, lift it up, turn my wrist... nothing. He started crying how his life is over now that he has to go to jail. I did the one thing I regret the most - I waited to go to the ER myself where I told them I ""fell down some stairs.""

I move back home about a week later, this time looking to begin a new life in a new city with my friends. My boyfriend and I were broken up, but still talking. He vowed to me he will never do that shit again, his cheating days were done. We made up about a month later, and against everyone's wishes, I went back to him.

Honestly, it was the best. When I moved back, we got our own apartment. He seemed like a changed person. We now argued about laundry or dishes... not other women. I really, really, really felt he got his head out of his ass. He was more than willing to let me go through his things if I wanted, his phone never went off like it used to, he would come home every night to me. It just felt... nice. I wasn't talking to anyone either. 

In October 2013, I left for a weekend to compete because I had a job as a gymnastics coach. This was the first time I left him alone in our new place. I trusted him, I didn't think anything of it. He came to the meet to support me, and all was well.

I found out two weeks ago that while I was away that weekend, he was sending dick pictures to a ""friend"" of his (this is a new girl in the picture). He was telling her how she was ""on his radar for a few years now"" and how he ""loved her body."" She sent naked photos too and told him she was saving his photos. He'd ask her what color boxers he would wear. She'd send him dumb mirror selfies all day. He'd talk about licking fucking froyo off her stomach. 

Obviously, this happened two months ago, but I just found out about it, so it's all recent to me. He never admitted it til I found out. He claims he was so drunk while it happened he didn't remember. It makes me sick he did this and the next morning he was all smiles as he cheered me on.

I felt hurt, angry, alone. I started innocently flirting with someone on facebook. It was one conversation. Never took it to a place where it shouldn't have gone. Last night, I admitted it to my boyfriend after it happened. He was so angry he started threatening me.. telling me if I cry he will ""put me in a hearse."" He was so mad he started throwing shit at me... he threw a fork and it landed directly in my leg... so now I have bloody fork marks on my thigh. He eventually picked me up and slammed me on the ground, except this time I landed on my back and my head. I am pretty sure I have a concussion... I have a really, really bad headache and I am dizzy.

 He told me I am forced to sleep on the couch from now on. I understand that but... he doesn't keep the heat on in the apartment (we have a space heater but he took it into the bedroom with him), so it's 10 degrees outside and the window is broken in here. AKA... it's fucking cold. Almost unbearable. But, I went along with it. I slept on that damn couch.

We had a really bad fight today. First it started out him saying how much of a ""snake"" I was and how much of a whore I am (I didn't even do anything out of line). I got really upset, so I started crying. He threw a whole galloon of water across the room and it hit my leg so hard I fell to the ground. I started crying more. He kept calling me names. I told him to stop, he slapped me across the face so hard I lost my balance and fell to the floor (it also broke my glasses in half). I just wailed out because I was so scared, but he came up to me and grabbed my neck and told me to calm down before something worse happens.

I calmed down, we talked it through. We are now both sitting in the living room being civil. I FUCKING HATE MYSELF because there is nothing stopping me from leaving. I depend on him financially because I can't afford to live on my own. I do love him. But I feel like I am sacrificing my dignity and self worth. I hate this happens. I hate this all happens. But I can't leave... I would never send him to jail because it was ruin his life... I would rather just walk out of his life where we are both unharmed. We were totally fine until he decided to fuck it up by sending pics to some hoe. It turned me into this selfish monster who wanted attention, and I get punished for it yet he feels he's justified by doing his actions because ""he pays the bills.""

I now have to take a xanax to even begin my day. I have panic attacks all the time. I'm surprisingly doing really well in school. I just hate that when the bad is bad, it's BAD! But when we are good, it's the best. Why can't it be just normal? There is a part of me saying I should stay until I am finished with school in 2014 and then leave... but then I am using him.

I've thought about suicide plenty of times, but never seriously enough to do it. I've thought about just downing all of my xanax and drinking some vodka... Sometimes it just got too much for me. 

I feel like I stay here because I know what the ""Good"" looks like and I feel like it's definitely obtainable if neither of us do shady shit. Like I said, I don't want him to get into trouble/get arrested... but if there was a way I could get out without my future being compromised, I would do it... that way no one's life is ruined. 

Yeah, I'm fucked up. This is my life. Thank you for listening.

tl;dr My relationship is abusive in just about every way possible, but I can't bring myself up to leaving.

It appeared the other day out of nowhere, so I ran an Avast quick scan, which found nothing. I deleted the folder (probably two days ago?) and didn't think much of it until now, when it just appeared again. I haven't done anything with it yet, since I figured I'd ask here if there was anything dangerous about it - a Google search didn't yield any results.

I don't use 4chan (can't specifically remember the last time I was on it, but definitely not within the past few weeks leading up to this).

1sqx4c,1,2013-12-12,“Asylum between the road trip.”,[deleted],shortscarystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1sqx4c/asylum_between_the_road_trip/,"Raza.A

My name is Patrick and I was an internship student of a teaching hospital in California until I got a job opportunity in Harborview Medical centre in Seattle and I decided to take it. A Bunch of my friends, including my best friend Josh and his girlfriend Chelsea also got in that hospital and we decided to make a road trip out of it, you know to check out what we were getting into, we rented an RV, filled it up with all the essentials that we were going to need for an eighteen to twenty hours long drive and six of us me, Josh, Chelsea, Eric, Sabrina and the designated driver Ashley, she was 19, so she couldn’t drink and she is a good driver, so we brought her along too she’s Sabrina’s little sister. We started off late in the night maybe 2 or 3 AM, because we wanted it to be daytime when we reached the Klamath River so we could enjoy the freshness of the morning in the forest on the bank of the river. But I guess it was too much to ask for because turns out after 7 hours of driving we weren’t on the Cascade wonderland highway anymore but instead we were on the pacific highway, I was sleeping so I didn’t know when we crossed the state line and ended up in Oregon and Josh was busy with Chelsea and 27 years old Eric was busy hitting on Ashley and Sabrina was occupied with the dog that she shouldn’t have brought on the road trip but I guess it wouldn’t have made any difference even if she didn’t, it was my fault too, I shouldn’t have slept. When I woke up and after a while when I saw the road opening to the old highway I realized that we were on the pacific highway but there was no point in going all the way back so we decided that we should set up a rest camp over here between the intersection of the two highways. Sabrina wasn’t so sanguine about it she said that it reminds her too much about the wrong turn and that we should just keep moving until we hit a town, we all made fun of her and tried to scare her more but the truth is that I agreed with her, certainly not on the horror movie thing but on this place not being safe enough to rest here but we had no choice the RV’s engine needed sometime to cool down and so did we, besides it was not like a ghost town or anything because every now and then a car or an RV would pass by us and Josh was packing heat, his uncle’s hunting rifle, so overall it wasn’t that bad.

We set up a camp fire and started talking about different things like the friends that didn’t pass the exams, places that we would visit when we arrive in Seattle, about teaching hospitals and where we would buy a place to stay, things like that and out of nowhere Eric changes the topic altogether and starts talking about this 1800’s abandoned asylum in the Oregon forest and he starts telling his “folk tale” about this 80 years old deranged killer who would eat flesh out of his own body parts, every time different body part once a month and then he would wait a while for the flesh to reform and he would tear it out with his teeth and eat it again, he was committed there after killing his wife because she didn’t cook the deer right. He was found chewing on her face.

He was bound into straightjacket and a protective gear on his mouth just so he would stop eating himself and give up threatening others by showing his blood tainted, broken teeth and by making a petrifying roaring sound from the bottom of his larynx whenever they come into his room. Eric also said that when the asylum was being abandoned no one knew what happened to the old man they all assumed that he was left in his room because no one was gutsy enough to let him out and take him to the bus where all the other patients were.

No matter how juvenile his story sounds we were all a little bit startled, after all we were sitting outside the forest of Oregon.

Afternoon was ending and the evening was beginning, it was getting cold and dark, and the animals were awakened, so we started to head for our RV, Sabrina’s dog, Stella was getting a bit apprehensive. Now before I go any further you should know something about me and Sabrina, we use to date each other back in the college, actually it was more like four dates, nothing serious, I mean I guess it wasn’t because later I found out that while she was dating me she was sleeping with someone else, someone close to me, a friend. And she told me about him while *we* were making out, anyway I would’ve let that go if the guy was some stranger and not my friend but I can’t blame her for that because she wasn’t aware of that but he was, he knew about my relationship with her and how much I liked her, we are not friends anymore, not after I punched him in the guts. -After that I couldn’t date her anymore, I guess it was too much for my ego, we stayed friends, but that didn’t change the way I felt about her. Maybe that’s why when the dog, Stella leapt from her arms and ran into the forest and when we all decided to not go after her except Sabrina and Ashley, -and leave the dog because it was late and running off into the forest was just too much precarious, that’s when Sabrina looked at me with her deep blue eyes and said “Please”. Boy didn’t that make me change my mind. I also knew the story behind that dog, it might just be a dog for every one else but not for her because it was given to her by her mother on her sixteenth birthday, that dog was the last present she got from her mother, her mother died of a brain tumor, actually she died during her surgery.

So when she asked me to help her find the dog, I said “Let’s go find that dog”. I mean what could go wrong, right? -Running after a dog in the middle of the forest at night. It’s a beginning to the happy ending with half as population as before.

Josh wasn’t onboard with the idea, I don’t blame him neither was I but I don’t know why I was doing this anyway I did manage to get him onboard with the plan which involved me and Sabrina going into the forest alone but he said that he wouldn’t let us go alone in there with all the wild animals and I suggested that he gives us his rifle but he said, “No way you can’t shoot jack. I’m coming with you.” On which Chelsea also decided to join us and Ashley and Eric were going to stay at the RV.

We were following the same path on which we saw the dog running off to but she could’ve been anywhere by now after all the time we took deciding to go after her. Sabrina was calling out her name and Chelsea joined her upfront. Josh and I were behind them. “What the hell is wrong with you?” he whispered. “What?” I knew what but I still asked what. “Running after a dog in the middle of the evening, really? Hey if you wanna sleep with her go ahead but don’t get us all killed in the process.” Hey we’re not going to die you’re overreacting. We were just talking when we heard a familiar bark and then someone running it was Sabrina going after the sound of dog’s bark, we ran behind her for a while and then we stopped when she stopped, it was from here, she said. The barks stopped, we were very far out into the forest, and slowly we wouldn’t even be able to see anymore, the sunlight was fading away gradually, we again decided to give up, this time even Sabrina wasn’t this much enthusiastic about finding the dog anymore, we were just about to head back when we heard the barks again, this time from two different directions, it was not that uncommon for two dogs to be barking at the same time, Sabrina thought that she recognizes one of the dogs bark but we wanted to be on the safe side so we split up, Josh and Chelsea went after the other one he gave me his knife, just in case, he said. Finding our way back to the RV wouldn’t have been hard because we had our phone’s GPS synced with Eric’s phone. We were running in different direction and by my understanding they were running in different direction. Sabrina and I ended up at this very old building; it had fences around of it covering it but it had gaps in it which could be easily tackled by a dog. We entered the building; it was quite a big building we had to go through a barren yard to get in the building, there was a big, dry and thick tree in the yard, I don’t get scared that easily but I was and by the looks of it she was too but she didn’t want to go back without finding the dog because we could hear her inside the building. The building was very old; it seemed like it would crumble around us if we jump to hard. There was a reception just across an average size hall, it was a two floors building but we couldn’t go upstairs because the staircase was wrecked, it was quite easy to know that the dog wasn’t upstairs. Sabrina found a picture behind the reception desk other than a coffee mug, a journal, a 19th century telephone and a half piece of marble with “sylum” engraved on it, picture was old and was of this asylum, with some people standing in front of it, I couldn’t make out their faces. I guess we both were wasting our time here looking at these things because we didn’t want to exactly find out what was making all those noises in the back of building, we didn’t had much time so we started walking towards the hallway, “Secure unit” on a board that was hanging vertically from the ceiling. We didn’t bother to check the rooms that were either locked or the doors were closed, many rooms still had personal items in there, we were checking one of the rooms when Sabrina said, “You thinking the same thing I’m thinking?” “No. I’m thinking about you, are you thinking about you?” I said. She chuckled and said “No. I was thinking that this place might be the same place Eric was talking about.”, “It could be, it doesn’t matter even if it was, I mean it’s not like he could be alive all these years”. And she said, “I just want to find Stella and get out of here.” It might’ve been a peculiar timing but I asked her out in an Asylum, she said yes and then I said, “Great. Umm… just want to be sure if you’re not… with someone.” “What? Oh no… no I’m not.” We were just talking and checking the rooms when we heard a loud thump from beneath us, it was from the basement, we just skipped it because frankly I didn’t had guts to stare down the staircase into the obscurity, going in there was beyond my bravery. But now we didn’t had any other choice because we checked the whole first floor of the building, last time we heard the dog from inside the building, we knew that she was in here, the windows had bars on it so she couldn’t get out from there except from front door but we had that covered, we closed it behind us. Well, there was just one place left to look and it was the creepy, shadowy basement. The metal door into the basement was already opened so we got in and started walking down the stairs; I and Sabrina were using our phone’s LED screen light to see where we were walking. The stairs were made of rusted metal; it was creaking with every step. I was just hoping that it doesn’t break apart because I don’t think there was any other way out of there. It was very dark and it smelled of something very foul in there, our phone’s light wasn’t enough but it did the trick. It was a big basement, there was a long corridor with rooms on either sides and every room door was made of metal, there was another corridor but the door to it was locked. There was a reception there too but it had a lot of warning signs all around it. We started walking towards the end of the corridor from where we heard that thump, Sabrina was whispering Stella’s name. We must have only covered half of it when we heard a very stunning and deafening bang noise from upstairs, it sounded like two heavy metal objects striking together. I figured it was the basement door that we just passed through it must have been wind, because after staring a while at the basement stares waiting for something very strong coming down that basement stairs all hungry and growling was getting old, so we started moving again, she was terrified, I was scared too but my ego didn’t allow me to show it. As we were walking towards that place where it said “Medicine Room” from where that sound came from we heard something again this time it was from inside that place, we started taking our steps slowly towards that place, Sabrina stopped whispering Stella’s name, I had my one hand on the knife and my other in front of Sabrina, guarding her, that’s when we heard a scared familiar female voice, “Who is it? Don’t come any closer I have a gun, I will shoot.” It was Chelsea, she was very happy to see us; apparently she was scared because she too thought that something strong was coming down the stairs all hungry and growling towards her to eat her. Josh wasn’t with her, she said that he went to check the end of the corridor for some noise that he heard, and that he wanted her to stay there in case the dog comes out this way. We started walking towards the end of the corridor, checking every room from the outside, some were closed and some were opened, there was this one room that was closed and it said on the wall adjacent to the door “Do not open without proper authorization. Do not stare. Do not engage.” I looked inside and saw some blood on the wall and on the bed, I also saw some sort of a mouth protective gear, Eric’s folk tale was becoming more and more terrifying and not just to me. The door was unlocked, there was no lock on the door but we decided not to open it anyway. We reached the end of the corridor, only to find that two other corridors were sprouting out of that corridor but just as we were going to enter one of the corridors we heard someone running towards us from behind. Whatever or whoever it was we didn’t want to know but we looked behind and it was the dog, she startled us but she made Sabrina very happy and then there was my friend, Josh running towards us, I almost cracked a smile but then I saw that he wasn’t running alone there was someone else behind him, in fact he seemed to be running away from him, he was holding his shoulder and before he could shout run, I shouted “Run!” and it was after that one word that we all started running away into that undiscovered corridor, we were running very fast there was not enough light in the corridor, we couldn’t see where we were going, we were completely dependent on the dog and our luck, when she jumped we knew that something was in the way so we jumped. I could hear that thing coming after us although whoever or whatever it was, it was very slow but made a lot of roaring and growling sounds and then we reached a dead end, it was that close door that we encountered after entering the basement, it had a lock on it, which Chelsea shot with her rifle without wasting much time, we opened that door and ran up the stairs and closed the basement door behind us, that thing didn’t come up the stairs but we all could hear it down there. Josh was hurt, he said, “F*****g crazy old man. He bit me.” and then Chelsea said that we have to get out of here quick because there’s an another opening into the basement around the back of the building and he could come from there, so we ran outside and it was now dark we couldn’t see so we used the GPS tracker to get back to the RV, when we got there Eric and Ashley were making out, we ignored the vulgarity of the situation because we were preoccupied and yelled “Drive!” Ashley wanted to know more but Sabrina yelled at her and said “Just get us out here, now!” Ashley started driving towards Seattle again. Josh was bleeding but it wasn’t that bad, Chelsea was applying first aid when he said, “A**hole.” Yeah. I know, I said. “No I actually mean you.” He said. Chelsea wasn’t too happy with me or Sabrina, she didn’t say it but we knew. By the way, the dog was fine. Anyway, we got him to the hospital, had a bunch of blood tests, checking for rabies, poisoning, staph infection, hepatitis, Aids, T-virus (i.e. the zombie virus) etc. He was all good, even now he is married and has two kids perfectly healthy, although they do have some *weird* habits but I guess it’s normal for kids to occasionally *bite each other*.

I graduated this year with a good degree in journalism and politics and I'm currently enrolled on a National Council for the Training of Journalists diploma. I've had several successful articles published in a regional paper and a local one. Here's my best story so far. Trying to work on a follow-up again. 

I was wondering if anyone could offer me some advice on how I might pursue my goal of securing a job as a reporter (or in PR or related field) in Canada (preferably Alberta, but I'm obviously not fussy). 

I've been doing a bit of research for work experience placements and internships, however I was thinking maybe I could just contact the newspapers directly and ask if they would take me on for a few months unpaid.

Any advice would be very much appreciated.

Thanks! "
1sqlk9,1,2013-12-12,I need some advice with a job offer I received today.,[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1sqlk9/i_need_some_advice_with_a_job_offer_i_received/,"So let me put you in the situation. I'm 7 months out of college, still no job. It's probably due to a lack of experience on my resume, as I never did an internship in college, mainly because I didn't see how important they would be in finding a job. I did apply to one internship, but I didn't get it, and anyway, it's a bit late for that.

I don't have a job at the present time, and I've been looking for one pretty much full time, but I'm kind of lazy so I'd say about 4 hours a day or so is spent looking for a job. I've had several interviews, I think close to 10 at this point, most of them for decent positions, but 2 were for door-to-door sales scams that basically tricked me into interviewing with them. I recieved an offer from one of the door-to-door jobs (which I declined, because fuck that,) but other than that I've had no offers.

Now I just interviewed with a job yesterday for Eastern Account System. They found my resume after I reposted it (I do this every Sunday,) to various job boards. I interview with the recruiter first, then they send me to the job 10 minutes away, and it's a call center. I knew this going in, so at this point I'm still optimistic. Office looks nice, everyone is friendly, interview goes well I'd say, all is well. 

Now this is when the problems begin.

I look up the company online (I wasn't told the name of it until I arrived at the recruiter, one red flag there,) and the reviews are abysmal. I know everyone says ""oh, they wouldn't go to a review site unless they wanted to complain,"" but these reviews are the worst I've ever seen on glassdoor. And there are a ton of them. On indeed.com they are just as bad. Tons of reviews stating that it's a horrid place to work, that the turnover rate is extremely high, that it's actually a collection agency in disguise (I was told I'd be handling account issues, and that would be bonuses after 3 months. I'm learning now that all of these calls are payment related, and the bonuses are commission based on how many people I can get to pay,) and that all in all it's atrocious. And did I mention the hours (12:30-9:00 weekdays) are terrible? The pay (12.50 an hour) is also not particularly amazing. I could probably get that several places that are way closer than 45 minutes, which is what the commute would be.

Now obviously I'm hesitant to work here. In fact, I would outright say no (I asked for a day to think it over and the recruiter was not happy, which...whatever,) if it was not for my mom. She's pressuring me to accept this position, probably because she knows I'm a lazy guy, and that I'm really hesitant to do, well, anything, and I think that's clouding her judgement to the point where she can't see how legitimately terrible this position would be.

Now, I can be honest here - I've grown to like not having a job. It's very addicting. At any point I can just do whatever, and I don't have to pay for much, so I still have a large amount of money saved up. I know this needs to end though, sooner rather than later, and that if I still haven't found a career by next year I'll get a part-time job, anything that I can put on my resume would help. I'm going to need to start my life soon, but this job is not the way to do it, my gut is telling me that. My mother is really pressuring me to take it though to break me out of my funk, but if I do, that's a mediocre wage for like 3 months, and I'll still be looking for a new job to escape a damn call center. I'll also miss Christmas Eve with my family (apparently they don't get off that day, or most holidays,) and for what? 12.50 an hour that I don't need now, and a crappy job to put on my resume?

I know it's my decision, and my mind is pretty much made up, but how can I convince my mom that this is the right one to make?

EDIT: Another question here. I'm kind of new to the job world, but there's no penalty really if I accept the job, and then just instantly quit, is there? I obviously can't use them as a reference now, but there's no penalty on my end right? Is it possible I might sign something that would fuck me over in that regard?"

I started a internship in a big (great) company focused on IT. I asked here to see what could I do, as I didn't really liked the situation there, got some advice (keep looking for work) and stopped looking as a small (developing) project not related at all with what the department did arised. Things got boring, started looking for work again and looked straight in the eye on the awful software development spanish wasteland: Almost all are companies which re-hires you (I don't know the word in english... contractors?), with a ""get young people, burn them out, get new young people"" plan of business and which requires knowledge in very specific areas (i.e. specific java frameworks) with specific languages that doesn't really appeal me in a professional way (I think C++ is better for what i want to do long-time, companies only looking for people with Java, C#, .net).


So, right now, I'm 28, my only experience in the ""real"" world was an internship from which I didn't really learned nothing (Not really, small stuff, a Java app here, some theoretical knowledge of computer management there...) and seeing the market it seems there is no ""right"" spot for me, at least with 0 experience developing.


I have my almost mandatory personal project, and I would LOVE to have some free months to finish it and get some other ideas working, but that does not give money.


I'm also seriously considering freelancing, although the pay is crap (more for a guy with NO real portfolio) and the job is, at best, ""unstable"".


What my heart says is to build a real portfolio and forgot about this year, then start freelancing, then look for serious job. I don't really mind looking for job outside Spain, but I don't really see myself capable of doing it, both for language and personal stuffs.


So, any ideas/advices on what should be my next step?"

Two weeks ago I had two back-to-back phone interviews with Amazon for a summer internship. It was for an SDE position. I felt that both interviews went really well.

I received an email yesterday from one of their recruiters titled ""Congratulations from Amazon"" saying something along the lines of: ""We would like to speak with you about how the interview processes went and to discuss details for an offer this summer. Congratulations!"" 

I was just wondering a few things that perhaps some past interns could answer for me:

1. Does this mean that I got the position and will be discussing the team I will be on? I ask this because I was expecting them to fly me over for in-person interviews first before discussing any offers.
2. What team were you on, what did you do, and how was your experience with Amazon overall?
3. Was the pay suitable?

VERY lon",BimmerQK,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1sqbbt/i_am_a_24m_avoided_posting_here_for_months/,"Where do I start. I am a young professional at a large company and she was the summer intern. I had just gotten out of a 3 year relationship, she a 6 year relationship that ended in January when she cheated (i later found out). When I first met her I thought nothing of her besides the fact that she was very attractive. That was how it was from May-June. Within the team at work there were 2 other guys our age and we eventually became a tight knit group at work. This turned into a daily group chat and we eventually began organizing hangouts outside of work on about a weekly basis.

One night the other 2 couldn't make it out and I ended up inviting her to come out with my local group of friends with no intentions at all. I had actually playfully stated to my friends that I was bringing an attractive woman out that was single before that night even started. That night got the ball rolling.

We ended up having an absolute blast together, and ended up getting seperated from my friends. Around 3am or so she ended up dropping me off at home and nothing more happened. At that point I had acknlowledged we had a good time but that was it, as far as either of us knew. The next workday, we started chatting on the side of our group messages, sharing stories, etc. She mentioned something about me potentially coming on to her that night, but then quickly backtracked and said not to make anything of it. So still nothing and things continued as normal.

As the weeks went by, end of July by this point. We began to have in depth discussions in our side chats about anything on our minds and we would constantly flirt and text while we were apart. This was all still just fun for me.However, I began to realize that I was beginning to like this woman. I ended up organizing a one on one hangout again at a local bar after work and she accepted. 

The night went well, and we ended up staying at the bar for way longer than the ""few drinks"" that we had planned for. But eventually called it a night as it was (i think) a tuesday night. We parted but not without hesitating, I stated I wish we could continue this night, she said me too and we went our ways. Next day I avoided talking to her on chat until she asked if I had a good time, then asked if I wanted to do the same thing the next day after work. I accepted. This time (thurs) I decided to see where things would go, escalating the night until I suggested that we go for a walk on a bike path I knew locally. During this time I made my move and kissed her (early Aug) making my intentions clear and she reciprocated. 

The next night (fri), I invited her out with local friends and picked her up from her fathers place and met him and her step mother formally, i should mention he is at my company and we have worked together before. We then went out and proceeded to have a great night as all our previous ones had been...however this time we ended up in my bed and we could no longer hold ourselves back. 

By now she had three and a half weeks until she had to go back to school a little over 4 hours away. Things turned into a whirlwind romance where we hung out basically everyday after work going out on dates and having sex, while talking all day at work, I really began to feel a connection and she admitted this too, all the while realizing the decision we had to make come end of Aug. The last night she was here I was invited to a VERY nice dinner with her father and stepmother...I was initially reluctant, and had already denied dinner with them and her grandparents for fear that we were going much too fast, but I eventually decided to, since it made her extremely happy. 

We decided that we wouldn't make things official since neither of us liked the idea of a long distance relationship. This didnt stop us from talking on the phone and skyping nearly everyday after she left. I ended up visiting her at school in mid Sept and spent the weekend. I was a little thrown off by the framed picture of us in her bedroom from the nice dinner, but it seemed right to me so I continued as normal. However, in the process forming an attachment, and realizing I wanted more from this, but failing to mention it due to fear of ruining a good thing. I ended up leaving and we were both left lingering for much longer during the goodbye and when I got home we continued to stay in touch daily, her falling asleep while on skype with me etc. Until Oct.

She began to act distant, not being as talkative, and almost being snappy over chat with me. After a day or two I asked her what was up and through some tears she said she didnt think she could do what we had been doing anymore. I initially said I understood, realizing that things were probably beginning to ramp up at school, in addition to her new reponsibilities as president of a business org, part time job etc...however after a week of limited contact I began to feel like I was letting a good thing go and began to feel symptoms of anxiety and lonliness resulting from the ""break"". Determined to beat this I started to let go and focused on my emotional health and started running, working out, studying, and working

Despite this, the roller coaster that was October through mid November was harsh to say the least, all my thoughts revolved around her, hanging on every text and the occasional phone call. During which I let slip how much I cared for her and how It was unhealthy and my work was beginning to falter. Yes I know cutting her off should have been my move but neither of us could let each other go. Each time we talked on the phone or the one or two skpye sessions she began to open up about her past and her emotional issues, and I understood why she had done what she did. For fear that she was falling for me and not wanting to be hurt. So i persisted against every fiber of logic i had, taking things excruciatingly slow while she picked up her heart. Eventually we agreed on another visit mid Nov where we had a homemade romantic dinner and caved again to our intense physical attraction...leading eventually a talk where she revealed more of her past including the cheating and self harm resulting from it....how she was still in contact with the ex she cheated on and the ex she cheated with, who is across the country i should mention. It really hurt to hear but I  didnt try to fix anything, just mentioning I would be there for her reiterating how i cared about her. I should mention she finally revealed her terrible anxiety, which I knew but never wanted to point it out based on respect.

We had limited contact after i left that weekend as I attempted to distance myself from her. But she ended up back in the area during Thanksgiving break where we spent one night very closely at her father place, and the next a movie and wine night which ended up with..you guessed it. But my attempt to talk with her about what we were doing ended her stating that she couldnt commit to me yet. Wasnt ready, same story basically. By now I have my emotions in a stable place and am able to tell her I am fine with continuing slowly, but am getting worn thin waiting for her. 

So here we are now, I distanced myself even more at the beginning of this month. Talking to her the day after that night and only once since then until Monday. Im actually feeling much better and am in a good place again, starting to loosen my attachment to her. BUT, she has now begun to text me alot, and begun to initiate skype sessions, basically back to square one. We talked for hours monday then again last night. She invited me to her parents christmas party and her sisters birthday dinner here at home. We are going to see a concert on the night before nye and then plan on spending nye together, not to mention the entire christmas break that is open.

I have made it absolutely clear that I would be treating this on a dating/relationship basis but she is still hesitant. I have talked to her about the possibility of me moving on and finding someone else, which she replied that she would understand and wouldnt blame me if she still isnt in a place where she can commit yet, but would miss me incredibly so. Basically we are in a relationship but she for some reason cannot call it one...i am positive she is not sleeping around as she is not that type of woman (i know you think different), and I have told her I wont be a part of it if this is the case...she will always tell me when she goes out with old guy friends from home, and emphasize that they are just friends and tells me about guys that come on to her that she tells off because she of the guy she is dating back at home (me), am I naive for thinking that she is being genuine and making sure this is right before she jumps in, with the fact that the pressure of the semester is coming to an end? Or just MASSIVELY overthinking things? 

Id really like to hear some outside viewpoints. The hard truth, or someone to tell me to calm the fuck down and let her determine the pace of things and let things develop.

TL,DR Seeing a girl till she went back to school, she is not ready for a relationship. Despite this neither of us can end things and she is coming back for winter break. Need advice on what to make of things. Thanks for reading."

Some information I'm looking for would be: 

Your name, company's name, industry, what type of products or services your company does. Also how long you've been working there.

About you I'd like to know your position title, department, and what kind of work it is that you do (and if you like what you do!). I'd also like to know your education, if you earned a degree and from what college, and also any other positions you may have held working up through your career.

If you have time to actually chat that would be even better! PM me and I can email you or figure out a way to chat that works for you.

Just want to say a quick thank you to the denizens of this sub. Its because of your questions, comments, and personal stories that I've decided that software dev/engineering is a field that not only interests me greatly, but can feasibly provide me with a good job given that I work my ass off. I'm trying to figure out how to best manage the remainder of my time in school, and I have a few questions.

After floundering in my major choice for 3 years, I'm now a senior with a sophomore-juniorish standing for a CS degree at a decent school. I don't have any personal projects or open source contributions to speak of (yet) , which seems like it may nix my chances for getting an engineering internship for the summer. Assuming that's the case, would it be better to: 

1. Take the summer to work on my own stuff, go for an internship for summer 2015, and then graduate after fall 2015. Or....

2. Take a bunch of classes over the summer while working on personal projects, graduate in spring 2015, and then attempt to get an internship/job after I graduate.

I realize these two options aren't very different, I only ask the question this way because it seems like most the internships I'm interested in stipulate that you be returning to your program after the internship is over. Does it usually work that way in practice? Are there respectable internships that don't have this requirement? (my research has been admittedly less than exhaustive)

Any insight you guys can provide will be greatly appreciated!"

I'm in the city tonight after a long day of internship interviews, and I've decided to unwind back at my hotel's bar next to the lobby. I'm surprised by how many sexy men there are in here- mostly older businessman traveling.. lots of silver foxes.. but also what looks like a small group of gorgeous young jocks. I go to work immediately, making eyes at every guy I want, sitting alone at an empty end of the bar. It doesn't take long before I'm bought my first drink. I laugh and flirt and stroke thighs for hours, teasingly denying any of these men the chance to come upstairs with me. Feeling drunk and strangely sleepy very suddenly, I decide to call it a night. I stumble a bit heading for the elevator, but make it to my room and plop down on my bed, too drowsy to even kick my shoes off. A few minutes later, there's a knock at the door. Bleary-eyed and confused, I force myself up to answer it. When I open the door, there's a young man in a hotel staff uniform standing there, some kind of folded up table on wheels at his side.
""sir, I'm from the hotel- you're too receive a full body massage in your room, compliments of the hotel.""
My head is spinning so fast, and it doesn't occur to me to wonder why the hotel would do such a thing, especially at this hour. Instead, the word ""massage"" sounds sooo so good to me, and I back away from the door without a word, stumbling back onto my bed. The hotel employee rolls the table in and unfolds it- moments later I'm vaguely aware that he's speaking to someone..
""He's all yours""
I register a small amount of surprise when I hear the voice of a third man in the room.
""looks like it's hitting him pretty hard. ha. thanks for your help"" 
I turn my head a bit, seeing the man hand some cash to the hotel employee, who then leaves. Did I see this guy down at the bar? That seems right... I start to feel dizzy and lose the thought. I'm suddenly aware how flush and sensitive my cock feels...."

TL;DR: I'm trying to have my proposal plan go off without a hitch but I have so many factors to worry about and my anxiety is making me crazy! 

We've talked about marriage a lot and she knows that I'm going to ask her before Christmas. I'm planning on proposing on this Friday the 13th.



Upon our talks of how she dreams of being proposed to I've learned that basically she wants it documented somehow. First she told me that she wants me to do it in front of her family and friends, but I said hell no as I would most likely have an anxiety attack. Another part of what she wants is to be surprised, although she makes it terribly difficult for me to surprise her because she thinks literally everything we do is going to be the proposal. My solution to this is a little misdirection.  

My plan :

The plan is to have my best friend, who so happens to have a hobby of taking awesome pictures, visit us as he has not seen my new place since we moved to his area from our college 800 miles away. So he will visit us then we will go to have dinner, he is going to bail on us to meet a different friend in the city and just my gf and I will have dinner together. After that we are going to take a walk and hangout near the water, this will take place in Coronado, CA btw. So we will be near the water and my buddy will be near by without her knowing then I do the proposal and he ""documents"" it. 

My problem:

I've been having trouble planning this as my work schedule is unknown to me until the Friday before the next week. And on the days where I know my schedule I don't know what time I'll be done until I finish. She is a full time grad student and has no time for anything until the weekend. Since I'm doing this on Friday, both she and I will be coming home from work /internship. At that time I'm hoping both of us are home by 3pm or earlier. If this is the case then pretty much no matter what we will be stuck in rush hour traffic heading into San Diego. The problem I have with time is me trying to plan on a reservation for dinner, and the light level my friend needs to get good shots of us since it gets dark around 5.

I'm worried that I have too many unknown factors that I need to work correctly in order for this to go as planned. I'm having crazy anxiety about this which I'm sure is normal but the one person who knows how to calm my anxiety is the person I'm having anxiety about! 

Now I'm not sure how anyone can help, but I think just writing this helped a little. Any words of advice are appreciated! Thanks. "
1sp7tb,2,2013-12-12,I don't know how to handle being good-looking,throwaway8656098,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1sp7tb/i_dont_know_how_to_handle_being_goodlooking/,"Okay, so apparently I've got an ugly duckling thing going on and I'm not handling it well.  Sorry if this isn't the usual story but I've lurked reddit for a long time, and figured this subreddit might be the best to voice a concern.

I'm a straight male, and for a long time was considered unattractive and to put it plainly, ""creepy.""

I don't disagree with those terms, I accept the fact that I didn't look my best for a while and didn't handle my emotions well, which likely made people uncomfortable.

However,  I've been working out, fixing up my style, and generally considering how I treat others better and people are significantly more attracted to me...  physically speaking.

I don't know how to handle this, as I still have zero confidence in myself.  Tonight I made-out with a member of my offices board of directors (the woman had over twenty years on me), and I'm just an intern, this happened at an office party.

Nearly everyone I work with saw this happen, and saw me leave with her.  I've gone the longest time feeling like I have to go for every girl I meet because I might not have another chance, but now it's affecting my professional life and I don't like it.  My friends congratulate me when this happens (wishing they were in my place) because they're all in committed relationships (ironically, I would much rather be in their position.)

I just don't know how to handle this, out of nowhere I can spark an interest in someone, but can't hold onto that interest for more than an evening.  I'm worried that the rest of my life is just going to be a string of shallow hookups without a single meaningful relationship, and that my own history of being rejected will fuel that.

I guess you could say I'm scared, I have a lot to work on when it comes to my personality, but almost majestically my physical appearance has improved.  I don't want to be an asshole who goes off with any girl he can, but at the same time I can't get over the idea that I wont meet anyone else for a long time.

I know a lot of people have the opposite problem, feeling that they are great in terms of personality but are disliked because of their physical appearance.  But I don't know where else to put this, I'm happy that people like how I look, but it really bothers me that I can't get anyone to like me for who I am.

(EDIT)  Also, while I'm at it, I was in love with a girl, and a week after I told her that she felt it appropriate to ask for advice about her having a threesome with her ex.  Not relevant to this post, but still something I've wanted to say to someone for a while, I'm glad she's out of my life, but I really miss feeling that way about someone, despite what she put me through."
1sp6rl,1,2013-12-12,"Sex Makes Me Feel Horrible and Wrong, Looking for Help/Advice (m22)",throwaway87964237,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1sp6rl/sex_makes_me_feel_horrible_and_wrong_looking_for/,"Throwaway here, and it's gonna be a bit of a long read. tl;dr at the bottom that sums up the problem without the back-story.

So I was raised by a very religious mother, whom I love to death, but she always taught me premarital sex was wrong. All I learned of sex from a very young age was how horrible it was and all the terrible consequences it could lead to. Because of all this I made the decision to wait until marriage to have sex. So extreme was my fear of sex that I didn't even masturbate until I was in college, and the first time was an accident (I did watch porn however). I also had a girlfriend in high school, but we never went beyond kissing. 

Then I got to college and picked up a girlfriend in the first 3 months. We were both waiting until marriage so it seemed perfect, but after about 5 months I decided I wanted to have sex with her, and she said she'd been having similar thoughts. We waited a week or two to make sure this was what we both wanted, and then had sex. As with most people's first time, it wasn't very good, neither of us finished, and there was a lot of blood. I didn't feel great, but I felt like I had overcome a personal demon of mine. We slept in the same bed that night, but the next day I had to go to an internship interview. While I was there, she began texting me telling me how horrible last night had been for her, how she cried all morning in the shower, how I wasn't very good, how it wasn't special, and how I had ruined her life. It felt horrible, like everything I had been told about sex was true. 

That night, when I got back, we talked. She had calmed down a bit from earlier and she had stopped blaming me quite so much for the whole thing. She even said that after she had given it some more thought, it was special in its own sort of way. She also decided she wanted to have sex again that night. I wasn't sure but I thought I was in love so I said okay. 

It was horrifying. In terms of performance she said she enjoyed it, but I hated it. I felt wrong and guilty. We continued to have fairly regular sex (~3 times a week) for the rest of our relationship (year and a half). During that entire time, I only enjoyed it a handful of times, and most of those times we had just done something really special together, such as spending all day at a Renaissance Faire. 

When we broke up, I felt an enormous sense of relief, which I now believe was tied to not having to have sex anymore. I recently entered into another relationship, and we started having sex fairly quickly. I had thought I didn't enjoy sex before because my ex was not very responsive and did little to no work, but with my new partner all my old feelings came back. The difference between the two, however, was my more recent gf realized something was up and asked me about it. She was very understanding, and we continued dating for about three months. 

However, I still think about sex all the time, and have a very high sex drive. It would get frustrating for the two of us when we would both get worked up, but if we even started oral, the feelings would come back, she would sense it, and it would be over. One good thing that came out of all of this was I discovered fingering does not make me feel bad at all, so we would mostly do that, but she would often feel inadequate that she could not reciprocate/help me. She told me this was the main reason we broke up.

And now I'm here. I'm still terrified of sex, but I have a really high sex drive, and while it's not ruining my life, it makes it next to impossible to pursue any kind of meaningful relationship. I've been reading this sub for about a month now, and seeing so many people who are open and this feels like a safe enough space to share my issue. So I'm reaching out to you guys, maybe one of you has had a similar experience, or know someone who has, and can give me some kind of advice. Thanks in advance.

tl;dr I don't enjoy sex or anything past kissing (with the exception of fingering) and it makes me feel horrible inside, but I still have a high desire to have sex. Any similar stories/experiences/general advice is appreciated."

I've been using Kratom regularly for 6 months now (yes I know it's a ""weak"" opioid blah blah blah). It worked wonders for my depression and anxiety, but it really just masked those those things. It didn't fix them. My supply ran out last night, and today I woke up with the most crippling anxiety and depression I've ever experienced. Much worse than before I started on the Kratom.

This was exacerbated by the fact that I hung out with a bunch of friends from high school last night, who are now very successful (we're all 23 or 24 - my age). I'm a little... behind them. I'm currently unemployed, and while I do have an internship lined up for spring, I'm definitely a late-bloomer when it comes to career. Anyways, the whole encounter just devastated me, and made me realize how ""far behind"" I am because of the drugs.

Today has been a hell. I had a couple ativan on hand, which helped a bit -- enough to calm me down enough to write this -- but I'm just done. Cannot go on like this. No more opiates."

I'm wanting to try to learn enough C# over break to be able to interview for a software developer internship where i work (they only program in C#).  Any recommendation for someone who already knows the basics of programming?
1stzsy,2,2013-12-13,IT -&gt; CS change,kevin305,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1stzsy/it_cs_change/,"I'm currently a senior with about a semester and half left before I graduate in IT. Recently, I've been extremely intrigued with the challenge of CS and software development. I have picked up some of the core books, and have begun to slowly read through them. The issue is, I will be graduating soon, and don't know what I should be doing for internships. I don't feel I have anywhere near enough knowledge to pass a CS interview atm, as my Prog I and II classes only covered data structures vaguely, and I do not have any real experience. In the next 3-5 months I will be spending 25-30+ hrs a week working on data structures, algorithms, side projects, and competing for my school, which should hopefully give me the experience I need, but by then i'll be nearing graduation. So my questions are essentially this:

1. Do I start applying for internships now, even though I don't feel comfortable in my ability to pass a CS interview?
2. Given 25-30 hours a week dedicated to theory &amp; programming development, how long might it take to reach a good level of competency? (I know this varies, just want a general number)
3. I aspire to work at Amazon, Microsoft etc. Is it feasible to have an in-person interview within a year? I'd be focusing heavily on the things they'd test on, and hopefully have an internship to help.
4. Currently I only have a pretty introductory understanding of two languages: Java and Python. Java because all my school projects have used it, and recently I have picked up Python since it is a good recommended language for beginners. The issue is, most big companies I've seen ask for Java/C/C++. Should I make Java my primary language from here on out?"

I just wanted to get /r/leagueoflegends thoughts on applying to the Riot Internship program.  I've been playing league since about when Lux came out, so I've been around quite a while.  I love League, it's been a great part of my life when I need to take a break or relax for a while.  I'm not very good at all for how long I've been playing (Silver V), but I really think it's a fantastic game and that Riot is an amazing company.  I saw the internship program a while ago and really wanted to apply, probably in the community area because I think I could bring a lot to that through my experience working as a resident assistant.

The thing is, I just received a job offer for this summer working for my university.  It's a really great position that would benefit me a ton, but I'm trying to weigh it against applying for riot.

So my question to you is: Would you accept the sure-fire position or reach out to apply for the internship?  I typed this out really quickly, so please just ask if you want more details.  

Hope you all have a great day :)"
1stqh6,9,2013-12-13,Stacy fucks me at the dance club,readeranon,ReaderAnonErotica,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReaderAnonErotica/comments/1stqh6/stacy_fucks_me_at_the_dance_club/,"As it happened, a short internship I had ended while Stacy's university was in session and I had a week to kill before I needed to be back. She invited me to stay with her.

It was a tad awkward as Stacy shared a room with another girl, but we made it work and Stacy was never the sort of girl to shy away from sex just because her roommate was trying to sleep in the other bed.

We were going out to a club the night of this story and while it wasn't normally my thing, Stacy promised that I would spend the night getting ground on by her and some of her friends.

DEAL!

Stacy was competitive by nature and was turned on by competition. She loved to win, but had started to understand by this point that she enjoyed losing to a man who she deemed worthy of besting her. A strange girl.

For our evening out I was in Jeans and a t-shirt. I wasn't much of a snazzy dresser then. Stacy put on a tight dress that let her cleavage pop (it looked like it was going to burst out) and the hem was so short that if she bent over at the waist (which she couldn't because then her boobs WOULD pop out) you could see her pussy. Stacy almost never wore panties.

As everyone began getting ready to go out, we were laughing and joking and began to play the penis game. For those not in the know, in the penis game, you take turns saying penis. Each person has to say it louder than the last until we were eventually, walking around the apartment complex screaming penis at the top of our lungs.

As we piled into the car, I was the only guy, this turned into something of an escalation game. I don't want to say it was truth or dare, because it wasn't. It was more like a game of perverse one ups man ship. Trading stories and eventually acts and trying to top the last person.

In the car it was mostly chatter. Someone talked about the time they sucked their boyfriend off while his parents were in the next room with the door open. To top that someone else said they had given a guy a blow job in school, in the boys locker room, during a school day and could hear guys changing near by. Stacy, told about fucking a guy in a public park (me) on a park table. She left out that it was fairly hidden. I decided to be a show off and told that I had fucked a girl in a park (stacy) and then gone to another girls house and gotten a blow job downstairs while her parents were awake upstairs.

I think you get the picture. The topic would change to something else and everyone would start trying to one up each other. I think the best story I heard that night, not involving myself or Stacy, was from Stacy's roommate who claimed to be actively sucking a teacher off for her grade. The one upping was on a topic regarding sex that made you feel gross.

Things escalated to dares. They were very tame at first. We were hitting the club and someone dared me to make a full of myself and try to get a girls number. I saw a pretty girl, dropped to my knees and begged Jesus to give me her phone number. I did not get it. Stacy dared a friend to grab the first cute guy they saw and kiss him. She did. There was a lot more along those lines. Go tell that guy you think he's hot. Go tell that girl that you aren't a dyke, but if you were you'd munch her pussy. 

We were on the dance floor and it slowed down a lot because the girls were busy dancing with each other, with me, with guys. Stacy's promise was kept and I indeed ground pretty hard on her and a few of her friends. I was the dude-meat in a cute girl sandwich by this point.

A few dares did pop up. A lot were along the lines of embarrassing dancing. Go dance with that ugly guy. Go grind up on that fat guys leg. Go dance with that guy for a bit and pretend to have an orgasm on him.

One of Stacy's friends had started to dance with a guy and they seemed into each other. Stacy dared her to start making out with him. A bit later the friend dared me to approach a girl for a threesome with Stacy and I (rejected!).

We moved off the dance floor and the four of us were sitting around on some chairs and talking. They were closer to dining chairs, just nice padded ones, which will be important soon.

Stacy and her friend kept escalating things.

Stacy to her friends random guy: I dare you to give her boobs a feel right in front of us. He looked at her friend who gave him a sort of flirty smile and nodded. He slid his hand into her dress gave them a squeeze and pulled back.

“Those are great,” he said, then turned to me, “Ok bud, your girl, I think you should give her a nice tit massage.”

Stacy didn't hesitate, leaned forward and I started to squeeze those lovely melons. 

Stacy's other friends came over at this point and joked around about what a slut Stacy was and she joked that they didn't even know half. Stacy got onto my lap at this point and was sort of dancing to the music, but more rubbing her ass into my dick, getting me hard and teasing me.

There were a few other dares thrown out. A few pairs of panties were thrown out onto the dance floor, a few boobs were flashed. Yes at this point a large amount of drinking had been going on.

One of the girls felt up the others dress, Stacy's friend rubbed the guy on his pants and then someone made a mistake.

Stacy's roommate, perhaps to get her back for all the sleep we were interrupting, decided to try and push Stacy into backing down. She should have known better.

“I bet you wouldn't fuck RD,” she said to Stacy.

“I fucked him last night and this morning,” Stacy said.

“No,” her roommate said, “Right there, right now.”

“I would have no issue with that,” Stacy said. I held my tongue, it was a little public for me.

They started arguing back and forth and one of Stacy's friends got up and said, “Eww, she's totally going to if you don't stop pushing her and I don't want to watch that.”

A few left but Stacy's roommate, who was probably drunk at this point, and her friend and the guy stayed, those two were pretty engrossed in making out with each other.

Stacy and her argued back and forth a few times and then she did it, reached under her, lifted up and before I knew it my zipper was down, she was fishing my cock out and sliding down onto it.

We were at a dance club. People were dancing nearby, a few people were clearly watching us and her friends were right there and Stacy just started to fuck me.

Now if you have seen people fucking in a dance club, you know its not obvious unless they make it so. It's pretty dark, flashing lights and everyone is grinding up on everyone. Only people very close could probably tell what was going on at first. BUT Stacy's skirt was so short that as she fucked me, it started riding up to her waist.

She was bouncing up and down my cock, I couldn't see it but she was making eyes at her roommate who after a few moments yelled something about Stacy being a slut and left. But Stacy didn't stop, she kept on fucking me. I saw a few people watching, staring, I started to worry that we might get in trouble, but Stacy didn't seem to care and either through my fear or who knows, I came very quickly.

When I finished, she didn't move, but smoothed her skirts down. A few people whistled over the music and Stacy's friends guy reached over to give me a high five. I was pretty embarrassed.

After a bit Stacy slid off me and I zipped myself back in.

We left soon after that. I didn't say anything, but when we got out of the car, I saw a wet spot under Stacy were I am pretty sure my semen leaked onto her friends cloth car seat.

He roommate passed out and we climbed into Stacy's bed and fucked again."

I am currently searching for a summer internship and need help with finding out who to talk to and how I can better my chances of getting an internship.
1stitz,0,2013-12-13,"Girlfriend and I split up for a year, we get back together and turns out she slept with 11 guys.",8c1,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1stitz/girlfriend_and_i_split_up_for_a_year_we_get_back/,"Girlfriend and I split up because I got an offer for a really good internship in California. Prior to this we were together for 2 years, and before me she slept with two other guys. Well recently my internship ended and I got a position close to where we live.

We instantly picked right back up and things were good. She asked me if I was if I was with anyone, and I told her that there was one girl that I was with that lived near me. She grilled me for a couple weeks about this, saying she was hurt etc. I ask her if she was with anyone she looked me dead in the eye and said no. 

Months go by, and well inconsistencies start popping up, mainly from her friends and her own stories. After confronting her turns out she was with 11 fucking guys after we split up. One guy in particular was a guy I never liked in her friend circle, that I always asked her to keep distance from. Turns out she slept with him too. 

Now I know we weren't ""together,"" but fact of the matter is she lied to me one. Second she became extremely promiscuous after the break up which I absolutely hate. I know some of you guys are fine dating former prostitutes/slutty girls, but I am not one of them. 

I never thought it would be in her character to sleep around like this, I thought she was different. If she was with one two even three guys fine. But 11? 

I have so much history with this girl, and I love her, but I am starting to question who she even is. I am thinking of breaking up with her, but if you guys have any reasoning why she might have became like this please share.

And if you have similar stories please share as well."
1std2o,3,2013-12-13,Please help me go to university.,[deleted],Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/1std2o/please_help_me_go_to_university/,"Hi guys, I’ve been reading reddit for a long time but never actually made any posts or even created an account. From reading reddit I’ve learned there’s a lot of generous people on here so at an attempt to achieve my dreams, I will post my story on here. 

The tl;dr version and the cause I am posting for can be found on here:  http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-me-go-to-university--18

For who is interested I will post the whole story on here, feel free to ask any questions you might have.

Some background information: My parents were never married, they separated when I was about 3 years old. I’ve lived with my mom up until 2 weeks ago and my father has been supporting me financially my whole life long. When I was 6-7 years old my mother told me I have a half-sister, she had her when she was too young and addicted to drugs and gave her up for adoption. After she told me we met up for the first time and saw each other every few months in the following years. I didn’t really think anything about my mother’s past, mainly because I was too young.

Fast forward a few years, I am 13 years old and in the best “high school” (starts at age 12-13 here) in town. My grades are good and I am enjoying my school-life. We were one of the first in the area to get internet, and we had always had a computer at home because of my mom’s job. I was spending a lot of time at the computer, which is why at the start I didn’t notice what was going on with my mom.

Around this time my mom would be drunk a lot, she would embarrass me in front of my friends by going outside in her pajamas, being loud and obnoxious and saying weird things. At some point she decided she couldn’t take care of me anymore and send me away to stay with some friends of ours. This happened twice. I thought the reason for her behavior was the fact that my half-sister got arrested for smuggling drugs to The UK and had to spend a few years in jail. 

Stuff got worse. My mom had a decent job, my dad was supporting us a lot at that time, but somehow we were always out of money. Sometimes there was no food left at home at all and my mom would go to shops to steal food, which resulted in her being banned from a lot of shops. I wasn’t able to go to school quite often because there was no money for transportation and my grades started dropping.

I remember my mom being “burned out” from work, taking time off and spending a lot of time in bed. At the beginning I didn’t know what to think of it, but then things started getting more suspicious. She would go to the mailbox or go check if we have mail, and stay out for 3 hours quite often. People would ring our doorbell for hours on end until my mom disabled the doorbell and we couldn’t hear it anymore. I started finding glasses with some weird liquid inside and tinfoil wrapped around it around the house. It smelled weird but I decided to ignore it. By this time I had a good idea of what was going on, but I never spoke to anyone about it, I didn’t want to make it real.

Sometimes when I’d get back from school, I would come into my room and stuff would be missing. My mom sold my guitar, PS2, camera and a few more things just to get more money for her addiction. If I ever had money myself, she would ask me to borrow 10 euro and promised me she’d double it. I didn’t want her to get angry so I’d agree. After years she told me she would go to Mac Donald’s to buy a burger, pay with 10 euro’s and when they gave her change she would say she paid with 20 or 50 euro’s. A lot of cashiers fell for that trick, until they started recognizing her at some stores.

One night I was dyeing my hair, I remember this night very well. My mom had just put the dye in my hair and I went upstairs to let it rest. Then she called me downstairs. She started crying and told me she had a problem with drugs and told me she called someone for help and that they were on their way over. They arrived really quickly, talked to my mom for about 5 minutes and then told me I had 10 minutes to pack because they were taking me away from home. I quickly went to rinse the dye out of my hair and packed whatever I could find in the few minutes I had left. I managed to get an SOS message on MSN out to a few of my friends, I couldn’t call or text anyone cause my phone was cut off cause the bill was never paid. 

I was brought to a crisis institution, the waiting lists for proper institutions are so long that that’s the only place they could place me. And I didn’t even get a permanent spot at first, for a few days I slept at different places until they found me a spot. By this time my mom went into rehab.

The time at the institution was terrible, it seems like they tried everything to make my live even more miserable over there. I dropped out of the school I loved and went to a different high school, with courses on a lower level, and I hated it there. Despite that I was really keeping my head up high. I didn’t need any help, I didn’t want to talk to anyone, I just wanted my mom to get better so we could start over.

My mom seemed to be recovering very quickly, after about 2 months the only thing keeping us from moving into a house again, was that we didn’t have a house. We never owned the house we used to live in, but the rent wasn’t paid for such a long time that we were evicted. I salvaged a few things that were at the house, but lost a lot more because everything that was in there got sold off and even memories like pictures were never recovered.

As soon as we found a house, everything started getting back to normal. I had forgiven my mom because I didn’t see the point in holding a grudge when all I wanted was just to get back to normal.
We were living a poor life because my mom didn’t have a job anymore, and we picked out furniture of the streets, nevertheless it was better than living in the institution.

Everything went well for a while, but then she started drinking again. I tried to make her stop on my own a lot of times, but then just stopped trying. I never spoke to any officials about this because I was too scared that I had to go back into an institution.

While we lived at this house I once again dropped out of school because we didn’t have money to let me go there and when I was able to go I was obviously really distracted. I decided to give up on high school and to start a vocational study in IT. I was doing really well until I got Pfeiffer’s disease not too long before I was about to graduate and I dropped out once again.

After living like this for a while our house was going to be demolished because it was quite old, we got a small amount of money to buy furniture and priority to find a new house. I saw this as an opportunity to address the problems between us once and for all and wanted to start over at our new house. 

Stuff went well for a while again, I started going to school again (I am not in the last year, I have one exam and a few months of internship to go to graduate) and was doing great there. Then it all went downhill again. I tried to fix it a few times again but I got so sick of being hurt and spending the time and effort to fix things while not being successful that I just started ignoring everything as much as I could. By this time I was in charge of the finances, because my mom did realize she wasn’t good with them. So we always had food and because I was now 18, I got free public transport and some financing to go to school. My mom was still trying to steal my money, and was sometimes succeeding at this, but I had most of it under control. We continued like this until 1.5 year ago.

Our house was going to get demolished again, for the same reason as it did last time. I thought this must be it for real. I told her I knew that she was still drinking, she denied it. I kept pushing and eventually she gave in. I was sure this time things would be different once we moved.
It was for a while, and then it wasn’t. I never mentioned anything again, and started looking for a different way to solve things. This resulted in me moving out 2 weeks ago.  

During these hard few years I met my fiancé on the internet while playing online games.  He is trying to get a job/education in the Netherlands right now and is sort of living with me, we are very happy together. 2 years ago we were invited to come to G-STAR in South-Korea. We were invited here because we were volunteering for a game called Archlord. This whole experience resulted in a passionate love for the country. All I want to do now is to study Korean at University, but because of all the hardships I’ve had I never graduated from high school so I don’t meet the requirements.

The good news is, the university has agreed to let me enroll if I complete 3 exams and 2 courses. The bad news is, I don’t have the money to pay for it and the deadline to pay for the exams is in January. I am in debt because of all the things I had to pay for and mandatory things I couldn’t pay during these past few years.

I’ve had a hard life but I managed to pull myself out of it, my life is almost complete except for this one thing. Not being able to go to uni would devastate me.

I’ve started a project on Indiegogo, and a few good friends from all over the world have donated. I am very grateful they have, but I have only 18 days left on this project and I’m not even close to reaching my goal. 

Please Reddit, if even one of you can find it in your hearts to help me out I don’t have to worry about how else to get the money together.

Fast forward a few years, I am 13 years old and in the best “high school” (starts at age 12-13 here) in town. My grades are good and I am enjoying my school-life. We were one of the first in the area to get internet, and we had always had a computer at home because of my mom’s job. I was spending a lot of time at the computer, which is why at the start I didn’t notice what was going on with my mom.

Around this time my mom would be drunk a lot, she would embarrass me in front of my friends by going outside in her pajamas, being loud and obnoxious and saying weird things. At some point she decided she couldn’t take care of me anymore and send me away to stay with some friends of ours. This happened twice. I thought the reason for her behavior was the fact that my half-sister got arrested for smuggling drugs to The UK and had to spend a few years in jail. 

Stuff got worse. My mom had a decent job, my dad was supporting us a lot at that time, but somehow we were always out of money. Sometimes there was no food left at home at all and my mom would go to shops to steal food, which resulted in her being banned from a lot of shops. I wasn’t able to go to school quite often because there was no money for transportation and my grades started dropping.

I remember my mom being “burned out” from work, taking time off and spending a lot of time in bed. At the beginning I didn’t know what to think of it, but then things started getting more suspicious. She would go to the mailbox or go check if we have mail, and stay out for 3 hours quite often. People would ring our doorbell for hours on end until my mom disabled the doorbell and we couldn’t hear it anymore. I started finding glasses with some weird liquid inside and tinfoil wrapped around it around the house. It smelled weird but I decided to ignore it. By this time I had a good idea of what was going on, but I never spoke to anyone about it, I didn’t want to make it real.

Sometimes when I’d get back from school, I would come into my room and stuff would be missing. My mom sold my guitar, PS2, camera and a few more things just to get more money for her addiction. If I ever had money myself, she would ask me to borrow 10 euro and promised me she’d double it. I didn’t want her to get angry so I’d agree. After years she told me she would go to Mac Donald’s to buy a burger, pay with 10 euro’s and when they gave her change she would say she paid with 20 or 50 euro’s. A lot of cashiers fell for that trick, until they started recognizing her at some stores.

One night I was dyeing my hair, I remember this night very well. My mom had just put the dye in my hair and I went upstairs to let it rest. Then she called me downstairs. She started crying and told me she had a problem with drugs and told me she called someone for help and that they were on their way over. They arrived really quickly, talked to my mom for about 5 minutes and then told me I had 10 minutes to pack because they were taking me away from home. I quickly went to rinse the dye out of my hair and packed whatever I could find in the few minutes I had left. I managed to get an SOS message on MSN out to a few of my friends, I couldn’t call or text anyone cause my phone was cut off cause the bill was never paid. 

I was brought to a crisis institution, the waiting lists for proper institutions are so long that that’s the only place they could place me. And I didn’t even get a permanent spot at first, for a few days I slept at different places until they found me a spot. By this time my mom went into rehab.

The time at the institution was terrible, it seems like they tried everything to make my live even more miserable over there. I dropped out of the school I loved and went to a different high school, with courses on a lower level, and I hated it there. Despite that I was really keeping my head up high. I didn’t need any help, I didn’t want to talk to anyone, I just wanted my mom to get better so we could start over.

My mom seemed to be recovering very quickly, after about 2 months the only thing keeping us from moving into a house again, was that we didn’t have a house. We never owned the house we used to live in, but the rent wasn’t paid for such a long time that we were evicted. I salvaged a few things that were at the house, but lost a lot more because everything that was in there got sold off and even memories like pictures were never recovered.

As soon as we found a house, everything started getting back to normal. I had forgiven my mom because I didn’t see the point in holding a grudge when all I wanted was just to get back to normal.
We were living a poor life because my mom didn’t have a job anymore, and we picked out furniture of the streets, nevertheless it was better than living in the institution.

Everything went well for a while, but then she started drinking again. I tried to make her stop on my own a lot of times, but then just stopped trying. I never spoke to any officials about this because I was too scared that I had to go back into an institution.

While we lived at this house I once again dropped out of school because we didn’t have money to let me go there and when I was able to go I was obviously really distracted. I decided to give up on high school and to start a vocational study in IT. I was doing really well until I got Pfeiffer’s disease not too long before I was about to graduate and I dropped out once again.

After living like this for a while our house was going to be demolished because it was quite old, we got a small amount of money to buy furniture and priority to find a new house. I saw this as an opportunity to address the problems between us once and for all and wanted to start over at our new house. 

Stuff went well for a while again, I started going to school again (I am not in the last year, I have one exam and a few months of internship to go to graduate) and was doing great there. Then it all went downhill again. I tried to fix it a few times again but I got so sick of being hurt and spending the time and effort to fix things while not being successful that I just started ignoring everything as much as I could. By this time I was in charge of the finances, because my mom did realize she wasn’t good with them. So we always had food and because I was now 18, I got free public transport and some financing to go to school. My mom was still trying to steal my money, and was sometimes succeeding at this, but I had most of it under control. We continued like this until 1.5 year ago.

Our house was going to get demolished again, for the same reason as it did last time. I thought this must be it for real. I told her I knew that she was still drinking, she denied it. I kept pushing and eventually she gave in. I was sure this time things would be different once we moved.
It was for a while, and then it wasn’t. I never mentioned anything again, and started looking for a different way to solve things. This resulted in me moving out 2 weeks ago.  

During these hard few years I met my fiancé on the internet while playing online games.  He is trying to get a job/education in the Netherlands right now and is sort of living with me, we are very happy together. 2 years ago we were invited to come to G-STAR in South-Korea. We were invited here because we were volunteering for a game called Archlord. This whole experience resulted in a passionate love for the country. All I want to do now is to study Korean at University, but because of all the hardships I’ve had I never graduated from high school so I don’t meet the requirements.

The good news is, the university has agreed to let me enroll if I complete 3 exams and 2 courses. The bad news is, I don’t have the money to pay for it and the deadline to pay for the exams is in January. I am in debt because of all the things I had to pay for and mandatory things I couldn’t pay during these past few years.

I’ve had a hard life but I managed to pull myself out of it, my life is almost complete except for this one thing. Not being able to go to uni would devastate me.

I’ve started a project on Indiegogo, and a few good friends from all over the world have donated. I am very grateful they have, but I have only 18 days left on this project and I’m not even close to reaching my goal. 

Please Reddit, if even one of you can find it in your hearts to help me out I don’t have to worry about how else to get the money together.

I just started working at a boutique creative marketing firm in Soho and next week I'll be negotiating my salary with my boss. We have some pretty high profile clients and they are doing well for themselves. I'll be the third person brought onto the team. The past two weeks I've been working intern hours and I'll be full-time at the start of the new year.

My supervisor told me it could be a range of $40K to possibly higher end $60K but I'm not negotiating that with him. He was just spitballing salary with me. 

I want to walk into this meeting next week as prepared as I can be to possibly up the $40k. I've never been on salary before and I wanted to calculate how much I'm losing tax wise because I live in the city. 

Right now my monthly expenses are $650 rent, $112 train (30-day unlimited), $75 utilities, and I'm pretty frugal with food. My parents will stop claiming me as a dependent after the new year so I'm going to be a proper adult soon. 

I'm happy with $40K and I'd like to start putting money in the bank so I can move to a nicer apartment this summer when my sublet ends. But I know NYC taxes are going to slay me. I want to negotiate a number that after taxes has me earning something at least close to $40K.

Any advice?"

I also find it very awkward to write a resumé without very much relevant work history, so any notes you can give me on it would be greatly appreciated.

I feel as though I can't express the main reason that I think I would be a good hire: I honestly *love* learning new programming related things. Whether it's a new design pattern, a new language, or a new framework. I am self motivated and a hard worker. I have a lot of projects that I've done in a variety of languages/frameworks, but I'm not sure which ones to highlight.

1sscb9,1,2013-12-13,Dropping out of uni for FTE after internship?,1stWorldThrowAway314,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1sscb9/dropping_out_of_uni_for_fte_after_internship/,"Hi, I recently accepted an offer for 2014 summer internship at a Big 4 tech firm (check my history to narrow it down if you're curious).  I'm in my third year of undergrad now, so obviously I'm hopeful I do well enough to be offered FTE.

I also hate academics.  I find my work boring, tedious, and pointless.  I have no motivation to do well, and most of my classes are in electrical engineering and thus unrelated to my future work.  I feel like I would learn just as much (and actually enjoy learning) working, while also being paid and not paying 30k/year for tuition.

I'm not quite Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerburg, but I'm curious about the possibility of dropping out to accept FTE immediately after the internship.

Specific questions:

1. Is this a good idea?  Would I limit my opportunities if I never complete my Bachelor's?  I would be forgoing my last year.  I can't help but think that 3 years of uni + 1 year of FTE must be equivalent or better than a Bachelor's.  I also realize that the most successful dropouts dropout because they need to focus on their work and can't miss an opportunity, not because they hate school as I do.
2. Do tech companies generally offer these kind of opportunities, and how rare is it?  I imagine the bigger, more corporate, and more conservative the company, the rarer it is.
3. Besides obviously performing well, how can I position myself for this?  Do I just ask if I can start FTE right away (obviously only if I am extended an offer at all)?
4. Would this affect any potential offer?  That is, would any offer be reduced in terms of compensation if I elect not to finish my degree?  I guess it would reduce my leverage while negotiating.  But the fact that I would be working for a year as opposed to paying tuition for a year already nets me a financial gain.

I'd appreciate any input at all, especially from anyone who's done this!  Thanks"
1ss7ty,1,2013-12-13,[31/m] She (26/f) ignores my kid and talks a lot about a new guy at her intership.,Ilikeher2013,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ss7ty/31m_she_26f_ignores_my_kid_and_talks_a_lot_about/,"Hi guys. I need some advice. 

Background: We have been together since August this year. We met at my work where she was an intern. It started as a booty call, but we quickly developed feelings for each other. 

I have four year old boy from a former marriage and she has a lot of mixed feelings about that. In the beginning she wouldn't even talk about it. She have seen my kid once, where I invited her to come play with Legos for a few hours. This was 2 months ago. She haven't seen him since and still tells me that she has issues with me having a kid. She is from a very conservative family and I think my past is a huge deal for her parents...

One month ago she told me she loves me and I told her that I love her too. We have just been on a very nice weekend trip out of town, and it went great. I felt some very strong feelings for her and she told me the same. 


The new guy a work: She is still an intern at my work just in another department. A new intern(B) started two months ago. B is at her age and a lead Singer in a semi famous band, he also works part time as a model. B's dad works at a company that my gf would really like to work with. My gf quickly added B on Facebook and Instagram. In the past week she liked one of his tour photos and he liked one of her photos from a bachelor party. 

In the first weeks after she met him she talked about him almost every day. She told me stuff like ""it's exciting to know someone semi famous"" and ""B did this and this at work today""

After listening to stories about B for a few weeks, I told that it would be nice to talk about something different than B. She apologized and stopped talking about him for a while. 

Recently she started telling stories from work again. She doesn't use his name( she says ""an intern at work""), but I know the stories are about him because she doesn't like the third intern at her department.


I really don't know what to do. We had a lot of difficult talks about my past in the start of our relationship. I think I could manage it if this was just about my kid, but her talking about the new guy at work makes me question her commitment...

I need to talk to her, but how do I do it without sounding jealous or being pushy about my kid?

1ss7fr,1,2013-12-13,“Asylum between the road trip.”,Raza-A,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ss7fr/asylum_between_the_road_trip/,"Raza.A

My name is Patrick and I was an internship student of a teaching hospital in California until I got a job opportunity in Harborview Medical centre in Seattle and I decided to take it. A Bunch of my friends, including my best friend Josh and his girlfriend Chelsea also got in that hospital and we decided to make a road trip out of it, you know to check out what we were getting into, we rented an RV, filled it up with all the essentials that we were going to need for an eighteen to twenty hours long drive and six of us me, Josh, Chelsea, Eric, Sabrina and the designated driver Ashley, she was 19, so she couldn’t drink and she is a good driver, so we brought her along too she’s Sabrina’s little sister. We started off late in the night maybe 2 or 3 AM, because we wanted it to be daytime when we reached the Klamath River so we could enjoy the freshness of the morning in the forest on the bank of the river. But I guess it was too much to ask for because turns out after 7 hours of driving we weren’t on the Cascade wonderland highway anymore but instead we were on the pacific highway, I was sleeping so I didn’t know when we crossed the state line and ended up in Oregon and Josh was busy with Chelsea and 27 years old Eric was busy hitting on Ashley and Sabrina was occupied with the dog that she shouldn’t have brought on the road trip but I guess it wouldn’t have made any difference even if she didn’t, it was my fault too, I shouldn’t have slept. When I woke up and after a while when I saw the road opening to the old highway I realized that we were on the pacific highway but there was no point in going all the way back so we decided that we should set up a rest camp over here between the intersection of the two highways. Sabrina wasn’t so sanguine about it she said that it reminds her too much about the wrong turn and that we should just keep moving until we hit a town, we all made fun of her and tried to scare her more but the truth is that I agreed with her, certainly not on the horror movie thing but on this place not being safe enough to rest here but we had no choice the RV’s engine needed sometime to cool down and so did we, besides it was not like a ghost town or anything because every now and then a car or an RV would pass by us and Josh was packing heat, his uncle’s hunting rifle, so overall it wasn’t that bad.

We set up a camp fire and started talking about different things like the friends that didn’t pass the exams, places that we would visit when we arrive in Seattle, about teaching hospitals and where we would buy a place to stay, things like that and out of nowhere Eric changes the topic altogether and starts talking about this 1800’s abandoned asylum in the Oregon forest and he starts telling his “folk tale” about this 80 years old deranged killer who would eat flesh out of his own body parts, every time different body part once a month and then he would wait a while for the flesh to reform and he would tear it out with his teeth and eat it again, he was committed there after killing his wife because she didn’t cook the deer right. He was found chewing on her face.

He was bound into straightjacket and a protective gear on his mouth just so he would stop eating himself and give up threatening others by showing his blood tainted, broken teeth and by making a petrifying roaring sound from the bottom of his larynx whenever they come into his room. Eric also said that when the asylum was being abandoned no one knew what happened to the old man they all assumed that he was left in his room because no one was gutsy enough to let him out and take him to the bus where all the other patients were.

No matter how juvenile his story sounds we were all a little bit startled, after all we were sitting outside the forest of Oregon.

Afternoon was ending and the evening was beginning, it was getting cold and dark, and the animals were awakened, so we started to head for our RV, Sabrina’s dog, Stella was getting a bit apprehensive. Now before I go any further you should know something about me and Sabrina, we use to date each other back in the college, actually it was more like four dates, nothing serious, I mean I guess it wasn’t because later I found out that while she was dating me she was sleeping with someone else, someone close to me, a friend. And she told me about him while *we* were making out, anyway I would’ve let that go if the guy was some stranger and not my friend but I can’t blame her for that because she wasn’t aware of that but he was, he knew about my relationship with her and how much I liked her, we are not friends anymore, not after I punched him in the guts. -After that I couldn’t date her anymore, I guess it was too much for my ego, we stayed friends, but that didn’t change the way I felt about her. Maybe that’s why when the dog, Stella leapt from her arms and ran into the forest and when we all decided to not go after her except Sabrina and Ashley, -and leave the dog because it was late and running off into the forest was just too much precarious, that’s when Sabrina looked at me with her deep blue eyes and said “Please”. Boy didn’t that make me change my mind. I also knew the story behind that dog, it might just be a dog for every one else but not for her because it was given to her by her mother on her sixteenth birthday, that dog was the last present she got from her mother, her mother died of a brain tumor, actually she died during her surgery.

So when she asked me to help her find the dog, I said “Let’s go find that dog”. I mean what could go wrong, right? -Running after a dog in the middle of the forest at night. It’s a beginning to the happy ending with half as population as before.

Josh wasn’t on-board with the idea, I don’t blame him neither was I but I don’t know why I was doing this anyway I did manage to get him on-board with the plan which involved me and Sabrina going into the forest alone but he said that he wouldn’t let us go alone in there with all the wild animals and I suggested that he gives us his rifle but he said, “No way you can’t shoot jack. I’m coming with you.” On which Chelsea also decided to join us and Ashley and Eric were going to stay at the RV.

We were following the same path on which we saw the dog running off to but she could’ve been anywhere by now after all the time we took deciding to go after her. Sabrina was calling out her name and Chelsea joined her upfront. Josh and I were behind them. “What the hell is wrong with you?” he whispered. “What?” I knew what but I still asked what. “Running after a dog in the middle of the evening, really? Hey if you wanna sleep with her go ahead but don’t get us all killed in the process.” Hey we’re not going to die you’re overreacting. We were just talking when we heard a familiar bark and then someone running it was Sabrina going after the sound of dog’s bark, we ran behind her for a while and then we stopped when she stopped, it was from here, she said. The barks stopped, we were very far out into the forest, and slowly we wouldn’t even be able to see anymore, the sunlight was fading away gradually, we again decided to give up, this time even Sabrina wasn’t this much enthusiastic about finding the dog anymore, we were just about to head back when we heard the barks again, this time from two different directions, it was not that uncommon for two dogs to be barking at the same time, Sabrina thought that she recognizes one of the dogs bark but we wanted to be on the safe side so we split up, Josh and Chelsea went after the other one he gave me his knife, just in case, he said. Finding our way back to the RV wouldn’t have been hard because we had our phone’s GPS synced with Eric’s phone. We were running in different direction and by my understanding they were running in different direction. Sabrina and I ended up at this very old building; it had fences around of it covering it but it had gaps in it which could be easily tackled by a dog. We entered the building; it was quite a big building we had to go through a barren yard to get in the building, there was a big, dry and thick tree in the yard, I don’t get scared that easily but I was and by the looks of it she was too but she didn’t want to go back without finding the dog because we could hear her inside the building. The building was very old; it seemed like it would crumble around us if we jump to hard. There was a reception just across an average size hall, it was a two floors building but we couldn’t go upstairs because the staircase was wrecked, it was quite easy to know that the dog wasn’t upstairs. Sabrina found a picture behind the reception desk other than a coffee mug, a journal, a 19th century telephone and a half piece of marble with “sylum” engraved on it, picture was old and was of this asylum, with some people standing in front of it, I couldn’t make out their faces. I guess we both were wasting our time here looking at these things because we didn’t want to exactly find out what was making all those noises in the back of building, we didn’t had much time so we started walking towards the hallway, “Secure unit” on a board that was hanging vertically from the ceiling. We didn’t bother to check the rooms that were either locked or the doors were closed, many rooms still had personal items in there, we were checking one of the rooms when Sabrina said, “You thinking the same thing I’m thinking?” “No. I’m thinking about you, are you thinking about you?” I said. She chuckled and said “No. I was thinking that this place might be the same place Eric was talking about.”, “It could be, it doesn’t matter even if it was, I mean it’s not like he could be alive all these years”. And she said, “I just want to find Stella and get out of here.” It might’ve been a peculiar timing but I asked her out in an Asylum, she said yes and then I said, “Great. Umm… just want to be sure if you’re not… with someone.” “What? Oh no… no I’m not.” We were just talking and checking the rooms when we heard a loud thump from beneath us, it was from the basement, we just skipped it because frankly I didn’t had guts to stare down the staircase into the obscurity, going in there was beyond my bravery. But now we didn’t had any other choice because we checked the whole first floor of the building, last time we heard the dog from inside the building, we knew that she was in here, the windows had bars on it so she couldn’t get out from there except from front door but we had that covered, we closed it behind us. Well, there was just one place left to look and it was the creepy, shadowy basement. The metal door into the basement was already opened so we got in and started walking down the stairs; I and Sabrina were using our phone’s LED screen light to see where we were walking. The stairs were made of rusted metal; it was creaking with every step. I was just hoping that it doesn’t break apart because I don’t think there was any other way out of there. It was very dark and it smelled of something very foul in there, our phone’s light wasn’t enough but it did the trick. It was a big basement, there was a long corridor with rooms on either sides and every room door was made of metal, there was another corridor but the door to it was locked. There was a reception there too but it had a lot of warning signs all around it. We started walking towards the end of the corridor from where we heard that thump, Sabrina was whispering Stella’s name. We must have only covered half of it when we heard a very stunning and deafening bang noise from upstairs, it sounded like two heavy metal objects striking together. I figured it was the basement door that we just passed through it must have been wind, because after staring a while at the basement stares waiting for something very strong coming down that basement stairs all hungry and growling was getting old, so we started moving again, she was terrified, I was scared too but my ego didn’t allow me to show it. As we were walking towards that place where it said “Medicine Room” from where that sound came from we heard something again this time it was from inside that place, we started taking our steps slowly towards that place, Sabrina stopped whispering Stella’s name, I had my one hand on the knife and my other in front of Sabrina, guarding her, that’s when we heard a scared familiar female voice, “Who is it? Don’t come any closer I have a gun, I will shoot.” It was Chelsea, she was very happy to see us; apparently she was scared because she too thought that something strong was coming down the stairs all hungry and growling towards her to eat her. Josh wasn’t with her, she said that he went to check the end of the corridor for some noise that he heard, and that he wanted her to stay there in case the dog comes out this way. We started walking towards the end of the corridor, checking every room from the outside, some were closed and some were opened, there was this one room that was closed and it said on the wall adjacent to the door “Do not open without proper authorization. Do not stare. Do not engage.” I looked inside and saw some blood on the wall and on the bed, I also saw some sort of a mouth protective gear, Eric’s folk tale was becoming more and more terrifying and not just to me. The door was unlocked, there was no lock on the door but we decided not to open it anyway. We reached the end of the corridor, only to find that two other corridors were sprouting out of that corridor but just as we were going to enter one of the corridors we heard someone running towards us from behind. Whatever or whoever it was we didn’t want to know but we looked behind and it was the dog, she startled us but she made Sabrina very happy and then there was my friend, Josh running towards us, I almost cracked a smile but then I saw that he wasn’t running alone there was someone else behind him, in fact he seemed to be running away from him, he was holding his shoulder and before he could shout run, I shouted “Run!” and it was after that one word that we all started running away into that undiscovered corridor, we were running very fast there was not enough light in the corridor, we couldn’t see where we were going, we were completely dependent on the dog and our luck, when she jumped we knew that something was in the way so we jumped. I could hear that thing coming after us although whoever or whatever it was, it was very slow but made a lot of roaring and growling sounds and then we reached a dead end, it was that close door that we encountered after entering the basement, it had a lock on it, which Chelsea shot with her rifle without wasting much time, we opened that door and ran up the stairs and closed the basement door behind us, that thing didn’t come up the stairs but we all could hear it down there. Josh was hurt, he said, “F*****g crazy old man. He bit me.” and then Chelsea said that we have to get out of here quick because there’s an another opening into the basement around the back of the building and he could come from there, so we ran outside and it was now dark we couldn’t see so we used the GPS tracker to get back to the RV, when we got there Eric and Ashley were making out, we ignored the vulgarity of the situation because we were preoccupied and yelled “Drive!” Ashley wanted to know more but Sabrina yelled at her and said “Just get us out here, now!” Ashley started driving towards Seattle again. Josh was bleeding but it wasn’t that bad, Chelsea was applying first aid when he said, “A**hole.” Yeah. I know, I said. “No I actually mean you.” He said. Chelsea wasn’t too happy with me or Sabrina, she didn’t say it but we knew. By the way, the dog was fine. Anyway, we got him to the hospital, had a bunch of blood tests, checking for rabies, poisoning, staph infection, hepatitis, Aids, T-virus (i.e. the zombie virus) etc. He was all good, even now he is married and has two kids perfectly healthy, although they do have some weird habits but I guess it’s normal for kids to occasionally *bite each other*.

1srz0y,5,2013-12-13,Monday will possibly decide my fate.,iwillalwaysderpyou,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1srz0y/monday_will_possibly_decide_my_fate/,"Warning:  This might be a tad long.  However, if you feel like hearing someone pull themselves up from the bottom, while contemplating the future, please read on.  Any words of wisdom go a long way too.

A bit of backstory here, I'm in my mid-20s.  My college career has been less than stellar.  A once 18 year old overachiever eventually dropped out of his EE program after two years of stress and financial burden.  My father lost his job, I worked full time with school (2.5 hour/day commute) and just realized I was wasting my time and money on something I couldn't give 110% into.

Don't get me wrong, I loved the field.  I just didn't have the time to dedicate to the demanding coursework.  Working 40+ hours/week and maintaining 12 credits was a rough way to go.  I was averaging 3-5 hours of sleep per night and at it 7 days per week.  After 2 years, I eventually just shut down and for sanity's sake decided my health was more important than grades.  On top of that, it was still difficult affording school.  Driving a SUV with gas @ $4.00/gallon didn't do much to help the matter.

I left the University and hit the local Community College to decompress for a bit.  While my father found a job after a few months, it wouldn't be until last year that family income was back to pre-recession levels.  I chose to take some electives in order to keep my Financial Aid/insurance.

I stumbled upon a professor teaching classes in Homeland Security.  I took it on a lark, although I have always been interested in such things.  As it turns out, I found out that the Comm College had a 70/30 agreement with another local University.  Most of my credits from the Engineering Program should transfer over as well.  Success.

In the mean time, I was spotted at my beer league hockey game by a coach of another University a few hours north.  He showed up to watch his son and asked me to skate for him.  Offered me a spot on their club team.  Unfortunately, I had to turn this down due to family obligations.

I've been chipping away at the required courses.  Taking a mix of online electives and on-campus coursework.  The online classes help me maintain my status for Financial Aid while boosting my GPA.  They're easy enough to where I can focus more on my core classes.

In the meantime, I scored a wonderful job with a local non-profit.  I started as a ""support"" worker and busted my ass for the past year.  Ended up becoming what is essentially a patient advocate in a local hospital.  Good pay, great retirement, 5+ weeks paid off per year (sick, vacation, personal, paid holidays) and insurance that costs me $0 out of pocket.  The best part is, this is in a growing field where I can make a name for myself.  I have a great management team behind me that wants nothing more than for me to succeed.  I'd love to make a career out of this place.  In the past year, I've paid off all my debt (outside a relatively small amount of student loans), gotten back into shape, been able to help out the family, and started putting money away for a Corvette or similar.  Hell, I almost bought a house until I realized I might want to relocate in the next few years.

On Monday, I am visiting the new University to begin my transfer paperwork.  After this semester, I will be transferring.  Unfortunately, it seems as though a great deal of my coursework from University 1 does not transfer to University 2.  However, it looks as though quite a bit transfers if the agreement would allow me to transfer credits from University 1 to the Community College and onto University 2.

If all goes well, I am done next spring and can begin grad school, as well as the rest of my life.  Work seems pretty flexible as far as working around any sort of internship I would have in the future.

On the flip side, there is another possibility.  If the credits do not transfer, I will most likely be attending another University.  They are about 4 hours north, and are arguably better as far as Public Safety programs go.  A lot of the classes they offer at an extension centre which is about an hour away.  

The worst possible case is that the extension centre does not offer the courses I need and I am forced to move 4 hours away.  I do have family in the area, and my sister even attends that University.  I have kept my second job and could most likely transfer to a store in the area, so would have a nominal income.  Hell, I could even possibly play college hockey if I felt up to it.

However, I'd hate to throw away such a good life I've begun to build for myself.  The only good part is I could eventually work my way back to a similar position in the future.  I'm fully prepared to do whatever I need to do in order to make this work.  In the grand scheme of things, it will be a lot easier than what I've dealt with before.  It would just a struggle, albeit temporarily.

At least I should have this all sorted out in the next few weeks.  I have held off all major purchases (non-beater car, house), sold my other ""sporty"" car, stopped going out, etc. until April.  The Government contract I currently work under is up for renewal then, and I decided it would be best to be thrifty until everything is 110%

**tl;dr - Hit bottom.  Worked my ass off.  Might have to throw it all away.**"
1srul0,2,2013-12-12,[Help] Physical reactions to Anxiety,rh29,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1srul0/help_physical_reactions_to_anxiety/,"I have always had anxiety and depression, but until a few years ago I always felt like it was normal for everyone to feel like that. I have since been developing worsening symptoms. I'm in my last year of college, and my internship at a dream company isn't going to pan out into a full-time job (I am still pretty devastated), and I'm worried that my anxiety is a cause of that, since I am very socially awkward and increasingly self-aware to the point of being robotic or sometimes timid. I am a very career-focused person and think that my anxiety going to be my #1 obstacle in achieving my goals.

I tried to get treated for my depression once, and it was a terrible experience so I stopped. However, anxiety seems to be ruling me more than ever, much more than depression ever has. I am beginning to get physical manifestations. I had ringing in my ears for about two days that made me unable to sleep and drove me to a very manic place. I have also had terrifying visual hallucinations, which occur when I am feeling most stressed. I also bite my nails until they bleed when I am anxious, which is all of the time (I understand that this is more ""normal"" for people with anxiety). The thing I'm worried about the most is the visual hallucinations. They are terrifying. I make a point to write about them after they happen, and even draw them, as a reference if need be.

I guess my question is, does anyone else get these physical reactions to their anxiety? I have tried to do research, but haven't found anything informative. I would also like to add that I'm going in soon to begin treatment again, since things are beginning to get worse.

I currently have two internship offers for this summer and I need to decide which one to choose by tomorrow. Both are software engineering internships, and one is in San Diego for Viasat and another in Lawrenceville, GA for Cisco. I am having a hard time deciding between the two because I really don't want to live in Lawrenceville, however I am afraid working for Viasat won't look as good on my resume. I guess I am asking if it will be detrimental when applying for full time jobs if I have experience at a lesser known company such as Viasat as opposed to Cisco."
1srr6i,6,2013-12-12,Marketing/Entrepreneurship student from Denmark looking for internship abroad,CheGites,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1srr6i/marketingentrepreneurship_student_from_denmark/,"Hi Reddit,
Now wouldn't it be awesome if, i met just the people that i am looking for, here.
I live in Denmark. To those of you not familiar with Europe, its the small thing under Sweden. Remember, we are the “happiest” people in the world?

Well, we also have a lot of pretty good schools, and am enrolled at CPH Business (cphbusiness.dk) where i study Marketing Management and Entrepreneurship as an elective. Let me be honest, i really thought that entrepreneurship would be awesome, but i quickly found out, that my teacher didn't  understand my papers. 
First paper i wrote was a concept i called “BackMine”. Is was basically a background miner that large websites, such as large newspaper sites, would use on their website, so every visitor used a percentage of their computer power to mine crypto-coins, for the website. The idea was to find an alternative to ads.

Needles so say, my grades probably reflect the school system more than my actual entrepreneurial skills.

In January we have a mandatory 3-4 month internship, and i have already settled with a company that i already work with, but its just a time killer. Nothing challenging or fun. 

As Bitcoin has developed and surged to the (i want to say moon), the concept has grown even more majestic to me. I am a true believer in Bitcoin and the ways it can change the world, and i want to be a part of it. 

The Danish school system is pretty awesome, and my school actually allows me to accept an internship in basically any country. This make the range huge, right? Well, no. Not really anyway. See, all of the offers that i am able to find, with my current education, are all, so to say, extremely boring. And i really do believe in something greater than working in a marketing department of a pet food store-chain.
The company that i have accepted an internship with expect me to start in January, but if i am able to find a place where i can be of more use, it wont be a problem for them. I still have other stuff i do with them, and there wont be any hard feelings. (I will have to confirm with my school that the change is actually alright, but lets se how far this goes :) 
Its not that important if the internship is paid, however it can be, if you want. Personally i will also accept BTC. What is more important is that i believe in the company and the concept that they want to promote. I want to be a part of a team of motivated and brilliant people.  
Im pretty awesome at selling stuff. I am, what some would call, a nerd. I love computers, tech, gadgets etc. I enjoy being active, not in a sense of sports, but working on something, and always keep a goal I have several apps and projects that i am working on, and i like keeping a lot of balls in the air. And often, i can joggle them quite good. What ellse. Oh yeah, i own a record label and i have been a rapper for 7 years. Good at sound engineering/edit/mix. Got pretty big with a song called “Gag Gag” a few years back. Pretty disturbing song.. 

Allright, this is by far the most weird application i have written so far. 

Hope to hear back.

The past summer I learned about programming through a Coursera course I took and I loved it ever since. I have been reading this subreddit for a while and am now trying to get into my school's CS department, it requires 4 math classes and a 2.5 cumulative GPA. I'm doing the math courses now and I'm sure I'll be able to get my GPA to 2.5+ in order to get in, but not much more (probably 2.5-6).


I currently have a 2.43 GPA with 48 credits at a Canadian University, the CS program will be about 72 credits (2 more years) for a total of 120 credits for the BS. After using some GPA calculators, it seems like the GPA won't go up significantly unless I get all A+'s, which is ideal but probably unrealistic. And internships, I won't get any?! How do I fix this? I can't transfer because I go to the only English university in my city. Is it worth it to change cities or is that overreacting? I have dreams of interning at Facebook or Google.


**TL;DR: I have a 2.4 GPA half way into my degree, will probably graduate not too far away from that. What do I do?**

1swcug,12,2013-12-14,Picking industry preference group for Big 4 internship,throwawaybig4,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1swcug/picking_industry_preference_group_for_big_4/,"Greetings /r/Accounting 

I was hoping to get some opinions/guidance on picking an client/industry preference for my upcoming Big 4 internship in the summer. I've been asked to rank 4 groups on a scale of 1-3, 1 being my most preferred.

My issue is, I don't really have much of a preference as to a type of industry I would enjoy. One of the listings in one of the groups (media, telecom, utilities) does sound better than others, but the other listings in that group (pharmacy and health care) do not. So I'm thinking about picking a preference based on other things, such as probable hours, exit opps (I guess this is pretty much just you typically exit to your industry group?) and probable commute.

To elaborate on the ""commute"" part, I will be in a major city in the US, a place where having a car and driving would be sort of a nuisance. I am required to have access to a car, but not actually *have* one, so I'd like to be able to have a client with a higher likelihood of being sort of downtown so I don't have to actually own a car, as opposed to outside the actual city where not having a car may be a nuisance more than having one.

So, without further adieu, the list of client group choices are as follows

* Private Company Services - all industries, private companies only (I don't know anything about this, haven't really met anyone in PCS)

* Retail &amp; consumer/industrial products, automotive (this seems most likely to be in the suburbs or outside the city)

*  Financial Services - insurance, banking, investment management, real estate (seems most likely to be in the city, but I heard the hours are worse compared to other groups, and the work is more narrow, less learning experience)

* Pharma, healthcare, telecom, media, utilities

So basically, what would you guys choose based off of these, for a preference scale from 1-3, keeping mostly in mind likelihood of insane hours (i.e. 80-100 vs 60-80), learning experiences/exit opp broadness, and a commute if living in a major city. Also feel free to chime in with any other advice for picking certain industries. 

Thanks in advance for the help!"

Nonnoob,agreathobo,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1swbkb/profitability_questions_nonnoob/,"Okay, I am pretty well versed in Bitcoins for my age, a sophmore. I have a wallet and I mine with my CPU/GPU with Slush's pool just for fun. As of now I have about $0.01 in Bitcoin. Yipee. The economical manager for my city came to speak to all the business and entrepreneur classes at my school. When I saw he was starting his presentation with a talk on Bitcoins I struck up a conversation with him and he was impressed that I was the only one the whole day that knew what Bitcoins were and I landed an internship interview with his office. I like Bitcoin. But I would like to make money with it. I have a debit card with $38 on it. The price of Bitcoin is flucuating quite a bit, dropping near mid $800 and rising to mid $900. So could I in theory buy $20 worth of Bitcoin, when say the price in $898, wait for it to peak, say $950, then sell or exchange back into cash? On paper it sounds pretty solid, I can afford to lose $20. But I haven't heard of anyone doing this. It sounds just like stocks, buy low, sell high. But I feel there's a reason no one is doing it. What are your thoughts and opinions on it? Am I overlooking something crucial?"
1sw6y2,381,2013-12-14,Cutting,SaidIToMyself,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1sw6y2/cutting/,"All I can see is blood. Every time I close my damn eyes there’s blood. Every time there’s silence, instead of tinnitus I hear screams. I haven’t slept in… Fuck, when was the last time I slept? I don’t remember eating any time recently either…

“Now that you’ve seen what you’ve done, what you’re capable of doing again…” He lowered the scarf wrapped around his face to reveal a mouth that had been stitched closed. “Won’t you come use your powers for…” His words were in my mind. “The Greater Good?”

No, no, this requires some context. My name is Nathan Marlow, surgeon, amnesiac, butcher. This is the story of my conscription into a war you can’t see.

Five years ago I woke up in my hospital with retrograde amnesia. I’d vanished after the last shift of my internship, right after I learned I’d made surgeon, right after Bethany said she was leaving, and reappeared almost exactly a year later. At the time I couldn’t recall a single second of my time away.

They offered me my position back, being first in my class out of med school and having a perfect record as an intern, and of course I graciously accepted. I enrolled myself in therapy but the best trained psychologists I could meet with couldn’t rouse anything from the depths of my mind. Before long had passed, I simply accepted I wouldn’t figure it out.

I’d probably spent the better part of the year drunk or on one type of binge or another. By my figuring, it was probably better that I didn’t remember. I had no idea how right I was. With no family to speak of, no one investigated too hard after I was declared dead. I’d never made friends in school, being a gunner and a rank climber, except Bethany. No one missed me, especially not Bethany.

I tried to call call her, email her, visit her house, but it was like she had been wiped from the map. Her parents and friends never returned any of my calls either. Total communication embargo, but I was oddly okay with it. I was alone, but I was also handsome and athletic, the top ranked surgeon in a prestigious hospital, and used to it. Alone was how I operated best. I just made a pun, that’s almost more grating than the screams…

All of that being said I did actually enjoy the company of others, especially pretty, young women of loose moral fiber. Outside of surgery I could usually be found at one of the trendy bars or clubs in the city. Inheritance covering the cost of my schooling and investments covering the cost of my living left me with plenty of money to float people’s ways in the form of drinks. This meant that if I wanted company for the evening, I could usually secure at least a lengthy conversation if not more.

It was everything I could’ve wanted out of life. Or at least that’s what I told myself. It was every man’s dream, right? I was set to coast through until I had the clout to secure a mansion, a trophy wife, and a retirement in the south of Italy.

And then I met The Shaman.

The last day of my life as I knew it started out like the hundreds before it. I untangled myself from my sheets and stumbled across the room to shut off the alarm. The girl in my bed, I can’t even pretend to remember her name at this point, rose naked and disheveled. I told her I had to go to the hospital and my dockett would have me there till the evening. She was welcome to use all of my house until then. I think I really liked her? Back when things like that mattered.

What followed was a long ass commute, three short surgeries, lunch, a run, a transplant, and paperwork. More paperwork than I ever imagined myself doing back when I had stars in my eyes as a boy. It was entirely tolerable but it’s funny how romantic ideas die when the weight of reality begins to push down.

When I finished up as much work as I felt like finishing I took a long hot shower in the hospital locker room. I scrubbed my hands three times then took another shower. It was a habit that had cropped up post amnesiatic episode. My therapist had suggested any number of theories, but the simple truth of the matter was that I never really felt clean unless I took two to three showers. The fixation on cleanliness had served me well as a surgeon. I was sure to never be a source of infection.

When I entered the hospital that morning the sky had been overcast but the roads had been clear. Leaving met me with a snowstorm and clogged up public transport. It looked like walking would be my best, fastest option, even if it wasn’t the warmest. Trying to look on the bright side of things, it meant that I could swing by a bar for a drink.

I had no faith that the girl had stuck around. She never answered my attempts to contact her. I could take the message and, as I said before, I was used to it. On to the next great adventure and all that romantic shit. None of normal watering holes sounded good to me as I passed them. Instead I ended up at a hole in the wall I’d never even think of entering if it weren’t so damn cold out.

“Whiskey sour please,” I said to the bartender, dropping onto a stool. “Top shelf whiskey if you can swing it.” He looked at me, not in the normal way, but harder. I could feel the look like a ray of light off a heating lamp. I wondered if I’d somehow offended him. Sure, some would consider a whiskey sour a non-manly drink, but I couldn’t fathom it eliciting such a stern reaction. It hardened into frustration with an edge of anger but a ten dollar bill waved his direction sent him on his way.

The man poured the drink and the look on his face evaporated as he graciously accepted the large tip I left on the lacquered wood. This was the kind of place that catered to a hardcore group of regulars, I assumed, the jeans and t-shirt crowd. I wrote it off as a reaction to a soggy man in a suit tripping through his door. After a long sip, I turned to scope out the other people at the pub.

A few men were playing pool. A woman watched from where she leaned against the wall calling the game against the winner. Only about a quarter of the booths were taken up, all of those that were looked to be filled with close-knit friends. The others at the bar all had their own conversations going on that I didn’t feel like interrupting. 

Normally I would’ve been out of there after my drink, but I stayed. Why didn’t I just leave? I’ve agonized over the question, but the only answer I’ve been able to believe in is that it was because The Shaman didn’t want me to.

Instead of high tailing it, I picked out a booth in the middle of an empty series of three. After I got settled, shucked my coat, and taken another drink, I checked my phone. No new messages. Those that I’d sent to the girl were still unread. There weren’t even any messages from the other surgeons at the hospital. Normally at least some of them talked to me, it was as close to friendships as I had.

A server brought me another drink that apparently had been paid for by the girl by the pool table after I finished my first. I raised my glass in salute after catching her eye. It wasn’t a rare occurrence, having a drink bought for me, but normally it was just a pretense for reciprocation. Those that did normally let me buy them drinks for the rest of the night. But the waitress told me this girl didn’t drink. Sure enough she’d come sit down when her game was over. And sure enough I was right, eventually she did come over but she was joined by another person. He was a man in a long grey coat, draped with no less than three scarves not counting the one wrapped around the lower half of his face. He had vivid green eyes and a mop of wavy black hair that fell to his shoulders.

The woman was a small blonde who wore a scarf like the man’s wrapped loosely about her shoulders. The two of them looked at me expectantly for a minute after sitting down before she broke the silence. “Enjoying your drink? I had you pegged for a whiskey drinker the moment you came through the door. We don’t get many of your type around here. You look monied. What kind of car do you drive? Apartment of house in the suburbs? Sorry if Barry the barkeep gave you a hard time, he’s really a big ol’ teddy-”

“Serenity, please.” The girl had been talking at a mile a minute before the man had interrupted. “My associate is excitable. And also apparently rude as I believe she neglected to ask your name. Please excuse her transgression.”

“I’m Nathan,” I said, “but my friends call me Nate.” Why had I said that? I had not friends and no one had called me Nate since Bethany. “Actually, Nathan if you would.”

“You don’t have any friends,” I heard Serenity say. Well, I thought I heard her say it. Her lips hadn’t moved. I dismissed it as a product of stress and anxiety.

“Hello Nathan,” he said slowly. Each syllable was cool and calm and… Almost musical. It was the kind of voice that would hush a room without rising above a whisper. “You’ve already had an introduction to Serenity and her proclivity for speaking much more and faster than is wise. Then again, I cannot fault her as I quite enjoy conversing as well. But that is a matter for discussion later. As for the matter at hand, you may call me The Shaman.”

The way he said it, casual, part of his rolling speech. I didn’t question it. “It’s nice to meet you, Shaman, Serenity. Thank you for the drink, it’s actually really good.”

“What do you mean by actually? Expecting less than quality?” There was a hint of incredulity in Serenity’s voice. “Believe me our bar has the best damn spirits in the city. Much better than Rez or Green Street, I see to that myself. My bar-”

“Serenity…” There was something cold in the way The Shaman interrupted her this time. “I’m sure our companion here did not mean to disparage your choice of liquor. Simple misspeak, that’s all it was, am I correct?”

“Yeah, all I meant is that it’s delicious.” Each word I said was cautious. “It tastes like the mix is homemade.”

“It’s nice of you to notice, I’m sorry for flying off the handle,” she said looking down at the table. “Why you?” but her mouth didn’t move for the last part. I ignored it again.

“How about I buy you a tumble of my choice of libation as an apology for our combined verbosity?” he asked. “This conversation must be dreadfully droll for you.”

“It’s not,” I assured him, “and I’d love to try it. What is it?”

“Where is your sense of surprise?” He laughed. “I will tell you after you’ve had a sip.”

I agreed with a certain amount of discomfort and suspicion as he signaled the server. She must have been keeping her eyes on us seeing as she bustled right over. The Shaman made a short sharp gesture then showed three fingers. She understood and was back moments later with three glasses of purple liquor. She passed them out to the three of us and walked away without a word.

“To an end to this god awful snow. And Barry the barkeep,” Serenity said raising her glass.

“To holiday remembrances,” The Shaman said following suit.

“To new found friends,” I said, completing the cheer before lowering the glass to my lips and sipping…

Blood. Blood and screaming and men in shadows. It’s on my hands as I operate. The patient is asleep but I can still hear her as I cut. A scalpel snaps but another is in my hand the moment I raise it. The shadowed men converse as I stand at attention. The patient is next to me, spine ramrod straight, eyes dull. When prompted, I taze her. I tazer her a second time. A third time. Never flinching, never recoiling, never moving. She is a perfect success. Subject 1.

The patients thrash in their beds, waiting to go under my knife. The nurses anesthetize them one by one. I cut and cut and cut. My hands covered in blood. The walls echo. One after another, no time to even wash my hands before moving on to the next. Days without eating, nights without sleeping. Just cutting away. Cutting away.

The survivors stand in lines, face to face listless eyes meeting listless eyes. A nurse blows a whistle. They tear each other apart by hand until exactly half are left. I stitch up the survivors, the winners, before returning to my O.R. Before returning to the blood and screaming. They file out wordlessly. None of them ever speak after I’m done operating. None except the first. The Hollows aren’t supposed to speak. It’s why I take their tongues.

Alarms. The alarms go off and I’m wrist deep in an experimental project. Cutting for fun, he’s long dead. Thought maybe I could put it back but I never finish. Gunshots and more alarms. I run. Blood drips from my hands behind me. Outside is hell. A battalion of Hollows are fighting the Others. I’ve never cut an Other. I want to know what makes them Other. My scalpel hand twitches with excitement. Maybe I can fix them?

The shadowed men converse. I stand. Subject 1 waits in the shadows. Three scalpels are hidden up my sleeve. I can’t kill them all. They say the word. Subject 1 leads me out. In the hallway we struggle. My blades meet her face. Her blood is on me. She locks me in submission, The world goes black. My eyes blink open to the harsh lights of the hospital, remembering nothing.

“What the flying fuck was that?” I found myself back in the bar, not even a minute had passed. The two looked at me, Serenity smiling widely, The Shaman with his hands folded around his empty glass. “What did you bastards dose me with? Fucking fuck. Why the hell are you smiling bitch?”

“Dear Serenity, it appears as though our guest’s side effect is using curse words,” The Shaman said evenly. “How interesting.”

“Was it some kind of shitty acid? Why the hell did I see all of that?”

“It’s called InnerEye. The Shaman distills it for all of the Others and it’s nothing like what you were thinking. It awakens dormant powers in those with the potential though in your case it made you remember yours.” Serenity chattered and sipped at her glass. “The weird thing is, it affects the way we speak. You’re swearing more than we’ve ever seen you swear. The Shaman is like walking thesaurus vomit and obviously I can’t shut up until someone interrupts me or-”

“Shut the hell up,” I bellow at her. “Fuck that nightmare, fuck InnerEye, and fuck you two.”

“Calm yourself Nathan,” The Shaman raised a hand. “You would have had the recollection eventually. Sins like yours do not merely vanish, we just helped you to remember your black year. You can thank us by saying yes to my proposal.”

“Why would I do anything either of you two…” I catch myself before I swear again. “Why would I thank you?”

“You operated on people’s souls, more specifically you paired them away until the vessels that used to contain them were husks.” The Shaman tapped his glass and the waitress took it away. “The Convocation used you to create soldiers until you failed them, then they eradicated your year in their service and abandoned you without your remarkable talent.”

“We want you to work with us. Of course it wouldn’t be anything as nasty as pulling souls out of people. InnerEye can only awaken what’s already there, it doesn’t instil any type of gift. That’s where you come in. We want you to graft Potential onto people’s souls so we can bring them in with the InnerEye and fight the convocation. So basically the exact opposite of what you were doing with them-”

“Now that you’ve seen what you’ve done, what you’re capable of doing again…” He lowered the scarf wrapped around his face to reveal a mouth that had been stitched closed. “Won’t you come use your powers for…” His words were in my mind. “The Greater Good?” I ran away. As I left a terrible laugh, boiling and cackling, cracking and breaking, erupted from The Shaman’s mind. “Don’t you remember me?” His voice followed me outside. “Your experiment? Your pet project? Your failure?” I ran down the street as fast as I could. “You can repeat the process.” I packed a bag back at my house. “My blood on your hands, that’s why you bathe so much and scrub so hard. You still feel it.” I got into my car and started driving. “You’ll be back.” I left the city limits at 90 mph. “Your hands are aching to cut a soul again.”

I’ve been living in hotels ever since. I can feel people’s souls when I draw near. Everyone except for Convocation agents, they’re all flat or hollow, warded or scooped out. The Others are keeping eyes on me too, their souls are too big for their bodies. They’re both following me from town to town, but neither side is making a move. I don’t sleep, I don’t eat, and I don’t know what to do…

The Convocation would erase it all and hide me again.

The Others would use me to fight the abominations I created.

Either side would take me in.

Maybe, for the things I’ve done, I should kill myself..."
1sw4f5,0,2013-12-14,Questioning a lot of things in my roller-coaster of a life.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1sw4f5/questioning_a_lot_of_things_in_my_rollercoaster/,"I graduated about a year ago with a Bachelor's degree. Things were going well after a big internship recently. I then moved in with a girlfriend who's now in grad school. Everything was good until recently when my client for a freelance job (making a pretty good amount of money) stopped giving me work. I've also been working a crappy hourly job, but got a two interviews both making good money and with big companies with room for moving up. 

The worst - I was driving my car down a highway when it began smoking and eventually caught on fire. I got out before any possible injuries, but I literally watched the car go up in flames. 

So - the two big jobs I got interviews for will be a crazy commute via public transportation. Getting another car wont be as easy, because I've become independent from my family like paying for my education and living since high school. 

I've worked hard getting an education (the first in my family), but I'm seriously questioning the value of the degree. I've done public transportation and walking to work, so it's not really a matter of being embarrassed. It's just that I'm having a lot of problems seeing any self-worth when I've worked so hard. I've had some of these self-esteem issues throughout my life, but it's become a very big issue. "
1svx47,7,2013-12-14,My brother is getting paid less than minimum wage by a PC repair shop. He is not motivated to do anything about it. Should I report them?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1svx47/my_brother_is_getting_paid_less_than_minimum_wage/,"My brother is a good guy, but he doesn't have great self-esteem and he isn't good at sticking up for himself. He's 22 and making less than minimum wage (we are in the U.S.) for his job. This is not an internship.

I believe he works between 30-40 hrs/week. I asked him if he'd like me to speak up for him, but he said that he'd rather I not. As a concerned citizen (and not just his brother), I think that the guy who runs the joint is a douche and a law-breaker. My brother says that it's good experience for him, which is fine, but the law is the law (and my bro brings in a good amount of revenue with his tech skills).

Should I just not intervene? I know my bro has to fight his own battles, but I hate seeing an employer take advantage of him (and his co-workers, who are no-doubt being underpayed as well)."
1svpse,8,2013-12-14,Trying to get out to the west coast: Take a Midwest detour or move there directly?,sll_r0_r0_0,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1svpse/trying_to_get_out_to_the_west_coast_take_a/,"Well, first a little about me. I'm an ECE student graduating next semester, I have mid-range GPA from a public university in Florida, no impressive internships but some relevant work experience for the last year or so. Right now, I have a strong desire to find a job in Silicon Valley or Seattle, which I feel would start my career off on the right foot.

I currently have two offers:

One offer is from a company based in a pleasant Midwestern city, developing healthcare software. I like a lot of things about this job: the campus is nice, they allow a lot of independence, the pay is very generous, and I've negotiated the terms to ensure I'll be doing something that interests me and will be marketable in the future. I've heard companies like Amazon and Microsoft recruit some employees here, so it's not what I consider a dead-end job by any means. However, I don't see myself living in the Midwest forever, so I view this job as a sort of detour to prove myself before moving on.

The other offer is from Cisco, at the San Jose, CA location as a software engineer. I don't like the work as much and there seems to be a lot of middle management. Pay isn't a big deal for me (I won't leave a student mindset for a while) but when factoring in the cost of living it's a good deal less. To be honest, I'm not as enthusiastic about this offer, but I feel like it will give me way more opportunities and I could move on in a year anyways. Having a Cisco reference couldn't be bad for my career, and since I want to get involved in the startup scene this seems like the most logical option, if the less fun one.

I'm concerned that the year or two working out in the Midwest will delay my career by too much and then I'll be playing catch-up. On the other hand, I want to be doing something I enjoy. On the other other hand, I could probably force myself to do a year of work at Cisco if it means it will be way more beneficial.

Any thoughts?"
1svk6j,13,2013-12-14,Not a productive year...,SuperRicktastic,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1svk6j/not_a_productive_year/,"So, I fell off the wagon in a hard way, and ended *gaining* 5 pounds from my start weight. Suffice to say, things have not gone according to plan. I'm pretty sure it's been a combination of school stress, the end of a relationship, and moving back home for an internship. While in the end the sum of the blame is on my lack of action, those factors definitely played a role. 

The stress and the end of a long relationship was definitely a blow to my motivation, and moving back home for my internship... well it's a tad hard to diet when you lose control of what food is stocked in the house. 

I'm not giving up though, I'll be re-registering for next year, and with a little more independence and a more stable relationship will benefit things. I know I've got some changes to make, hopefully next year will be better."

1sva0s,7,2013-12-14,Wanting to build a portfolio for an upcoming career fair. What should be in it and why?,The_Alex_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1sva0s/wanting_to_build_a_portfolio_for_an_upcoming/,"Hey all. So my University has a career fair every semester and I'm wanting to get an internship to not only get some valuable real-world work experience, but also build my resume. I personally feel as though that when it comes to programming and coding, a resume says nothing about my code, what it looks like, and how efficient it is, especially since I do not have any work experience related to coding, nor any accolades other than my grades.

That being said, I feel a portfolio of my projects is the way to go to impress potential employers. My only questions is : What should I put in my portfolio?

I can code extremely well in C++, and have decent experience in Java, JavaScript, and Python. My computer science knowledge encompasses past intro courses to basic data structures. Of course, I don't mind taking on projects above this knowledge range ; everyone likes to improve and solidify their knowledge if they are serious about this field.

Although I am not too concerned with whether the internships I apply for are relevant to the career I want to get into since any experience looks good on a resume, I do see the logic in having a an internship that applies to your desired career on your resume, so I will mention that I am wanting to get into Robotics.

Thanks so much for your time!

EDIT: I also would like to know the best way to go about forming the porfolio. Should I have a folder of printed out code or should I just have a link to my Github? I feel the latter is far more practical, but I'm worried no one will pay any mind to it."
1sunj3,1,2013-12-14,I [27F] am worried about my boyfriend [27M] of 6 months.,sour_tangerine,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1sunj3/i_27f_am_worried_about_my_boyfriend_27m_of_6/,"We met through Match.com and hit it off right away-- we're incredibly well-suited for each other. I'm getting a master's degree in journalism, he's a medical intern applying for residency. We're both busy, he more than I; we did a great job making time for each other for the first several months and got to know each other on a deeper level than many people I know who have been in relationships much, much longer than we have. 


Over the past month or so, he's been less and less available. A month ago is about when he started getting rejections for residency programs, and I think there's a direct correlation between the two. We're really good together, and having him be so distant is really frustrating for me. I know this is one of the worst times in his life, and I understand that he's unbelievably frustrated with his career right now. 


This week is the first week of our relationship where we haven't talked every day, and we've only spent one short evening together in the past three weeks. **This is not normal for us.** I'm worried that the profound self-doubt he seems to be experiencing in his professional life is seeping into other aspects of his life-- namely, his relationship with me. (Of course I'm also concerned about his general wellbeing; he's always exhausted, and lately his sense of humor is nowhere to be found.) Based on a few sleep-deprived, offhand comments I'm concerned that he's starting to doubt whether I'm the right girl for him. I'm confident that I am, and I'm fairly certain that he'll return to his normal, happy self after his interviews in a few weeks. 


Meanwhile, I miss him a lot, and we'll be apart for a few weeks over Christmas. I'm looking for advice on how to be supportive while he goes through... whatever this is. Also wondering how to tell him that I feel a little neglected without seeming too demanding; I know he had issues with this with his previous girlfriend. It seems to me that if he had time to see me a couple times a week and talk to me nightly when he was on a rotation with much more demanding hours, it shouldn't be a problem now when he's on a less demanding one, but I've never felt more like he's completely lost interest.

**TL;DR: Doctor boyfriend is panicking about the next stage of his career and ignoring me/doubting our relationship in the process. Miss him, don't want to lose him, but he's been so distant over the last few weeks that I feel like I already have.**"

I finally got my first job offer! I'm super excited, but I'm curious as to whether or not I should negotiate. The problem is that the position is part of a unique rotational program, so the salary is not something I can simply look up on GlassDoor to see if it's competitive.

2) I was an intern at this company last summer.

Any tips? Should I even negotiate?"

I'm a junior in my undergraduate. I made it to final round interviews of competitive top firms because of my GPA and decent leadership experience on my resume.

I feel like I am working hard to always be my best. 3.6 cum GPA, 4.0 major GPA and a bunch of extra-leadership time consuming things on my resume. I also go to a pretty good school, so I thought that would help me out as well, it's not ivy, but it's still a great college.

Maybe they won't want me because of me?

I'm just feeling really depressed I didn't find anything that I applied for when I worked really hard to get here. Maybe I just need to keep on trying and hope for the best? I didn't think Accounting would be THIS competitive of a field, it honestly feels like its almost impossible to come across opportunities.

I'm sorry for my rant. Should I seriously consider not being in this field if I don't have what it takes to get an internship before graduating?

Maybe I'm just shocked because I honestly thought I was extremely confident about getting offers for everything I applied to and thought my interviews went EXTREMELY well.

If I get my Masters and a CPA, will job finding be easier or is it always going to feel like this?

Should I just give up on trying and just accept I'm never going to be good enough?

I just want to scream.  I am always keeping myself busy doing anything I can do helping back to the community am trying to make a difference aside from getting great grades.  

Why do I feel like I am failing at life?  I seriously am hating myself so much because I'm NEVER am going to get anything right. 

I'm so frustrated.  I don't know who I can talk to.  I don't know what else I can do to help myself get to the next step.

Worst of all, I come don't come from a wealthy family.  This is why I'm trying so hard to do my best.  I'm afraid of  trying my BEST and still ending up nowhere in life...  I'm terrified.

I just want to work hard, and I want to prove to myself and to the world I can.  Why doesn't anybody want to take a chance on me? :(  This feels to me just as bad as getting rejected by your biggest crush.

I'm a student at MIT, where we have the month of January off to do whatever (take classes, study/work abroad, do internships, hang out) and I'm interning at a startup in SOMA (2nd and Bryant) over this period.

**What I'm looking for:**

I'm looking for a place to stay somewhat close to 2nd and Bryant from 12/31 to 1/31.  I can probably crash with someone from work for a day or so if necessary so there's a tiny bit of wiggle room on either end.

I also have a friend working in FiDi over the month who I'd like to room with if possible and we don't mind sharing a full+ sized bed. If you have a big enough place that's located convenient enough to get to 2nd and Bryant and FiDi, let me know!

[Hey Will! Three years ago after the Betty White SNL taping, my friends and I enticed you over our way with a box of cupcakes. You ran over and began punching the cupcakes in anger. You called us muffin poisoners and immediately regretted punching them as you had a lot of icing on your fist. Three years later, I was wondering if you still regret this decision and if you’ve ever been able to look at cupcakes the same way again.  Also, what was your inspiration behind your SNL character Clancy T. Bachleratt?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce1518g?context=5)|I am still very sorry about the cupcakes situation.  I absolutely remember destroying them.  I do not regret it though.  As for Clancy T. Bachleratt -- I don't even remember how we came up with that stuff.  It just kinda happened.  We originally tried to write a sketch using ""model t cars, jars of beer, toddlers and spaceships"" in existing songs like Kenny Loggins' Danger Zone but it would have been too expensive to produce so we just made up original songs.  And Jonah Hill was really good about championing the sketch after the table read.  Thanks for liking that one -- it's one of my favorites I ever got to do at SNL.  Sorry again about punching the cupcakes!
[P.S. Tell me which movie studio I need to entice with cupcakes to get them to make “MacGruber 2: Grube Harder” and/or the prequel to the Brothers Solomon ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce1518g?context=5)|And no need for cupcakes, we're gonna make MacGruber 2 -- somehow, somewhere, sometime!

Were there any sketches during your time there that you were completely surprised went to air?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce159ow?context=5)|For my audition, I did Tim Calhoun, a speed reader, a prison guard that yelled at people and another thing I used to do at the Groundlings Theater (perhaps my favorite sketch I've ever done) called the Gold Man -- I'm one of those Gold Men on the streets that moves when people put money in their bowl -- I get my money stolen and then sing a sweet song about the hard life of a Gold Man that ends in the reveal that I suck cock for my facepaint.  From there on out, most of the rest of the song is about cock and facepaint -- in fact, those are the only two words I use for the final two minutes of the song -- I must have sang the word cock like 200 times by the end of it.  As I walked out of the audition, Lorne thanked me for coming and I shook his hand and said ""Sorry for all the cocks.""  The next day, I found out I got the job.  I guess it was the perfect amount of cocks!
[What is the status of the MacGruber sequel? Also have you considered calling it MoreGruber or MacTwober?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce15215?context=5)|Val wants us to call it MacGruber Also which I really like.

It didn't really change anything about the way we acted in the movie.  We did however at times wear some pretty weird color combos that would register better in black and white -- undershirts that were neon orange -- that kind of thing.  If you were to watch a color version of the movie, you would think, what the hell are these guys wearing?  But I can't imagine the movie in anything but black and white now -- I think it's so beautiful!  Alexander Payne is amazing!
[That inspirational coach speech with Peyton Manning was the funniest thing I've ever seen.

I think that's my favorite sketch I ever got to do at SNL.  That was one I wrote with John Lutz (the guy that played Lutz on 30 Rock).  He came into my office with that crazy song (""Casino Royale"") and I told him about an idea I had from years before in which a coach used a weird song to motivate his team and we went from there.  The funny thing is that we wrote the whole thing just thinking that I would play the song and listen to it the whole time.  But right as we were about to turn the sketch in, Lutz said ""Why don't you dance while the song is playing or something.""  I can't believe we almost didn't think of that because that's the whole sketch!  Thanks again for liking it!

How I Met Your Mother was an amazing experience.  I wrote at Letterman with Carter Bays and Craig Thomas who created the show, so I had known them forever.  They're wonderful guys.  So it was a very comfortable experience working on the show.  The director Pam Fryman is AWESOME and the whole cast is so talented and so damn nice -- it really was a great experience!

My favorite things to do on SNL -- the dancing coach sketch with Peyton Manning -- all the Clancy T. Bachleratt and Jackie Snad songs about Model T Cars, Jars of Beer, Toddlers and Spaceships -- the ESPN Classic sketches -- MacGruber -- Jon Bovi -- and Potato Chip!

Every part of the Nebraska experience was amazing.  Bruce could not have been better to me -- what a great friend and guide through the whole process.  And I got to watch an amazing actor who has given hundreds of amazing performances, give the best performance of his lifetime -- and I got to watch it from like a foot away.  To say it was an incredibly special experience would be the biggest understatement of all time.

I usually say that you should either go to The Groundlings in LA, UCB in NY or Second City in Chicago and start working your way through the system.  They always look for people in those places.  But there are so many other wonderful theaters and I'm kinda out of the loop now.  There are also so many ways that you can get noticed on the internet too.  Old Man Forte wishes he could give you better advice, but that's the best he can do.  Best of luck to you.  Work your ass off and work with as many people as you can -- you never know who is gonna make it to the next level and then take you with them!  Or maybe you're the person who makes it and takes them along.

And also, days.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce15jzq?context=5)|As for Spelling Bee, that's one I used to do when I was at the Groundlings (a sketch/improv comedy theater in LA).  I used to go on forever with the letters -- sometimes like double the SNL version of the sketch.  I was really nervous because it was the last sketch of the night before Neil Young played and I was scared that he wouldn't have enough time to do his song so I did it a little shorter than I normally would have.  In hindsight, I should have just kept saying letters until they hauled me off the stage.  But it was so fun to get to do that one at SNL -- that's one that's really close to my heart!

1syorc,9,2013-12-15,Can non-programmers ever write anything besides spaghetti code?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1syorc/can_nonprogrammers_ever_write_anything_besides/,"I do a lot of programming in my current job, because I am significantly cheaper than a trained programmer, and my boss is a little vague on what makes one computer skill different than another (think http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVhuG5QYoQ). Apparently this pattern has been going on for quite some time (hire person who knows nothing about programming to program, replace with other non-programmer when they leave), so I'm sitting on a huge mountain of legacy spaghetti code. I don't want to add to the problem; I've tried reading ""Design Patterns"" and stuff by Knuth, but to be honest it all seems a little beyond me. I'm really not sure how to improve without going back to school for a CS degree, and trying to explain to my boss why exactly they should replace me with at the very least a paid intern from the local CS department has not been successful.

Is this a sinking ship? I know that I don't have the skills to re-factor the codebase, but what can I do to at least stop myself from making it worse? What tactics should I use to convince my boss that they really do need someone with training working on the code?

Am I going about this the wrong way? Advice appreciated."

1sygk3,4,2013-12-15,"Me [25F] with my BF [26 M] 2 months, we are really compatible and happy, but our relationship began with lies. I cannot trust and do not know if I even should",shoulditrust,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1sygk3/me_25f_with_my_bf_26_m_2_months_we_are_really/,"I will try to keep this quick and simple, so please feel free ask for further information.

I met with my BF about 4 months ago. When we first met, we talked about relationships and he told me that he has been single for the past 3 years. After going out on informal dates for about 1 month, I initiated a kiss, to which he did not reciprocate. That was when he told me that he actually has a GF, who is a Canadian girl who lives in Hongkong, and he was going to visit her in a few days (I knew that he was going to Hongkong, but he told me that he was going to visit a friend).

We talked about it a bit, he told me that he had feelings for me and I told him that we'll see what happens. No contact at all during the 10 days he is in Hongkong.

After he comes back, he contacts me again, we meet up a few times and after two weeks he tells me that he wants to be with me and breaks up with the Canadian girl, and we become ""official"". 

However, I was felt that his story was a little flaky. After being official about 3 weeks, I tell him that I've always felt that your story does not match. This is when he confessed that there is no Canadian girl, but his GF of one year was actually his coworker from another location. He did travel abroad to meet her, but not to Hongkong. He told me that he kept this a secret because they agreed to keep it a secret because they were coworkers.

I see so many red flags and I told him that I cannot stay here. We also met at work, I was an intern, but our relationship began after I left the firm. The reasons why I am still here: a) other than this, he seems pretty reliable b) we are very compatible in every other aspect c) I really like him, he begged me to stay and tells me that I am the love of his life and other stuff like that.

Its been a month now and I still do not know what to do. How can I trust him? Should I?

**tl;dr**: BF told me he was single when we first met. He was not. Then told me about his GF who was a Canadian girl and they were in a LDR. Turns out his GF is LDR (true), but actually his coworker in another location."

- I am creating a press release and again I am not sure how to exactly make it, I have looked online to find out what should be in it and what it should say exactly.  I have written it so that it briefly tells what the game is, why it is different, why people should play it and that is it so far.

- Also in general what is the correct way to contact people to ask if they could talk about our game. I am at a lost to how to talk to people like do I say, ""Hi this is Fish09 and this is our game...would you be interested in talking about this or learning more?""

Ever since I was a child, nothing I've done has ever been good enough. 
In school I tried with all that I had, still I would always get picked last and picked on. I tried to listen to the teachers, read and learn, still my grades weren't all that good. 

I try all I can to be the best employee, work my butt of at internships, but seldom get anything more than few hours for the summer. 

I'm tired of trying to be outgoing, taking an interest in peoples lives, trying to make friends and just end up with nothing. 
Tired of trying to look my best, put on my best smile and never getting approached. Tired of the bitchy looks I get when trying to approach someone. 

I'm tired of practicing something I want to be good at for days, weeks and months and still only suck at it. Sick of reading all the guides, watching all the videos and never improve. Sick of feeling stupid for never getting it right no matter how hard I try, no matter how much I want it. 

I'm doing all I can to take care of my skin. Still it never stops being itchy and dry. I exercise and diet, but won't lose weight. I take care of my hair but it won't stop being frizzy. 

I'm eligible for a job opening. I have worked as hard as I possibly can to show that I really want this. But I keep getting evaded. I'm starting to think it's probably for the best. I won't be good enough anyway. 

I'm so sick of trying now. I don't want to anymore. I don't want to work, cook, clean, game, practice, talk to people or anything. What's the point of it? I'm not that old, but I'm not young either. I've been trying for years and years. 

I've tried my hardest and that wasn't hard enough. Do I even have any right to complain? 

Ugh. I'm sorry for this. It doesn't even feel good to get it off my chest. To tell some stranger. Who cares, I've made myself feel like a nuisance instead. Another fail. 

I should just try harder. But I don't have anymore strength. "

Berkeley would be my first choice as my uncle lives lives there and I have visited a few times. 

So I probably wouldn't be going until 2015 but if I am going to make a big move like this I have to start thinking ahead and start saving.

I am writing you because I really need advice for my visit to my Ex in one week. He is in Seoul right now, I'm in France. We come from the same university and met last year when I started my studies. We were together for one year and it all really went well throughout the first months. We knew that we'd have to enter a LDR for two years as the 3rd year of our BA is obligatorily abroad and I am one year below him. However, we said we would work it out, seeing that afterwards we would be together in Paris for at least 2 more years.

However, he broke up after only 5 weeks of LDR, after one week of fighting over skype. The fighting was my fault, I had heard about the possibility to do a gap year for internships after your 3rd year before entering the Master and I wanted him to do it in order to go where I will go next year. He did not want to, and then he said that the fighting was too much. It also has to be said that our summer break went pretty bad, because then suddenly his family demanded him to spent all the time with him before he left, and he was torn between our plans and his family's. They hated me, and although i tried to improve things, they just did not seem able to cope with the thought that their beloved son and brother (only boy) could have a GF. It really was horrible. But at the end we said we'd work it out when again living in the same cities for more than a few weeks. 

Now he constantly says that I hate is family and that this is one of the principal reasons why he broke up. I find this very unfair, seeing that I really tried. 
Well, and as we already had booked a non-refundable flight ticket in advance and he agreed I should still come I will now live at his place for 3 weeks. I really really would like to try to solve our issues, but he says he's too afraid that in the end we just end up fighting over the old problems again and that he therefore doesn't want to be with me.But everytime we were together it was just so great so I can't imagine that all the feelings will be just gone when we see each other again after 4 months.
I am really scared of going there and even thinking about not to, but then again I'm pretty sure I would regret it for the rest of my life to not have tried at least. Since the breakup my whole life has been wrecked up and has fallen apart because i am just too sad to be happy right now.

So, how would you recommend I should behave? He probably knows that I am still in love with him, but I don't want to appear needy or anything."

I just can't help myself from checking up on her online postings.

I no longer have Facebook, which helps, but her Twitter feed is public and so, whenever I'm feeling a bit down (all the bloody time), I'll type in her twitter handle and up pops a list of all the amazing things she's been up to, including moving in with her boyfriend. (This is roughly a year after she stated ""long term monogamy isn't really for me"" Ha.) 

I know the old yoda meme ""If into your ex's Facebook page you go, only pain will you find."", but it's not quite that straightforward. 

Her life is increasingly awesome (grad school, moving in with him, incredible internship) and mine is increasingly shitty (desperately trying not to fail my final year, becoming increasingly depressed).

In an age where she can be across an ocean (which she is) but I can still check up on her life, how do I forget about her?

tl;dr Ex's life is awesome, and I can't deal with being able to find that out.

The other one came from a statistics tutor.  I'm an online student, so I didn't really have too many willing professors to write me a letter.

Second problem is I only got a 142/170 in quantitative, 153/170 in verbal, and 3.5 in writing on the GRE. My program says they look for at least a 150 on both quant and verbal. I am an awful test taker. But I did get good grades in my Math courses.

I did write a vitae, which my research experience and Magna Cum Laude title looked nice on. My personal statement seemed okay. Made it a point to emphasize my interest in I/O geared research. I told them I was mainly focused on pursuing a career in research, but that I'd also eventually like to teach at the college level. I don't know if that sounded weak.

So, what are my chances? Thoughts? Should I add more on the personal statement/take off the bit about ""eventually"" wanting to teach, etc.?"

UT Austin is having a course on edX in January on Embedded Systems that I'm planning to be apart of. You can check out the course home page [here](http://https://www.edx.org/course/utaustinx/utaustinx-ut-6-01x-embedded-systems-1172), but here is a summary of the course:
             
* *This is a hand-on, learn-by-doing course that shows you         how to build solutions to real-world problems using embedded systems. Each student will purchase a Texas Instruments TM4C123 microcontroller kit and a few electronic components. This microcontroller has a state of the art ARM Cortex M4 processor. The course uses a bottom-up approach to problem-solving building gradually from simple interfacing of switches and LEDs to complex concepts like display drivers, digital to analog conversion, generation of sound, analog to digital conversion, graphics, interrupts, and communication. We will present both general principles and practical tips for building circuits and programming the microcontroller in the C programming language. You will develop debugging skills using oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and software instrumentation. Laboratory assignments are first performed in simulation, and then you will build and debug your system on the real microcontroller. At the conclusion of this course you will be able to build your own arcade-style game.*

I was wondering after completing this edX course and the college courses I've listed, I'd be a good applicant for a computer engineering internship since it's really important for me to get as much experience as possible before I graduate."

Thoughts please!,SoILikeThisGal,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1swwt3/is_she_22f_into_me_21m_thoughts_please/,"Alright, I'm in need of a second opinion! I've been lurking for a while, but I'm not 100% sure what to do regarding this situation. I met this girl in one of my college classes this semester, and since we worked in the same group all semester, we became pretty good friends. I have class 2x a week with her, and we hang out outside of class once a week on average. The problem is that I can't tell if she is interested in dating me, or if she just sees me as a friend. I feel as though she gives off signs that could go either way. Here are some examples:

Why I think she is into me:

* Prolonged eye contact. Sometimes, she just stares and doesn't say anything.
* She accepts my offer to hang out every time I ask. Two times she canceled, but with legitimate reasons.
* She seems to genuinely enjoy my company. She has been making the plans for what we do lately.
* She laughs at the majority of things I say.
* She touches me every once in a while (Usually on my arm or hand)
* We've done couples things like seeing a movie, shopping, and dining out (We've paid for each other multiple times).

Why I think she is not into me:

* All but one of her friends are guys, so I'm unsure if she is categorizing me with them (Never met any of them).
* She has called me ""dude"" a couple of times. Maybe I'm over-thinking this, but I wouldn't call someone I like ""dude"".
* She's incredibly friendly to EVERYONE. It's hard to determine if she is flirting or just being kind.
* I have to ask her to hang out probably 90% of the time. If neither of us have plans she won't ask me, but if I suggest doing something she says yes.
* When texting, her responses are always very blunt, short, and smiley faces are extremely rare. This may just be the way she texts anyone, but texting her is completely different than talking in person, and it tends to put doubt in my mind.

We only have one more class together. Also, I am taking next semester off to work full-time for an internship, so I won't have another class with her (She asked me if I wanted to though!). I'm sure I would still see her, but not nearly as much as I do now. Also, any thoughts on waiting until after the holiday season to make a move?

As for previous dating experience, a 6-year relationship ended poorly back in March, but I saw a therapist and was able to move on after a few months.

My apologies if I am over-analyzing this situation (I *am* an accounting major :D). If anything needs clarification, let me know. Thank you for reading, and any feedback is greatly appreciated!"

I'm a self-taught visual UI designer. Right now, there's one more semester in my senior year in college. I've had an internship at a major design agency last year, and have done a couple decent sized client projects for a startup and an app developer. I'm also working on some side projects with friends too. ***I have to apply to companies this winter break (the next 1 month or so) in order to secure a job for the fall. I'm just worried I don't know enough code and employers are going to turn me down because I'm not an expert technician yet.***

I am doing my best to learn code still though. I know a small bit of HTML and CSS (hand coded my portfolio site), but I'm no Chris Coyier (CSS Tricks). I'm just starting Javascript, which is a lot of fun, but I'm struggling to learn it (I'm using pure JS, not jQuery or a framework or however you call it).

A lot of people these days seem to malign visual designers, so I know I have to learn technical skills beyond Photoshop etc. it's just that at this point I am struggling to learn programming and it seems like a prerequisite everywhere. I feel if I'm not a great coder/front end dev by the time I apply to companies, they'll turn me down in favor of some technical wiz who has less visual design chops because that's just the economy.

Despite all my failings, I am decently well known in the design community eg. Dribbble, Forrst etc. with ~400 followers, for whatever little that is worth [read: nothing] but these days every job description says ""needs more than just Dribbble...must have previous web development experience"" etc. I wonder if given this skill set I have a chance to work at companies like Tumblr and Twitter as a junior/mid-level designer, or if I should simply resign myself to work at a local web design shop for a starting salary around $20-30K?"

After browsing this subreddit for nay 6 months, I had completely forgotten a tale of my own that happened a few years ago!  No greentext 'cause I just like the written story format better (more artistic freedom).
 
  
SCENE: A cold blistery Canadian winter.  The snow was cruel that day, my friends.  Hell, this is Canada.  It's like that here pretty much every damn winter day.  Through the wind and snow, we see a few lights illuminate.  Is it a lost arctic traveler, dismally sauntering through the dunes of ice and snow?  No, it is merely a pedestrian on the sidewalks of a buried city.
 
  
Be me, Midnight. F 5'4"" 117 (woot for gym!)  Down from 135 last winter.  I recently acquired a thigh gap.  Damn, that is so fun to brag about haha.  But back then I was still 145.  Pudgy programmer doing intern work downtown.
 
  
My co-worker, Remus.  M 5'5"" 135 Asian friend.  Nice guy :)
 
  
The thing with our downtown is that many of the popular malls, shops, restaurants and offices are either connected through skywalks or tunnels.  One I got in, I didn't have to go outside until I took the bus home.
 
  
Now, stereo-typically talking, we Canadians love our coffee.  The most popular being (let's call it) Jim Morton's. There were 4 in walk able distance via the skywalks, but the closest was only down an elevator and across to the building next door.  After a long hour bus ride of cramped, cold, noisiness my morning breakfast was either a 1)W&amp;A breakfast sandwich or 2) a nice coffee and a maple pecan strudel from Jim's.
 
  
Today was a Jim's day.  The maple pecan strudel was only out for a few months (I still miss it to this day) and I was damned if I didn't have my fix before it ended.  I did the 'pop-in' to the nearby quad to see if anyone wanted to join me and sure enough, Remus was game.  Sidenote: I hate eating/getting food by myself, made me feel guilty so I had some fatlogic pressuring my co workers.
 
  
So we skip and jump to the coffee shop to find... What did we find, Brain?  The same thing we found every morning, Pinky.  Jim Horton's has taken over the world!  The line of people spilled out into the office building like a fat chick in size 6 jeans.  Ever table and corner was stuffed with people.  Hustle and bustle.
 
  
Like cattle they line up for the slaughtering of their diets.  But I digress.  After 20 mins we were almost at the front of the line.  Now, what you need to know about my city is that there are bums downtown.  They reasonably decently dressed, very few are the stereotypical hole-in-shoe type.  These are not friendly bums, they are con artists and extortionists.  I have seen a few regulars come in and try to hound customers into paying, which they usually don't.  But today, ladies and gents...
 
  
Enter Mammoth.  A 250, 5'7"" 45 year old woman bundled up as if it was the ice age.  I had seen her around before.  I deal with bums, usually courteously with a ""sorry!"" to whatever they request (agh Canadians).  And sure enough, this woman shuffles to the front of the line.
 
  
""Excuse me, my mother is in the hospital and .... My family hasn't eaten in a few days .... can't afford food with parking ...."" oh the tale this woman told, loudly I may add.  But she had to be loud to talk over everyone else.  But people continuing to talk, clatter of coffee cups and rining of registers filling the air.  No one was taking the bait.  Customers are getting their morning coffees fast, and we were getting closer to the front.  She turned and looked for anyone to catch her eye.  For the love of god, do not look at it.  We're close now.  Remus, no don't look at it.  We're next in line.
  
  
He looked.
  
  
The Mammoth was all over him like a starving planet on a dollar deal.   She came right up and sputtered her sob story.  I, however ordered my strudel and lost him in the sea of people.  I do not like crowds and get very claustrophobic but dammit i'll have my breakfast.  My order could not come fast enough.  Finally I got my scrumptious yumyums but GOD I needed air and waited outside.  Too much elbow to elbow.
  
  
I waited 5 mins.  
I waited 10 mins.  
I waited 15 mins and headed back to the office.
  
  
I sat away from the view of the doors and away form the quad, and I just assumed he got caught up with something.  About 10 minuets later, he sauntered by my desk and off to the quad.  Curious, I tailed him.  His co-workers asked where he had been.  I chimed in.
  

""Soooo...? What happened?  You didn't end up buying anything for her did you?""  
He sighed.  He beta'd.  Apparently he bought her 6 (SIX!!) large frappuccinos, a dozen doughnuts and 2 sandwiches.  About 50$.  There was a food court in the adjacent building with soup, chili, fruit trays and sandwiches, but this woman had come in specifically to get her beetus beverages and sugar.
  
  
The kicker?  The cashier told him (after he had got the order and Mammoth had left) that she comes in there to hassle people ALL THE TIME.
  
  
TL;DR - Hammies gonna ham"

If I go to Stony Brook I will graduate with 30k in debt but I heard Stony Brook is very good for computer science. Is this true? Also if I go to Stony Brook I will get the ""real college experience"". Is this worth the 30k in debt? 

If I go to something like Cuny barcuh I will graduate 100% debt free. 
What's the best CUNY for computer science?

For computer science jobs I heard the most important things are internships.

What do you guys think I should do. Something like Stony Brook or Baruch? 
Or maybe a different college altogether?

1t1h0y,0,2013-12-16,I(M/24) think I made a huge mistake in breaking up with my ex(F/20) 3 months later.,iregretitthrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1t1h0y/im24_think_i_made_a_huge_mistake_in_breaking_up/,"I was with Britney for two and a half years. I liked many things about her. She had a good sense of humor, we like the same music and all of the same video games, she's hot, she gave me cool gifts. She was always there for me. Around a year and some change into the relationship, I started an internship. Not only did I have an internship, I had a job, and school. This lead me to having long days from 8AM-12AM/2AMish. I had no time to see anybody. Luckily, Britney lived a few blocks away. So I'd hang out with my friends after work, then pick her up around 3 or 4AM, depending whenever I was done. 

I started to get tired of being in a relationship. Everything she did annoyed me. I started feeling obligated to hang out with her. I thought as soon as my internship was over, I'd rekindle the candle and things would be fine again. It didn't work out that way. I'd cancel plans and do things with my friends. Because I got used to the night time hang outs. We'd just hang out at my house later that night anyway. I didn't talk to her for days. Every time she asked if I was okay, I'd tell her I was because I never learned how to communicate well.

Finally, September came. She tried to talk to me about her concerns in person and I didn't give much of an input. Other than telling her she had nothing to worry about. I left to go hang out with my friends. Later that night, she texted me saying that it's so hard to communicate because I always avoid the things she says. That she wants to know what's wrong because she cares about us. That it feels like I only hang out with her because I'm obligated to.

So, we meet up. I tell her how she's perfect for me, but I don't want to be in a relationship anymore. I've been in relationships since I was 16, and have never gotten a chance to be single. She says she understands and would rather not be in a relationship with someone who isn't giving 100%, and that she won't hate me.

We break up. I go out with my friends a lot. I try talking to other girls. But being single isn't what I thought it would be like. I'm not drowning in vagina. Girls don't like me. I think we needed a break, not a break up. I was getting so annoyed of her, and if I had time off I'm sure it would've worked out.

Cue to a few weeks later, and I see her in another city with a new guy. Her new boyfriend. We trade items at a show later in the week and I don't talk to her. I turned around and walked away before she could say something.

I regret it immensely. I told her how I feel. Things aren't the same without her. She completed me. She was so good for me. And I wasn't the best for her. I was really shitty to her for a good majority of the relationship because I always assumed she'd be there. I told her that she haunts me and how my bed feels so empty now. That there's so many things I wanted to show her. And that I can change. I can learn how to communicate and treat her like the princess she is. A few days later, she called me. She asked if I really felt that way and if so why couldn't I say anything early? I was so happy. A few days later, she texted me saying that she couldn't do this anymore and she was done. That she found somebody who treats her very well and that she will never hate me but that she can't deal with me anymore. 

I still texted her for a few weeks. Telling her I miss her. How could she jump from one relationship to the next? She was always insecure about my ex and I because my ex always posted about me(Even until now) and my ex hangs out with a lot of my friends. She always thought I moved on too soon from my ex and would regret being in another long term relationship. Yet she does the same shit. Like everything we've built was nothing but quicksand. Once again, she told me she couldn't do this anymore. That me texting her is mentally draining and isn't good for my health either. That she is trying to move on but I keep contacting her. That she didn't just decide to go into another relationship, but happened to meet somebody. She pointed out how I told her that we were never getting back together.

I've seen her family, and her, a few times since we broke up. I saw her alone at a show last week and walked up to her. She was civil with me, and I asked if she wanted to move up in the crowd. We went through the crowd together, but I lost her as soon as the show started. I saw her again when I was leaving, and asked if she wanted to travel home with me and my friends, but the coat check line was long. So she just left.

I know she still cares about me. I don't think she'll last with her boyfriend. What can I do? I regret leaving her.

TL;DR; I broke up with my girlfriend of two and a half years to get some space and be single. She started dating someone new shortly after. I know she still cares for me. What can I do?"

I'm scheduled to participate in an internship for this upcoming summer from the end of May to the beginning of August, and I will have to take care of finding some housing for myself for that time.

I've been googling places and businesses to see what kind of potential options are out there to live for the summer, but I wanted to get some real SLC-er feedback on what the best course of action for this would be.

I would probably prefer to stay somewhere close to downtown as that's where I would be working, or somewhere close to the city where public transportation is easily accessible. Also, as an aside, I would love to live somewhere where I can easily have access to some of the hiking or biking or outdoor stuff in general, as I read that there's a lot of that in Utah!

One other question though: will I absolutely need a car for my stay? Or will I be able to take advantage of the scenery and other locations by solely relying on public transportation? I was in D.C. last summer and one thing I loved was that a car wasn't needed and loved walking through the city and being able to see what it was about.

Thanks for any advice you can give me!"

Need some really good advice, please.",-lmt-,massage,https://www.reddit.com/r/massage/comments/1t11cj/having_trouble_with_finding_the_right_place_big/,"Hi ladies/men of r/massage, i've mostly been a lurker here off and on and decided to make an account to discuss finding the right place for employment and sort of get what i've went through for awhile off my chest because I don't have any therapist friends who I can talk to.

I've been a licensed therapist for over a year and have worked in 3 clinics. My first job was with one of the two massage envy's in my city. I was trained in 2 different types of massage and they both feel  incredible. My teacher had been a therapist for 40 years and broke everything down so well, explaining how i was helping what my moves do for the body, etc. 

My practicals went really well and I was given the job on the spot. My boss would override the regional manager and let me do a certain massage i learned that wasn't offered at ME. Somehow he found out about it and forced them to fire me because she didn't tell him she allowed me to do it. All it was was a variation of deep tissue massage nothing harmful and nothing that can hurt someone (i get their legal liabilities) but couldn't i just get like a slap on the wrist and just not do it anymore?  That one really fucked with me and made me question why i even got into this business for a short period of time. 

So, then i took a job almost right down the road at another clinic and it was just horrible. The pay was garbage $15/1 hr. massage and an extra $2 more for a 90. Well that didn't last long plus summer rolled around so it was slow. 

I then applied at the other massage envy in my city and went through with the practical. Nerves took over me because the owner didn't even talk to me face to face before we had a practical, making me nervous as hell because i have no clue what her personality is like and had just learned her name. I've never even been slightly nervous with an actual client so it was really weird and made me feel very awkward.

She said she liked my massage but gave me an internship instead of a position, saying that I just went quickly for a 50 minute sessions. I told her about my nerves but she didn't really seem to care. This internship has really messed up my credit because i had to go find anything for work just to make money and i'm stressing badly. 

The weird thing is the internship seems so sketchy. I have to give x number of massages before i get a another shot at being hired. They make me massage their therapists and in return they're supposed to give me tips for a better massage etc.. I have my own style and have been doing it for a long time like all of you. You know its next to impossible to change that unless you do it intensively over a longer period of time but it will NEVER completely replace everything from school unless you just go to another one.  

All the therapists are nice, a couple were very catty and talked about me behind my back making fun of how i talk and use bigger words and they think I believe i'm some genius or something. Whats with the fucking cattiness in this business sometimes? We should be helping and encouraging each other. Most of the therapists all went to the same school so they keep trying to tell me their style of massage is the best and i need to adapt to it because they all get lets of business (not exactly true). 

My boss won't answer or return any phone calls when i try to discuss anything with her. I know she screens calls because she always has her phone on her. She will answer e-mail but I can't talk about these things over email. I think i'm just done with the with lack of professionalism there and need to find an actual place that will embrace what i've learned. 

Sorry for the long rant but I've been put through an emotional rollercoaster just for simple employment. I'm thinking about moving to my state's capitol just for work. The cost of living is terrible there but I have no other options if i actually want to use my education. 

What i want to know from you all is do you think maybe i should find work at a chiropractic office or maybe even find a hospital to work for? Those jobs are rare where i live but do any of you have some insight and background for me in those settings? What can i expect there? 

Thank you if you read all this, seriously, feels great just to tell therapists what i'm going through and thanks if you can give me some sound advice.  "
1t0ssm,2,2013-12-16,"Hi, I'm in a job predicament (my fault!) and could really use some advice on how to decline an offer...",question1112,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1t0ssm/hi_im_in_a_job_predicament_my_fault_and_could/,"Hi all! Sorry if I ramble or sound rushed; I'm a little sleep-deprived and nervous. Basically, I applied and interviewed for two internships for the upcoming semester. I'm 20 and still in college. Company #1: really cool, fits what I am hoping to be paid for this summer (editorial work) at a different company (so I think it might look good on my resume if I've interned in a similar position), and it's well-known. Company #2: a non-profit that has several locations across the country, which was my main drive... and while it's not oriented toward what I'd like to do in the summer, it still seemed fitting as it would allow me to teach creative writing to kids. After the interview, however, I felt differently about it; it didn't seem to fit exactly what I wanted, and the commute home was extremely difficult. It would be a 2 hour commute and I would be unpaid. At Company #1 I'd also be unpaid, but the commute is only 15 minutes on the subway.



So I think it's probably clear that I'm leaning toward #1. However, #2 contacted me on Thursday and offered me the job, asking for a response from me by today. I waited until today because I wanted to see if #1 had gotten back to me. Because I was nervous, I emailed #2 back and said that I was having a bit of trouble with my scheduling for next semester and might only be able to work there one day a week. I know, I know - I should have just asked for an additional couple days to make my decision. but I'm not wildly experienced with these kinds of things and have never had to turn down an offer, so I felt uncomfortable about that. I ended up talking to my teacher/advisor and he suggested that I ask for extra days and contact #1 to see if they'd come to a decision yet. I honestly didn't know that either of those moves would be considered appropriate - learning experience, I guess....





So, as it would happen, I emailed #1 asking nicely for an update, and they responded immediately offering me the position. Which is exciting, but also so frustrating --- especially because Company #2 emailed me at the SAME time saying that they'd be more than happy to be flexible and work around my schedule so that I could come in whenever I am available. Dammit. They're so nice! So I guess I just feel really, really guilty now. There is no way I could accept both positions as I won't have time. I really want to accept #1, but I don't know what to tell #2, and I feel like a jerk for having to say ""Oh, thank you for being so considerate and willing to accommodate my schedule, but I'm STILL going to turn you down."" Sigh.


So that's my struggling point. I don't know how to turn #2 down after they've been so nice! I know this is something I need to learn now as opposed to later, so I thought you might be able to help me.

Thank you SO much for any opinions and suggestions!"

Hi guys,

I´m in need of your help here.
At first, please forgive me my grammar and spelling, as English is not my native language.

I work as an intern in an IT-Department, which has recently acquired two big-ass 4K-Displays.
Their purpose is showing several monitoring applications, like NAGIOS, for example.

My job now, is to build a preferably small Windows-machine, which is able to feed two 4k-displays simultaneously.
I´m experienced in building rigs, but the whole 4K-thing is new to me, as it is to anyone I know in person.
Sadly I couldn´t find any useful recommendations on the web for a project like this.

Also my boss would like to see something based on a mini-ITX board, while I fear this won´t be possible.

Scenarios I thought about are:

A)	Using an Intel Core-CPU, equipped with internal graphics and a PCIe graphic adapter for the second panel. Provided that the board supports the use of both (the on-board and the external) HDMI-jacks simultaneously. As I haven´t tried this before, I don´t know if this would fly or not.

B)	Building a “normal” PC, equipped with a SLI- or Crossfire-Setup, what in turn would not meet the desired small form factor. Until now, I couldn´t even find out, if there´s a graphic adapter supporting dual-4K output, or if If I HAVE to choose a  dual-setup.

As this little project might be a small step to a permanent job in the company I´m doing this internship at, I´d really appreciate any useful input from you.

I´m a Redditor since about three years now and haven´t asked for much yet (except funny cat pix and some Gonewild-stuff), but today I need your support.

Thank you,

I want to pursue a graduate degree in Developmental Psychology, preferably a combined degree (MA and PhD). I want to get into a top tier grad school in USA. I am still trying to figure out whether I want to have a PhD on cognitive development or social development, thus I am still in the process of finding a good advisor/a good ""fit"" in terms of research.

Research-wise I have been involved in seven research projects in four different labs since freshman. Last summer I did an internship at a prestigious university’s lab and I will be getting an excellent recommendation letter from the professor I worked with. I got accepted to another internship for next summer at another prestigious lab. So far everything looks good in terms of research. 

I have also started designing a smartphone application for educating parents and I am planning to start working with a CS (computer science) major around January for making it real. 

In terms of publications, I only have a 3rd authorship on conference paper in a top conference in I/O Psych (unrelated I know) and a poster presentation on Developmental Psyc.

I haven’t taken TOEFL or GRE yet but I have started prepping for both. My only concern is my English. Although people tell me that my English is sufficient I feel like it is not good enough for me to excel in grad school.

What would you advise me to in terms of bettering my English? Should I pursue a masters degree outside my country first? Or would I get better as I struggle in grad school? Any advice is great!

1szhze,116,2013-12-15,I'm 30yrs old and my parents found my stash - Now they're insisting I go to counseling. I feel like I'm being treated like a child. Any advice?,[deleted],Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/1szhze/im_30yrs_old_and_my_parents_found_my_stash_now/,"I'm staying with my parents for a while as I'm in between jobs.  It's been an anxious time and this past weekend I took too many ambien before I went to bed. The next day I found myself slurring my speech, fumbling and basically sleep walking. 

My parents immediately noticed and searched the room I was staying in. They ended up finding some ambien, xanax and valium. Not my entire stash but enough for them to freak the fuck out. Later they found my workout journal that pretty much chronicles my workouts, eating, sleeping and any drug use. 

I'm 30 years old and have been a responsible drug user since I was 16. I've had some rough patches of life but have never turned to drugs as an escape. I've also never been addicted to anything. I did make a mistake this past weekend but it's not much different than one of those nights when I've had just a little too much to drink.

I've got a degree in engineering and an MBA both from Ivy League universities. I left my job recently and have been unemployed and so have been taking a little more than usual to relax. That said I'm normally a very occasional drug user. I'll keep my percocet after surgery and will take one for a hangover until they run out. I've bought Xanax online and have used 3-4/month in a bind. I've also pretty much tried everything but meth, heroin and crack. Still I've never ""needed"" drugs and so have accumulated an eclectic stash. The rest of my stash isn't in the house but the journal explicitly stated every drug I've used for the past 5 months.  

My totals are probably as follows:

percocet 6 times
Xanax 20 times
Ambien 20 times
Valium 10 times

Now this is over a period of 150 days of unemployment! I've had nothing to do but search for jobs and so my frequency might be a little higher than normal. I've held great jobs in the past and if it wasn't for unemployment my parents never would have known.

Now suddenly everyone in the family thinks I'm a junkie who needs help. I've agreed to go to counseling because I'm crashing at my parents place until I get a new job. 

Still I know deep down nothing will ever change. I'll always want a little xanax around for when I need it and if I get some percocets after surgery I'm gonna keep those suckers for when I'm hurtin. I don't think there's anything wrong with this. If I've made it this far then there's no reason to think I have an issue. 14 years without notice or a problem but now it's out there.

What do I tell the drug counselor? Am I honest? I feel like if I am my mom will freak out about the 2 times I've tried LSD or the 5 times I've done XTC.  I'm no druggie. I'm just a responsible user yet our society is such that it's judging me as having a problem.

I'm not at risk of harming myself or others. I use drugs responsibly and if I had taken 3 ambien in my own apartment I would have just acted like a moron all day and slept it off. (I don't normally up my doses and never ever mix.)

I just don't know how to approach this with my family. It feels like I'm coming out the closet and I know they won't accept it. If I tell the full truth they'll judge me more. If I stay quiet or say anything else they'll know I'm lying. 

How the hell do I get out of this one? Anyone else go through anything similar?

SOME EDITS TO ADDRESS SOME RECURRING QUESTIONS:

1) I have an apartment I have been subletting but have returned home between Thanksgiving and X-mas/NYE by   choice. I'll travel back and forth for job interviews but it's the North East so it's getting dark and cold. Being home means I'm closer to family, old friends and good food.

2) I pay my own bills. I have money saved and I actually have some unemployment I get weekly. Also I left my job by choice. My boss could see I was unhappy and worked with me on making the departure as easy on everyone as possible.

3) My concern is that I DO NOT want to run away from the issue. I am concerned with how to deal with my parents moving forward. I don't think they think I am a legit TOTAL junkie. They simply judge everything with the exception of nicotine, alcohol and pot as unnecessary, unethical and abusive. My mother worries a lot and now that she's found some pills she's worried about addiction and overdose. It's difficult for her to look backwards, for all she knows I could have bought them all last month and developed a problem just these past few weeks.

4) For all those who don't believe I can't find a job it's simply true. I had gotten my original job offer as a result of my performance during my summer internship in New York City. As a result I had a pretty generous compensation package. While I've stated that I'd be willing to take a pay cut, one of my friends in HR said that the salary thing is what might be holding me back. She mentioned that people who take a pay cut to come work at a job usually jump ship the first year when a better opportunity presents itself. To stay at my level of compensation and responsibility means that a company has to take a risk in hiring me. They don't have a 3-month internship to judge me on. Just a piece of paper, a couple of references and maybe 5 hrs of interview time, max.

5) Honestly I think my mother will always think that use of drugs without a prescription is abuse and high risk behavior. She doesn't feel this way about alcohol or cigarettes even though they a much bigger killer.

She watches TV and so she's more afraid of me overdosing on xanax than on alcohol although it's nearly impossible to OD on benzos alone. (Benzos + Alcohol though is a very different story)

She still has the mindset that a person who does LSD once or twice is at much higher risk of injuring himself than one who drinks a few beers everyday.

She's also probably rather see me smoke cigarettes daily than do MDMA every couple years.
That's the disconnect. It's absurd but it's what they put on TV and what she thinks is true. The anti-drug alarmists really control what people see. Have you ever seen a portrayal of responsible mushroom use? No but people do it all the time.

My dad is a teacher (shop) and my mom is a housewife- despite trying to get a job she can't get hired anywhere. We live in a nice enough neighborhood but we're at the low end for the area (bought in a low market) and while we've always gotten by, its never been a certain thing. Money has always been a concern for us- we've had shutoffs, nearly lost one of the cars, nearly lost the house after an unexpected major expense really screwed us up. We don't drive nice cars (the newest is a 2006, paid for, and I drive a 1996 Toyota that's only on the road because my dad can do a lot of mechanical work himself). I've worked since I was 16 and have helped out with money ever since and I go to the state university on scholarships, a Pell Grant, and loans and live at home, work two awful jobs and am trying to graduate early to save on loans. My parents have made some mistakes with money but they're doing the best they can. They raised us to act like we could fit in with the middle/upper-middle class area we grew up in, so we don't act ""working-class"" like we're on Roseanne or something, but we are. 

My boyfriend, on the other hand, grew up very wealthy. New money, big spenders, very flashy. His parents grew up less well-off than I did, so I get the impression that they wanted their kids to have the best of everything. His first car was a Jaguar and a $600 a month lease was ""cheap"". They have their house on the market for $1.2 million. His father was a business owner, and successful for a long time. My boyfriend went to a $50k a year private university and lived on campus all four years, mostly paid for. Graduated in May moved back home and walked into a $60K job not even a month later because a friend of the family owned the place. His mom makes at least $120k, almost double what my dad does, and has significant assets and savings (we have neither) and no kids to support- he's the youngest at 22, and gainfully employed, his only brother is 30 and married and doing very well. 

Our different backgrounds have led to some conflicts:

1) His father passed away early this year of cancer and it came out afterwards that his business wasn't doing as well as he had had everyone believe it was. I feel for him, I really do. Getting hit with the double whammy of losing his father and finding out that they were not as well-off as he though really sucks. I didn't meet him until three months after his dad passed, so I have no idea what their situation was before, but they're nowhere near poor, or even struggling. He talks about how they're ""having trouble"" financially but the new Audi says otherwise, among other things. Every time he mentions it I just see red because he just so clearly doesn't get it, and I don't really want to go into my experiences for the sake of my parents' dignity. 

2) I'm in a pretty bad place financially right now. I work two horrible jobs in food service and take a max-credit course load. My parents don't have connections and I can't afford to take unpaid internships. He's never worked a dead-end job and his lowest paid job was $10 an hour in high school.  I've pretty much lost hope in ever finding a worthwhile job and have strongly considered dropping out because college is a pretty huge waste of money for people like me. He can't understand my worrying because in his world, college was fun and everyone gets a nice job and things all work out. Its frustrating and almost feels patronizing at times. 

3) He can be a bit insensitive sometimes. He'll point out how much he spent on something or refer to something as inexpensive when its something that would drain every penny out of my bank account. He doesn't seem to understand that I can't buy a new car, even though mine is probably unsafe, and that I have no financial help whatsoever, no matter what. There is no fallback for me. Honestly sometimes he inadvertently makes me feel like I'm a gold digger, even though I'm not, or just makes me feel totally inadequate (not intentionally, I'm just sensitive about it) because I can't afford the things he wants to do on my own. He makes comments about poor people being lazy, without it ever occurring to him that I'm a lot closer to those people than I am to him. 

He has a good heart and is very generous, with me and with others, despite the fact that sometimes he puts his foot in it and doesn't come off that way. I don't want this to be what tears us apart, but I know money issues can be a huge problem. As we look towards the future, how do we/I deal with these issues?

**tl;dr I grew up working-class and we always worried about money, work two jobs since I was 16, in school full time, feeling really overwhelmed and pretty bleak about the future. My boyfriend grew up rich, has never worried about money, graduated college and got a good job. Found out hes not as rich as he thought, complains about money. Can be a bit insensitive regarding money because its a non-issue in his life. I don't want this to be our undoing, what can I do?**"

Hello guys, first time posting here. I am currently doing an internship and I do the tech support in the building. I get ticket with all kinds of different problem and I only support the employee there. Here's what happened : I got a ticket from someone telling me they're second computer monitor lags when she's browsing internet and I have never heard of this before. I went to her desk and it's really the case. Whenever I try to move a browser from one screen to the other the second screens get really laggy and sometime freeze for a couple of second. It seems to be even worse with google chrome. Also, the computer is on windows XP. There's no lag with the first monitor... 

I searched on google for this but they all seems related to graphic card problem and at my workplace everyone use the same kind of computer so I don't have any clue what could cause this. Anyone have an idea?"

Things have changed - I now have the option of either going back to my CSU or continuing at CC to transfer to SJSU (hopefully) and I'm not sure if it'd be worth it.

I hear SJSU is a great school for CE due to the location and internship opportunities and while my GPA is over a 3.0 I also have doubts if I'd get in so I'm not sure if it's just worth my time to stick with my local CSU in the big picture because if I want to transfer, there's a significantly bigger amount of stress on getting A's in my difficult classes so my transfer GPA is competitive. However I also do not want to stay in my region after I graduate, so that's a reason to transfer and not attend my local CSU. "
1sz0rc,0,2013-12-15,"I [18M] have been through a long break up, now I haven't seen her [17F] in 2 years but I'm still feeling the effects. How do I break out of the sadness this has caused and find someone new to fill the hole?",Ascillion,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1sz0rc/i_18m_have_been_through_a_long_break_up_now_i/,"Nearly 4 years ago, I was 15, I fell in love for the first time. She was 1.5 years younger than me so she was 13 then. I fell pretty hard and had a wonderful 10 month relationship before a rather messy breakup.

I've always been a fairly shy guy who didn't really go outside and she was the thing that brought me out of my shell and got me socializing properly. We were attending a mixed boarding school at the time so it was easy to see each other and we'd be together nearly every day except weekends. I changed a lot over the time we were together and I was happier than I'd ever been. We eventually slept together 8 months in and 2 months after that it lead to us splitting up.

She had very protective parents. She was their only child and they wanted the best for her and they wanted her to be the best and whatever she was good at. After a weekend at her place (the first ever time we'd stayed in the same house overnight) they found out we'd had sex. They found out by some supreme stupidity on my part and a silly mistake on hers, but it's not important and not something I like talking about. There were already cracks forming between us but I believe we could have worked through them. Anyway they just stopped the relationship there, no input from either of us. She always did just about everything her parents said in an effort not to disappoint them so there was no sneaking around or anything, their word was law to her.

This left us in a rather awkward situation because we still had feelings for each other which we couldn't act on and we were around each other all day every day due to being at boarding school. We tried to be friends for a few weeks but we couldn't keep a hold of our selves and ended up going past the point of friends a bit, then she cut me out. A good decision really, trying to be friends was really hard for both of us.

I ended up getting very depressed and making plenty of stupid decisions. Self harm, locking myself in my room for days, stuff like that. And this started to effect my schoolwork. I was doing my GCSEs at the time and if there was ever an exam where we were in the same hall I'd lose all concentration and I'd usually fail that paper. On one particular exam I was sitting facing a window and she just happened to be standing outside that window for the entire exam, I think I got a U for that one. Eventually I decided it wasn't worth staying at the same school as her and after one term of Sixth Form I dropped out.

Before I left I said goodbye to her which was a very strange and emotional talk but that was the last time I spoke to her. That was 2 years ago. After I dropped out I did nothing with myself. Didn't get a job, didn't do any more education, nothing. I sat on my ass in my room and played games for 9 months. Then a new school year started and I went to try sixth form again. During that 9 months off I was very anti-social, only really spoke to people on the internet. Overall I was still pretty depressed. To top it all off I had a falling out with my WoW guild, my main group of friends after leaving school, a month after dropping out.

When I eventually ended up back in sixth form I'd lost my drive to learn and my focus. I'm fairly intelligent but I just couldn't bring myself to care about the work. I generally hung around with my friends and did the bare minimum to get by. After a year there I got my AS results and found out I'd done terribly. After a talk with my parents I ended up dropping out again. This time I had some kind of plan. I got an internship. 3 weeks after getting this internship the company went under. That sucked but after a month or so the same guys brought me in to another internship which is what I am currently doing.

Now there's my story. Here's the issue. I've been very lonely for the last few years. I rarely go out, my friends are mostly online and the only time I really socialize with people in person is when I go to a large gaming event which happens 3 times a year. Other than that it's eat, sleep, work, game. Since my first girlfriend I've only had any real interest in one other girl. It started off as FWB but then became something more but wasn't really a relationship. In the end I broke off any sexual or romantic involvement because I felt like she was just mucking me around.

Now I can't see where I can go relationship wise. I very rarely meet any new girls and it feels like those 'plenty of fish in the sea' aren't in reach because I don't have a boat. I don't know where I can meet people, I'm a little worried about getting close to someone, because being mucked around did me no good at all, and I just want my love life to go somewhere because I'm sick of this situation. How do I give it the push it needs?

I'm still going through patches of sadness from the breakup and being alone so much is bringing me down too. I just really need a way to break out of this hole but it feels kind of hopeless right now.

tl;dr: Heart got broken, messy breakup, ruined a lot of my education. Nearly 3 years later looking for a way to be happy again."

1syxac,152,2013-12-15,"My sister, my lover.",[deleted],incest,https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/1syxac/my_sister_my_lover/,"I am a white male, educated and modestly successful. I grew up in a very strict family. Very religious, very controlling. I am the second  oldest of five children, I have a brother and three sisters. My parents were good people, they were a little wild when they grew up  and did not want that for their children, so the way they tried to  control that was by not letting us go out. While all of my friends in junior high were down at the movies on a Friday night, I was stuck at home. My sister was one year older, and a grade above me in school. Needless to say, with the two of us having to stay in every night, we were pretty close. In the summer and on weekends, my sister and I would hang out late at night, playing board games and watching tv, kid stuff. One night when I was in (x) grade and my sister was in (x), I fell asleep  in her room (this had happened a bunch of times). While we were  sleeping, somehow we started cuddling, I remember waking up and finding my arms wrapped around my sister, I knew it was wrong, but I was so turned on, my cock, which had no hair on it yet was hard as a rock. I held onto my sister and real slowly pressed my cock harder into her, she was wearing pj’s and I could feel my package pressed in between her butt cheeks. I was scared she was going to wake up, get freaked out and then I would be in BIG time trouble. I lay there for a while until I realized that my sister was awake. She was laying there acting like she  was sleeping, but she was definitely awake. I pressed into her a little  bit to test the waters, she slowly but firmly pressed back into me. We moved like this into each other, both of us still acting like we were sleeping, my sister reached back and acted like she was scratching  her ass, she was brushing her hand into my cock, still scared to actually grab it. My arms were around her and I started to feel on her boobs, they were just little nubs, but they felt so good. Finally, I got the nerve to roll my sister onto her back, I climbed on top of her and we started to dry-hump, we were moving so fast into each other, her legs were wide open and I could feel the bulge of her pussy as we were grinding, I tried to put my tongue in her mouth but she kept turning her head. I didn’t cum and neither did she, but it felt so fucking good. We dry humped until 4 am, finally falling asleep.

After that, (it was summertime) my sister and I dry humped every night, nothing more, no kissing, or penetration. School came and we had to limit ourselves to weekends that were not busy, there was no way I could sleep in her room every night, my parents would have grown suspicious. We had not done anything in over a month, on a Saturday night, I was finally able to stay in her room. I wanted her so bad, that when we started to grope each other hungrily, my sister stuck her tongue in my mouth and we began to make out, OMG it was so good, I stripped her underwear off and for the first time in my life I went down and began to lick and suck her pussy, my sister started to breathe so loudly, her hips bucking into my face, I could feel her pussy getting wetter and wetter, I was practically drinking it, it was then that I noticed my sister moaning, I was terrified that my parents would hear so I covered her mouth with my hand and made her quiet down,  I went back to licking and sucking her pussy, fingering it, I could not  get enough, I felt my sisters legs trembling and shaking and then I  felt her cum, she was breathing heavy and moaned loudly, I was so scared I jumped and ran back to my room, just in time to beat my mother who got up to ask my sister what was wrong. My sister told my  mother she must have had a bad dream. After a while I heard my sister crawling on my floor in my bedroom, she got into bed with me and asked me to lick her where she pees. I licked and sucked her pussy all night, she sucked my little package and it felt so fucking good.

We were so excited about this that we could not stay away from each other, even on school nights we risked getting caught, sneaking down the hallway into each others rooms, she would suck my dick, I would eat her pussy, we would dry hump. It was heaven. We NEVER discussed it with one another during the day, ever. I would try to put it in her pussy but she would tell me no, she didn’t want to do ‘that'. 

When I was in (X) grade, I snuck into my sisters room, I could not wait to taste her, to eat her pussy and to dry fuck her. By this time, I had hair on my cock and it was getting a bigger, my sisters tits were getting rounder and fuller though still small, I would cum in my sisters mouth and she would spit it up on to my stomach or back on to my cock. We were doing our normal routine when I laid my sister back, put my cock on her pussy and started to trace her pussy lips with my hard cock, I inserted just the tip, I had done this before, but had never went farther than that. While tracing my sisters pussy lips and inserting the tip in and out, my sister grabbed my face, pulled it down, stuck her tongue in my mouth and began to kiss me very tenderly and softly, she than grabbed my swollen, throbbing cock and began to guide it into her wet pussy. I couldn’t believe it! I was in, I started to slide in and out very slowly, lowering myself onto her as her hips rose up to meet mine, we  moved into one another, when our hips would meet, we would grind  against one another so hard. It was fucking unreal! I pumped into my  sister harder and faster, she began to moan and I had to cover her  mouth with my palm, and I shot my load in her in 45 seconds, just dumped it inside her. I was so fucking hard that I just kept pumping slow and deep, when she came I pumped as hard and fast as I could, she bit into my hand so hard that she made me bleed. For the next week we were terrified until she had her period.

After that, we could not get enough. I would rush home from school so that I could fuck my sister before my parents got home. My father worked late hours, my mother went to work twice a week in my dads firm, it was on those days that we would rush home and just fuck, then at night I would sneak in her room and fuck her again. We did this all through school. I had girlfriends, and my sister had boyfriends, but for whatever reason, she did not fuck  them, she wanted to be known as a good girl, we lived in a smaller close-knit town and she knew it would get out. I was secretly glad, I was perfectly content to have her to myself. We almost got caught more than a few times, it is a miracle that we never got caught or that she never got pregnant. There were a couple of times when we would get carried away and I would cum inside her, then we would be all shook up until she got her period. Normally I would fuck her, pull out and spray it all over her stomach or ass.

Than my sister went to college and left me home alone. I had been having huge amounts of sex for five years and then boom, it was gone. She came home for thanksgiving and I could not wait to stick my cock in her. When she got home we could barely contain our excitement. When my sister saw me, she gave me a strong firm hug, but nothing overt, our whole family was there. It was torture, the waiting, finally, my sister  said she wanted to visit friends and asked me if I wanted go with  her. We told my parents that we would be back for dinner. We didn’t  even get down the street before my cock was out and my sister was  sucking me off, I was so torqued that I blew in her mouth in less than  a minute. I took her to the apple orchard , parked way in the back,  pulled my sister out, laid her up against the trunk and buried my cock in her. We fucked for a little bit but it was cold out and we didn’t have a lot of time. We went home had thanksgiving dinner with all our family, aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, everyone wanting my sisters time and to hear about college. Finally everyone was gone. Of course, that night, I snuck back into her room and banged her out all night. She was home for three days and we must have fucked 15 times. We kept it like that my senior year, fucking on vacations. But the summer I graduated, my sister started an internship and was gone most of the summer, we only fucked a couple of times.

I went to college near home in Southern California, my sister went to school in Arizona, we rarely saw one another anymore, she of course, being away from home and no longer worried about reputation had no shortage of boyfriends. We never once spoke of what we had shared all of those years, and despite the fact that we had fucked each other over and over, we still stayed close and there was no awkwardness between us. When my sister was 24 she married a good guy, he had a career, she had kids and they have an awesome life. I did not get married until I was 31, but I now have children, a great wife, career etc.

Last winter my grandmother died, we did not see her much over the last ten years, kind of grew apart. For the funeral, my sister called and asked me if I was taking my family, I told her no, that we just had too much going on and that I would be going to Wisconsin on my own. My sister said she was going alone as well. We flew together to WI, checked into our rooms, our whole family was there. We all went out to dinner, visited cousins we hardly knew, you know the deal. That first night, alone in my room, my sister called, asked me to come over, said she could not sleep. I of course told her that I would be right over. When I got to the room, my sister was wearing nothing but a tshirt, her hips were full, her stomach had a little pooch to it, her breasts were smaller and they sagged, but she looked fucking delicious. My cock immediately got hard, hard like when I was 13. I hugged and held her close, she ran her hands around my back and shoulders, finally our lips met and we started to kiss, slowly, my hands exploring her body, a body I had not touched in almost 20 years, I pulled her t-shirt off as she pulled my sweats down, grasped my cock in her hand and went down to suck it. It was like old times. We fucked all night every night, which was tricky sneaking in and out of her room with my family all staying in the same hotel. We could not get enough of one another. 

We went home and did not talk for more then a month. Than my sister called my office, asked if we could have lunch. At lunch, she told me  that the best sex she had ever had in her life was with me when we were kids. She is horny and sexually frustrated, told me sex with her husband was a rare occurrence and not very good. To my surprise she had been cheating on her husband, but is worried about getting caught or having someone get attached and the risk of losing her kids and what she has at home is to much stress on her. She asked me if we could start fucking again every now and than. Of course told her yes. She lives about 40 miles away from me. We meet every now and than and break a piece off. Although I wish we met more often, I love when our schedules allow for us to meet up.

I am thinking back to that  first night when I first ground my young cock between her buttcheeks, what if I had not had the balls to do that? I probably would never have had the experiences that I had, and what a shame that would have been. I have never spoken of this to anyone. My sister told me that in college, she drunkenly told a friend of hers that she was attracted to her 'brother' and that her friend looked at her as if she had sprouted an arm out of the top of her head. After that, she wisely kept it to herself.

I do not know why I felt the need to talk about this, but it has been awesome and liberating. I am not in love with my sister, and she is not  in love with me, it is just sex, but great fucking sex and I do not  ever want to give it or her up again. I know that everyone is going to  think we are hillbillies, whatever, I could give a shit, and I bet this  goes on a lot more than we know of. I have been looking online for similar stories and experiences, but what I find is mostly fantasy. Finally, here on Reddit, I’ve found some real people with real experiences like mine. If you want to share, hit my inbox, if you’re genuine, I’ll share pics and experiences. "
1sywng,2,2013-12-15,I'm (22/F) falling for my friend (24/M) and I don't know whether I should try to pursue it.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1sywng/im_22f_falling_for_my_friend_24m_and_i_dont_know/,"Guy and I met over a year ago, while we were both dating someone at the time, so we simply became friends. A few months after that, I was going through a terribly rough breakup (and still have my occasional moments of weakness), and this guy was well aware of it as we would talk about it occasionally and he gave great advice and was just in general a great listener.

He on the other hand never really mentioned his girlfriend. I knew he was dating someone because of Facebook (although he never publicized the relationship status) but he brought her up maybe a handful of times we hung out. Granted, we never spent that much time hanging out together (maybe drinks once every few months and the occasional text) but the topic would never really come up in conversation. The only time I remember him saying anything specific about her was when we were talking about what we did during the weekends in our downtime - I jokingly said that I no longer had any friends, because many of my friends from uni went into investment banking after school and it became really difficult to make plans with someone whose life revolved around their BlackBerry. His girlfriend, I believe, is in banking as well - and he said with a dejected tone ""I know."" And looked away. I didn't really know what to say so I changed the subject. This was several months ago.

Anyway, fast forward - I really enjoy spending time with this guy and just being in his company, but I have always respected the fact that he was in a relationship and was always very platonic. What started out as simply attraction (I don't think you can help whom you're attracted to, so I didn't act on it at all, but it always registered in my mind that he was attractive) is starting to become a full-on crush on my part. It's significant for me personally because I've had a hard time forming any emotional connection (or feeling anything for any guy) since my breakup last year, and I'm just kinda glad it's this guy I'm falling for because he's someone I know and trust.

My dilemma is: I have no idea whether he is still in a relationship. I haven't been able to confirm one way or the other whether he and the girl are still dating (although the signs on social media point to no - but then I could also be biased. And even if he is now single, it would be a fairly recent development). We were supposed to hang out last week to grab drinks to ""celebrate"" his belated birthday/his graduating from grad school/his last day of his internship, but he had to raincheck last minute because his day at the office ran late. Almost every time we've made plans in the past, he's followed through, and the times that he couldn't, he always came back with a proposal for a later day, so I don't really have reason to believe that he's lying. And we still interact on social media (if that's anything). But I leave the country for the holidays in a few days and he knows it, and he said ""We'll make it happen :)"" and hasn't said anything. So I'm waiting for him to say something now about drinks.

I would love to give us a chance if he does as well, but I just simply like this guy so much as a person (beyond any romantic attraction whatsoever) that I think I'd be okay with being in the friendzone, and I really don't want to ruin my friendship with him. But reddit, any advice on even how to approach this subject with him? Should I even try? We've always hung out very platonically but the last time I saw him, it was definitely more physical (as in the chemistry was palpable even to strangers who remarked on it, if that makes sense).

TL;DR: Met this guy while we were dating other people - became friends. Slowly developing attraction towards him: the first guy I've truly had feelings towards since my really rough breakup last year - the more I get to know him, the more I feel myself falling for him. Not sure if he's still single, not sure how to ask, not sure if it's even worth pursuing.

PS. So sorry for how long this is! Thanks for reading. I hope it made sense."
1t4gps,3,2013-12-17,I think I know what the courage and stupidity meters are for.,losermeetsworld,KerbalSpaceProgram,https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1t4gps/i_think_i_know_what_the_courage_and_stupidity/,"Just a theory, no idea what they're for anyway. But I think eventually, courage and stupidity will play into how much science you get out of experiments performed in career mode. I think the 'aptitude' of the entity performing the experiment will also play into how much science is gleaned from the data.

Let's say you have a computer core piloting a science drone around space. When it performs experiments, it can only record objective measurements such as temperature, time, pressure, exposure to radiation, light refraction, etc, and lacks the ability to make subjective observations or use logic to draw useful conclusions in real time. So, computer - performed experiments would all have a flat multiplier, such as 60%, so that you get 60% of the science that that experiment would produce (before transmission). The lost 40% would symbolize the subjective observations lost on a computer.

Now, the experiments will be divided into two categories, those that require more bravery, and those that require more brains. Some experiments are risky, like EVA reports and taking surface samples, and as such, a Kerman who has a full courage bar gets a multiplier of 100% because he's calm and collected enough to perform the experiment to the best of his abilities, whereas a Kerman with an empty courage bar gets a 0% multiplier or maybe a very small one like 10% because he's too busy pissing his spacesuit in terror to file a satisfactory report.

Other experiments, like running atmospheric analyses or taking gravioli measurements from the safety of your ship's cabin don't require a lot of courage, but, they take a lot of brains to interpret, and a lot of brains just to get a good reading from the complex equipment. So, a Kerman with a full intelligence bar will be able to properly read the equipment, interpret the results, and make inferences and connections while he does so, and as such, gets a 100% multiplier. A Kerman with an empty intelligence bar, however, probably got the job because they needed to round out the numbers in the Capsule after Jeb never showed up and they had an intern standing around, and as such, has never even seen an atmospheric barometer let alone heard of Gravioli. So, his experiment's reports will get a multiplier of 0% - 10%, since his end goal was mostly trying to figure out how to turn the thing on. 

I think it makes sense. Even the dumbest person on an EVA trip can make a lot of observations that can scientifically useful so long as they are collected and calm, but even the smartest person will be totally useless if they are terrified out of their mind. 

To back up my theory, look at the three default pilots:

Jeb Kerman- Perfectly middle of the road. Brave, not too brave, smart, not too smart.

Bob Kerman- Very smart, but cowardly.

Bill Kerman-  Pretty dumb but pretty brave.

Following my theory, the three archetypes of Kerbonauts are built into the game by default, almost to purposefully fill the three man module: the smart guy who gets queasy to hold down the fort and tinker with the computers, the all around guy to assist him, and the dumb brave guy to go climb around outside the ship and play on the surface. 

Just a thought! What do you think? Ents, solid [8] on this."

I gave up my first-year internship with the Attorney General after a couple weeks, when the stinky brown mess hit the oscillating bladed ceiling unit, mainly because I was involved in some high profile cases and, as I told my supervising attorney, with everything going on I wasn't sure I could perform at the level needed, and would rather resign than destroy a case because of my problems at home.  The problems continued after first year, hell, they multiplied.  Grandparents' dying, car totaled, wife and I separated.  I thought about withdrawing, but muscled through because I was already 30, I didn't want to lose my scholarship, and I needed to be able to find my balance...plus I was going to lose my mind if I didn't have something to keep my rooted in reality.

Resigned law review.  I couldn't sync the time up with my parental obligations, same issue as with the internship.  My grades took a hit as well...went from Top 3% to top 20% of my class.  Became a better father, so there's that, and eventually my wife and I reconciled.  At the end of second year I even managed to land an internship...which ended when the case I was specifically hired for was dismissed in NYC.  So, I sort of became a hired gun.  Dad knew some people who needed help, and I ended up flying all over the country for three months doing multiple ""clerk"" stints for specific matters with various offices, in a wide variety of practice areas.

Third year, I'm in the civil clinic.  Loving it.  All of my clients are satisfied, the supervising attorneys are blown away by the work, I'm winning my cases or, more importantly, keeping them from ever coming to court by getting the settlements we want.  Still no job though, and I'm waiting on my grades for this semester...but I screwed a final royally (1/3 of the actual analysis I needed to do got on paper, and the exam length was shortened to two hours from three at the last minute).  Other finals, I'm fairly confident I'll come in above the curve.  

The plan, though...well, Dad's office is slowing down.  Not his fault, just his work exploded, and he hired a good number of young associates last year.  I still have a slot if I want it, and it's not a bad option, except for the following:

1)  My wife now has her career, in a very specialized area, and she can't pursue it in my hometown.

2)  I'm not sure I want to practice back home.  

3)  We can't stay here, as her family is roughly crazier than a box of methed-up ferrets and it's putting a lot of strain on the home.

So...I'm looking at going solo, or trying to hook up with a current solo, to get the ball rolling.  Heck, we're not even settled on where to take the bar yet.  My contacts here are okay, but minimal in the area we'd move to if we stay (I was focusing on a larger city, but her company wants to transfer her to a smaller town on the other side of the state if we stay).  Back home, good contacts, but there's more stress; we'd be living directly beside my family, who...given the past couple years...aren't too fond of her.  And I have my reservations.  Outside of that, we're debating ""going traveling"" and have a short list of towns where she can be involved in her industry and I could start a practice...

...So, here's the question:  How would someone go about establishing a solo practice in a town with little in the way of connections.  I was around for the start of my father's office, I know how much of a hustle it is, and I'm aware that meeting overhead is unlikely for a decent period of time.  But as a student, I'd like to start contacting practitioners in the areas we've shortlisted and start trying to build some connections.  Email a decent idea for that?  Doing a drive down to ""press the flesh"" with people?

This went on too long.  Here's the TL;DR:  I'd like some advice on opening a small solo practice, possibly in an area where I have currently little to no contacts.

And yes, before it happens:  I know I want to practice.  I'm in my 30's, I grew up in a small practice, I'm aware of the stress, the oversaturation of the market, etc.  I was aware going in, and harbored no illusions about being the ""exception.""  I just want to practice law, make a little money doing it, and eventually be able to not worry too much about money...you know...before I'm 80."

Most people I have talked to (counselors, recruiters, professors) simply say that landing an internship as a sophomore is extremely difficult unless you have extensive connections.  I interviewed for several positions on campus this fall but most told me in the interview they generally didn’t take sophomores (which makes me wonder why they selected me to interview in the first place). Needless to say none of these interviews led to a summer offer save for an invite to a 3 day leadership seminar at a regional firm. 
I really would prefer not to go back to the two jobs I had this past summer (landscaping in the hot sun and working the graveyard shift at the local fast food joint) but I do need the money. What I’m really looking for is a summer job that could give me at least a semblance of professional (ie office) experience as opposed to manual labor. It’s not that I think I’m above this type of work, but I have been doing it for several summers now and I’m looking for a change.  Any advice about finding meaningful summer employment would be greatly appreciated. 

TL;DR I keep being told landing an internship (especially in public accounting) 2 yrs fro graduation is unrealistic. How can I maximize my professional experiences this summer w/o an internship?"

I feel the employment section is the weakest, since I've been in school the entire time and kind of reiterates some of the information I talk about in the projects section. Is the tutoring and teaching assistant stuff relevant? Should I leave that in? Second, I have the most experience with python and Matlab, but I also did some projects/coursework in C++ and Java. Is the way I presented my knowledge of those languages okay? Third, I've only done two big decent sized coding projects as part of my research. I've also done more theoretical stuff. Is that worth talking about, or is it irrelevant? Also the cs related coursework I've done is all self study and online courses. Should I make mention of that and how? I've done a lot more physics and math classroom course work, but it doesn't seem relevant. So I left it out. Should I include my undergrad GPA and honors? My grad school doesn't really do that stuff.

I have been in my current position for 2 years (public practice). I was hired as a receptionist at 26k/yr.

I do everything - payroll, GST returns, T1s, bookkeeping, Notice to readers, all admin, all office A/R &amp; A/P, training interns, you get the point.

After my first year, I got a raise of 10% (which isn't much). I have my review coming up and going to assume my raise will be something similar to last year. I have been talking to a recruiter who says the lowest I can start at a similar position is close to $40k/yr which she said was the industry standard. Although I have learned everything about public working here, I feel I have wasted time working here as I have not been paid what I deserve to be.

I have a BBA and feel confident that I can be at a better position. 

My question is how do I mention to them that I am thinking of leaving cus I know there's no way they can match the industry standard for salary? I don't want to burn any bridges cus I feel I would get a really good reference out of this but at the same time each day here feels really long as I know my skills are being taken advantage of with low salary.

1t401a,0,2013-12-17,[Rant] Newbie here and I need to get this off my chest...Can cannabis make you psychic?,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1t401a/rant_newbie_here_and_i_need_to_get_this_off_my/,"So I'm brand new to smoking and I've been smoking a lot lately. I keep having this feeling and it doesn't go away when I'm sober either. It's just extremely amplified when I'm high and I can't think about anything BUT this thought. It's consuming me to the point where I (a sane and normal person I swear) is so convinced I had to go on reddit and ask. 

TL;DR Can cannabis make you psychic? **READ THE LONG STORY, YOU MIGHT MAKE HALF A MILLION BUCKS**

Long story...

I'm not a believer in psychics or spirits or stones and gems or any of that crap. I've always been a straight A student. I'm a computer programmer by profession and I'm a pretty normal guy. Once again, I DON'T BELIEVE IN PSYCHICS. Seriously, these people are scam artists. However, throughout my life things have always worked perfectly for me. When I'm in a rough spot or need something to happen, it ALWAYS happens. Let me present three examples...

-In high school one day, I was walking in the hallway and didn't do my homework for the first time. At that very moment, a thought came to me: my math teacher who did not miss a single day all year was absent that very day. I walked down the stairs to walk into the room to see a substitute teacher sitting at the desk.

-I consider myself a hard worker. I was a full time college student, worked a 32 hour internship, and worked out every weekday kickboxing. I was basically waking up at 5 and getting home at 9. One day out of nowhere, I got sick during class. This was the 1 out of 2 days the entire year that I took a day off. At the train station (above ground) while I was waiting, out of nowhere my ex texted me. We broke up years ago in high school (it lasted like 3 days). Even though we had broken up, we had always been good friends. She lived about an hour and a half away by public transportation. This was the one day that she decided to be around the area and asked if I wanted to get halal food with her (we had always talked about it). A couple of weeks prior I had said yes to my friend to attend a stupid dance run by a club (in all my years, and even then the only dances I went to were prom). I had said yes because she had advertised to me so much about it because her club was running it (no, she wasn't in to me). So yeah, took my ex to the dance as my date which led to happy relationship 2 years going.

Here are the probabilities:
=time spent going to and at home that day that were suitable for a girl to come over: 8/24 
=days I was sick out of days I was working (gonna round down a lot to be very conservative): 2/255
=days she even close to where I lived by public transportation:  2/365


You do the fucking math.  1/61,593. Okay, not convinced yet?

-Me and my girl were going to the deli and a thought popped into my head: What if I made a wager with my girlfriend? I only play $1 scratches. I told her that I could buy a scratch ticket and win it right now. She laughed her ass off and said sure. I basically concentrated really hard and treated it like a fact - like I did for my math teacher to be absent. The trick was you had to have total conviction / concentration. You have to treat it like fact and like there is no doubt in your mind that this is the truth. I won $10 off that card ( the most I've ever won on a $1 scratch to date ). She has never doubted me since.

So yeah, I feel like I'm going crazy. This semester, I'm not sure what happened but I basically failed all my classes except one. I hit the lowest point of my life a couple weeks ago (before I started smoking!) when I basically woke up one day, didn't feel like going to take the midterm because I was too lazy, and dropped Calc 2. I didn't even pass my Anthro 101 class. 

Once I started smoking, all I could not stop thinking about was the word billionaire. I started looking at luxury homes nonstop. I have always at the very least been a 3.4 GPA student. I am a computer programmer by profession (I've worked for some of the largest retailers and banks in the country). I have never ever felt like dropping out or straying from the path. I've always been good academically. The only thought I have now is I'm going to become a multibillionaire. I ballooned from 203 to a massive 265 (the highest I've been my entire life). I found myself in $1100 debt and had to borrow money from friends. That is when I reached the lowest point of my life. I had lost my health, my grades, and my finances. There was nothing I had left. That's when I started smoking, and during that time I had an idea for an app. These days, all I could think about was that I reached the lowest point of life to bounce back to the highest. I would tell this story years later and laugh back at my problems. My first startup failed, but I'd always felt like I was destined to succeed. This thought took me over so deeply. I can't sleep without thinking about how rich I'm going to become and what I'm going to do with that money.

Today I am much healthier (248 and dropping fast), picking my grades up, and just finished a huge freelance job which gives me enough money for months. I still can't get this idea out of my head however. I thought the odds were so rare to become a billionaire, but then I kept realizing things I hadn't noticed before. I won't go into detail, but everything I've ever put my mind to as my goal, I have always succeeded.

This thought is consuming me so deeply and I never believed it...but I had to ask someone who I don't know in real life.

Can cannabis connect you somehow and make you a psychic? Can destiny be telling me I'm destined for great things and to become a multibillionaire? If you believe me, tell me what you thought in the comments. If I do end up becoming a multibillionaire, I'll give each of you $500,000 I promise."

Is there a way to hedge BTC if the price falls? I don't think you can short them. Google searches provide me with too much generic information. I need something more specific. Is there a BTC trader who can help?

Also, I'm going to have to be able to explain to him concisely what, exactly BTC is, and why it's a valid investment. 

My explanation is ""BTC is a digital currency that allows instantaneous international money transfers and purchases anonymously. It is a valid investment for the same reasons Gold or Silver are valid investments, except that this actually allows for purchases."" How does that sound? 

What are the security concerns with BTC? (I have googled, but I want your opinion as well)

What are the risks vs. rewards? 

What is the potential market cap of BTC?

I would like to eventually build a social music sharing website, but would also like to learn Python for general coding purposes and to pursue my interest in machine learning and AI in general. My time and energy is quite limited, however, so I need to prioritise my pursuits. **Given a time span of one year, would it be more worthwhile to focus on Python** projects that incorporate AI of some sort; **or to learn web dev skills** to get the music websites up and running, **then add on machine learning/NLP features?** Basically, I feel like the Python projects would be more relevant to developing AI skills, but less beneficial to the world, whilst the music websites would actually fill a gap in the market.

***&lt;/SHORT VERSION&gt;***

***&lt;LONG VERSION&gt;***

**Definite Goals:**

* Have a well-designed blog/website up where I can also host my programming projects
* Have a demonstrable coding project done within a year
*  Become proficient at OOP
* Learn Python


**Tentative Projects:**

* A variety of swarm intelligence exercises (think StarLogo)
* A website where people write about their experiences with particular songs, enabling an exploratory mode where recommendations are given based on the similarity of your experience with someone else's (using NLP)
* A social music sharing website (think Facebook groups with functionality geared towards sharing music)


**Constraints:**

* Limited time and energy (heavy university workload)
* Currently doing General Engineering, with very little programming in the coursework (C++ only) - I only specialise next year
* Would preferably like to explore machine learning, NLP, AI, genetic algorithms or computational creativity (I find these topics very interesting)
* Would prefer a career that utilises the Information and Computer Engineering degree I will eventually get, i.e. AI/machine learning focus over web dev


**Current Skill Level:**

* 1st Year uni knowledge of C and C++
* 2 month internship doing basic work with C


For the blog, I intend to use WordPress to get it up and running so I can do some writing ASAP, but **in future, I'm not sure if I should focus on developing my WordPress skills**, or if I should learn JS or perhaps Flask (so I can build my Python skills simultaneously), in order to further develop the site.

Basically, my dilemma is whether to **focus on basic web dev skills** right now so I can eventually get either one of the two big music based projects going, or to **focus on learning Python**, so I can build interesting (but initially fairly useless) swarm intelligence/computational creativity apps. **I really want to be able to build the music websites some day**, as I feel like there aren't any social music websites out there that do exactly what I want; **yet I fear the learning curve for web dev skills would mean I won't be able to get anything done in the limited amount of time I have**.

Everything was running fine, no crazy issues. That being said, a couple of weeks in on the job he hears people talking about using the ""long distance"" email account for communicating with clients.

This obviously set out some alarm bells. He goes and asks about this long distance email address thing, which he thought was some company policy he didn't hear of before. Apparently people used some personal email accounts for talking to people living far away, because their company emails only worked for small distance emails (what?).

It seems that everyone in the company did this, it was common practice.He goes and checks the server it was connected and sending to the internet and any address just fine. The problem was, emails were getting timed out almost instantly. The old solaris based server had set the timeout to 0 and if the connection was fast enough emails could get trough just fine, otherwise they would disappear into thin air. Thus only recipients 'close' enough could receive them. The problem had been there since they first started, so people just saw it as the norm."

Greg Thompson and Howard Palmer had the idea of multi-player and that was done by connecting 2 Imlacs with serial ports.  
Greg Thompson continued working on it in college at MIT in 1974. He added client server and ARPANET(internet predecessor). A level editor was added and a host terminal was added so they could view all the people playing. It was multiplayer at that point.  
In 1977 Thompson and others built a Maze War arcade with networked multiplayer and added four level mazes. Players could go up and down.


This is the same year a programmer at Xerox PARC rewrote it for the Alto. Maze War had used vector graphics, but Xerox PARC added raster graphics, Ethernet and PARC Universal Packet support was added. We still use raster graphics and Ethernet today.
Some programmers at PARC began cheating in Maze War(wall hacking). Even though PARC had some of the most valuable programming developments of the time stored on their servers. Only Maze War was encrypted and due to hackers and cheaters.

Like many of my friends living in the south east of England, after going to university for a few years I picked up some generic temp/office admin work, which would invariably lead to us to do such tasks as:

helping out senior people with simple powerpoint work
cleansing some data in a bespoke database (which we would then learn how to use as a byproduct)
generally doing things in excel, software testing, basic marketing activities etc.

Some of these jobs went nowhere, but for most of us we eventually found a job that became permanent.

None of this was part of a 'graduate scheme' it was just picking a simple job and then using that opportunity to shine, by being hugely helpful, working long hours and showing that we can do more than just the work we were set etc.

Generally making our bosses look good helped.  Pay would be between £9-£12 an hour, with options of overtime when needed.

These jobs were usually with large media/finance firms based in the City.

Question - do these kind of temp jobs simply not exist any more?  Were we just lucky at the time?

I can't imagine having to do some kind of unpaid job to prove that I'm capable of doing the job I'm already doing.

Doing generic office admin allowed me to learn office IT systems, how departments fit together, and eventually get into a consulting role.

Why is so much store put in 'getting a graduate job' or getting an internship?  These jobs don't seem to offer much more than simply getting an office job to help a senior manager out...?

Or maybe my peers and I were just lucky, right place/right time?"

In other news I made contact with the electro tigers. The pure energy aspect of their bodies has deteriorated their brains. They have become feral and formed a tribe deep within the vents. I also found out they can't be killed. They can just recharge by going into the power grid. 

It turns out they also have a leader... Someone who hates the facility after he was killed be someone I will not mention. Jeff is leading the tribe of electro tigers and he is pissed...

I graduated in August 2013 but lack professional experience due to poor planning and because I was taking summer classes/working. In addition to this my GPA is 2.3. 

I find it difficult to be a top candidate for entry level positions because of my GPA and lack of experience. I'd be willing to intern but most companies are looking for current students, should I still apply to them?

1t2nos,3,2013-12-17,Student Loan Help!,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1t2nos/student_loan_help/,"I'm going into my 2nd semester of my Junior year. I spent my first 2 years at a CC so I don't have any debt besides my 1st semester of my Junior year (which just ended). I took out a private loan for my 1st semester at the University (around 10k with housing) because my family doesn't qualify to get financial aid based on income.

What are my options for 2nd semester besides taking out another private loan (for the exact same amount)? I know I can do the direct stafford loan but thats only $7,500 per year, where my cost is about 20k per year (including housing). I also don't want to involve my parents credit. They did co-sign on my private loan, but if I understand correctly, my parents will be the primary borrower on the government loans because I am a dependent (please correct me if I'm wrong).

For my educational situation, I am very happy with my major choice, I have a paid internship this summer, and most likely (due to this internship) will have a job paying ~50k once I'm out of school in May 2015. I already make small payments on my private loan even though I'm not graduating until 2015.

Also, this is a little urgent because my first payment for my Spring semester is due on January 3rd of 2014 (i just found this out today).

1t2mav,3,2013-12-17,My life is heading nowhere,Tharagar,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1t2mav/my_life_is_heading_nowhere/,"I am writing this here because I can't bear to hold it only to myself anymore. 

First of all, I must apologize for many reasons. The first and least reason is about the quality of my English. I do not usually write in anything else than French so, please, be indulgent. The second reason is about the situation which brings me pain itself. I had a fairly easy life and still have a lot of things others would have dreamed of at that time and I consider myself lucky to have had those things, but they do not erase of ease the pain. I apologize for that weakness and loathing toward what would seem for many as an easy way of life. The last apology I must make is about the length. I do not expect someone to read it whole and if you just read those words and do not wish to continue any further, I would easily understand.

I have been thinking a lot about suicide recently. My way of life has changed a lot and painful thoughts and memories are rushing back. I should give you a quick glance at what happened before. 

It all began in high school. Back then, I was one of those kids who are considered nerds. I was the kind of kid who had his first black eye at 6. Playing D&amp;D, card games, video games, that kind of kid. It was my way to escape. I escaped hostility from my classmates. On good days, I was kind of invisible, which was not as bad as it may seem. On bad days, I made a mistake and got laughed at for what seemed an eternity. On really bad days, people picked at me for a laugh. Never with physical violence, only words. Before entering high school, one of my fears was to think of myself better than I truly was, to overestimate myself. The worst was when a girl hugged me because I was too pitiful (and it was not one of those sincere hugs). No need to tell you that by the end of high school I didn’t know what to think of myself anymore and that I was terrified at the idea of speaking with a girl for every time it happened before, the sole purpose was to laugh at me. 

Cegep began (a kind of 2-3 years advanced studies between high school and college) and I decided to stick to the shadows. Besides, I didn’t know what else to do at that time, the one girl I fell for a year ago telling me she wasn’t interested in me. It was also a time of turmoil in my mind for I didn’t think I wanted to go into psychology anymore (especially for the length of the studies). I was in social science at that time. I found myself a little small haven where I would be almost alone and reflected most of my free time. I already wanted to end my life at that time, thinking I was worth nothing, that there was a purpose behind all that hate towards me. I managed to carry on, dealing with my concentration disorder poorly. I earned my diploma 3 years later (when it should have taken me 2) and took a few months to reflect on my future. I thought about teaching history in Cegep, since that place, despise having stuck to the shadows, was one of the better things that happened to me in a long time. I longed for philosophy, economy, French and English literature, psychology, sociology and especially history. I knew that I wanted to become a scholar. However, statistical chances that I would find a job as a history teacher were incredibly slim so I abandoned that project. 

I worked for 6 months out of school, not knowing where to go. I met a girl that was from the Cegep I went from at that time. It didn’t work out well and 2 weeks after our kind of date, she was with another guy. I do not need to tell you how much it hurt me.

I finally got into a networking class. It was expensive but I went for it since the money would be good in the end. Halfway through it, I wanted to give up. It bore me to no end. I ended up assimilating the whole books for the exams and then forgot everything about them. Everyone pushed me to get that piece of paper when I wanted out. I was burnt. Only one thing kept me going. 

There is a girl at my part time job. She is beautiful, caring, the embodiment of innocence and happiness. I got along incredibly well with her. We were about to go take a coffee together around Christmas last year and I planned to confess my feelings for her then. But I waited too long. One week before we went, I overheard at job that she had a new boyfriend. I was crushed. This was the first time I felt something so strong for someone. It was not just physical desire, it was a lot more. She was not perfect but I could have lived with those flaws. Now, every time I see her with him, I fell like someone is tearing me from the inside.

I almost finished my networking class but my laziness took over and I did not do the last projects. There is uncertainty about whether I’ll finish it or not. I still did my 2 months internship and ended up knowing I could not do one of those cubicle jobs and be happy. In the middle of my internship, the night before the end of the first inscription round, I applied to get into a history baccalaureate. Since then, I am studying history and aiming for what would be my dream job, no matter the odds. 

However, all my willpower is lost. Everything that kept my laziness in check just went away. I barely pass my classes, barely sleep, eat less than 2 meals a day in average and just drown myself in video games to forget the pain and problems. I feel like I have no future, no hope and that no girl with a bit of judgment would open her heart to me. 

I am now 24, hopeless, weak and lonely. I made myself a promise at 20 that by 25, if nothing would have gotten better, if no one ever opened their heart to me, if I failed to rise, I would forfeit my life. 

Do not misunderstand. I do not hate myself. I hate my laziness and my lack of charisma but I do not fundamentally hate who I came to be. I just feel I am wrong by not hating it."

1t295a,8,2013-12-16,I Feel Left Behind,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1t295a/i_feel_left_behind/,"I'm getting tired of carrying this and I didn't know where else to put it, so here it is.

I feel behind in life. I feel like a failure. There was a time when I was doing well in a large university in the engineering program there. I felt like I could have pride in the material I was taking on. Then, I fell into a depression. A personal family issue that I tried to bury came bubbling up and every time I tried to force it down and keep going it only got worse. This, coupled with my already poor study skills, drove my grades into the ground. Eventually, I couldn't drag myself out of bed before 2pm. Finally, I just withdrew out of desperation. I had no idea what to do, and I panicked after I couldn't get out of the way of my own pride and put myself through 2 extra semesters that I simply couldn't pass. 

So I went home. I went to a therapist and talked it out as much as I could. It was one of the few things I've done that I was actually proud of doing. I felt better. So I applied to a community college. But now that I'm here, it still sucks. The people who populate the classes here don't make me feel like I'm getting a higher education; I feel like I'm back in some twisted form of high school, and it burns me every time I think about it (prideful, I know). I don't know if this major is what I want, nor do I know if the college I want to get back into will even accept me. I see my friends already on their way down their path, leaving for studying abroad or some internship, and I realize I'm starting over. I'm so far behind. People that I love are leaving, and they were the reasons I was able to get out of bed when I was depressed.  

It just makes me feel so angry. I failed, and now I'm behind. In the near future I may not see the people I care about. They'll have internships or study abroad opportunities or friggin *jobs* that will end with them leaving, and I'll be stuck in this shitty town with just my own bitter disappointment in myself to keep me company. I'm not doing things that make me proud of myself. I have a hard time convincing myself to even put the effort in school because I'm losing steam. It's hard to keep trying when it doesn't look like results are happening. It makes me feel like I wasn't good enough, like I won't amount to anything.

The only reason I'm putting this here is because I don't really have anyone else to tell it to. My friends can't relate because they aren't in this position. My mother basically tells me to get over it, and anytime I share something personal she'll just share it with the rest of the family no matter how much I beg her not to. Perhaps its a first world problem or something, but it feels very real and very heavy to me. 

My future is uncertain, my present is embarrassing, and the past is painful. I know I have it SO much better than so many. I know I shouldn't complain. I'm just tired of this, and honestly pretty scared for what the future holds for me. I don't know how to make it through this with the same fire I had before. I don't know how to get my optimism and drive back. I just feel stuck, like I'm watching everyone else pass me by, and I desperately don't want that to happen. 

tl;dr: I did shit in school and now I'm starting over at a community college and I feel left behind. I'm disappointed with myself, and scared of people I care about moving on before I have a chance to catch up. "

Them leaving in different countries wasn't ideal, so they fought and broke up.From what I've read, everytime he goes to their country he contacts her, she refuses to see him, the email I read was something like ""Still in a relationship? Not 2 material.Think about it"".

So I went crazy on the gmail account, thousands of chats..they did broke up a couple of years ago, still kept in contact.I searched for the chats close to up becoming oficial...he told her that he likes me, he doesn't love me, but I'm cute and I do a lot around of the house etc.Of course he mentioned they have great banter.

The last time he contacted her was last month when he was to their country, she again said no...but I feel like I'm his second choice.
I can't ask him directly, because privacy is important to him and I betrayed that.

Longtime digger, finally signed up for reddit after lurking for quite some time.  
If I break some cardinal rule of reddit please forgive me.  Anyways, I’m in an interesting 
situation, and need some career advice.  I guess I should start with a little background
info on how I got to where I am today.  This is going to be beyond TL;DR, so prepare yourself.

I started out my venture into CS back in 2005, when I was accepted into Penn State’s Engineering
program at a branch campus.  I spent two years there, studying computer science, and while I 
absolutely loved the coursework and the program, I simply could not keep up with some of the 
math courses.  The college of engineering, as I’m sure you guys are aware, uses many of the 
math and physics courses as cut courses.  Bone crushing exams and the like.  Granted, a lot 
of my failure there was related to my age I feel.  At 18/19 years old I was more interested in
partying and generally being an ass than hitting the books, but hit the books I did.  
My final semester and third run through calc 2 I finally saw some of the writing on the wall.

The effect on my GPA was nearly catastrophic.  I withdrew my final semester with a 
2.02 GPA.  My family was not in the best of financial shape at this point.  My dad lost his 
job a semester in to my first year of school.  Given my academic performance, and the number
 of courses I had dropped, I ended up paying back a lot of grants, not to mention having to 
make student loan payments.  I needed to find a job that paid well enough to cover these 
expenses, as well as my dream of returning to Penn State.

I found that job in the wireless industry.  Selling cell phones believe it or not is actually 
a reasonably decent job.  Not too bad, especially if you’re good at it, and I was.  I spent some
 time working for a small local dealer, and when I left there, I went to one of the major wireless
 carriers in the US.  At this point I was working for a top 20 fortune company, with all the benefits.
  Not a low stress job, continual increases in goals and quotas, management screaming at you
 constantly to improve this metric or that metric.  The silver lining was that I was at this point 
making $60,000 a year.  I parlayed my success at this into a transfer to a store in State College,
 took a $10,000 a year pay cut, and made my journey back into school.  I figured the $6000/yr 
in tuition reimbursement made this only a $4000/yr loss.

Penn State was not as receptive about my return.  I was essentially washed out of the 
computer science and engineering program as I did not receive entrance to a specific major.  
CompSci was just simply not an option, not to mention, 4 years had passed since I’ve last even
 looked at calculus.  Given the field I was in, I did some bureaucratic gymnastics, and weaseled
 my way into Penn State’s Information Sciences and Technology program.

The journey to that point was not without its trials.  This also wasn’t my first rodeo with 
Penn State’s massive bureaucracy.  After leaving school my first instinct was to find out what my
 options were as far as returning goes.  Not meeting entrance to major is a death sentence for an
 engineering student.  I knew that.  I reached out to the college of IST immediately after withdrawing,
 and scheduled an appointment with an academic adviser.  The adviser (who happened to be the
 head of academic advising for the college), that I met with after a 3 hour drive to university park,
 told me that the college of IST was simply not an option for me.  My GPA did not meet their
 requirements as such, and moreso, it seemed that the college of IST was more interested in
 a student fresh out of high school than anyone with the thought of leaving compsci and coming
 to IST.  Regardless, I knew if I had any shot at beginning a career in computer science or a
 related field, I needed some sort of degree, and being the sort of person who insists on finishing
 what they started, another university was simply not an option.  I started at Penn State, my
 father went to Penn State, I had decided on penn state when I was in middle school, I was
 going to graduate with a Penn State degree.

So now, I’m living in the correct geographic area to begin my return to school.  
I read the academic advising handbook, and pretty much every policy Penn State has. 
 First order of business was reenrolling, which was easy enough.  Simple form, hand it to 
the registrar, and for the first time in four years, I was a Penn State student yet again.  
That said, before I could register for classes, I had to clear somewhere along the lines of 
20 separate holds on my registration, two from the college of engineering, one from the 
bursars office who apparently forgot that I had paid them, one from housing regarding a 
4 year old charge for a new light switch plate on my old dorm room, the list goes on.  
I cleared those holds in a few hours’ time, and then could register for classes again. 
 I still was at this point, banned from the college of IST, but for now, I was a 
telecommunications major.  Seemed fitting given my current career.

I found an interesting policy in Penn State’s handbook a few years prior that I bookmarked. (http://handbook.psu.edu/content/academic-renewal) 

&gt; The student's cumulative grade-point average and cumulative credits start anew when he/she enrolls in the first course following the renewal. His/her total credits &gt;are recalculated to include only those courses in which a grade of C or higher was earned and which have been approved by the appropriate dean to fulfill &gt;graduation requirements.
&gt;The student's prior academic record remains on the transcript, including all grades earned prior to renewal. Courses with a grade of D taken before academic renewal &gt;will not satisfy graduation requirements. Courses with a grade of C or better that are approved by the appropriate dean may fulfill graduation requirements.
&gt;Late drop credits are restored; credits used prior to academic renewal are not counted against the student's late drop credit limit.

I met with an adviser in the college of communications, one of the people 
who helped me most along my journey.  She helped me prepare a petition to the 
faculty senate, as I did not meet the less than 2.0 GPA requirement of the policy.  
The faculty senate responded after about a week’s time.  I was granted academic 
renewal, and my GPA was reset.  I then completed some more paperwork, and changed
 my major to Information Sciences and Technology, with a complete fresh start, keeping 
all the credits I had already earned.  Interestingly enough, now that I was an IST major, 
I needed an adviser in the college of IST.  I was assigned to the same person who four years 
prior had told me that IST was simply not an option for me.  It’s basically impossible for me 
not to smile a bit each time I walk into her office.

So now I’m working full time, about 50 hours a week, taking about 6-9 credits per semester. 
 My performance at work slips a bit due to my course load, my performance at school slips slightly
 due to my work load.  I fight my way back to being at least an average sales rep and a decent 
student.  I’m at this point at work the person with the most seniority, everyone comes to me with
 complex questions and problems, my hourly rate is almost twice that of a new hire with the company. 
 I’m in a job that I don’t really want to be in.  My passion has always been computers, but I find
 myself more and more out of touch with programming and the computer industry as a whole. 
 My life is consumed by cell phones.  I can’t walk down the street without being able to identify
 every person’s cell phone by brand, model, and carrier.  My manager is constantly riding me
 about sales numbers, and I’m honestly sick of sales.  My heart just simply isn’t in selling cell
 phones at this point, and it’s about time for me to go.  I was let go from that position about a
 month ago at this point.  That said, I stashed enough money away over this time to be able to,
 for the first time in quite a while, return to Penn State full time, and finish my degree.

That brings me to the present.  I’m at this point a full time student.  I expect 
to graduate after fall semester with an Information Sciences and Technology degree, 
with my focus area being Integration and Application.  If you’re interested in reading 
the description of what that exactly is, here is the link to the academic plan for the
 integration and application track.  http://ist.psu.edu/current-students/pdf/IST-ITINT.pdf 
 I still have yet to complete an internship.

Most of my coursework to this point involves systems integration, getting system A
 to talk to system B, data aggregation, etc.  That said, I’ve been exposed to the compsci 
curriculum, and what I can tell you is that I’ve never written anything for school that wasn’t 
in Java or PHP.  No professor has even mentioned a sorting algorithm or the like in my 
coursework.  It’s not the “low level” stuff I sort of expect from CS, but, that said, I did
 complete the first two years of compsci aside from accomplishing the math.  Most of 
the IST program seems hell bent on providing me with an IT consulting job.  I’m not 
100% convinced that’s what I want.

I’m at this point, exactly where I feel I was leaving Penn State the first time.  
I’m about to enter the job market, and I’m not sure I’m 100% prepared for what I’m 
about to enter.  I need to find an internship as a graduation requirement.  I sort of
feel that that is my real chance to break out of the consultant mold and get a job I’d
 be really passionate about and enjoy.  I’m interested in doing some sort of game 
development, as it’s always been sort of a dream job for me.  Looking at the jobs 
I’m interested in, most of them want a BS in Computer Science.  I’ve got an inordinate
 amount of questions, most of which lead to other questions.

* What job titles should I be looking for given my degree and do I want any of those jobs?
* How well does an IST degree stack up to a CompSci degree?
* Will not having a true Computer Science degree hurt me in the field?
* How will I fare in an interview for a CS related job with the degree I have?
* What options do I have to better prepare myself?
* What sort of internship should I be looking for?

Opening by **Gabe Wolf**.

[**Question 1 (Cartik Minst):**](https://soundcloud.com/ifiwereyoushow/episode-2-bounce#t=3:21): I am a male in high school. I recently caught my best friend's girlfriend cheating on him. We have been really close friends for a long time, and I know how upset he would be if he found out. Should I tell him about this, or should I let him find out about it on his own eventually? I already talked to the guy she slept with, and trust me, he got what he deserved.

[**Question 2 (DeJordan Molasses)**](https://soundcloud.com/ifiwereyoushow/episode-2-bounce#t=7:21): I own a cat. It constantly wants to cuddle with me, but I'm allergic. Help! What do I do?

[**Question 3 (Fence L.)**](https://soundcloud.com/ifiwereyoushow/episode-2-bounce#t=9:03): Hey, Amir and Jake. My brother is thinking about buying a motorcycle, but I think it's too dangerous. He wrecked every single car he's owned and has miraculously survived them all. I think if he gets a Harley, he might be pushing his luck. Please help me convince him that he has more to live for, or to convince me that I'm just being overconcerned.

[**Question 4 (Professor van Strassenberg)**](https://soundcloud.com/ifiwereyoushow/episode-2-bounce#t=15:25): Hey, Amir and Jake. Going on vacation with a friend and a group of her friends who I have never met. Hoping to make a move on my friend whilst we're down there. However, would this be considered a bad first impression upon the ex-boyfriend who is part of the group that I don't know. From your long-term admirer in England, Prof. van Strassenberg.

[**Question 5 (Skinny Dennis)**](https://soundcloud.com/ifiwereyoushow/episode-2-bounce#t=19:15): I just moved to the middle of Butt-f Nowhere in Ohio for my internship, and I'm extremely bored with nothing to do. I finished exploring, and the internet here makes an hour show on Netflix take four hours to download. What should I do? Don't say masturbate.

[**Question 6 (Portrend Dale)**](https://soundcloud.com/ifiwereyoushow/episode-2-bounce#t=23:10): What's the fastest possible way to get a six pack? Don't make this a joke about going to the supermarket. So, I'm not fat, I'm really lazy, and I want to spend as few minutes as possible working out. Maybe you guys have some tips. Your friend, Portrend Dale.

[**Question 7 (Sanny San)**](https://soundcloud.com/ifiwereyoushow/episode-2-bounce#t=26:41): Hey, Amir and Jake. Just finished my senior year of high school and have recently met a girl that I like. We live in Long Island, and I'm going to University of Vermont. Which is a six-hour drive from my house. The question is, should I get into a full-on relationship with her considering college is only three months away? If so, do I end the relationship before I go to college or try long distance?

When I look at the courses people who started out in university took, such as the introductory mechanical engineering courses (which my CC doesn't offer) I'm worried I wont have as much of a grasp as them. 

For instance one University I'm looking to transfer to has classes such as Computer Methods in Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Design Graphics, both of which I will have skipped by being an upper division transfer. Can/Should I still take those introductory courses even as an upper division transfer?

Also, a lot of people start getting internships in their junior year. I feel I wont have the connections or the introductory engineering process knowledge to be able to get/do well in any internships. Only some decent math and physics under my belt. I haven't done CAD or anything like that which my classmates will already have experience with.

Am I correct in being worried? And if so what can I do to help get caught up?"

My question is, is there an automatic way to detect if the drupal installation will break if I upgrade PHP to 5.3.3?

I was thinking on checking out http://php.net/migration53 and then check for every thing that was removed/moved in the API(Methods,Variables). But that's a bit too much work.

Also the system is used 24/7 so there's not a lot of maintenance time available and having no development enviroment for drupal makes the upgrade a mystery."

1t73zv,2,2013-12-18,Question about spring internship salaries and living in SF,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1t73zv/question_about_spring_internship_salaries_and/,"I landed an internship with a mid-size firm in San Francisco for the busy season. It runs about 3 months and pays $23/hour + 1.5x pay for overtime.

Since the job could potentially last only 3 months if I don't receive an offer extension, I'm trying to find a place in the city to live on a month-to-month or even weekly basis, which is of course going to be very expensive.

Can anyone with past experience (both in spring acctg internships and/or living in SF) help me guesstimate what my monthly salary will be and what the maximum amount I can reasonably pay for rent is?

According to HR, my position makes ~$48,000/yr, so the simple calculation would be $4,000/mo of income before taxes (and roughly $3,300/mo after taxes). I'm currently looking at a place in the Mission (my own room + bathroom + parking spot) for $1,300/mo which seems high but is something I think I'd be willing to pay if I could afford it, which is what I'm unsure of. 

First of all, do these calculations seem reasonable? Furthermore, does paying almost 40% of my wages just for rent seem absurd? I mean I know SF is considered the least affordable city in the country, but still.... Any input from anyone who has been (or is currently) in this situation would be awesome."
1t71v9,5,2013-12-18,A Frustrated Rant,AngryCyc,txstate,https://www.reddit.com/r/txstate/comments/1t71v9/a_frustrated_rant/,"Just a quick story to vent my frustrations. A couple background facts, I originally was at the Air Force Academy after I graduated highschool, and got medically discharged after a head injury. I also am very close to graduation, needing only 4 foreign language classes after this Fall semester to be completely finished.

So this August, I met with advisors, ODS, Counseling, and heads of my departments because they told me that with my background, I could get my modern language requirements substituted for other things, because I had trouble with languages. So first thing I needed to do was get officially registered with ODS. They needed me to get a copy of a Neuropsych exam that I had undergone a few years back. Alright. I filled out a form so they had the ability to get my medical records from my old hospital. They said they'd get the report, and have someone meet with me in about 3 weeks to talk about my options and for getting the languages substituted.

A month or so later I hadn't heard from them yet, so I went by to ask them. They hadn't received the report from the hospital yet. So my mom dug up our own copy of the report, scanned it, and I emailed it to ODS. I waited another 2 weeks or so for them to contact me and they didn't, so I went by again to ask them about it. They say they still haven't received a copy of the report. Uhh, no I emailed it to you. Really? What's your name again? AngryCyc. *Type type type. Oh. Uhhhh looks like... oh. You did send it, we just didn't put it in your file. Okay. We'll take care of this and have someone call you in a week.

Week later someone did email, told me to set up an appointment with them. I got an appointment the next day. So I went to have a meeting with ODS. In the meeting, the guy tells me that they can let me have extended testing time, and that I can take tests in quieter places. I said great, but I don't need that and what I needed was the languages substituted. Oh. Ummm. Well your neuropsych report didn't have enough on it about language deficiencies. But maybe we can talk to Counseling and work something out. We'll call you in a week or so.

October something-teenth or twentieth, haven't heard anything from them so I email the guy who I had talked to, and he replies saying they don't know anything yet, and that I might need to get further testing (That'll cost about $500+ dollars) so they have enough to get me the substitutions. But they still might be able to work with Counseling to either make the current neuropsych report work, or to get me free testing from some of their interns. So they'll keep talking to Counseling for me. Alright.

Waited a couple more weeks, hearing nothing. So I went to Counseling myself and asked them about it all. The guy I had first met with in August who had told me about getting the substitutions in the first place? He had moved to a different job the next week after I saw him. So they dug up my files from when that guy had met with me, gave them to a new guy to see me, and he went over everything. Basically, I was going to have to meet with the head of the Counseling center so that she could figure out if they could get me more testing for free from the interns that worked there. The problem was, Counseling had no idea what kind of ""tests"" I would need for ODS to be able to help me. There isn't exactly a ""You suck at foreign languages because you had a traumatic brain injury"" test. So Counseling guy told me to go ask ODS about what sort of tests specifically would meet their requirements.

Walk over to ODS. Oh hey, did you guys know that ODS and Counseling are literally 5 feet from eachother? I walk over, ask them about it at the front desk, and they're like... uhhhhh. Hold on. They get me in with the head of ODS because he had been looking at my file too. We sit down real quick and he hands me a note with a list of tests. I walk back over to Counseling, hand it to the guy I had just talked to. He's in the middle of typing up everything about me.

He says the head of Counseling is really busy and doesn't have any free time to schedule in anything, but he says he's going to try to catch her in the hall sometime and tell her about me, and see if he can't get her to meet me for just 10 minutes or so to take care of all this. He's got the tests that ODS wants me to have, they just have to see if any of the interns need to do testing still.

So wait around to hear from her. She eventually calls me during finals week to tell me that the interns can't help me, she's not sure what to do, and in the course of the conversation she pulls up my neuropsych exam and starts looking at it. She kind of stops and says she needs to look up what a couple codes mean. Let me save you some dramatic pause in this story: She eventually figures out what's on my neuropsych exam is exactly what ODS was looking for. She kind of wants to tell them that, but can't because that would violate confidentiality unless I come sign some paper. Great, I can be there in 10 minutes. I drive straight there, sign the paper, and bring a copy next door to ODS, telling them ""The Head of Counseling says my Neuropsych exam should qualify. This paper says she can talk to the Head of ODS about it. Please take care of all this. I haven't registered for classes yet because these are the only classes I need and I'm waiting for this."" It turns out the Head of ODS is there and he sees me, and just has me come back to his office for a minute. I explain it all to him. He says he'll try to get in contact with the Head of Counseling (Again, 5 ft away) sometime so they can figure it out.

Jump ahead to last Wednesday. FINALLY, they have looked at everything, figured out what they needed to, and they can write me the letter I need allowing me to get the classes substituted. Now I just need to get the letter and meet with an advisor so they can get me into the dean of my majors so they can figure out what classes to substitute. I literally ran all over campus that day trying to meet with an advisor who could see me right then to help, seeing as I sort of needed to get this done as soon as possible to register for spring semester.

 I eventually found an advisor, filled out a form I needed to, ran that back to ODS, ran what they gave me back again to the advisor, who finally went to the associate dean's office with me to ask her about it. She said email everything to her and she'd take care of it.

Perfect. I've got everything on my end done that I needed to get done. They just have to do their stuff and they'll get back to me. But I made sure once again to note that I need these classes to register, because they're all I need to graduate and I have nothing else to register for. Alright, everything is done and I can go home for the holidays now.

Friday though, I got an email from the advisor. She said she hasn't heard back from the dean yet, and that she (the advisor) is going to be out Monday and Tuesday, but she'll be back Wednesday (today). She finished the email by saying I should just register for classes so that I don't miss registration times. I replied reminding her that I have nothing to register for since these are my only classes.

Well I didn't hear back until this morning when she called me to tell me my list was in! I can register for those classes, I just need to come in and get it. I'm not there, I'm back home. Okay they can email it to me it'll just take a few hours. Fine fine... I waited and the email came through. I have my classes now. I can register for those, and if I can get all of them I need this spring, I'll graduate! Now to just see if any of those classes aren't full already...

Oh. Hey. What do you know? Registration ended yesterday at 5. I have to wait until January 2nd to even register for these classes.



Well. There's my rant. I know we don't really do much like this on this subreddit but I really just wanted to vent about it. It took almost 5 months to do what should have taken a week or two at most if people had just done their jobs... &gt;.&lt;"
1t703u,2,2013-12-18,"How do I [22 M] get into the ""Friend-Zone"" with this amazing colleague [22 F]?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1t703u/how_do_i_22_m_get_into_the_friendzone_with_this/,"I bet not the most oft asked question, but bear with me!

I have lead a boring friendless/loveless life for the past 22 years without really being too bothered with it, until a couple of months ago after I finished my study. I had made some friends there, but they disappeared as soon as I finished my study due to living in different cities.

Wanting something more out of life besides work/sitting behind a computer, I started being less passive in my life and started to get more sociable to meet new people!

I work as IT in a school, and while I am talkative with the colleagues, we are generally a generation apart, so there is no ""hanging out"". Suddenly, out of nowhere, in comes this amazing, cheery talkative girl working as an intern for 2 months. I chat it up with her at lunch breaks, and we quickly 'click', finding we have a lot of similar interests (movies/videos/music) and just generally having a fun time talking.

As I have said, I feel like I'm alright with having good conversations with people, but going anywhere beyond that is just an invisible line I haven't ever dared/hoped/thought to cross, which I have just begun to realize how silly that is.

So here I am, wanting to have a friend, and finding just the person! But that person will most likely be gone from my life in 1 month, unless I stop being as passive as I always have been. So I thought, what can I do? 

Yesterday we talked about The Hobbit movie being in the cinema, and me being interested in watching it. Then today the idea popped in my head to invite her to join the movies (brilliant, right?), so after intense debate with myself considering the pros and cons of this extremely delicate action, my thoughts went from the hopeless/subtle  ""It won't work, you will alienate her!"" ""Is it too soon, better not do it?"", ""maybe I should just drop a subtle hint, hope she leads on with it"" to the more hopeful and direct ""Just ask her, hope it works out to ""Jeez, it's just a god damn question""

So, in the end, I think I have decided to just be direct with it and through a conversation casually ask her out to see the movie, and if not, just dont be bothered with it. Is this a solid course of action? Am I hopeless? Any advice besides the possibility of a cinema experience?

(tl;dr) I'm sorry that this is a huge post for what is basically ""How do I/what is the best way to invite this person to activities and hope to stay connected?"", but I have just begun to realize that besides knowing to have a conversation how socially hopeless I am, and just writing this out has helped me in my perspective a lot!

----------

UPDATE:

Thanks to all the reassurance that this is indeed  a question that is not a big deal, I casually asked if she wanted to join me, which she wanted to! We shared phone numbers are will be deciding on a date to go to the movies somewhere this month!

Having crossed the ""invisible line"" I was talking about earlier, and now looking back on everything I can't help but feel silly that I made such a gigantic deal out of just a simple question. I'm learning! "

I've come to ask you all for career advice as I'm currently at a game changing point in my career. 

A little background: I'm a 20 year old who has been interning for a very high profile financial corporation for a total of a year and a half now. Although I have one more year of college to go, the company has told me that they will hire me full time, to be in effect by the beginning of next year.

This company, I have been slaving my ass off for a year and a half. I started as a Desktop Support Intern, doing simple helpdesk tasks for 3 months, got dragged on to the infrastructure team as our help desk team was getting outsourced - and have been doing infrastructure related tasks for the past year and 3 months. During this time I've learned more than I could ever be thankful for, but I know I have so much more to learn. I can handle VMWare, SAN, Networking, AD, DNS and FTP better than I ever could in my life, they've taught me so much here. I've put in countless hours. Everyday is  8 am to 5pm. Then school 5pm to 9pm and then working even after 9pm remotely. Even though I was only getting paid $16/hour this entire time, it was so worth all of the hours that I've put in. 

But now it's coming to the point where HR will no longer allow for my company to extend my internship and it's either I get hired or I don't. I talked to my boss about it and he is definite on hiring me. 

So here's where I come to you for help. My boss's boss invited me in to a conference with him to talk about my current situation. He expressed that I have done tremendous amounts of quality work here and that it hasn't gone unnoticed. But he asked me if what I'm currently doing is what exactly I'd like to do. If I get hired on, I could explore other fields in the company: database, production application support, development.. He asked me if that something that I want to do instead of what I'm doing now. If I didn't want to continue IT, he would refer me to other departments and refer me to their open positions.

I love IT, I love what I do, primarily because I'm good at it. I'm good at supporting, troubleshooting and I could tell you how to set up an ESXi host for VMWare blindfolded (well almost), but so many co-workers here tell me that IT is not the place that you want to be your entire life. They tell me that there's a cap at the end of System Administration/Systems Engineering and I believe them. However I'm so comfortable doing what I'm doing now that I haven't thought much in to the future.

What do I do /r/sysadmin? I have to tell my boss's boss by Monday otherwise they won't be able to process this request through HR in time for the new year."

Then, I worked at the second job for 5.5 years. We had a new manager come in 2011. He didn't get along well with women and found reasons to fire three out of the four of us. He got rid of me after I brought up some situations that I thought were abusive to us to HR: throwing books at us and telling us we were worthless idiots, to name two.  The other female transferred to another facility. Patient loads dropped dramatically after his arrival, so I always wrote on applications that I was laid off. 

The next facility I worked at hired in me in anticipation of having more patients, but despite marketing efforts, the patients that were supposed to be filling the center never came, and after a good review at the 90 day mark, and nothing but (what I thought were) daily conversations all managers and employees have while working together to discuss the day's work, I was given a written warning and an action plan because my work wasn't up to par. Seventeen days later, I was fired. 

Now, I'm not getting unemployment because I was discharged. I have an appeal at the end of the month and I'm not sure what to say, especially if they bring up that I was fired from the previous facility as well. I've never been intentionally negligent in my work. I put on a smile for every patient that came through the door, listened to their concerns, and tried to do the best work I could. I worked twelve to thirteen hour shifts, sometimes longer, as I always came in early to get a head start on my work, or stayed late to make sure all tasks were complete. In both jobs, patient volume decreased significantly prior to my getting fired. When patient loads started going down a lot a couple years ago, I went back to school (for IT), but right now I don't have experience, so nobody will hire me. I'm working as hard as I can to do some projects to show my skills. I've graduated now, with my second bachelor's degree, but I can't break past HR to save my life. 

What can I say at the appeal to increase my chances of winning? 

I've listed both firings as layoffs, because I think that's what they really were. How should I bring up my leaving these companies? Can potential employers ask why I departed from the company?

1t6rtb,0,2013-12-18,Help! I need your old emails from Japan,brucenasty,japan,https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/1t6rtb/help_i_need_your_old_emails_from_japan/,"Hey guys. I'm an intern at a company which makes a smart assistant app.  One of the features of our app is that it helps identify certain types of important emails (such as restaurant reservations, boarding passes, bills, etc.) so they can be brought up to you in the app.
The app has been doing well in the US so we are looking to globalize.
It would be great help if you guys could pull out old emails (please censor personal info, and if you forget I will) from companies in Japan, such as TicketPia (this is one example I don't know much Japan's web services).  Whatever I get will be given to my company's engineers so they can identify these emails.
Thanks!"

[Aspiring screenwriter here. I have no contacts in Hollywood, I don't even live in the US. How do I ""break in""? Screenplay competitions? I've read one way to stand out is to actually have your screenplay made, which is a chicken-and-egg problem, but I'm writing something I can shoot for cheap.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4nff9?context=5)|There's a concept within literary representation - it seems like a nice little platitude but it's true: If something is *good,* people will find it. The trick is to keep writing. The mistake most young screenwriters make is they'll have one script, or two or maybe a tv spec. But that's not enough. You need to write something and then write the next thing and keep writing. As you continue to write you work will improve. And writing is comparatively inexpensive as compare to other pursuits.  Now if you really believe you've written something strong then yes filming a short or low budget feature is a fantastic way to get people's attention. Especially if it stands out and is different.  **TLDR** Keep writing, always be writing. But if you can definitely shoot it, it's a better package for your idea, and directing will help you as a screenwriter think about direction and the final look of the movie. 
[I'm writing this *""shootable script""* - few actors and locations, as few special effects as possible. Don't get me wrong, I love when movies are great with just a good script, but it's somewhat limiting - two of my other scripts (one written, outlining the other\) are sci-fi so not as easy to pull off without embarrassing results. What's the game plan for the ones I *can't* shoot?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4nmse?context=5)|In a perfect world: you shoot this short. It's good! It gets attention at some festivals and you'll be introduced to managers/producers and they'll all ask you this question: ""What are you doing *next?*"" The wrong answer is to say I don't know. The right answer is to say, we'll i've written YOUR NEXT MOVIE.  They'll ask you send them your script(s), and assuming they think it's good they'll either ask to represent you or ask to option the script from you. If either, hurray! If only the ladder, then make sure you find a manager to negotiate the option.  In a less than perfect world: the movie is not great, but you learn from it and make another one and another one. Keep plugging away until you're getting the responses from people you want. Cause if friends think its good, then strangers (who might be in a position to help) will think so too.
[What are some of the secrets that happen behind the scenes that only you guys know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4o7zs?context=5)|So many categories to speak of. Well it's no surprise that a lot of actors/actresses have to have a public persona of being affable and fun and are actually complete terrors to work with. That's a given. But it's also kind of surprising to people how much power a young actor is given as compared to say an experienced production designer or AD. It's kind of sad really, the amount of people who work tirelessly (and I mean incredibly long hours) who never get any credit compared to actors who do so little but are the face of the films.
 |Conversely promoting a film is hell on actors. Like film junkets are awful - if you can imagine - you're stuck in the same hotel room for days sometimes. The studio will bring in local, regional and international film critics to ask you the same 5 questions over and over again. And you need to look sharp and respond as if they're asking it for the first time, because that's how movies get sold. 
[I really feel for actors on junkets. I do my best to really engage &amp; connect w/ them in interviews, even for my 5 minutes, and thank them for their time &amp; just project my respect for their endurance!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4qppq?context=5)|You're one of the good ones. Great username btw.
[What are your top 5 favourite movies of all time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4nqzi?context=5)|Casablanca.
 |Shawshank Redemption.
 |Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.
 |City of God.
 |What about you?
[I loved ""Children of Men"".  I consider ""There Will Be Blood"" a modern classic myself.  I know a lot of people didn't like this movie, put I really liked ""City of Ember"".  Also a big fan of ""Dark City""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4qwir?context=5)|The only one I hadn't seen was City of Ember, I worked for the studio that made it, but never got around to watching it. I'll give it a shot. Dark City is amazing, I wish there were more movies like it.
[I've only recently started to have an appreciation for films, but so far it's:  1. Fight Club  2. Oldboy  3. The Lives of Others  4. In Bruges  5. Drive.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4nzpi?context=5)|I mean all those are fantastic films, so I'm going to guess we have similar tastes.
[I'm a senior high school student in southern Ohio who's life dream is to be an actor. What should I be doing now and through college to get out there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4nedl?context=5)|There's no right answer to this question. In my opinion, actors have it the hardest. Because anyone can be a closet writer, director or producer. But part of an actor's job is to put themselves out there constantly and let themselves be seen.
 |From my experience, the actors who have had the most success (obviously talent helps a great deal), is to be in a place where you're able to shine. If that means being in a large production in a small town, do that - because in New York, Los Angeles actors are everywhere and you really need to find a way to stand out.
 |That being said - if you're able I would highly encourage you to try to get to an acting school in either New York or Los Angeles, besides being in a protective environment and being able to hone your craft, you'll also make connections to the people who will (years later) be in a position to hire you.
[Do you think Hollywood has changed? Is it more valuable to be in a series rather than films because of the longevity I.E Game of thrones/Dexter/True Blood/Sopranos ETC.  Who is the humblest person you have met on your journey up the ladder.  Do U have any regrets.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4pxh6?context=5)|Yeah it has changed - it continues to change. It wasn't that long ago that the thought of being a huge actor on a tv show was impossible. But then this market emerged where it gave you more than 2 hours to tell a compelling story.
 |The downside, from an actor's perspective - is that a movie might take 6mo-12mo of your time, but then you're free to go to the next project. Television is more demanding, so if you're the kind of person who like to mix it up - you're locked in. The money might be good - it might be nice for your family to have you in one place but it definitely limits your options.
 |The humblest - I don't know. Most people in the industry are insanely humble - they do such incredible things but unless they're an actor or director no one has heard of them. For my money - I once worked for one of the producers on the original Lord of the Rings. And while he was a great producer - the reason he got the job was because he was old friends with Peter Jackson and when Peter was first in LA, he crashed on his couch. So years later when Peter was pitching the project - he came to his old buddy and they made one of the most successful franchises. And you would never expect it from him but he was very down to earth, he told me one time (while we were waiting for a copier to finish making copies), ""never wish away time - you'll regret it one day."" It stuck with me.
[Hi, thanks for doing this. I'm trying to get a short film together, with the intent to enter competitions and upload on the internet. People have been successful doing this in the past. Any advise on that? also when it comes to shorts what do you think is more important cinematography, writing, acting. Should i be as anal as i am? It must be perfect.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4nvvz?context=5)|Be Anal. That's the best advise. Be Anal.
 |The best filmmakers are anal, they care about detail. I'm sure when they started making shorts they were surrounded by people less concerned about the minute details but because they weren't their shorts were better. That quality attracts others who have a respect for the craft.
 |So what should be good - cinematography, writing or acting? EVERYTHING. But from the perspective of a short I'll say this: a terribly written short can't be saved from the best actors or the greatest cinematographer. However the best written short is hard to screw up - even with terrible cinematography or acting.
 |And yes - I mentioned it elsewhere, but direct a short, direct a bunch. Submit to commercial competitions (not doritos, but smaller ones) - they're a great way to practice and get better with the possibility of getting paid.
 |Filmmaking is a skill, you have to practice to perfect it.
[How much emphasis gets placed on soundtracks? How do most music directors go about finding/selecting music for their films? Does is rely on publishing agents? Is it a director's personal taste? Do many in the industry prefer unknown artists in order to save money financially?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4q49w?context=5)|Movie soundtracks are a dying art. Score aside, most people can cobble together any studio movie soundtrack from their own libraries so there's little demand for what was an incredibly lucrative side business in the 80s/90s.
 |The person you're talking about is called the Music Supervisor. It's their job to suggest and negotiate music/bands for their movies. Most studios have a department that does this - they get credited on each movie (usually on the billboard as well as in the credits - I think this is a contractual vestige of moviemaking from the 80s/90s).
 |However there are movies where a Music Supervisor's work is absolutely necessary so they are good at their job. It's their responsibility to know what's popular, what's going to be popular. And they do that by having relationships with labels and managers. They're constantly sent free samples and its up to them to determine whether they should pitch these bands to the studios (though a lot of the time, it'll be the director demanding they get the rights to a song the director likes).
[In your opinion what are the key elements to a good screenplay?  Also, when developing characters what do you start with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4nozx?context=5)|I think what defines a good screenplay or movie is an original plot. If you've got that then it's just a matter of fine tuning all the other pieces to service the plot.  If I go to the movies I want to see something I haven't seen before. I want to believe that world is real. I want to go on a journey with that character and have them overcome all odds to succeed. That's what I want, so if something does that or even better - surprises me, twists my expectations and turns them on its head - then I know it's a good story.
 |I don't start with characters - I start with plot. Is the plot good, new, interesting, real? If it is all of those then characters within the plot should have those traits too, they're just tools of the larger plot construction anyway.
[Related question: How likely is a screenplay with an original plot to be picked up? It certainly seems that the same old thing gets produced time and time again, while the truly original and interesting stuff is perhaps seen as unmarketable.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce5ga6q?context=5)|If something is truly original, I believe people will gravitate to it. Especially if it's well written.
 |Yes it's easier to invest in something that already has a built in audience, but there's still enough of a demand for original content that people do seek it out.

[Thank you for doing this AMA :\) Is there a possibility/chance to recreate a big film industry similar to Hollywood in emerging big countries? India has Bollywood. Perhaps other countries such as Brazil, or Indonesia able to follow the footsteps?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4omzf?context=5)|Possibly. I think it has to do with language and I think it has to do with culture.
 |The US film industry currently has a rampant case of ""runaway production."" Basically other cities/states in the US and abroad provide tax incentives to major productions to film there. The logic is that the productions will create industry and infrastructure there, because you artificially create demand. The problem is that time and time again, once the tax incentives go away (or there is a higher incentive somewhere else) production leaves. BUT I think if there is little to no internal film industry and you artificially create one with incentives - you HAVE to then encourage local people to use the resources at hand to develop films locally.
 |The reason Bollywood exists as a counter to Hollywood, is that it's not exclusively English nor are the stories particularly Western. So there is a demand for those kind of stories and Hollywood isn't supplying the high-end product, so it's being made locally - and in the case of Bollywood it's being made very well and truthfully in a stronger market than Western cinema.
 |So I think it's possible to create industry in emerging nations, but there has to be a demand for local, cultural product as well as finances available for locals to learn how to create cinema.
[Hi there, I'm really curious about some major movies can turn out really badly (e.g. bad script etc.\)  I understand that getting into hollywood is generally really competitive, but if this is the case then how do movies with terrible direction or acting happen?  Surely the most qualified people get the job, so shouldn't they produce the best work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4p72t?context=5)|It's a tricky question - if you can give me a specific example we can pull apart and try to figure out what went wrong.
 |First thing's first. No one sets out to make a bad movie. When people back a project and put millions of dollars into production, they do this because they are confident that it's going to be a good movie.
 |Through production a number of things can go wrong, a director who had a great vision may turn out to be terrible working with a particular crew. The studio may decide to make revisions into the story to save costs but ultimately cut out what made it good in the first place.
 |An actor chosen because they are a box office draw may turn out to be the wrong person for the role.
 |So many things can go wrong, but there's one thing I guarantee you - the time and effort spent by the crew to make Schindler's List is the exact same that a crew would put in to Prince of Persia. It's just a question of how audiences are going to respond to it.
[Well, what I consider bad movies are those that go straight to DVD. For some reason the producers sometimes decide not to release a movie in theaters, even if it is watchable, and release it right on DVD only. Why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4pjqu?context=5)|I would not be so quick to assume something going straight to DVD/netflix is a bad movie.
 |The industry is changing very quickly. The amount of money it costs to put a film into theaters is tremendous - particularly if you are an indie film. Imagine each theater requires a physical copy of the movie. And imagine that every market you are in requires advertising and marketing. Then you have to do it all over again when you release it on DVD months later - its expensive and only makes sense if you are big studio and have money to burn.
 |For indie films - releasing something straight to dvd/VOD. Means it's cheaper to release and that they only have to do 1 single marketing campaign instead of 2.
 |Sure there are plenty of terrible movies that are made specifically for DVD, but they're trying to hit a particular audience either those that seek out bad ""B movies"" or those knockoffs that look like a popular studio release and they get tricked into buying that one instead. [Link to en.wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockbuster)
[Does your career affect your family life?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4piwp?context=5)|Yeah. It's actually kind of a sad fact, those that do production rarely are able to sustain marriages or family life. I'm not talking about actors or famous directors. I'm talking about the people below who do all the work. On one hand its making movies and you get to travel and experience such amazing things. But it means you're not in control of your schedule. You're also getting paid per project so you really can't say no to a job. It puts a tremendous strain on a relationship - I don't get how some people are able to do it. Personally - it's prevented me from ever being in one place for over a year and as a result I've lost some really great people in pursuit of this dream.
[Do you feel it was worth it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4ppju?context=5)|I'm still hopeful I'll find a balance - find someone who understands the demands.
 |But if I had to chose... well relationships are fleeting and movies live forever.
[Can you tell if the video piracy on interenet is really damaging the market now? I remeber in the old days, when there were Music tape cassettes, and VHS videotapes, everybody were copying music and movies then, but the market seemed stable at that time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4pxud?context=5)|I really can't say - studios/distributors are incredibly protective of numbers for DVD/online sales. So it's hard to say how it's being affected.
 |I assume it is - but I don't know to what extent. Nor do I know what the relationship is to seeing something in poor quality, making me want to seek it out in high quality.
 |All I can tell you is that it's never a good feeling when someone tells you they downloaded your movie - yeah it's great they saw it, but you know if everyone did that - you'd be out of business.
[For a very long time, all I've wanted to do is to become a composer for film. What advice do you have for someone who wants to join the film industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4r086?context=5)|As a composer? We'll always need music - trust me. Your future career is secured - the question is, will you be doing it with a live orchestra or with digital files. I'm inclined to thing the ladder - it's cheaper.
 |There's no direct path for a composer, but I would definitely try to seek out composers you admire. There's always an assistant to a composer who will secretly compose sections of a film's score an eventually work their way up until they have a relationship with a director (or producer) and get hired on all of their projects.
 |But you definitely need to be the best - in order to do that you need to practice, and I assume go to a university. I'd suggest aiming for a program in either LA or NY if you can.
[I'm really been interested in the behind-the-scenes part of the production of a film. What are some day to day responsibilities of a producer during production? What are needed qualifications to get into the production sphere of film? Also, do you know much about the people in charge of film distribution? I'm really interested on how the film gets from the film company to the screen in theaters. Should I look to getting some experience interning? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4rtlm?context=5)|Lotta questions - okay let's see.
 |First thing you need to know is that there are a couple categories of producer. There's a creative producer who helps develop a project (tweaking the story, getting a writer/director/actor attached and ultimately getting it sold.) They oversee the macro problems with the movie.
 |There's also a line producer who deals more in the nitty-gritty of hiring crew and locking down insurance and locations. They're more involved in the micro day-to-day issues of the crew.
 |There's also Exec producers who may only be involved by name or who may be more involved in a creative sense.
 |Personally I'm in the creative department, so my job is mostly about what happens before we start shooting. Once we're in production my day-to-day is mostly just to make sure everything is moving along and that everyone is happy. If a problem comes up it's my job to resolve it as quickly and cheaply as possible.
 |There are no qualifications for this job except prior experience, you get that experience by working under a more experienced producer. And you get that job by being their assistant and you get THAT job by starting as a PA or intern. So yes - take an internship working for a producer if you can.
 |Film distribution is another category altogether - there's the studio side of distribution, where they are just another arm of the studio, they're told what project are coming down the pipeline and they need to manage how it'll get sold and to what markets and when (what is the other compeition for this kind of film in a particular time of year.
 |There's also indie distribution, where you'll seek films out at a festival and if you think you can make money on it - then you'll approach the producers and offer to distribute for them. Because indie is much smaller scale - you attack each project as it comes up and more often then not - your main concern doesn't involve the big studio releases. Your concern is award season and how you can leverage a release date to help your ticket sales to coincide with the oscars.
 |Whew...lotta info - let me know if I missed anything.
[Thanks for replying! I think you answered all of them! Just one more question-sorry- I am going to college next Fall, Should I look have a Business and Entertainment major or take classes in that area?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4sys3?context=5)|Business - I think it has more applications should you decide entertainment isn't for you.
[Do you work for a company and get regular paychecks or are you a contractor/paid by the job? If you get paid by the job how do you survive in between?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4pn4b?context=5)|Per job. I've been fortunate to have a pretty good run these last couple years - I've been working with one director in particular who has had no trouble getting projects financed.
 |For medical - I'm not part of a union, but I get health insurance through a film fund that supports a lot of non-union production people.
 |Otherwise I just try to save up and hope I don't get in a position where I have to go into debt, hopefully the next project will just be around the corner.
 |The real threat is when I'll have to strike out on my own.
[I've always dreamed of being a screenwriter but I'm up in NYC and I'm only 15. What would be the best thing I could do to increase my odds of making it one day? Should I just start writing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4nt2a?context=5)|Of all places to be NYC ain't a bad choice. There are plenty of film studios in New York and New Jersey where plenty of tv shows and indie movies shoot. New York rescinded it's tax incentive last year, but NYC still provides one so I imagine production will continue to stay out there.  WRITE! WRITE! WRITE! At 15 you've got a lot of free time and not a lot of places to spend it - writing is a great way to practice because you'll learn from mistakes about what not to do. And if by the time you're going to college and you want to pursue screenwriting still - then apply to film school - NYU, USC, UCLA. You'll get the chance to work with screenwriters who can help you with your craft and if you're good enough, hopefully send along to their contacts.
[Thanks man, it's really awesome your even talking to me, let alone giving me advice.  Last question, is it really risky trying to get in? What position might i start at?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4w1j5?context=5)|Super risky. Intern/PA?
[Are screenplay contests worth it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4qhpy?context=5)|NO! With the exceptions of the [Nicholl Fellowship](http://www.oscars.org/awards/nicholl/).
 |Any program that expects money from you is not going to help you out. Your best bet is to keep plugging away. It's definitely hard to break in, but I really do believe if your material is good enough, it'll find it's way into the right hands. Cold calling submissions sucks and I don't really recommend it either, but outside of trying to produce your own scripts, I would recommend any other option besides contests.
[What about the Black List?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4uucs?context=5)|Eh jury is still out on the competition. Franklin's annual list of unproduced scripts is awesome if you can get on it. But it's not connected to the screenplay contest side. 
[Is the media portrayal - casting couches, producer scams etc. for Hollywood strugglers as real as they make it out to be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4p6vr?context=5)|Not at all. First off - the casting couch. I have worked on 20 projects that had casting, I also (once upon a time) interned at a casting company. The VAST majority of casting directors are older women and gay men. So the perception that casting directors take advantage of eager young actresses seems ridiculous to me.
 |That being said, I had worked at a talent agency that had some older agents - those who rose to prominence in the 60s-70s and for them, it would not surprise me to hear that they had done that in their day. Now everything is pretty corporate and sanitized. Someone would have to really be an idiot to try and pull that now - the repercussions for a serious casting director would be endless.
[I've been working turning my blog into an ebook &amp; debut novel. I would like develop the book into a tv series. What's the process like for books like Orange is the new black or a series like the Office to come to development?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4rco4?context=5)|I don't know the background behind Orange is the New Black exactly. I know Jenji Kohan had done Weeds based on her personal experiences. And I know Orange is the New Black came after, I had heard her Moth story which I believe was the origin of the book.
 |The Office was a remake of the UK one, which I believe was an original idea kind of based on a radio character Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant created - so I think that's a different route entirely.
 |But the idea is that if you have a novel, the hope would be you also have literary representation too? If not you should seek it out, I think it might not be the worst idea to create an outline explaining how your novel would translate well to television, and assuming you had the gumption to also write a pilot and series bible. Because at the end of the day you're the one who is going to have to go banging down doors to sell the idea, unless your novel/blog is popular enough that it's being sought out from you directly. I hope that makes sense.
[Thank you for the insight! And doing this AMA!! All the best on your current &amp; future projects!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4soch?context=5)|You too.
[Can you explain why suddenly Hollywood started producing a lot of remakes of relatively recent movies? Everybody I know says it is a little bit odd, because useless. Don't they have enough good screenwriters anymore to write something new?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4po1i?context=5)|I disagree a little bit with your premise. Hollywood has been doing remakes, sequels and adaptations for quite some time.
 |Fall of a Nation (1916) was a Sequel to Birth of a Nation (1915).
 |What I will give you is the trend these last 10 years or so is that something original has less financial security then something being remade - something that already has a built-in audience.
 |It's a flawed kind of logic, but it's hard to argue - Harry Potter had been a very succesful book series before they adapted it to film. But that sort of became the ideal financial model - so now studios look for succesful Young Adult novels to turn into films.
 |Same with sequels - Transformers 2 made way more than Transformers. People seek out what they already know.
 |This will keep happening until people stop going to see them. But I doubt that'll change. So we'll keep descending away from originality.
[Do you agree with the ""hollywood is a bloodsucking leech on all that is creative and original"" - discourse, a stance taken by such people as Steven Soderbergh, Nicolas Refn and Mike Stoklasa?  Do you agree that the quality of large Hollywood films (in terms of artistic vision, originality (again\) and so forth\) is worsening, as the same quality on TV is improving?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4sm4g?context=5)|Hmm - I think I have a more nuanced opinion on Hollywood. It's not a bloodsucking leech, I'd put it more to an untamed horse. You can either fight it and risk getting trampled by it. Or you can tame it and make it work for you.  But both TV and film mean you have a boss controlling your budget, so unless you're an incredibly successful indie director it's always going to be the case of trying to protect your art against someone who is trying to make money with it. Sometimes you see eye to eye, sometimes you don't.
[Is there a way for someone with little experience, other than some college, be able to get into the business? I went to a small school and had to drop out when my mom passed. But I just wanted to know if there was anything I could do to save my dream? I have relatively no money to go back to school right now. What small steps could I take to get my foot in the door?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4xb7s?context=5)|Sepooh - I'm sorry about your mother. I'd only suggest to see locally what access you have to try and make some inroads, maybe a local tv station or community theater. Just to try and see if anything gives you an opportunity. Barring that I might try to save up and see if you can move to LA and take classes as a community college like Santa Monica CC.
[What have you made in Hollywood? Anything I can view online?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4ns8y?context=5)|Sorry to have be vague here - I've made it a point to keep my identity private. But I'll say this, the vast majority of what I've worked on - I've only had a very small roll in. I made an independent movie a couple years ago that I was very involved in - and that movie played in theaters and is now available on iTunes.
 |Sorry I can't be more specific.
[I've written YOUR next movie! When will you be ready to produce this masterpiece?! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4sodd?context=5)|As soon as I see your last movie and quickly call your reps to ask how I can get involved in YOUR next project.
 |You gotta earn my interest first. 
[Awe crap. Hope I'm not too late for the party. Here I go.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4ywko?context=5)|Not too late. Here's the truth about directors - it's your job to always be in charge, to always be 100% sure of your decisions and your choices. Secretly to yourself, you know that none of it is true and you're bullshitting - but what makes a great director is convincing people to trust you and you do that by giving off nothing but confidence.
[I've always enjoyed acting. But never had the means to drop what I was doing and head to one if the big acting markets (well...I had the means but I'm always the analytical investor\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4qfr7?context=5)|Sadly, career calculation and acting are opposing forces. If you want to be a successful actor - you have to throw yourself out there and be willing to not see success for many years.
[Any advice for a 33 yo IT guy who is dropping everything to pursue writing/directing/cinematography?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4rp3i?context=5)|I would urge the PA gig, because it'll show you how the job works. If you don't have much of an education in writing/directing/cinematography then once you've been a PA and have a sense for how things run then you can look into school and programs and see if those will be beneficial to you.
[I'm not sure if I should still go the college route for the connections/friendships or just work (I already have offers to PA w/ a producer friend on a TV reality show and I have another friend doing low budget features\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4rp3i?context=5)|Take the PA gig - 100%. Take the feature one first, if it's not an option then the reality TV one. It sounds like you're passionate about pursuing this, though I don't know your background.
[If I had a ""killer"" idea for a sequel or reboot of an existing series/franchise, is it worth trying to flesh out and write or are the rights to original work usually too much of a hurdle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4vs4f?context=5)|Honestly - I'd write it. If you feel really passionately you should write it. Then you should write something original - hopefully when your original script sells you'd be able to arrange a conversation/meeting with the rights holders of the existing series/franchise and pitch them your idea.
[What are your thoughts on contacting industry people directly with ideas? Do you have any advice (e.g. ""when sending ideas to Wes Anderson, throw a mothball in the envelope because he just looks like someone who would appreciate that""\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4vs4f?context=5)|Pretty much everyone has a non-solicitation policy. It covers their ass in case they make something similar to something someone sent and it also saves them from having to sift through the endless terrible stuff people usually send. If you establish yourself as a good writer - then they'll want to meet you or read your material.
[Thanks, I've been an IT tech for a long time, was thinking of getting training as a DIT (maybe RED certified?\) but not sure where to start or if a DIT is a good springboard.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4sunv?context=5)|DIT is not a bad route, its a very niche thing - but every project needs one. That career leads towards being a full time colorist, who are sought after and make something like 6-7 figures. But its a very limited career, it doesn't really provide you the opportunity to see other aspects of the industry - and it'll put you back behind a computer. And I imagine if you're doing IT you want to get on the ground. So again - I highly recommend getting your feet wet with the PA job.

1t5n75,1,2013-12-18,Just can't seem to do well in college at all!,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1t5n75/just_cant_seem_to_do_well_in_college_at_all/,"Hey guys so I messed up a lot freshman year mostly due to my own fault by not attending class and participation etc. I did well for the most part in projects, essays and stuff but it's always participation which fucks things up. For example, I had a 93% in 4 papers in a college writing class but ended up getting a C+ because I was barely there. And then there are finals which for example, are 20% of my grade and end up lowering my average score because I just seem to have a mental block when it comes to tests.

As a result, I was on scholarship probation as well as academic probation. This semester I buckled up, went to as many classes as possible, but could still only end up with a potential 2.5 GPA which would get me out of academic probation but not scholarship probation.

I'm not dumb. I know I'm not because when it comes to my major, I'm pretty good. I have a great background in it especially with the experience I have in jobs and internships. I currently have many paid jobs which are related to my major. I always do well when it comes to research papers, projects and essays. But I just can't seem to get an A. I'm beginning to ponder if college really is for me? I was confident of a 3.0 this semester but my expectations seem higher than they actually should be. I'm struggling to find motivation. I will obviously keep trying harder and harder but if I get another below 3.0 GPA next semester, I don't know what I'd do.

Oh and my parents don't know that I probably won't have scholarship money next semester and I'm scared to tell them.

Any feedback would be appreciated."
1t55h4,9,2013-12-17,"This place is amazing, and I'm going to take the opportunity!",Just_Who_I_Am,outhere,https://www.reddit.com/r/outhere/comments/1t55h4/this_place_is_amazing_and_im_going_to_take_the/,"So this, is a convoluted enough story I don't even know where to begin, be forewarned, wall of text incoming.

First and foremost I guess, I'm gay. This is the second time in my life I've ever said that so clearly, to anyone, nonetheless complete strangers that have formed an incredible family here. 

I'm 22, wrapping up my senior year of college at a very, very prestigious university, and already have a guaranteed job upon graduation. The job is incredible, but requires a lot of discretion, and a very hard to achieve and maintain clearance. Any history of mental health issues are almost always immediately disqualifying, so I've been silently battling some pretty severe depression solo since about the end of high school. I'm doing far better now than I was a little less than a year ago, when I hit rock bottom.

So there was this guy, (obviously, right?), and he was introduced to me by a mutual friend who swore up and down that we had to meet one another because we would be such incredible friends. Well, he was right for once in his life... and this new friend and I hit it off right from the get go. He was soon my closest friend and confidant, and we shared all kinds of ridiculously close things. He told me about his FWB relationship with this girl, and how it made him feel weird and used, and I complained about the challenges of my life and school, and he was always there to help. The only thing I never told him was the one secret I'd never even considered letting out. I quickly fell for him, and you've seen enough unrequited love posts to know how much of a kick in the teeth that almost always is, especially to people with depression and low self esteem already. So it starts eating me away, and I start retreating more and more internally, talking with him less, trying to shield myself from it. All that happens is he gets worried, and I get more and more close to the edge. 

Finally one night I hit rock bottom, I am fully prepared to just end it all, and he senses something, and won't stop texting me. So I get to a point where I realize there's no point in keeping secrets if you're not going to be around, so I lay it on him, that I'm gay, find him to be the most incredible human being on this earth, and I'm ready for him to graciously accept me but tell me he'll never feel the same, and let that be the end.

Instead he opens up that he's been fighting hiding similar feelings his whole life, that he's never felt right with any of the girls he dated, and he knew deep inside he was gay, but never had any chance to let it out until I said that to him. We spent the entire night discussing various aspects of this new found connection, and by the end we're somehow closer than ever, and I know the world is either finally paying me back for some good karma I'd stored up, or was playing the biggest joke on me ever. 

We end up talking more and more, and I agree to take my next break to go visit him where he's going to school, instead of going home to my family. Not too unusual, I hadn't been home for almost a year already, my family is used to my independent nature. So I spend 5 days with him, and we fall head over heels for one another. I left, knowing we were both comfortable where we were, and were together forever. 

Begin long distance relationship, He's more talkative and communicative than I am, so he texts me a lot, but it's amazing. I had never been so close to anybody, and the more I learned and experienced the more I cared for him. He started making more and more comments about coming out, and that was one step I knew I wasn't, and I'm still not ready for based off my family background, career choice, where I'm at in life, what have you. I tried to be supportive, but it started to slowly come between us, and finally he called me one night, to tell me he'd just got off the phone with his mom, and that he'd told her. I told him how strong he was and congratulations and made sure she'd taken it well, every bit the supporting boyfriend, but inside I was a wreck. I slipped back into depression, anxiety about it, about being incidentally outed, about who else he was going to tell, you name it. I tried to talk with him about it, but he was always so happy, so proud, so excited I couldn't get him to see from my point of view. 

Finally He started expanding the circle of friends who knew, telling people one at a time here or there, trying for me to avoid anybody who knew me, but I knew it was only a matter of time. My withdrawal and depression began to take its toll on the relationship, and I could see it hurting him, something I could never do. So, I tried to talk to him about it one last time, and got the same stonewall response, and, I told him we really, really needed to talk. He said he would be in my college's town later that month for an internship interview (1200 miles away) and I said it could wait. 

He made it here, and I went to see him, we talked, and I told him I had to end it, that We weren't in the same place with our goals in life, whatever else I could think of to get it through to him that I couldn't do it anymore. He broke down, and I just left him there, sobbing in a hotel room, and drove back to school. We didn't talk for a while after that, 2.5 to 3 months, then slowly, he begins to make an effort to reconnect. I welcome it as a friend, after making sure he understood I still had the same reasons and that we couldn't get back together until I'd fixed myself and my problems and solved those reasons. We've been talking more and more since then, but still haven't seen one another since that night. Now we're both going to be in the same hometown for Christmas... and he wants to see me. He's now fully out, supported by everyone he's told, and living an incredible life. Has apparently been dating and doing well, but one drunken night he text me that every date he'd been on went poorly because he kept comparing them to me and they never lived up. 

I'm excited to see him, but afraid. Especially in our hometown, where he's out, and they see us together, and if he reaches out to hug, hold my hand, or kiss me, I don't know what to do. Obviously this is on my mind right now, and it's making me super anxious and panicky about going home, and bringing back my insomnia. This is my finals week (hence how I ended up on Reddit writing this novel) and I screwed up my first two because of bad study and sleep habits, partially at least due to talking with him about seeing one another over the holiday. 

I really don't know why I wrote this all out... I guess I stumbled onto this subreddit thanks to /u/Diogenes71 and wanted to kinda vent. It turned into my life story, and I almost just closed the window hoping that just having written about this would be enough, but I knew it wasn't going to be the case. So I'm going to post it, I don't really know if anybody will read it or care, but thanks for the opportunity and place to share. 

I already love this family. Thanks"

Here's a small bit of advice for those who aren't aware of it yet.",allofmybutts,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1t53li/after_3_months_of_searching_i_landed_a_decent_job/,"First and foremost, thank you to all of you for all the solid advice I got from lurking here everyday.

I did an internship for a couple of months a few years ago, and they really liked me. Now, two years later, after doing my MA and not having had any practical on-the-job experience in all this time, I started realizing how difficult it's going to be to find something decent.

I went back to the place I interned, mostly to just catch up with the people there because it was such a great experience, but I also wanted to probe the waters for anything they might have open. Within 10 minutes of casually speaking to my former supervisor / mentor and catching up, she decided to offer me a temp position with the possibility of becoming permanent in a few months. Didn't even have to do any kind of formal interview where I'd be nervous as hell and probably ruin my chances.

What I realized from this experience is that even though they could haven used someone, they didn't have any listings / open positions posted anywhere. There's a lot of advice on this subreddit about utilizing your network to push your CV to the top of the stack, but **I guess what I wanted to point out here is that even if positions are not explicitly listed, it's still worth a shot to probe companies that you might already have an in with. At worst, they'll say no. At best, you'll be the only candidate for the position.**

Good luck to all, and thank you once again.

**Cold Open**

Contrary to any misinformation you may have heard, YouTube didn't change any copyright policies last week... but they did make a slight adjustment to their Content-ID system. I want to explain how the system works, why it *doesn't* suck, how to deal with it, why it doesn't just affect gamers, and most importantly: what single quick fix could correct the entire system instantly.

**Introduction**

Hi, I'm Jonathan Paula. I apologize in advance, but this video will be a long, and exhaustive discussion on Content ID. Those in a rush can find a full script for this video in the description, and I'm including the topic-timeline above, which will hot-link you directly to the different topics I'll be covering in case you'd like to skip ahead. If you only have a minute, I suggest you watch the ""Conclusion"" section, where I discuss the BIGGEST thing I want you to take away from this video. And it goes with without saying: if you find this video informative or helpful in any way - please click the LIKE button, FAVORITE this video, and SHARE it around. It is crucial more people under these issues, so let's begin.

**Jon's Background**

This is a complicated issue with many nuances, but I am in an extremely unique position, as a content-creator who utilizes fair-use material often, as an owner of a multi-channel network, and as someone who has personally won over 500 separate copyright claims. I've been an independent YouTube Partner since the program first issued invites in January 2008 - In those seven years, I have been very fortunate and appreciative to earn my full-time income from this site. But the recent changes to YouTube's Content-ID system are jeopardizing my livelihood, as well as countless others on the site. 

**Content ID's Origins**

The Content-ID system, which was born out of necessity to handle and resolve lawsuits from companies like Viacom, utilizes sophisticated scanning technology to automatically match potentially infringing videos against a visual or audio reference file that exists in its database. Hollywood movie studios, record companies, game developers and even some top-tier YouTube partners like myself have access to YouTube's ""Content Manager System"", or CMS. These CMS accounts are the people who have the ability to input assets, or ""reference files"" *into* the Content-ID database (which is actually just YouTube itself). When I upload a new episode of ""Is It A Good Idea To Microwave This?"", or when Universal Music releases Taylor Swift's new single... we have the option to apply what's known as a ""match policy"" for ""automatic claims"". Each asset owner can actually adjust the percentage of audio or video that needs to be featured to trigger a Content-ID match. They can also route these matches to a human agent for review, to reduce any false-positives. For game developers, the tools are already in place to detect an audio-only policy on their assets, which would easily exclude the vast number of lets players on YouTube, who provide their own commentary - just like it would be very easy for movie studios to do the same allowing film reviewers to continue their work unimpeded. Game developers CapCom, Blizzard, and Ubisoft were quick to apologize to many YouTubers who were ""falsely-tagged"" by their match policies last week, but honestly: it was their own fault. If they had paid attention to what policies they had enabled on their content, nothing would have been matched at all. Setup your policies appropriately! Scan only for audio, and route matches for manual review before any further action is taken. Ignorance is not an excuse: pay attention, instead of causing a lot of undue stress.

**Benefits Of Content ID**

When used correctly, Content ID is a powerful tool that can be very beneficial. By and large, it's actually a great system that protects millions of songs, movies, games, TV shows, and other work - keeping the revenue and ownership in the hands of its rightful owners. I love that I have a team of robots protecting my huge library of 2,500 videos from anyone who attempts to steal my work and profit from it - in fact, Jogwheel's videos are routinely stolen and re-uploaded about 15 times a week.

**Match Policies**

When potentially infringing material is uploaded, and Content-ID makes a match, CMS-owners have three options how to deal with the video: ""Track"", ""Block"", or ""Monetize"". Some companies may have no issue with you utilizing their game footage, or background music - and only want to track your content, to see how successful it is. A musician, like my friend Rob Scallon may encourage his audience to download his music, and sample it in their videos - The ""Track"" option would provide him with useful analytics on how many individuals took him up on that offer, without penalizing them for it. Whereas FOX Broadcasting may see an entire episode of Family Guy as a particularly egregious upload, and they'll block the video - making it unwatchable to everyone on YouTube. But by far, the most common policy is to ""monetize"" the content. The infringing material remains on YouTube, publicly viewable to the world, but instead of the uploader earning revenue on the video, the earnings are given to the CMS-account that applied the ownership policy in the first place. Now, you'll notice I didn't say the ""proper right's holder"".  And this is inherently Content's ID most public flaw, but not its worst: any CMS account can upload content, and apply a match policy as their own. And this process is unfortunately far easier than you'd think. As a result, some companies - either by malicious intent, or more likely by an innocent accident, have applied polices to assets they don't actually have legal ownership of. Many less informed YouTubers have complained when they get an erroneous match from some random company -- claiming they’re being scammed out of income. In all likelihood, there was an overlap between policies, or some intern at Blizzard Entertainment clicked the wrong checkbox. But, if these false-claims *were* intentional? Well, YouTube really needs to crack down on them. With a site as big as this, with over 10 years of content uploaded every day... a few stray, incorrect matches are not really a big deal. To extend the example from earlier, Taylor Swift is not personally clicking the ""flag"" button to remove cover-versions of her songs off the site. Instead YouTube's Content-ID robots, under Universal Music Group's instruction are automatically detecting these uploads. 

**Multi-Channel Networks**

Those inside a multi-channel network (MCN for short), and CMS-partners themselves, were previously excluded from a majority of Content-ID scans. It was generally assumed, that if you were partnered with Machinima, or part of Sony Pictures Entertainment, you weren't going to upload any infringing content - part of an unconfirmed ""Trust algorithm"" YouTube placed on its larger partners. Again, let me repeat that: partners inside an MCN were protected NOT because their network secured permission from gaming companies, but because they were excluded from Content-ID scans. So many people, include dozens of top-level gamers on this site are under the misinformed impression that networks provided them a service. They didn't. They typed their channel into a box, and by proxy of their ""trust level"", their partners were seemingly protected. Somewhere down the line however, YouTube introduced three separate tiers of partnership within a network: ""Managed"", ""Affiliated"", and ""Whitelisted"" - if you're signed to an MCN, and not on YouTube's top-500 most subscribed list, you're likely an ""Affiliate"" partner, and until recently, that meant you were given the same amount of ""trust"" as whomever you were networked with. As a result, you would have been protected by automatic Content-ID claims... you could still of course be hit with the occasional manual match - so while you may have been able to get away with posting copyrighted material for a time, it didn't mean you were safe, and it definitely didn't mean you were without legal fault.

**Recent Changes To The System**

This all changed last week. YouTube released a statement on December 11th explaining, ""We recently enabled Content ID scanning on channels identified as affiliates of MCNs. This has resulted in new copyright claims for some users, based on policies set by the relevant content owners. As ever, channel owners can easily dispute Content ID claims if they believe those claims are invalid."" Meaning, if you're in a network, you're no longer protected. If you're an independent YouTuber without a CMS-level account... literally nothing has changed for you, except now everyone else is complaining about the same issues you've been dealing with since day one.

**What Are Your Options?** 

When the system matches a video to one or more policies issued by CMS-accounts, the uploader will receive an e-mail, explaining what type of policy has been applied. In this particular case, Warner Bros. applied a ""Monetize"" policy on this episode of Movie Night. So, while you can still watch that video, I am no longer earning revenue from it. Obviously, this is better than having the video outright blocked. Occasionally though, the system makes mistakes - like the aforementioned erroneous matches from random companies, or by detecting content that isn't actually infringing. Maybe you secured permission first, or your usage qualifies as fair use, or the person issuing the claim doesn't own the rights to the content either. These are valid, legitimate, and most importantly LEGAL defenses if your content is incorrectly matched. Luckily, YouTube has tools in place to dispute matches you believe to be false. By clicking the link provided in that e-mail, or by visiting the ""Copyright Notices"" section of your channel's video manager, you will see a link below the matched video that reads ""matched third party content"". Clicking this link provides you with an explanation of the match, a time-code link to the exact portion of the video containing the allegedly infringing material, and the name of the claimant who issued the match. You now have two options available, ""Acknowledge"", or ""Dispute"". If you believe the claim to be genuine, as in... you knowingly uploaded copyrighted material without permission, you'd select ""Acknowledge"", which doesn't adversely affect your account any worse than the match itself... it simply solidifies the ruling, preventing you from disputing it again later. But, if you disagree with the match, either on fair use grounds, or if you have permission to use the content, you can file a dispute. 

**Fair Use Explanation**

Now, I'm not a lawyer, so I won't provide legal advice regarding fair use -- but generally, news reporting, criticism, reviews, commentary, parodies, or some transformative use... are instances *I* would classify as fair use. As for all you gamers and let's players out there, of which I count myself as one... the argument for fair use is trickier, especially since there is zero legal precedent to argue either way. In America, our fair use copyright law was written in 1976 - so while it covers film criticism, song parodies, and news reporting...  telling jokes while you play Call Of Duty may not qualify. 

**The Effect On The Gaming Community**

Inherently, the unique value of lets play videos are the personalities, not necessarily the gameplay footage: but until an actual judge rules one way or another: tread carefully in this space, and attempt to secure permission from the game developers whenever possible. Almost ALL of the frustration and outrage last week came from gamers. But why are they so upset? Lets play exist within a grey area of the law, and the fact that your videos weren't being tagged before was absolutely no indication it'd stay that way forever. So while I take issue with people being upset and surprised by these changes, it doesn't seem like good news for the gaming community. Almost all uploads going forward will be immediately Content-ID scanned, and as we discussed, your options for disputing are not  as legally viable as other types of fair-use content. But really, what it comes down to is that if you're not confident you can win a dispute, you shouldn't be uploading to begin with... unless you're comfortable with not earning revenue. Practically speaking though, last week's change will scare many people off, and the community will suffer as a result. But for those who do have a legal right to their content, and are willing to defend their work, hopefully they can stick around and continue producing awesome stuff.

On a recent episode of the Colbert Report ([Mon 11 Nov. 2013](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/11/12/1255003/-MUST-SEE-Stephen-Colbert-s-own-bombshell-on-60-Minutes-Benghazi-story)), Stephen made reference to a film called The Plastic Dome of Norma Jean. He urged his audience to ""look it up."" I did. It's not on Wikipedia, isn't on Amazon (you get two results, both books. ""Film Composers in America: A Filmography, 1911-1970"" and ""Reel Women: An International Directory of Contemporary Feature Films about Women"" and The Pirate Bay hasn't heard of it. Despite this, several shady websites seem to want me to think I can stream it free and legal from their websites. I didn't. Oh, and its not on YouTube. Not even a clip or trailer. Only thing is a quick mention when somebody reads actor Sam Waterston's wikipedia page, which carries the only mention of the film in any of the Wikimedia Empire (I think that's what its called). They note it, as the guy who plays Jack McCoy on Law &amp; Order... it was his first film.

[TCM has the most information on its cast and crew](http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/86790/The-Plastic-Dome-of-Norma-Jean/). I won't list cast/crew here, they do better than I ever could. Though it does list the film as having a 1970 release and bases this off a New York premiere date. Every other source cites either 1966, including [the US Library of Congress](http://www.loc.gov/item/jots.200157817) or equally as common, 1965, [including IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059605/), which, by the way, has no reviews either professional or by the users, no trivia, goofs, anything in the FAQ on the film and only ONE discussion on its messageboards - titled ""Colbert Reference.""

According to [the Museum of Modern Art](http://www.moma.org/pdfs/docs/press_archives/4429/releases/MOMA_1970_Jan-June_0026_26.pdf?2010)'s original flyer for a screening of the film: ""winner of a special award at the 1969 Cannes Festival ... is the story of a young girl with clairvoyant vision, who is discovered and exploited by a rock and roll group. The feature was shot completely on location in the Ozarks, with a cast of unknowns. One newcomer, Sharon Henesy, played the leading role of Norma Jean ""with a naturalness and charm as if she were living the role,"" Variety noted."" The film is [not mentioned on festival-cannes.fr](http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/search/search/type/5.html?sn-search=plastic+dome+of+norma+jean) or on [Variety.com](http://www.variety.com/results/?q=plastic dome of norma jean).

SPOILERS BELOW!

&gt;Plot: A clairvoyant 15-year old girl meets an enterprising rock star in this drama shot in the Ozarks. The rock star has come to the mountains to build a performance arena with a large tent-like structure known as the Plastic Dome. He sees the girl as a potential audience draw and talks her into joining his act. Her talents make her quite popular and tourists come from all over to see her. Unfortunately, the honest girl doesn't always make happy prophesies. When they all begin to come true, the rock star gets quite upset until she finally quits performing. Her fans are so upset that the rocker attempts to return her forcibly. Sadly, as he attempts to abduct her, he accidentally causes her death.  
&gt;~ Sandra Brennan, Rovi (quoted on numerous sites, allrovi.com is down at the moment, it seems)

TVGuide.com had a similar overview of the film:

&gt;This odd low-budget film, shot in the Ozarks, stars Henesy as a 15-year-old girl who possesses clairvoyant powers. One day, Henesy meets up with rock star, St. John, who is trying to start an entertainment facility in a large circus-tent structure known as the Plastic Dome. Seeing in Henesy a way to attract large crowds, St. John convinces the youngster to join his act. Soon, the money comes pouring in as tourists come from far and wide to witness Henesy's amazing ESP talents. Henesy, however, becomes increasingly upset when her darker prophecies come true. In the end, she quits the act, but the public outcry for her return moves St. John to bring her back by force... (1 &amp; 1/2 out of 4 stars)

The [San Francisco Film Festival's Albert Johnson](http://history.sffs.org/films/film_details.php?id=3914) describes the film so:

&gt;A totally independent filmmaker, Miss Compton first won attention last year at Cannes with an out-of-competition showing of her first film, Stranded, an avant-garde comedy about three bohemians who take a summer cruise through the Aegean. She plays the leading role. In contrast to that sophisticated work, reminiscent of the French nouvelle vague, Miss Compton has turned to an unusual American locale for her new film shot in the Ozarks. The Plastic Dome of Norma Jean is original and full of the spirit of contemporary life. It describes a girl, part of a rock-and-roll group's entourage, who suddenly discovers she has powers of clairvoyance.

Strangely - very strangely - [The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has a write up of the film](http://old.usccb.org/movies/p/plasticdomeofnormajeanthe1974.shtml):

&gt;Plastic Dome of Norma Jean, The -- The media's inevitable victimization of the personalities that they create is the theme of this story about a young woman (Sharon Henesy) whose gift of clairvoyance is used to popularize an exceptionally undistinguished rock group. The script and direction by Juleen Compton prove simply inadequate to the ambitions of what proves to be a terribly flawed movie. Mature themes. (A-III) (nr) ( 1974 )

Yes, that's right. A 1974 release. Also, that rating ""A-III"" is shorthand for: ""A-III -- adults.""

[Soundtrack.net lists no entry for the film](http://www.soundtrack.net/movie/the-plastic-dome-of-norma-jean/), but the film has at least one fan: Barbra Streisand, [before that time she tried to have her house taken off the Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect) recorded (or at least played) a song called ""One Day."" [barbra-archives.com has this description](http://barbra-archives.com/record/unreleased_streisand_songs.html), the same for both the March 16, 1968 session and February 8, 1969 (note that both dates invalidate TCM's release date):

&gt;One Day  
&gt;(Music by: M. Legrand  
&gt;Lyrics by: Alan &amp; Marilyn Bergman)  
&gt;Wally Gold: producer  
&gt;Michel Legrand: arranger/conductor  
&gt;This pro-peace song is based on a Michel Legrand theme from the 1965 French film *The Plastic Dome of Norma Jean*, which Streisand originally heard as an instrumental. She requested Marilyn and Alan Bergman contribute lyrics.

The song was never released.

Apart from that, nothing else is really known. Although, it should be noted, that it was Sam Waterston's movie debut. He was actually in the segment of the Colbert Report that the film was mentioned in. [The Daily Kos](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/11/12/1255003/-MUST-SEE-Stephen-Colbert-s-own-bombshell-on-60-Minutes-Benghazi-story?showAll=yes) has a full transcript, along with screenshots and video (available in your region?). IMDb user ""allworkpeace"" explains in the ""Colbert Reference"" thread:

&gt;That's the reason Stephen Colbert mentioned this movie, kryptogal26. Sam Waterston currently plays Charlie Skinner in the HBO series ""The Newsroom,"" but his second film/TV credit in 1965 was the character of Andy in ""The Plastic Dome of Norma Jean,"" which I don't believe I've ever seen. It was Waterston in that ridiculous mustache and beard doing the comic character of 'college intern' Poncho Denews on last night's ""Colbert Report.""  
&gt;Of course, my favorite Sam Waterston gig was as the ADA/DA Jack McCoy in ""Law &amp; Order."" What a marvelous actor!

The end. (*...Or is it?*)

[edit] Also, in all my searching, I didn't see any other site or page as comprehensive as this post. If this turns up elsewhere, either somebody else decided to do the same amount of research as I, this far out from the show's mention of the film - or they really should reference this post (or [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/ColbertRally/comments/1qosr0/the_plastic_dome_of_norma_jean/)) as they are the originals. I'm not sure why I feel compelled to mention this.

[edit] Just found this in-depth review from 1970, which gives a production date of 1967. Written by Robert Colaciello of The Village Voice, April 9, 1970 (p. 56) where [this review of the film](http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1299&amp;dat=19700409&amp;id=qNpHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=N4wDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6370,5103469) originally appeared.

&gt;FILM: THE PLASTIC DOME OF NORMA JEAN

&gt;Juleen Compton made ""The Plastic Dome of Norma Jean,"" with a budget of $125,000, a union (i. e., expensive) crew, and a mere two-to-one shooting ratio, in 1967, *before* independent productions were thought possible, let alone desirable, in this country. Miss Compton was film educated in Paris, made her first feature, ""Stranded,"" in Greece and returned here to shoot ""Norma Jean"" in the low-budget, high-art manner popularized in Europe by the Nouvelle Vague. Despite awards at the San Francisco and Cannes festivals and commercial success on the Continent, ""Norma Jean"" remains undistributed in its native land.  
&gt;""Norma Jean"" (yes, Miss Compton informed us at Cineprobe at the Museum of Modern Art, the reference to Marilyn Munroe is intentional) is an enchanting fantisy set within a realistiv, even banal, context: as such, it recalls Fellini's ""La Strada."" Norma Jean, a naive clairvoyant; Vance, her loyal boyfriend; and BoBo, a slick showbiz type who heads a rock trio, attempt to run a road-show in a plastic dome in the Ozarks. When it becomes apparent that be-bop alone will not keep the yokels coming, Norma Jean, at BoBo's prodding, agrees to exploit her visionary ability, which does wonders for the box office, but nearly drives the girl insane. After her prediction of a suicide comes true, she collapses and is hidden by Vance. But the public is not about to give up its cheap thrills, the mayor his ""tourist hotspot,"" BoBo his neonized fame and fortune. They track Norma Jean down and in a deliberately ambiguous finale accidentally shoot her dead.  
&gt;In an admirably restrained manner, Miss Compton recreates the claustrophobic small-town atmosphere, the stupidity and boredom which finally demands a flashy tragedy to satisfy its hunger for excitement. The underlying obsessiveness of all this comes through visually as certain images casually reappear: parched earth, the clothes which the actors never change, decorative neon stars, a solitary phone booth, the revolving door of the dome, the dome itself. ""The Plastic Dome of Norma Jean"" is not without flaws, but it does work; it is faithful to its modest self. Unfortunately, with the exception of the MOMA screening, only Europeans have had the opportunity to see one of *our* earliest attemprs to free a medium long trapped in its own extraneous excess.

[Bill Bryers of the The Pittsburgh Press (Mar 6, 1966)](http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19660306&amp;id=29EbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Uk8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4257,2547482) also mentioned the film, albeit briefly, as being ""recently completed"" which would pretty definitively, in my opinion, cement the **original** release date as 1966.

Had an amazing connection with him, and even more incredible coincidences: we have the same birthday, and have met one another as kids. Need some Reddit tough-love on how we won't reconcile in the future.

------

Hello Redditors! Long time [21/F] lurker here. For weeks I’ve struggled about whether or not I should post, but reading what y’all have been writing has been so instrumental in nursing my first heartbreak, I regard doing this—throwing my own story out there—as my final step of healing. I will try to edit everything down and make sure it has nice flow, to make it as easy of a read as possible! 

I met him [21/M]-- let’s call him D—while we were going through security check in a German airport. We were both enrolled in a summer language learning program where we stayed in a university in Europe to learn that language by immersion. We grew up in the same city, but I go to college in NYC, and he studies in the UK. 

We randomly started chatting and immediately hit it off talking about pop culture and traveling. Over the course of our conversation, we realized that we have actually met each other as kids—our (nutjob!) parents have both strong-armed us into joining this super embarrassing children’s choir when we were 10. It was hilarious reminiscing over those times, and I’ve never had an easier conversation with someone I’ve just met. It really wasn’t anything romantic at first: We always had interesting banter and possessed the same snarky sense of humor, which came in handy when you’re stuck with 50+ loud college-aged kids!



Everyone found their cliques within the program pretty quickly, and we naturally formed this core group of 4: Me, D, and two other girls. The four of us would travel everywhere together, talk about anything, and always eat out after class. It was those dinner conversations I’ve always wanted to have—over amazing wine, sitting on the esplanade under the balmy night breeze, and laughing uncontrollably about something funny he said until food came out of our noses. All of us grew very close, but D and I would always find ourselves in our own little world, engrossed in some inside joke. I think the other girls (who were amazing and will remain my great friends) picked up on that, and were always rooting for us to be together.

Eventually, the topic turned to each of our backgrounds, and I discovered that he came from a very dysfunctional family: He grew up on the lap of luxury, but with very little affection coming from his parents. They are both high-ranking government officials (as a matter of fact, his mother was the chair of this academic program—I will get to her later) and are the most distrusting and emotionally-stunted people I’ve ever heard of. Although D would sometimes come off as a bit spoiled and immature, I was honestly surprised that he turned out to be a relatively compassionate human being, given his circumstances.

There was another completely batshit crazy thing we had in common: We had the same birthday, which fell on one of the weekends we were in Europe. Our friends threw us this huge blowout party and we all went clubbing, it was the best birthday I’ve ever had. He asked me to get a smoke with him outside the club, and we ended up sitting on the balcony, talking for hours. That was when I realized I have hopelessly fallen for this person. I tried hard to hide it as I thought he probably didn’t have feelings for me, but I’m guessing I didn’t do it very well—since three days later, he kissed me and asked me to be his girl.


Our time together was completely blissful, as for all couples in their honeymoon phase, I guess: I have been in relationships before, but never have I felt so strongly for another person. That was the first time I feel like a significant other is looking at me exactly the way I’d like to be appreciated. He loved that I was an independent girl who knows what she wants in life and how to achieve them. But the prospect of parting has always loomed over us: We had a little less than a month left together, and immediately after the program ends I have to return to NY. I remember staring into his eyes and never being so sure about anything else in my life: I knew I wanted to lose my virginity to him, while we were still in Europe. (He was much more experienced)

But actually sealing the deal proved to be a very difficult task: His mother flew in and supervised the students for the last week of the program, and because he NEVER shares any details of his personal life with his mom, we had to keep our relationship secret. Even though I understand where he was coming from, I was still hurt. And of course, his mother immediately disliked our group and thought her son could be doing much better than having friends like us—three middle-class girls who are nothing but “vultures” trying to profit from him. Bitch be crazy since I never took anything from him: I never let him pay for anything as it’s exactly the impression I didn’t want anyone to get—that I’m after his family money and status. 

I think his mother could sense that there’s something between us, and asked D relentlessly whether we are dating or not. He lied and said there was nothing between us, that I had a boyfriend and she was just overthinking. His mother then went on badmouthing me, implying that I was “slutty” for being so close to him while in a relationship, and that I must have a secret agenda. Naturally, I was not thrilled about this accusation and was so disappointed that he couldn’t stand up for me in front of his mother. But eventually I moved past it, as I knew he was committed to me enough otherwise. When we finally spent the night together, it was pure magic: We listened to jazz and danced stark naked in close embrace. He said he would never let go of me, since what were the odds of finding another girl who was smart, pretty (in his words), who completely gets him and is born on the same day?


I was weary when he asked me to go long distance with him at the end of summer: I knew so many friends whose LDRs didn’t work out, and was worried that we didn’t have a strong enough foundation to go into one. (We were only dating for 1 month at that point) He convinced me that distance won’t be an issue for us, and he would get a part-time job to save up and come see me in NY. He gave me a letter when we were at the airport and said “I love you.” I loved him too, in whatever capacity of my understanding of love at this very young age. I dug up some old photos of us in the choir: We were standing right next to each other, without knowing that 10 years down the line, we would fall in love! Life works in mysterious ways.

A month into the LDR and we were fine— Skyped everyday, showered each other in endearments, the usual humdrum. Eventually, however, the distance took a toll on us: We would both well up on how it was a blessing to have met each other, but how painful it was to be apart. He told me that everything he saw in England reminded him of me: magazines (I’m an aspiring journalist), my favorite latte, even the pen I like to use. We decided that I would go visit him for Christmas (splitting the cost--he wanted to pay for everything at first and I refused) He even began to look for graduate schools in NY, so he can move closer to me after graduation.

But things took a turn for the worse when school started for him: He was stressed about where to go for his master’s as the deadline gets closer. There weren’t any good schools for what he wanted to study on the East Coast. He became more and more distant and after a fight we had, he acted like a jerk to me for days. I got an ominous feeling we might not be working out, and all I really wanted was to be treated with respect. So I asked him to take a few days to decide whether or not he still wanted this relationship. He said he doesn’t know what he wants anymore, but he would think about everything and tell me the next day.

The next day came, and he never called. I was like a cat on a hot tin roof, but decided to wait it out one more day as I knew he had been drinking a lot. When I contacted him he said he still needed more time. Fine. By the time weekend rolled around I just couldn’t stand to be on death row anymore, and I told him to give it to me straight via Skype. He appeared agonized and said he was a hypocrite and a coward, that the LDR was tiring him out despite all his promises. He said I deserve with be with a much better guy in NY who is close and can actually take care of me. He said he could never reciprocate the level of love and care I had for him.

That last sentence was a dagger to my chest. This was the first person I’ve completely opened up to and really thought we are in it for the long haul. I knew there was nothing I could possibly say to change his mind, so I just accepted it with as much grace and composure I could feign. In retrospect, it was foolish of me to surrender all the power, where I should have just ended things when I feel like he wasn’t into it anymore. 


I have implemented NC and it’s been 2 months (except breaking it once for a brief and unsatisfying conversation). I have finally sworn off looking at his social media—everybody here is absolutely right, looking at his partying pics on Facebook does nothing but hurt me. For the most part, I am fine: my head is screwed on very straight and nobody can ever break me enough for me to give up on myself. I channeled my heartbreak pain into working on my own career, and I am proud to say that I got a dream internship lined up, and I just won a scholarship for student journos!


Of course, I still think about him every day, and sometimes that overbearing pain takes over and I find myself slumped on the floor, bawling and asking the universe why the hell it didn’t work out. I’ve had countless dreams of our reconciliation, and waking up from those ARE THE FUCKING WORST. I think part of my melancholy also stems from nostalgia: This past summer in Europe was the happiest time of my life, and I wonder if I’ll ever get to experience something that amazing again. This guy was like (forgive me as I’m about to get ridiculous) twin flame--my mind was so blown by the fact that we were born on the same day and fit together like 2 pieces in a puzzle. We could seriously finish each other’s sentences. How will I ever be so connected to someone again?


Deep down, I still harbor the pathetic hope that maybe a few years down the line when we move back to our city, we might get back together. I know that this is an extremely toxic thought and I need all the help I can get to kill it. I just WISH he realizes what he has given up, although there’s nothing I can do. Reddit, this is your time to shine: Please slap me into my senses! any advice on getting over that hopeful mindset would be appreciated!


Thank you so much for taking the time to read this whole novel!

 And I wonder what some productive projects to do would be, as for a learning/training purpose. 

~8 week deadline. For example if Im going to do this by myself I could for example write a paper (research) for a new networking technology or program a port scanner. If Im at a company I could evaluate the security of their network/servers or help them upgrade their network. These were as I said just examples but I hope I somewhat gave you an direction in the type of projects that are fitting. It need to have a start and a finish with goals etc, you get it.

 Of course its hard to brainstorm this for an unknown company but I was hoping that someone with some experience could share some thoughts. 

And yea, relrvant skill level: last year of uni networking degree. So ccna level. Lots of wandos and web programming, some C/java/python.

What would be a good project to do?"
1t4oo2,1,2013-12-17,Tips for a UK student hoping to apply for an Internship in America?,internet_ham,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1t4oo2/tips_for_a_uk_student_hoping_to_apply_for_an/,"Dear all,

I'm hoping to apply for internships in America for this summer but the idea is quite daunting. I want to go for the mechatronics/robotics/automation sector, which is quite small in the UK.

Some questions:

1) **Where should I be aiming?**

I'm studying at Cambridge which is arguably the best University in the UK and the best course for Engineering. I am a Second Year, and the course is general, so I'm learning everything from Material Science to Digital Electroncs. A downside of this is that the course is very work intensive, so I haven't had an awful lot of time for student led projects, but I've joined one this year and done a fair amount with Arduino in my spare time. I got 71% in my first year exams (average is 65%) and have won Department prizes in Computing and Robotics. (Sorry if this is braggy, I just want to show you what I'm going to sell to them...)

What size of company should I contact? What kind of position? Are there cities where I would struggle finding a place due to popularity? (I'm thinking maybe Boston, SF)

2)**When should I apply?**
I want to be applying now, but I'm worried I'll be lost in the Christmas Break Rush and/or New Year Rush. Is there an 'optimum time'?

3) **How should I apply?**
Given my position, should I go through the careers page, email directly or get in contact via UK offices?

4) **What should be in my application?**
How would a US job application differ from a UK one? The answer is probably not at all but I thought I'd ask. 

Hope you guys can help!"

**Cold Open**

Contrary to any misinformation you may have heard, YouTube didn't change any copyright policies last week... but they did make a slight adjustment to their Content-ID system. I want to explain how the system works, why it *doesn't* suck, how to deal with it, why it doesn't just affect gamers, and most importantly: what single quick fix could correct the entire system instantly.

**Introduction**

Hi, I'm Jonathan Paula. I apologize in advance, but this video will be a long, and exhaustive discussion on Content ID. Those in a rush can find a full script for this video in the description, and I'm including the topic-timeline above, which will hot-link you directly to the different topics I'll be covering in case you'd like to skip ahead. If you only have a minute, I suggest you watch the ""Conclusion"" section, where I discuss the BIGGEST thing I want you to take away from this video. And it goes with without saying: if you find this video informative or helpful in any way - please click the LIKE button, FAVORITE this video, and SHARE it around. It is crucial more people under these issues, so let's begin.

**Jon's Background**

This is a complicated issue with many nuances, but I am in an extremely unique position, as a content-creator who utilizes fair-use material often, as an owner of a multi-channel network, and as someone who has personally won over 500 separate copyright claims. I've been an independent YouTube Partner since the program first issued invites in January 2008 - In those seven years, I have been very fortunate and appreciative to earn my full-time income from this site. But the recent changes to YouTube's Content-ID system are jeopardizing my livelihood, as well as countless others on the site. 

**Content ID's Origins**

The Content-ID system, which was born out of necessity to handle and resolve lawsuits from companies like Viacom, utilizes sophisticated scanning technology to automatically match potentially infringing videos against a visual or audio reference file that exists in its database. Hollywood movie studios, record companies, game developers and even some top-tier YouTube partners like myself have access to YouTube's ""Content Manager System"", or CMS. These CMS accounts are the people who have the ability to input assets, or ""reference files"" *into* the Content-ID database (which is actually just YouTube itself). When I upload a new episode of ""Is It A Good Idea To Microwave This?"", or when Universal Music releases Taylor Swift's new single... we have the option to apply what's known as a ""match policy"" for ""automatic claims"". Each asset owner can actually adjust the percentage of audio or video that needs to be featured to trigger a Content-ID match. They can also route these matches to a human agent for review, to reduce any false-positives. For game developers, the tools are already in place to detect an audio-only policy on their assets, which would easily exclude the vast number of lets players on YouTube, who provide their own commentary - just like it would be very easy for movie studios to do the same allowing film reviewers to continue their work unimpeded. Game developers CapCom, Blizzard, and Ubisoft were quick to apologize to many YouTubers who were ""falsely-tagged"" by their match policies last week, but honestly: it was their own fault. If they had paid attention to what policies they had enabled on their content, nothing would have been matched at all. Setup your policies appropriately! Scan only for audio, and route matches for manual review before any further action is taken. Ignorance is not an excuse: pay attention, instead of causing a lot of undue stress.

**Benefits Of Content ID**

When used correctly, Content ID is a powerful tool that can be very beneficial. By and large, it's actually a great system that protects millions of songs, movies, games, TV shows, and other work - keeping the revenue and ownership in the hands of its rightful owners. I love that I have a team of robots protecting my huge library of 2,500 videos from anyone who attempts to steal my work and profit from it - in fact, Jogwheel's videos are routinely stolen and re-uploaded about 15 times a week.

**Match Policies**

When potentially infringing material is uploaded, and Content-ID makes a match, CMS-owners have three options how to deal with the video: ""Track"", ""Block"", or ""Monetize"". Some companies may have no issue with you utilizing their game footage, or background music - and only want to track your content, to see how successful it is. A musician, like my friend Rob Scallon may encourage his audience to download his music, and sample it in their videos - The ""Track"" option would provide him with useful analytics on how many individuals took him up on that offer, without penalizing them for it. Whereas FOX Broadcasting may see an entire episode of Family Guy as a particularly egregious upload, and they'll block the video - making it unwatchable to everyone on YouTube. But by far, the most common policy is to ""monetize"" the content. The infringing material remains on YouTube, publicly viewable to the world, but instead of the uploader earning revenue on the video, the earnings are given to the CMS-account that applied the ownership policy in the first place. Now, you'll notice I didn't say the ""proper right's holder"".  And this is inherently Content's ID most public flaw, but not its worst: any CMS account can upload content, and apply a match policy as their own. And this process is unfortunately far easier than you'd think. As a result, some companies - either by malicious intent, or more likely by an innocent accident, have applied polices to assets they don't actually have legal ownership of. Many less informed YouTubers have complained when they get an erroneous match from some random company -- claiming they’re being scammed out of income. In all likelihood, there was an overlap between policies, or some intern at Blizzard Entertainment clicked the wrong checkbox. But, if these false-claims *were* intentional? Well, YouTube really needs to crack down on them. With a site as big as this, with over 10 years of content uploaded every day... a few stray, incorrect matches are not really a big deal. To extend the example from earlier, Taylor Swift is not personally clicking the ""flag"" button to remove cover-versions of her songs off the site. Instead YouTube's Content-ID robots, under Universal Music Group's instruction are automatically detecting these uploads. 

**Multi-Channel Networks**

Those inside a multi-channel network (MCN for short), and CMS-partners themselves, were previously excluded from a majority of Content-ID scans. It was generally assumed, that if you were partnered with Machinima, or part of Sony Pictures Entertainment, you weren't going to upload any infringing content - part of an unconfirmed ""Trust algorithm"" YouTube placed on its larger partners. Again, let me repeat that: partners inside an MCN were protected NOT because their network secured permission from gaming companies, but because they were excluded from Content-ID scans. So many people, include dozens of top-level gamers on this site are under the misinformed impression that networks provided them a service. They didn't. They typed their channel into a box, and by proxy of their ""trust level"", their partners were seemingly protected. Somewhere down the line however, YouTube introduced three separate tiers of partnership within a network: ""Managed"", ""Affiliated"", and ""Whitelisted"" - if you're signed to an MCN, and not on YouTube's top-500 most subscribed list, you're likely an ""Affiliate"" partner, and until recently, that meant you were given the same amount of ""trust"" as whomever you were networked with. As a result, you would have been protected by automatic Content-ID claims... you could still of course be hit with the occasional manual match - so while you may have been able to get away with posting copyrighted material for a time, it didn't mean you were safe, and it definitely didn't mean you were without legal fault.

**Recent Changes To The System**

This all changed last week. YouTube released a statement on December 11th explaining, ""We recently enabled Content ID scanning on channels identified as affiliates of MCNs. This has resulted in new copyright claims for some users, based on policies set by the relevant content owners. As ever, channel owners can easily dispute Content ID claims if they believe those claims are invalid."" Meaning, if you're in a network, you're no longer protected. If you're an independent YouTuber without a CMS-level account... literally nothing has changed for you, except now everyone else is complaining about the same issues you've been dealing with since day one.

**What Are Your Options?** 

When the system matches a video to one or more policies issued by CMS-accounts, the uploader will receive an e-mail, explaining what type of policy has been applied. In this particular case, Warner Bros. applied a ""Monetize"" policy on this episode of Movie Night. So, while you can still watch that video, I am no longer earning revenue from it. Obviously, this is better than having the video outright blocked. Occasionally though, the system makes mistakes - like the aforementioned erroneous matches from random companies, or by detecting content that isn't actually infringing. Maybe you secured permission first, or your usage qualifies as fair use, or the person issuing the claim doesn't own the rights to the content either. These are valid, legitimate, and most importantly LEGAL defenses if your content is incorrectly matched. Luckily, YouTube has tools in place to dispute matches you believe to be false. By clicking the link provided in that e-mail, or by visiting the ""Copyright Notices"" section of your channel's video manager, you will see a link below the matched video that reads ""matched third party content"". Clicking this link provides you with an explanation of the match, a time-code link to the exact portion of the video containing the allegedly infringing material, and the name of the claimant who issued the match. You now have two options available, ""Acknowledge"", or ""Dispute"". If you believe the claim to be genuine, as in... you knowingly uploaded copyrighted material without permission, you'd select ""Acknowledge"", which doesn't adversely affect your account any worse than the match itself... it simply solidifies the ruling, preventing you from disputing it again later. But, if you disagree with the match, either on fair use grounds, or if you have permission to use the content, you can file a dispute. 

**Fair Use Explanation**

Now, I'm not a lawyer, so I won't provide legal advice regarding fair use -- but generally, news reporting, criticism, reviews, commentary, parodies, or some transformative use... are instances *I* would classify as fair use. As for all you gamers and let's players out there, of which I count myself as one... the argument for fair use is trickier, especially since there is zero legal precedent to argue either way. In America, our fair use copyright law was written in 1976 - so while it covers film criticism, song parodies, and news reporting...  telling jokes while you play Call Of Duty may not qualify. 

**The Effect On The Gaming Community**

Inherently, the unique value of lets play videos are the personalities, not necessarily the gameplay footage: but until an actual judge rules one way or another: tread carefully in this space, and attempt to secure permission from the game developers whenever possible. Almost ALL of the frustration and outrage last week came from gamers. But why are they so upset? Lets play exist within a grey area of the law, and the fact that your videos weren't being tagged before was absolutely no indication it'd stay that way forever. So while I take issue with people being upset and surprised by these changes, it doesn't seem like good news for the gaming community. Almost all uploads going forward will be immediately Content-ID scanned, and as we discussed, your options for disputing are not  as legally viable as other types of fair-use content. But really, what it comes down to is that if you're not confident you can win a dispute, you shouldn't be uploading to begin with... unless you're comfortable with not earning revenue. Practically speaking though, last week's change will scare many people off, and the community will suffer as a result. But for those who do have a legal right to their content, and are willing to defend their work, hopefully they can stick around and continue producing awesome stuff.

Many of my peers still believe they are going to become directors when they graduate and are having no problem finding general production internships, which usually consist of script development and other pre-production and production paperwork. I, however, found out very early on that I wanted to be an editor, and though I would have no problem applying for a general internship and doing the work associated with it, I wonder whether it would be actually helpful in furthering my career.

Have any of you had luck with turning a general internship into a job in post? If so, I'd love to hear about it.

Additionally, I've searched for studios and production companies with post production internship opportunities posted on their pages. Aside from this list, are there any companies I'm missing?

* Paramount

* Sony

* NBCUniversal

* Warner Bros.

* Miramax


Lastly (and I apologize for this moment of shameless promotion), would any of you be interested in taking on an intern? If you are, PM me and I'd be happy to share my credentials with you.


Thank you all for your consideration. Please correct me if I made any false assumptions on film internships and I look forward to hearing your thoughts!"

i started my university journey not knowing what to major in, after consideration i chose Computer science despite my brother (who finished CS many years ago) advising against it, i was enjoying the study the first year but not so much the second one when the theoretical study and huge projects started rolling in, i struggled that year although i achieved a pretty good GPA. that summer i did an internship and hated every bit of it, after that internship i started seeing my brother view point and started questioning my decision, I'm  not a good programmer and struggle in class projects so this hit the nail on the head and made me want to switch to a major that i was thinking off at the beginning and starting again in a 4 year engineering major ( Industrial Engineering). now, i want nothing more than switching but I'm afraid that its just a whim(which i think is not because i actually started hating programming and also i'm not good enough to make it professionally ) and that i will regret it later on, thoughts redditors?

i really don't know what to do I'm just confused.

note: my younger brother just started engineering so it will be a bit awkward  :)

Sad, lonely, missing home and don't know what to do.",her_name_is_cherry,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1t9juu/im_f25_struggling_to_adjust_to_life_in_my/,"Bit of a wall of text coming, so apologies.

I met my boyfriend two years ago when he was traveling through my country and we instantly hit it off. It was instant attraction, and we spent a lot of his vacation in my country together, and stayed in steady contact when he left to go back to his own country. For six months we talked constantly via FB Messenger, and spent most of one day a week Skyping with each other. After about two months or so we realised how serious it was and that we loved each other.

I was able to take a transfer semester at a University in his country for six months, and so last year I came to live here for that amount of time. I lived at first with him in his house (which went awesome) and then in a share house closer to campus, since he lived far away. During that time I was working, I made a few friends, I was singing with a band, and I was happy with my life here. Things between us were absolutely amazing. Going back home to finish Uni was very hard, but we did the long distance thing one more time. He came to visit me for two weeks for my birthday and during that time we decided that I would come live in his country after graduation - he has a good job with a set career arc ahead of him, and the economy and pay there is better in general.

I've been here now for almost seven months. I'm struggling this time a lot more than I was. Things between us are wonderful still - we have an apartment in a neighbourhood I love and a doggy and a life together. But I've been struggling in terms of my own life. I'm really struggling finding a job in my field. I must have sent out about a hundred cover letters and resumes and have yet to receive a single interview invitation, though I did undertake a three month unpaid internship in my field. I graduated from one of the best Universities in my country, in one of the best programs in my field for North America with a 4.0 and multiple scholarships and I am currently working in several different cafe's to bring money into the house. I feel really embarrassed that I can't get a job - or even an interview - in my field, and like I'm an absolute failure. 

On top of that, I don't really have any friends of my own here yet. I have my boyfriend's friends, and they are lovely, and I enjoy spending time with them, but at the end of the day I feel they are still his friends. I'm incredibly lonely and miss my family very much, and when I feel sad, or frustrated, or just like talking about home, I have to talk to him. There's simply no one else for me to talk to here, and I know it's weighing on him. He wants to make me happy, and fix all my problems and he just can't. I don't particularly like it in his country and don't really feel like I fit in here. I don't hate it, but I miss home all the time, and think about how little things are better there all the time. And I know that if I stay and marry him, which we've discussed and which is the next step, that this will most likely be my home for the forseeable future. 

He is such a wonderful man, and I've never doubted that he's my person. He is, without a doubt, the man I want to marry and have a family with one day. He has been infinitely patient, kind, and caring towards me, and we've taken excellent care of each other. I don't want to lose him, but I miss home so much and I can't help but wonder if my job prospects would be better there. I can't ask him to move - he's got a house and a mortgage and a career. I'm the one just starting out. I'm struggling so much with my own life here and when I think about settling down to raise kids - the idea that I'll raise them here, and that they won't get to experience all of the wonderful parts of growing up in my country that made my own childhood so special, I feel really sad. I am also very close to my family and miss them so much, and to know they won't be around for that either kills me a bit.

I don't know what to do Reddit. I miss my home so much, but I love him with all my heart. He's the best man I know, and he's my person. I just don't know where to go from here. My visa runs out in May and we have all the papers ready for my Permanent Residency application but once it's lodged...that's it. I don't know what to do. I feel like I've put myself in a terrible situation where no matter what choice I make, I'm going to break my own heart.

Any help would be so incredibly appreciated - especially if there are any expats out there who have dealt with situations like this.

TL;DR: Life with the boyfriend in his country is great - my personal life in that country is a major struggle. I miss home, miss my friends, miss my family, miss my country, but love him so so much.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for your input. Everyone was honestly so helpful and so kind that it brightened up my whole day. Sometimes just knowing that there are kind people out there makes a world of difference, and I will be implementing a lot of your suggestions. I'll post an update as soon as I can. Thanks again everyone, and Happy Holidays to you all, wherever you are in the world."

I was able to take a transfer semester at a University in his country for six months, and so last year I came to live here for that amount of time. I lived at first with him in his house (which went awesome) and then in a share house closer to campus, since he lived far away. During that time I was working, I made a few friends, I was singing with a band, and I was happy with my life here. Things between us were absolutely amazing. Going back home to finish Uni was very hard, but we did the long distance thing one more time. He came to visit me for two weeks for my birthday and during that time we decided that I would come live in his country after graduation - he has a good job with a set career arc ahead of him, and the economy and pay there is better in general.

I've been here now for almost seven months. I'm struggling this time a lot more than I was. Things between us are wonderful still - we have an apartment in a neighbourhood I love and a doggy and a life together. But I've been struggling in terms of my own life. I'm really struggling finding a job in my field. I must have sent out about a hundred cover letters and resumes and have yet to receive a single interview invitation, though I did undertake a three month unpaid internship in my field. I graduated from one of the best Universities in my country, in one of the best programs in my field for North America with a 4.0 and multiple scholarships and I am currently working in several different cafe's to bring money into the house. I feel really embarrassed that I can't get a job - or even an interview - in my field, and like I'm an absolute failure. 

On top of that, I don't really have any friends of my own here yet. I have my boyfriend's friends, and they are lovely, and I enjoy spending time with them, but at the end of the day I feel they are still his friends. I'm incredibly lonely and miss my family very much, and when I feel sad, or frustrated, or just like talking about home, I have to talk to him. There's simply no one else for me to talk to here, and I know it's weighing on him. He wants to make me happy, and fix all my problems and he just can't. I don't particularly like it in his country and don't really feel like I fit in here. I don't hate it, but I miss home all the time, and think about how little things are better there all the time. And I know that if I stay and marry him, which we've discussed and which is the next step, that this will most likely be my home for the forseeable future. 

He is such a wonderful man, and I've never doubted that he's my person. He is, without a doubt, the man I want to marry and have a family with one day. He has been infinitely patient, kind, and caring towards me, and we've taken excellent care of each other. I don't want to lose him, but I miss home so much and I can't help but wonder if my job prospects would be better there. I can't ask him to move - he's got a house and a mortgage and a career. I'm the one just starting out. I'm struggling so much with my own life here and when I think about settling down to raise kids - the idea that I'll raise them here, and that they won't get to experience all of the wonderful parts of growing up in my country that made my own childhood so special, I feel really sad. I am also very close to my family and miss them so much, and to know they won't be around for that either kills me a bit.

I don't know what to do Reddit. I miss my home so much, but I love him with all my heart. He's the best man I know, and he's my person. I just don't know where to go from here. My visa runs out in May and we have all the papers ready for my Permanent Residency application but once it's lodged...that's it. I don't know what to do. I feel like I've put myself in a terrible situation where no matter what choice I make, I'm going to break my own heart.

Any help would be so incredibly appreciated - especially if there are any expats out there who have dealt with situations like this.

TL;DR: Life with the boyfriend in his country is great - my personal life in that country is a major struggle. I miss home, miss my friends, miss my family, miss my country, but love him so so much.

One of the recruiters I've been in contact with told me that the next step in the process is an in person interview. Part of that interview will involve coding in the language I'm most comfortable in and then debugging it based on their comments.

I just decided on computer science this year after taking the introductory course because I'd unknowingly knocked out about half requirements with math courses I'd taken, so I don't have a whole lot of programming under my belt. The intro course was about 3/4ths C and then I focused on PHP for the last portion of that. I feel pretty comfortable with these languages, but I don't really know how to prepare for the coding portion of the interview moving forward. 

My friend who did this program last summer says I have a really great shot at getting it, but my lack of experience is a source of worry for me. I was wondering if any of you would be kind enough to offer some guidance as to how I should prepare for this. Thanks!"

I will be attending an internship in the Netherlands as part of my university studies next March. I am really looking forward to this, though I am not completely unfamiliar with your country as I am originally from a German city bordering the Netherlands, so I have been to your country a couple of times in the past.

However, just passing through a country and visiting a few places as a tourist is not exactly the same thing as living in a country for a somewhat extended period of time, so I have a few questions.

First of all, I will be paid 750€ + public transport cost will be covered by my employer - is that a fair deal for a 21 year old software development intern in the Netherlands? It seems okay to me, just want to make sure.

The employer informed me that my main position would be in (southern) Amsterdam, but that I would have to go to Utrecht at least once a week for some different kind of work. My question is now where to look for either an apartment or a room, which I would need to rent for 6 months while also keeping enough money to not having to worry about it (obviously I do not intend to get rich, but I am not familiar with prices in that area. I currently live in Berlin and it's just so incredibly cheap here, that I will probably feel like I am paying too much all the time). From looking at Google Maps, Amsterdam-Zuidoost seems to be sort of in the middle and a good option, but then again, is it a decent area to live in or do you guys have any better ideas?

Also, I will need a basic phone contract. It does not need to come with a text or call flat rate, I pretty much just want a good LTE connection with at least 500 MB per month to surf the web on the go and use Google Maps / Translate, do you have any recommendations for that?

Lastly, any other tips for a German / things to look out for?

1t8okk,1,2013-12-19,What You Should Look For In Business Schools?,mohangohade,news,https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1t8okk/what_you_should_look_for_in_business_schools/,"The Admissions to MBA are fast gaining frantic pace. People are preparing for competitive exams like SNAP in the hope of realizing their dream of getting in to the coveted Symbiosis MBA degree program. The Symbiosis group has established itself as one of the most reputed institutions of the country in the academics domain. In fact, their pursuit of academic excellence is clearly highlighted in the inception of colleges like Symbiosis Center for Information Technology that cater to the niche demand of programs like business management degree in IT, MBA IT specialization and so on. But choosing business schools is not an easy task. You have to patiently examine the tall claims against several factors before you take the final call. 
There are many options when it comes to getting into MBA programs but the true benefit is availed only when you make a wise choice. Looking for business schools may seem easy considering one type into Google and you will have thousands of results. However, the task of getting into one is a big challenge. You have to weigh a multitude of factors. For example there are several PGDM colleges in Pune that can be seen when you type PGDM in Pune on your local search engine but all of them are not as good as the reputed Symbiosis MBA option. In case of information technology, the search has to be fine tuned into looking for several niche features like project management training, the reputation of the IT B schools and the academic infrastructure. 
Here are a few things that you should keep in mind when you are choosing IT B schools:
Faculty
The Symbiosis MBA program including the MBA IT specialization has earned its reputation of being one of the most preferred MBA programs only because of its flawless academic infrastructure, training and faculty that ensures end to end approach of teaching students. But not all institutions are able to live up to these standards. Therefore, as a student you must check the faculty and training opportunities available in the college. 
Project management training
The MBA IT specialization is incomplete without proper practical training. Therefore, reputed IT B schools insist on mandatory training sessions / internships and industry interface programs. These sessions keep the students grounded with the real time situation of the industry and accordingly help them prepare for their role as future managers. 
The location
The IT B schools have to keep the students abreast with the present industry scenario. The best way to do this is to teach the students amidst an environment that is constantly upbeat with the happenings of the industry. It is this insight that helped SCIT become a hot favorite amongst students. After all, you get to pursue the MBA IT specialization from Symbiosis in Pune which is the hub of the IT industry in India. 
Rankings
Sometimes you may not have the time to check for different factors. In such situations, opt for authentic rankings by authorized bodies. Since these rankings are given on the basis of several factors, you will be able to get a fair idea about the college and its reputation. 
Lastly, choosing MBA programs is like planning your long term investment. Therefore, never hesitate to invest the time and effort to choose a good IT B school for your MBA IT specialization. http://www.scit.edu

My site just completed a major datacenter, network closet, and wiring upgrade performed by a professional team of wiring experts for ~75 percent of the campus (very large building with thousands of endpoints).  The main issues is that the company telecom/wiring tech is not a part of IT in any way and does his own thing without considering the impact (or insanity) of his decisions. 

* He has inexperienced interns make cables by hand, these patch cables often fail
* He regularly would splice existing cables, use couplers, and deploy junk consumer switches rather than pull proper cables
* He generally does not even pull cable but outsources it to a one-man business who also does shoddy work and who charges almost as much as trusted local company that would give us certified/warrantied solution 
* He moves or plug in new patch cables my teams switch ports without communicating the changes causing helpdesk calls and general chaos
* He insists on his own odd labeling systems and has modified the factory patch panels with his own scheme.  Cables previously were labeled with the switch blad and switch port rather than the patch panel number.
* Cat5 patch panel repurposed although all new wiring is Cat5e
*We have new closets that are messy because we were forced to use home-made 10-12 foot patch cables.  The intent was to have all new factory patches but as this for some reason fell on Mr telecom he never bothered to get the lengths and counts together 

We now shut all switch ports that are not in use to encourage that he include us in the process,requested changes and or placed our labeling scheme next to his, began documenting all the mistakes and impact on users.  If you have any insight or comments I would greatly appreciate some expertise.

1t8aqa,0,2013-12-19,Legitimate question: How do you figure out what you can afford?,boyaka,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1t8aqa/legitimate_question_how_do_you_figure_out_what/,"I realize finances can be kind of personal, but the fact that one of the most common pieces of advice given with bitcoin is that you should only invest what you can afford suggests that it should be understood clearly what that means.

Does anybody have any good methods for calculating what you can afford? I've always lived day-to-day and have experienced having debt, but with my parents, who are kind enough to not charge interest. I've started an internship recently (right before the recent spike...) and have found my way out of debt. The future isn't completely certain though, and I have rent to pay now as well as other daily costs.

I can start being more frugal with my money in case things go bad with my savings, but I'm not planning ahead very far and I'm having difficulty figuring out where to draw the line. I'd say I could survive with less fiat. Hell, I figure some people are going into debt to buy bitcoins because they can figure out a plan about what they can ""afford"" after more paychecks come in? How much fiat savings should I aim for before considering bitcoin at all or at a significant amount?

Edit:

So far I have been using Excel to figure out my current balances and future costs. Here's a summary of what I have in it, without the raw data:

* Total Bitcoin owned: ~2.5

* Average Price Purchased: ~750, four payments on 12/5, 12/12, 2x12/16

* About $2k USD spent with fees

* Current Checking: $600

* Balance in account after paid credit card and january bills/rent + paycheck from this month: ~$400

* Paychecks coming in January 2x ~$1600"

[Weren't you involved in the production of the guitar game Rocksmith? What was that like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce5bkyu?context=5)|Yeah. It was a lot of fun. I came in and shot for 5 straight days, in which I got the flu on the FIRST DAY of shooting!!! Great timing. We filmed in SanFran and I had to demonstrate an insane amount of guitar lessons. I would sit there and play these licks or techniques and sometimes have to exaggerate the way I played them for camera. It would feel so awkward to do it that way, but it was the way to make it look correct and clear for the viewer so it was worth it. They had me do all sorts of stuff like finger tapping, sliding, palm-muting, etc. Was very interesting and fun. Hard work though. The guys at ubisoft are INCREDIBLE and amazing dudes. They were such a great hang. I would do it again in a heartbeat. Have you played the game? Is my headless torso helping you learn guitar? haha. 
[Yeah, I like the game a lot. Everything in the videos is super clear, so whatever they made you do, it worked. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce5btq9?context=5)|Phew. It was worth the flu i guess!

[Hi Jared!  Big fan.  Love hearing you play and watching your rig rundown video for Premier Guitar.  What would you say are the skills that helped you the most in the audition for SNL?  Why do you think you got the job?  If I was going into audition, what advice would you have to offer?  You have such a sweet job!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce5bpt1?context=5)|Man. That is a large question. Yes, I can list certain specific things but the truth is I had been preparing my whole life for that audition. Not literally, but everything I learned from being in bands, doing guitar sessions, recording albums, touring, dealing with band personalities, going to music school, studying music, etc it all made me who I am ya know? The things I find the most valuable or at least the most important to me are a few things: Always be prepared, don't be late, have a good attitude, and play your ass off. If you do those things you win. Then it just becomes a matter of if you were the right fit for the gig. And that's not always the case. I remember auditioning for this really dark, rock band called ""Ours"" and I walked in not really knowing the deal. I knew immediately, it didn't matter my attitude or my playing that I wasn;t getting that gig, nor did I want it haha. As far as SNL, specific things that were important for this was knowing how to read music (although I wasn't very good at it), have a reasonable knowledge of a wide variety of music (SNL covers ALL styles), and just be a good player. If I were you and going into an audition my advice would be whenever possible, be as prepared as possible. Wether that means bringing the right guitar for the gig, dressing the part, or trying to meet some of the guys prior to the audition through a friend so they recognize you when you come in, little things like that. Have the music part so down that it requires no thought. Be early. And play like your life depends on it. It might. ;)
[Duuude.  You just had to play along with a track?  That sounds kind of brutal.  Were there a ton of people there to audition?  I bet that was terrifying.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce5cali?context=5)|Just track, no stopping. Just me and Lenny. TOUGH one. And the callback audition I had to play live with the entire rhythm section and we did like 6 tunes back to back. I think I had 1 minute to look over each new song. Yikes.

Please stay posted to all this damn social media world! I'll be putting out some music over the next year that is some next level shit!
[Have you ever had a ""holy shit. I'm playing with this guy"" moment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce59jdz?context=5)|Being a fan of music, any time that I get to play with someone I've listened to, looked up to, etc is always a thrill. I've had a few SUPER crazy moments like playing back to back with Sting, or me and Elton John rocking out together at the front of the Carnegie Hall stage. One of my favorites was playing with Mick Jagger at the SNL season finale last year. THAT WAS NUTS!

[Who or what's your inspiration? What made you decide to go for a music career? :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce59sxd?context=5)|I have so many. I grew up idolizing rock bands, and then guitar gods, then pop bands, then producers, then just people for different reasons. My influences and inspiration continually grow to be honest. That's what keeps me pushing forward to create and look to the future. Never looking back. As far as going for a music career, it wasn't a choice. I just loved playing music as a kid and it ended up taking over my life. When I was in High School was when I was able to pinpoint and say, ""this is what I want to do with the rest of my life"". In fact, it happened during an Allman Brothers Band concert haha. But I knew. And thankfully, it worked out bc I have no idea what else I would do with my life! Maybe go into the food business. Who knows.
[That's awesome. Hmm food business. Ramen perhaps? haha! yum...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce5a1rx?context=5)|Yeah, maybe some sort of travel/food show or writing. I really respect and love the food world so prob. 
[Is playing on a TV band something you always thought about doing? Or is it something that you fell into? Does it leave time/space for you to accomplish your own music goals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce59fol?context=5)|Great question. I would come to SNL during the last guitarist's (Dr. Luke) 10 years on the show every once and a while. And I always thought to myself, ""I would totally rock this!"" haha. So, it's kind of funny that I got the job. I think I might have manifested it or something by always thinking I could get it. Who knows. I was pursuing bands at the time, but I was getting very disillusioned/disheartened from being in a band. The struggle and up and downs were too much. It was nice to get something consistent. One of the best things about this job is that I have a lot of free time during the week to work on all the other music I do, like producing pop music, producing/writing my new instrumental EPs. Those last two things are honestly my biggest focus outside of SNL. 
[How did you get your job on SNL?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce59fe9?context=5)|There's a lot of different interviews I have done on this that goes into detail if you want to check them out. But basically, was recommended, then auditioned like everyone else had done. Got a call back for a smaller group of people to audition again, and then got the call that it was me.

[Any SNL disaster stories you can share?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce59xf5?context=5)|Not really any train wrecks. The worst stuff is typically when the band has to play during a sketch. Sometimes, the writers/Lorne cuts and edits the sketch and ton. Our musical directors are giving us new comments/edits during the prior sketch and we are marking up our music and then we have to play the sketch, essentially completely changed and unrehearsed. It's scary but thrilling at the same time. Even if we mess up, it always is relatively ok though.

We all pushed each other back in the beginning so maybe that had something to do with it. Who knows. Maybe luck. Maybe random. Oldest memory was playing the drum set to wipeout when I was in 5th grade at the band.orchestra concert!! I remember where I was, the angle I was facing on stage, color of the drums, all of it. Or possibly before that, the first time I sat on stage in 5th grade playing guitar while everyone sang along. I had my white Ibanez Ex series guitar and I knew Wild Thing, and a few other simple sing a longs. The entire lunch room was singing along. That was a great memory ;). As far as artists I am always excited to see play on SNL? Def anyone who I grew up listening to. I'd say I was most excited about Paul McCartney (continuously), Radiohead (in my college years I got to see them play SNL before I joined up), and a tie for Tom Petty/Mick Jagger!

I started out at the Hart School of Music for 1 year (Jazz performance), then transferred to NYU. Took one semester of Jazz perf, then switched to music ed. I never wanted to be a jazz guy. I consider myself to not be a jazzer. I can play through some changes, and some lines but at the basic level. Never was something I focused on. NYU for me, was more about being in bands and in NYC, not about school. BUT, I will say I was lucky to have an amazing teacher for my private lessons and he was my favorite part of school for me. I didn't need to do all those harmony classes and all that stuff. In retrospect, I guess it was useful, but nobody typically has anyone read real music anymore so you can learn all of it outside of school also. I guess it was helpful to have structure. But honestly, it was the guitar teachers at the time that helped me the most (Bruce Arnold and Pat Cerello). Pat was my private teacher. He sadly passed away a few years ago. I'm not sure who is still there teaching for the gtr stuff. I was def nervous for the audition but more bc I wasn't a great sight reader and I had to read the charts. I blew the first tune completely, bc it was in 6/8 and B maj. Oops. But I made it through i guess ;)

1t88i1,10,2013-12-19,"As a college student, should I be doing anything with my part time income other than putting it in a regular savings account?",Dunder-MifflinPaper,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1t88i1/as_a_college_student_should_i_be_doing_anything/,"Hello /r/personalfinance!

Well, this is the start of it for me! I'm tired of being afraid to check my Mint.com widget on my phone, and I'm grabbing my finances by the balls! My networth is about $750 right now, and even though I'm a college student, I don't find this acceptable.

A little background: I have my projected incomes and expenses in an excel spreadsheet and will be monitoring it closely. I have two years left of schooling (one undergrad, one grad), and I want to try to save as much money as I can in that time, to get myself started off on the right foot. My dad is gracious enough to pay for my car insurance, Otherwise, everything else is covered by my scholarships, grants, and my part time job. 

My absolute **biggest** expense is dining out. Not to make excuses, but I loathe cooking, and that combined with dining out being a good social activity for college students made for going out regularly, sometimes multiple meals a day. This is why I'm going to record everything in a spreadsheet, so that when I see how ridiculous my spending is I will be more likely to put it in check.

Now that all that is out of the way, to address the title of the post. I have readjusted my direct deposit to deposit 50% of my wages from my part time job (totals *about* $600-800 a month post-tax) into a savings account with a bank (Side note: anyone think Ally is a better idea, compared to like .01% from a regular bank? or not worth it for the lack of convenience?) that isn't even linked to my Mint account. My thought here is ""out of sight, out of mind."" If it ends up being that I can't live off that, I will adjust, but I figured I'd push my limits and try it.

My question is, is there anything else I could or should be doing with this small of an amount of money? I'm thinking in my situation, it is best to just keep it as liquid as possible. I will be doing a 2 month internship in a major city this summer, and will be paying two rents due to it (though I will obviously be making money from the internship, about $1000/week pretax, but rent could be as high as $1500/month). 

With all this in mind, and this seems more obvious now that I'm typing it out, is the best thing to do with my dough to just sock it away in an out of sight out of mind savings account? Also, feel free to chime in with any other ""starter"" advice!

Thanks!"

A lot has been useful toward pointing me in the direction that I want to go with my finances. However, I was hoping for some feedback from you guys on how I'm doing and what my steps for the future should be.

I work a part-time job, which is where most of my income comes from for the year. I do get financial aid, but that's another beast that I would rather not focus on at this time. Here are the numbers on my situation and how I budget:

Average pay check every 2 weeks: $200.00

Groceries: $50.00

Gas: $15.00-$25.00

Miscellaneous (entertainment expenses typically): $50.00

Savings: $25.00 (toward emergency fund)

The $50.00 extra that I have left over I save toward expected and unexpected expenses that come up. 


I just want to know if I am utilizing my current situation to its fullest potential. Having such a low income has taught me to be frugal and forced me to make a budget to track all of my expenses. I plan on having an internship during the summer that will supplement my current income minus a little.

So that's where I am at now. Any and all feedback is appreciated.

Do I even stand any chance in getting a job at the Big 4?

Also, a few questions:

- Does 4 links seem a bit too much (email, website, github, linkedin)?

- I was only at my last position 3 months because it simply didn't work out. Does my presentation bring up any questions/should it look different?

- Does ""Language skills"" seem a weird label since I'm a developer? Would there be a more appropriate name?

- Listing SAP internship as 2 listings in my new one -- does making this re-hire apparent make me look more employable (ie: SAP decided to hire me again)? Or would 1 listing like in the original be more succinct?

I had more questions but I can't quite remember them right now...

Then it became things like never letting me drive (I still don't have my lisense since she never lets me go out and practice, and the same thing is happening with my sister (18)). Because of this, i really did not have many (ok, any) friends by junior year, because who wants to hang out with someone who you can only ever talk to in school? Not only that, but i feel like she has been training me NOT to rebel since i was little. Choosing what clothes I could wear, what I should eat, what instrument I should play, that kind of thing have been going on my entire life. Even now, I'm afraid to go against anything she tells me to do because she screams at me and says things that put me down, how I'm a horrible daughter, I don't appreciate her enough, that type of thing as long as it takes to make me cry and then she tells me I'm acting like a baby.

*I'm not entirely sure what makes an applicant attractive to grad schools - what makes an applicant more desirable than another? 

*I'm also getting mixed messages from my school's advising department regarding when to apply. I've heard everything from ""You should have applied last year (junior year)"" to ""You should apply only after you graduate, secure a full-time job somewhere, and stockpile enough money to pay for school."" When exactly do you apply?
*What does financial aid look like for graduate school? I've heard horror stories about people graduating with absurd amounts of debt - my family is not ridiculously loaded, and my undergraduate degree was more or less funded with academic scholarships and grants.

*My goal is to eventually do research in artificial intelligence. For now, I would be pursuing a Master's degree in CompSci. However, the schools with the best CompSci programs (MIT, Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, etc.) are extremely selective and expensive - taking both economic background and where I'm getting my undergraduate degree from, I doubt that they'll give my application a second glance. How much weight does the school stamped onto your degree actually carry?

*Is it viable to work a full-time job and be a full-time grad student?

*Are professional recommendations acceptable as supplements to recommendations from professsors? I feel that my employer would be able to write me a strong recommendation - would that carry any weight at all (as opposed to a recommendation from a professor)?

**Background Information:**

*Major: Computer Science

*Concentration: Software Engineering

*GPA: 3.65

*Job Experience: I have 6 years of job experience and will soon be adding a CompSci related internship to my resume.

I don't know why but I look at my classmates, my SO (who is in the same program and year as me) and just focus on how I'm worse than them. I can't give myself any credit for my achievements and translate that into confidence that I'll get hired to do actual programming.

She comes home for 13 days starting tomorrow.

I don’t know how to feel about it.

On one hand, I’m ecstatic to see her again. She makes me happy and I miss her. I miss having someone here for me. I miss the way her hair is always flawless. I miss the way she kisses me. I miss having someone to talk to, to look at, to feel, to fuck, to comfort, to complain to, to hold, to laugh with, to love, in person.

I miss being the person that can do all that for someone else.

On the other, darker, dismal, disgusting, but ultimately more realistic hand, she has no plans to stay here. She wants to go back to Los Angeles and live and work and have a life there.

When she talks of home, she refers to herself as a big fish in a small pond. I feel like I fit in here, like I belong. What does that make me? A small fish, content with mediocrity? An immovable fixture in the pond that she occasionally visits and talks about with affection and tenderness? A fish she hopes to reel out to sea? I don’t know the answer to this. 

I’m afraid to ask.

She thinks being here in Suburban Chicago is failure to the thousandth degree. Does she tie me in with that failure? Does she actually think she’s better than me?

When I came to visit her in LA, I asked to meet her friends. Every time I brought it up, she had some excuse and skirted away from the question. Did she make up her friends in an attempt to make it seem like she’s happy there?

Or is she ashamed of me? Again, I’m afraid to ask.

My love and fear are at constant conflict, making this small pond feel like a tumultuous storm; my head spins, they sky seems darker.

I’m lost.

We need to talk. I need answers. I need to face my fear, weather this storm. 

Most of all, I need to find out if this big fish is worth reeling in and holding on to, or if I should let her move out to sea. I’m afraid she won’t make her way there without my support. I’m afraid I won’t stay afloat without her.

At the same time, I feel like I’m drowning, stranded with no one to save me. She’s so far. She can’t help me from 3,000 miles away.

When she first left, I thought she’d be gone for four months.

When she finished school there, she got an internship and she had subleased an apartment. She was gone for seven months.

When she finished that internship, she moved and got a new lease. She started a new internship. She’s been gone ten months.

She’s applied for dozens of jobs and is waiting for a call back from them. She excitedly told me that if she gets the job that she’s swimming after, She’ll be able to stay a week or two longer.

I don’t want her to stay longer just to leave again.

She’s causing the waves that are pulling me under.

She’s not entirely to blame, though. I've made it worse than it’s had to be. I pick arguments with her needlessly and I can't seem to get past my own pettiness. I’m the one causing the worst of the storm.

But I’m trying to surface, to get my bearing. To calm the storm in my head and think clearly.

I’ve made my decision.

I’m going to ask if she’s coming back.

If she says no, I’m cutting the line and letting her free.

If she says yes, I’ll ask her if she can give up on her dream without resenting me.

If she says no, then we’ll sail our separate ways.

If she says yes, I’ll be glad to have her back in my life.

But if that’s the case,

she’s probably lying."

Debilitating loss of faith in my abilities, don't feel like I can do it, but I have to.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1tatwr/ive_20_f_transferred_to_an_ivy_league_school_and/,"**TLDR;** **I am a former straight A student who is bombing her first semester at an Ivy League school and who is rapidly losing her ability to believe in herself. I also have no friends due to anxiety in social situations, and crushing pressure from both my parents to do well because of a sister that is ridiculously successful.**
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, don't know if this is the best place to post this, but I've frequented this subreddit quite often and I hope people here can give me some good insight on my situation.

Well, where to start... I know the title sounds almost like a First-World Problem. Especially considering that my parents can afford to pay my way through school without forcing me to take on any debt (yet, anyway). But I've been struggling ever since I got here at the beginning of fall.

Before I came here, I was straight A student with a 3.7 GPA at a ""prestigious"" all-women's college. It was really a good self-esteem boost to know that I could do well at a school packed with such talented and driven peers. However, I didn't really have a social life as a result, and spent a lot of time studying and isolating myself (this is a continuation of a habit I formed in high school, which is a really long story). 

The important, unfortunate result of having no friends for years is that I now have almost a form of borderline social-anxiety, where I feel too embarrassed to pass people by in the hallway even if it's just to go to the bathroom. For this reason, I am also pretty hesitant and freaked-out by the idea of going to TA hours or a Professor's office hours, so I rarely did it at my old school. I'd never needed to before.

Fast forward to me getting here as a junior, I've already had to drop a class because the material is so much harder, and I am much worse at test-taking than I'd thought. The graders here are a lot less forgiving than the ones at my last school, and on top of that, I got so anxious about doing well on the midterms that I ended up sleepless the nights before both midterms and this anxiety spilled over into another class, which I am now in danger of failing as a result. My major is one of the most rigorous fields at this school, and I really am starting to doubt my ability to pass every single one of my classes PLUS two more over the next 2 years. And I'm already at the maximum number of credits that I can transfer in.

Needless to say, I am incredibly, cripplingly afraid of failing this class, so much that I couldn't sleep after taking the final (yet to be graded), and I've been mulling over one question over and over again in my head for a week. It's driving me insane. I've burst into tears multiple times just thinking about this stupid question that I couldn't solve, and still don't really know how to do. I'm also stressed out that this is a critical period for me; my sister and family insist that I need to find an internship this summer or I will be left in the dust. Who would want to hire someone whose grades drop so drastically under the slightest addition of pressure?

 As you may have assumed, there is a huge cultural factor here. My parents have internalized the importance of good grades in me from a young age, and they are both livid at the idea that I might need 5 semesters to graduate. Especially my mother, who sometimes yells at my dad for giving me $20 to go to the mall. I don't know how much it would impact my life to take that extra semester and try to shoulder as much debt as I can. Add onto it that I have a high-achieving sister who is currently studying for her phD, has been financially independent since halfway through undergrad, and just applied to ninety jobs. One of which just gave her a 160k salary offer. She is too smart and savvy to ever be in this situation, and so I feel like my parents disappointment would be even more crushing as a result.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I felt like I gave it my all and still failed. Granted I didn't go to hours, which is my own fault. I rarely had time to, and was held back by my fear of social interaction. I would be working on projects and homework for 50 hours a week, and would have to skip classes for a quarter of the semester to get my work done. I studied for a week for my finals, and I still know for a fact I did a terrible job. How can I get myself out of this mess? I've done therapy in the past (4 different therapists), but I've always felt a disconnect with them."
1tar8m,2,2013-12-19,My [25F] husband [25M] of one year always gets incredibly angry and down when things don't go his way.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1tar8m/my_25f_husband_25m_of_one_year_always_gets/,"Hi, Reddit!  I apologize in advance if this is long-winded and, possibly, confusing.  I'm just trying to get my thoughts in order as well!  Thank you for your patience.



Firstly, I deeply care about my husband.  He is a wonderful man, and he is very good to me.  I can only hope that I can even strive to be half as good to him as he is to me.  Secondly, I know that, especially with this situation, we could benefit from marriage counseling, but, when I bring it up, he always says something along the lines of, ""We can't afford that.""  I know that some agencies provide payment according to a scale, but he says this even if we want something that is a couple of dollars that he sees unnecessary.  This is why I'm coming to you, Reddit! (Wow, I feel like I already have a lot of excuses; sorry about that. :/).  Thirdly, I have expressed everything said here to my husband.  But, it just seems selfish for us to focus on my feelings when we're in a marriage together!



Anyhow,  we have been married for almost a year, and, yes, we are still getting to know each other.    I have been diagnosed with depression a few times throughout my life, but I have never taken medication out of fear of it drastically changing my behavior.  I've had odd reactions to it before (like feeling constantly 'high').  I have learned how to keep myself out of a scary/deep depression by training myself to keep a positive outlook, no matter the situation, and by keeping myself busy.  But, the one main thing that triggers this depression is constantly being around negativity.  



The straw-that-broke-the-camel's-back, or so to speak, for this post is his job situation.  He graduated a year ago with a bachelor's degree in engineering.  Since he couldn't obtain a job, he decided to continue his education with graduate school.  After about a semester in grad school, one of our neighbors informed my husband about a job opening with the company that my neighbor works for.  My husband applied and was so excited that he started looking for houses and planning our future with children, etc.  I love seeing my husband excited like this.  This is when I love him the most.  A week went by, and my husband found out that his application wasn't even taken into consideration.  They weren't even going to interview him.  I told him to keep it up with the applying, keep a positive attitude, and keep trying.  He told me that he had been trying for years.  



He told me that he had previously applied to a few (4) internships and about 7 other jobs and was not given a single interview.  I, admittedly, snickered a bit, thinking he was joking about the ""applying for years"" when he meant applying for 11 jobs.  I've seen some of my school-mates apply for 11 jobs... each day for months before they got their first position.  I feel awful because he was serious in giving up on applying.  Understanding that ""big deals"" and catastrophes are different for different people, I apologized for my snicker and buckled down to support him.  I helped him revamp his resume, cleaned up his ""professional"" look, and off he went to a job fair.  He talked to a few companies and passed out his resume to said companies.  No response.  



He was so down by then that I knew I had to do something to cheer him up.  By this point, he said he was tired of going to school and just felt all around burned out.  I completely understood this because going to school for so long is not for everyone.  I was paying bills with a job in a city that had limited career opportunities, and, if he wasn't going to attend school, we thought there was no point in us staying in that city.  I devised a plan for us to move 6 hours back to our home city; he could work for my mother's company, and I could, finally, finish my bachelor's degree... Plus, we'd be closer to both of our families.  Everyone seemed overall happy with this plan.  I also told him that I could work instead of go to school because my mother isn't the best of mothers (or employers).  She usually means well, but she goes about it in a haphazard way (But, that's another story for a different day).  She pays well enough so that we are able to afford necessities, and I'm very good at budgeting to where we have a little bit of savings each month.   



5 months later (currently), he applies for a job online after being angered by something my mother said.  To his surprise, he was called, interviewed, and, then, interviewed again.  This happened over the course of a week, and he seemed happy but skeptical.  I made sure to choose my words carefully since he can be sensitive at times (Hey, we're all different :)) and keeping in mind what happened the last time.  I told him to keep optimistic but not to keep our hopes up high; at the very least, this is fantastic interview experience!  Plus, he already has a job, and we have other things to be fortunate for.   We have enough savings for over a year.  We did 4 practice interviews to warm him up and to get rid of his ""uhms"" in his rhetoric. 



Today, we find out that he didn't get the job.  I saw that he got sad, so I gave him a couple of hours to himself.  Afterwards, I went in and gave him a big hug, smiled, and said, ""Be happy!""  His response:  ""Why should I be happy about getting rejected?  I'm un-hireable and worthless.""  I told him that he is neither of those things and that we'd have to just keep trying.  This was supposed to be interview experience.  It's nothing personal.  They just have a business to run.  He stated, ""The definition of insanity of trying something over and over again with the same result.""  ""Well, I support you no matter what. But, if you want to keep trying, we can practice more."" ""No one wants me.""  The conversation is always like this.  Positive.  Negative.  Positive.  Big Negative.  Positive.  Blame.  Positive.  Yelling.  Crying.  I feel awful crying when trying to talk things out with him about a situation that happened to him.  I feel awful because this is supposed to be about him, but, then I start crying.  That's not fair to him.


He has given up again and keeps repeating that he's ""worthless and un-hireable.""  This just makes me sadder and a little bit angry.  I just want him happy, dang it!



Reddit, I'm not sure what to do.  He gets down often about a lot of things, not just the job situation.  I've tried cooking, baking, sex, gifts, outings, talking, not talking, movie, funny shows, silly dancing... Probably a few other things.  I know that we are inevitably responsible for our own happiness and that we have two different personalities, but I'm his wife!  I want to make him happy when he's down.  What are some of your ideas?


Also, what are some of your stories about struggling to start your career?  I think it might be good for him to read others' experiences so that he knows he's not alone.

**TL;DR**  Husband is very negative when I try to stay positive. I'm not sure what to do when he's down.  Help me, Reddit, you're my only hope! "

That being said, do any of you think that if I'm looking for I.T.-related employment about a year from now, that perspective employers would care if they found out that I walked out on Walmart (or that they would even bother calling to find out)? I've never done anything like this before, and I feel guilty, but I also can't handle the workload of both of these jobs. What do you guys think?"

I've been aware that I've been this way from a *super* young age and I'm not sure what to do. 

I've been thinking about MtF transitioning since I was 14, but a few mental roadblocks are standing in my way:

* My family is pretty orthodox Christian, and they won't accept me ever again. I can never go back.

* My friends are homophobic...they'll leave me and they won't come back.

* My chosen career field (aerospace/electrical/computer engineering) is 80% male, and many of them aren't okay with LGBT people. I might not get a job if I go to college, especially since I always dreamed of being a professor.

* Money is tight, and these are major expenses; especially since I'll have to quit my current job in the gaming industry because they don't tolerate GBT people in this industry very well.

* I'm very much overweight. I eat my feelings and it shows (eating disorder, too) :/

I'm in a tough spot right now as it is. Mom stabbed me this summer during an internship with the DoD and told the entire family it was my fault, and they still believe her, so they all hate me now. Been depressed too.

I KNOW I'm dysphoric and this isn't going to go away. 

Please kind of help me sort through these muddled thoughts."

Here's the problem.

The main reason I wanted to come back next year was to see if things would work out with my girlfriend or not (that way we could leave the same year and move to the bay or seattle together). Now that we've broken up I feel like I want to work in the industry for a few years before I decide whether to do a Masters.

However, I'm worried that if I quit the masters program I might get booted from my internship and lose out on what could be a career setting opportunity.

How do I approach this? Should I tell them ahead of time? Should i wait till towards the end of the internship before telling them that I'm considering not going back?"

1tejjb,7,2013-12-21,Reversing my ostomy.,holidayfromreal,CrohnsDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1tejjb/reversing_my_ostomy/,"My dear fellow crohnies,

Yesterday I met with a colorectal surgeon at Johns Hopkins  here in Baltimore. I am proud to announce we are working together to reverse my ""temporary diverting ostomy"". Who knew temporary meant 13 years.

I am going through many emotions. Rufus, who I have always fondly referred to as my ostomy, has been a part of me since I was 12 years old. I am now 25. Going through my teenage years was rough. Going through puberty is hard enough on a girl, now imagine strapping a bag full of shit on her abdomen. It took me many years to accept Rufus and not be ashamed. He has become a part of me that I grudgingly accepted. Now the thought of having him removed makes me scared, nervous, anxious, and excited. 

Rufus literally saved my life. I was a very sick child. Misdiagnosed at the age of 8, correctly diagnosed at 10. Had the doctor at the time caught the Crohn's, Rufus may have been avoidable. But, shit happens. Doctors make mistakes. My parents took me to the emergency room at Children's National Medical Center one particular night. I was in so much pain I was curled into a ball on my bed screaming and crying in pain, I couldn't even get up. My father had to carry me. None of us knew how severe my disease was. To this day we are all grateful for a wonderful, talented doctor named Benny Kerzner. He was the chief of gastroenterology at the time and became my main doctor. (Side note: if anyone lives in the DC area and has a child suffering with crohns - I highly recommend Dr. Kerzner.) that trip to the ER turned into a 2+ month stay at the hospital. I do not remember much. I was in and out of morphine-induced comas. I remember one night pretty well. My father was with me because my mother was in need of a break. He was giving me a bath and suddenly I looked down, blood everywhere. I was bleeding profusely from my anus. The bathtub was just blood. The last thing I remember was my dad screaming for help. I woke up in the ICU. Pastors from the church came and prayed for me. I was a horrible bitch to all of them. I was a horrible bitch to nurses, doctors, residents, and I'm pretty sure I made an intern cry once. I was angry, bitter, hungry, and didn't know what was going on with my body. (Plus those goddamn Checkers commercials were haunting me -- 'YOU GOTTA EAT' 'FUCK YOU, CHECKERS!') Before the surgery, I remember a social worker coming to speak to me. I can't remember her name, but she was a lovely lady. She was trying to explain to me what a colostomy was - I didn't understand a bit. My mother and the social worker assured me I would feel a lot better after the surgery. A few hours later, they gave me the anesthesia and I went under the knife. I woke up in the recovery area disoriented - and I couldn't find my blanket. We never did find it :( nurses came to check on me and I repeatedly asked if I was dead. I called one of them a bitch. God, I was awful. They finally took me back to my room and I had no idea why my abdomen hurt so badly. My dad and mom explained what the ostomy was in a way that a 12 year old could understand. I cried for hours. I didn't want that. It made me a freak. What would my friends think? How will I ever learn to swim as well as my sister can? How will I ever wear one of those cropped tshirts that were soooo cool? I was pissed off. My dad cracked jokes and made me laugh. It hurt to laugh. A few weeks later, I was finally discharged. They were all right about how I'd feel better. I was a different person. Nurses and doctors didn't recognize me. I smiled, I laughed, I said 'please' and 'thank you'; I was kind. Rufus did that. 

As you can imagine, my anger came back. It was hard to learn how to care for an ostomy. I was clueless. I wasn't good at it in the beginning, which caused a lot of awkward situations. I cried in the school bathroom a lot. People made fun of me. They didn't know what was with me. They didn't care. I was the butt of jokes - ha. Butt. I was 16 by the time I fully accepted Rufus. I had caring for him down to a science. I got my drivers license. I got an after school job. I got a car. I became a normal teenager. I graduated from high school when I was 17. I began college. (Never finished - but that has absolutely nothing to do with Rufus.) I began dating when I was 18. I had my first real boyfriend. I lost my virginity. My boyfriend at the time didn't even know about Rufus until we had been with each other for 6 months. I became skilled at hiding Rufus during sex. I still am. I've been with men who have absolutely no idea that under my tank top is a bag of poop. Although I'm sure they always wonder why I refused to take the tank top off. My life went on, and Rufus went with me during every step.

Now here I am. 25 years old. Working my first ""big girl job"". Living on my own. And I'm finally moving forward with reversing something that was once supposed to be temporary but became permanent. It's going to be a long process, but I'm excited. The surgeon seems very talented. She's sweet and has a warm presence. She said she is going to do this. 

First step is a colonoscopy and biopsy of my anus. I am having this done on January 7. Dr. Gearhart, my surgeon, says as long as everything is good inside and down there, we will be scheduling the reversal surgery. 

I'm not sure what the point if this post was. It kind of turned into a rant. Thanks for reading. Perhaps I needed to get this out. Wish me luck, Crohnies. And please share with me any ostomy stories, or if you've been in similar situation, what it was like to go back to ""normal"". "

From what the client has been telling me, it seems to be crashing and certain things are not working but I can't figure out why.  I do not have access to the clients phone since he's not in the same area as us, so I can't look at it physically and just output the logcat. I'm going to talk to him over skype or something similar to show him what we see and to see what he's experiencing.  Also some information about me, I'm just an intern so I'm still learning a lot about android, but I also seem to have the most experience on android since the company is deals mostly with iOS, so I don't have anyone above me that knows a lot about android. I'm really bewildered about this problem.  Has anyone else experienced this problem before?  Also when I do meet with him, any advice on what to look for specifically and how to do this to get the most accurate details on what is wrong so I can get rid of this problem.

Turns out it was the client, they installed the wrong apk......Thank you all for the helpful advice, although no longer needed."
1te9s8,3,2013-12-21,Things I've learned and some inspirational quotes.,Queggy,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1te9s8/things_ive_learned_and_some_inspirational_quotes/,"Last night I almost broke down and PMO'd. I was laying awake in my bed, unable to go to sleep. I thought about turning to PMO to calm me down. Instead, I forced myself to stop and meditate on what I've learned so far and how it has helped me.

I know that I'm only 15 days in and haven't made it to the magical 90 yet, but I've learned a few things already and thought I'd share with all of you:

1. **Stay busy.** I don't know about the rest of you, but I mostly PMO'd when I was bored or restless with nothing else to do. I launched my NoFap challenge shortly before my university's Christmas break; a time where I might normally be less busy and more prone to turn to PMO. Instead, I made sure to get an internship where I'm working 40 hrs a week. After I get back from work I'm either hanging out with friends, family, or working on putting together a portfolio. I am on my computer MUCH less than normal. I've been so busy I've barely been able to even *think* about PMO. 

1. **Remember why you're doing this, where you're going, and how far you've come.** When I first started the NoFap challenge I relapsed twice. Each time I was wracked with guilt. It wasn't worth it. It never is, and I knew that, I just chose to ignore that. We all do that. Last night when I was struggling with relapse it was helpful for me to remember that I've already made it two weeks. By this point, it would just be so **wasteful** to throw that all away. It made it easier to not ignore that part of my brain telling me I would feel terrible after I relapsed. I know the first few days are the hardest, breaking that initial barrier. But trust me, make it through those and it becomes a little easier. 

1. **Don't just do this for yourself.** While NoFap is an excellent goal in-and-of-itself to make yourself a better and healthier person, don't forget that it helps with relationships as well; physically, mentally, and emotionally. When I go back to school in January I have a date waiting for me. It helps in my struggles to remember that this isn't just for me, it's for her as well. 

1. **This fight isn't easy, nor should it be.** If breaking this addiction was easy, this subreddit wouldn't exist and PMO wouldn't be a problem. Whether you're at 14 days or 1400 days, the struggle against relapse will always be there. But you can break it. You're better than that. You're a fighter.

Lastly, here are two inspirational quotes that I feel some of you might appreciate:

*""The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. The fears are paper tigers. You can do anything you decide to do. You can act to change and control your life; and the procedure, the process is its own reward.""*
 
- Amelia Earhart

*""The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly; it is dearness only that gives everything its value. I love the man that can smile in trouble, that can gather strength from distress and grow brave by reflection. 'Tis the business of little minds to shrink; but he whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves his conduct, will pursue his principles unto death.""*

 - Thomas Paine

**Edit -** Forgot this, but it's one of my favourite poems and definitely applies here:

*""Out of the night that covers me,
Black as the pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.*

*In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.*

*Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds and shall find me unafraid.*

*It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the scroll.
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul.""*

- Invictus. William Ernest Henley"
1tdz37,14,2013-12-21,Student at top 10 school failing for first time,new_confessor,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1tdz37/student_at_top_10_school_failing_for_first_time/,"I'm a scholarship student studying computer science at one of the top 10 schools in the nation, and I'm failing for the first time in my life.

For a little background:
In highschool I was the president of several clubs, a varsity baseball state champion, and a National Merit Finalist (SAT was 2350). I ended up getting in to the school of my dreams, an elite East Coast university.

I was shocked when college ended up being a challenge, probably the first that I had faced in my academic career. My freshman year was hard, but I fought through it. The first semester of my sophomore year I got a 3.9 - I thought I had figured school out - but the last two semesters were completely different; something had changed.

I don't know how or why, but I think I've developed an anxiety issue. I am so paralyzed by my fear of doing poorly on assignments and projects that the enthusiasm I once had for the work has been replaced by a dull, throbbing anxiety.

In the beginning I thought it was just normal procrastination, but more recently I've found that even when I have times specifically planned for work I just end up getting too anxious and trying to do something else to relieve my stress.

My GPA has dropped so much that it might prevent me from doing the master's program for which I had thought I was a shoe-in, and I am utterly at a loss for what to do.

I have never admitted any of this to my friends at school, my parents, or really anyone else. I've been able to maintain a veneer of success (i.e. my scholarship and a summer internship in the industry), but it feels like my life is spiraling out of control. 

Any ideas you have to offer will be appreciated and seriously considered."

That instantly got ""Hey ya"" in my head... Moving along! So a few months back I quit my job to follow my dream after getting an internship at a restaurant, long story short it wasn't what I need as a chef, I spent a lot of time being outright made fun of and chewed out for food that honestly wasn't what I wanted to learn (figured that out too late) so needless to say I decided ""eff this!"" because on top of that I was doing it for no pay for 60 hours a week (no joke) and didn't feel being put down on top of that was necessary.

So cut to right now, a month after leaving and I'm a bit shaken, confidence is on the rocks, questioning everything, wanting to give up and finding it hard to get up and take action on like... Everything. Its hard to talk to my friends and girlfriend about it because they're like ""You're an awesome chef! You need to do it!"" but inside I guess it hurt me to be kind of bullied again, it brought me back to being that nerdy kid everyone made fun of, no one wanted to be around and no one talked to and honestly I haven't been able to shake it.

Any ideas on how to get back on the horse?
Thanks guys."

**46,022** worldbuilders for **5 years!**

“Fantasy is escapist, and that is its glory. If a soldier is imprisioned by the enemy, don't we consider it his duty to escape?. . .If we value the freedom of mind and soul, if we're partisans of liberty, then it's our plain duty to escape, and to take as many people with us as we can!”
― J.R.R. Tolkien

So it was that John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, son of Arthur Reuel Tolkien, son of John Benjamin Tolkien along with his fellow escape artists began leading minds everywhere out of the everyday and on into newly built worlds. Worlds where practically anything is possible. Places where one can find wondrous magic, mythical creatures and [enough cloaks to completely cover King's Landing](http://imgur.com/gallery/sNx1a). These trips into the [fantastic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QFwo57WKwg) can serve to entertain, act as distractions, and they can even provide some insight into the boring average world.

/r/fantasy is reddit's own personal gateway into all of these other worlds that have been put to paper by talented writers, many of whom have contributed to the sub's [extensive amount of AMAs](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1gk4r7/list_of_ama_alumni_links_to_previous_amas/). Some writers even decide to stick around and become regulars of the sub. It is a subreddit that regularly allows for content makers to interact with the fans. The team of mods act as the gatekeepers to this portal as well as making sure that the sub is one of the best locations on the web for fans of the genre to gather. Here is the interview I got to have with the team:
&gt; ##1.Tell us about yourselves

&gt;&gt;**kjhatch**: I'm a freelance graphic designer and web application developer. I'm an older guy with a growing family and always too much to do :)

&gt;&gt;**nitesmoke**: Single dad, 34. I live in rural U.S. I've been reading fantasy books since around 1985 or so, and still do to this day.

&gt;&gt;**stridera**: New moderator still trying to learn the ropes. I'm a single 34 year old software engineer and writer. I hope to be an AMA author before long.

&gt;&gt;**elquesogrande**: Yet another family guy who is older than the average redditor. I have a business background and, in a former life, evaluated reddit as an acquisition candidate before it was sold to Condé Nast. I love the speculative fiction genre and what the r/Fantasy has done over the years.

&gt; ##2. You were featured two years ago, can you give an idea of what has changed since then?

&gt;&gt;**kjhatch**: From my perspective the sub's grown a lot, but all in a good way, with a strong focus on community activity.

&gt;&gt;**nitesmoke**: The amount of author AMAs is insane. We've had some of the biggest names in fantasy literature stop by and interact with the community. I got to have a personal conversation with Terry Goodkind!

&gt;&gt;**stridera**: /r/fantasy was one of the first subreddits I frequented. Since then, I've been happy to see more AMA's and a larger user base. Many authors and publishers see reddit as a serious avenue to reaching fans, and /r/fantasy has helped shape that growth.

&gt;&gt;**elquesogrande**: We are now one of the largest fantasy and speculative fiction communities on the web. The industry recognizes r/Fantasy as a great resource for fans, potential fans, authors and artists to interact. Great growth and, at the same time, the community feel is still there. r/Fantasy is now a daily stop for many authors and industry people.

&gt;&gt;In September, r/Fantasy hosted a table at WorldCon in San Antonio. This ended up being a focal point for many authors during the long weekend – where we hosted live AMAs and interaction. We also helped to put on a 200+ attendee Drinks With Authors event as a way for fans and authors to interact less formally. We gave away hundreds of new and author-signed books throughout the evening.

&gt;&gt;r/Fantasy will continue with these types of activities in 2014.

&gt; ##3. Why do you think so many big names of the genre stick around and become regular contributors in the sub?

&gt;&gt;**kjhatch**: Of all the social networking sites, Reddit's got a more low-impact, casual participation curve. It's just easy for people to get on, participate when they want to, and stop when they don't have the time. Facebook's either too personal or non-personal with no grey area, and Twitter generally requires a more sustained participation to work well. That makes Reddit, and /r/Fantasy specifically, a better forum for genre community discussion.

&gt;&gt;**nitesmoke**: The way so many authors stick around and become part of the community. It's not uncommon to see Brandon Sanderson leave a comment now and again. It's the only subreddit where the fanbase has so much variety of access to the creators of their media.

&gt;&gt;**stridera**: Reddit's voting system allows users to ask questions with real communal interest. This means authors can answer questions that actually mean something real to their fans. Also, the passion of most of community is amazing and I think the authors really pick up on that.

&gt;&gt;**elquesogrande**: r/Fantasy is about connecting authors and artists with fans and potential fans. AMAs are the gateway for many big names – it’s the great interaction with r/Fantasy redditors who keep them coming back. This is a relatively respectful, honest and appropriately snarky bunch.

&gt;&gt;r/Fantasy is also one of the largest speculative fiction communities on the web. The moderators not have a profit motive and we are not affiliated with a single publishing house, which makes us a uniquely fan-driven community.

&gt;&gt;A lot of earlycredit goes to authors Brandon Sanderson (/u/mistborn) for starting us down the AMA path and Robin Hobb (/u/RobinHobb) for helping us to refine the process for future authors. Both continue to support the community and, like many other writers, recommend r/Fantasy when they can.

&gt; ##4. What is your favorite part of the community?

&gt;&gt;**kjhatch**: I like all of it, but I think the AMAs are what set /r/Fantasy apart from even other similar areas of Reddit.

&gt;&gt;**nitesmoke**: For the sub, I see the success of other AMAs to lead to more. Hopefully we can branch out eventually to include more fantasy creators of other types, for example the person who creates music for a fantasy MMO, or the Director or an actor from fantasy film or television.

&gt;&gt;**stridera**: The people for sure. The fans and authors of the subreddit keep the topics interesting and the advice honest.

&gt;&gt;**elquesogrande**: How the community reacts to opportunities and to adversity.

&gt;&gt;For example, r/Fantasy has supported Patrick Rothfuss’ Worldbuilders charity for three years running. The community has embraced the effort – contributing time, money and donation items. This year’s donation started with a steel great helm that WorldCon authors signed. It went for $2,025.

&gt;&gt;r/Fantasy has hosted authors with controversial works and opinions for AMAs. I have been amazed at how well the community has treated these writers during AMAs and afterwards. The r/Fantasy community can disagree and even dislike positions in a respectful manner.

&gt; ##5. Where do you see the sub/genre heading as fantasy becomes popular with a larger audience through things like television and movie adaptations?

&gt;&gt;**kjhatch**: The focus is mostly books now, but there's already some movement toward getting artists more highlighted. I'd like to think the sub will continue to encompass all forms of Fantasy media, where eventually we'll see participation from actors, musicians, special effects artists, and other professionals from related fields with a genre-connection.

&gt;&gt;**nitesmoke**: For the sub, I see the success of other AMAs to lead to more. Hopefully we can branch out eventually to include more fantasy creators of other types, for example the person who creates music for a fantasy MMO, or the Director or an actor from fantasy film or television.

&gt;&gt;**stridera**: The subreddit will continue to grow, but I don't see the community going away. Hopefully the growing interest will continue to reach out and bring more sought out authors to enrich the content.

&gt;&gt;**elquesogrande**: r/Fantasy is a place for the broader fantasy genre and any medium – books, music, art, TV, games and more. That said, the book industry that has embraced r/Fantasy more than any other. We expect to see this branch out into other areas in 2014.

&gt; ##6. Anything else to add?

&gt;&gt;**kjhatch**: I like dogs. There ought to be more Fantasy books written with dogs in them.

&gt;&gt;**nitesmoke**: Happy Holidays!

&gt;&gt;**stridera**: I'm honored to be given the chance to assist the community and hope I can help the subreddit grow.

&gt;&gt;**elquesogrande**: Many thanks to reddit.com leadership, authors, artists, industry people and r/Fantasy members for what you do for this community.

1tdt5y,2,2013-12-21,Never give up hope(advice from a past sufferer),abere001,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1tdt5y/never_give_up_hopeadvice_from_a_past_sufferer/,"A little over a year ago I had overwhelming anxiety. The fear of failing out of college and not achieving anything in my life sent my anxiety through the roof. I had panic attacks over everything, even to the point where I became a hypochondriac which only made matters worse. Depression and anxiety ruled my life. Therapy,anti-depressants, and even  family support weren't enough to help me. I even developed some complex stomach issues because of all the stress. I knew I had to do something to snap myself out of it. I started watching feel-good movies and listening to motivational speeches. I started  exercising and eating healthy (getting all the proper vitamins and minerals). I listened to alot of speeches by Les Brown on youtube. Panic attacks happened less frequently. I could finally be in a room full of people and not feel overwhelmed. I started forcing myself to face any fear that arose in my day and found how silly it was that such trivial things caused so much stress in my life. Even working at a job I hated, didn't seem as miserable. I became focused on fixing every aspect of my life from rekindling the relationships with my friends,getting back in school, to getting better with woman. My life started to improve. I started to have confidence and all my anxiety went away. I got back into school and even got a great internship. My sex life has never been better. I got a better job that i really enjoy doing. Its been so long since I've had a panic attack. My point is that you should never give up hope. If anxiety is bothering you, face it head on. Figure out what is causing your anxiety and do something about it. Stop feeling sorry for yourself if bad things happened to you. I've been there myself, and I know how it can seem like life is out to get you and you'll never be happy or worry free. You can handle anything life can throw at you and the beauty of it is that it'll only make you stronger. If you are full of worry and anxiety I highly recommend you youtube Les Brown. Download an mp3 of him if you have to but listen to him daily. You can always do something about your situation no matter how bad it gets. You'll be amazed at what happens with the right mindset and encouragement. "
1tdpoy,12,2013-12-21,Bad stuff happened. I need advice.,thisismyfuckingdick,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1tdpoy/bad_stuff_happened_i_need_advice/,"So here's my story. Went to community college for 2 years, transferred to a UC with a 4.0 ready to start upper division computer science. First quarter went fine. Next three didn't.

In my year at university I managed to earn an internship at Amazon. It was an awesome experience and I did well enough to be invited back for another internship.

However, despite being a pretty good programmer, I turned out not to be so great at being a student. After D's in physics (twice) and math classes, I just found out that I've been academically disqualified from my university. 

Which puts me at a crossroads. I can either go to
community college again for another year and them come back, or I can just quit school now and try to make a career with the experience I have. Aside from my Amazon internship, I also have some contract work and personal projects under my belt. 

I really don't know what to do. I want to finish school, but it kind of feels like it's for nothing at this point. I've taken all of the core programming classes, everything left is math and extra stuff. But still, I know how much degrees are valued and how helpful it would be to have one. But would it be more valuable to just get more experience? I don't know. I'm really lost here. 

Throwaway account because of how embarrassing this situation is.

So if you browse my posts, you'll notice that I'm a junior in college at the moment. You may also find that I have a internship in a nice corporation and I've recently realized how deep in shit I am. Excuse my language. 

Essentially I've got a decent amount of computer knowledge. I can put one together, take it apart, swap parts, fix it, etc. I can do the same to a network: put together, make it nice, fix it when it breaks. However, this doesn't compare even close to what happens on a corporate level. And I get that I require experience, and that I lack it at the moment. But I guess I don't know how to close the gap of where I'm at now, and where they people that work here are at.

To my point: How do I choose which set of Microsoft certifications I should take? At one point I was interested in getting my CCNA, but that fell off. Now I'm not sure what part of IT I'd like to learn. I'm interested in tech support, and maybe some sort of networking. Maybe even database. 

TL;DR: College kid severely lost in IT and I don't know how to choose what MS certs to look into.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. And if you know where I should xpost this for more insight, please tell me."

You know, you find one you like and express interest. Only to never hear back. Or you actually go on a date (interview) and try to impress your date (employer) and get rejected. Well I just heard back the rejection from a position that I had worked my ass off to get.

About the company/job/interview:

The company was referred to me by a VP (different company) I met at a networking event. I began networking with the company, scheduling meetings to discuss the company and connecting with different people via email.

I applied to a few positions and originally heard nothing. I proceeded to email and ask about internships. They got back to me and scheduled a time to have a phone interview. The day and time of the phone interview my phone didn't ring. A few hours waiting past the agreed upon time, I emailed HR asking what the deal was. They informed me that my interviewer didn't come into the office that day, and to reschedule. I was upset but I remained civil and understanding in my email to reschedule.

The next day we conduct the phone interview. The guy on the phone asked me why we were discussing internships when I was qualified for an actual position within the company. He said he would make sure to have HR email me and set up an interview for a permanent position. HR gets in touch with me and a position was actually one that I had applied for originally but never heard back for. We ended up scheduling an interview with 4 different people for 30 minutes each. I prepared like hell for the interview, researched the company and specifically what services they offered, prepared notes and researched each one of my interviewers to view specific projects they completed so that I could reference them during the interview. I went to kinko's and printed/binded my professional portfolio, each addressed personally to each one of my interviewers.

Well, two of my interviewers weren't there that day, and they recycled the guy I spoke with on the phone to interview me again. Despite that, the interviews went great. I referenced their work, expressed my understanding of exactly what it was that they did, showed them a specific example of me doing the work that they did. They said they really were impressed by my portfolios and continued by saying they hoped I could join the team and talked about how great it was to work at the company.

Following up the interview, I sent out 6 hand written thank you's to each one of the connections I had made with the company, including the interviewers and HR.

They said they would get back to me within a couple days, well over a week and a half went by, during which time I sent following up emails as polite reminders and to check up on my status. The person I was told I would hear from gave me the runaround, saying they didn't know the next steps in the process and that I would hear back from the hiring manager. After that didn't happen I emailed them back referencing that I was told I would hear from them, and immediately after received an email saying they were pursuing other candidates that were the best match for the firm.

I'm pretty pissed off and bummed out by this whole process. I sincerely went above and beyond and gave it my best shot. I know that I am qualified to do the job and I literally proved it to them by providing examples of my work.

Thanks for reading, I just needed to vent. Would appreciate your comments.

tl;dr: This has been the worst year of my life, proving that my best is never good enough, in both my personal and professional lives."

1thmxk,5,2013-12-22,"I'm gonna join AA! Also, story time!",headpool182,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1thmxk/im_gonna_join_aa_also_story_time/,"After my last post, I've decided to join AA! I haven't had a drink in 252 days, and I'm not worried about me. I'm worried about people like me. People who don't see that they have a problem. I'm gonna start here though. Here's my story!

I started drinking when i was 16, didn't drink often, maybe a party every other month. I turned 17, and stopped completely. Didn't have a drink for a year and a half, just before my 19th birthday. It was the cool thing to do. I became a partier. I was drunk every weekend of that summer, and quite often, during the week too. I went back to school, party every weekend, and then I was arrested for something unrelated to drinking, and diagnosed with bipolar. Doctors told me ""you shouldn't drink."" I said, ""Ha, they went to medical school, and have a tonne of education. What do they know?"" I would go through spats of binge drinking, followed by a few weeks of no drinking. A few times i got myself into binds, but my parents quite often bailed me out. One time I got black out drunk, and stranded in a city an hour away from my home. My dad picked me up at 1am, and I was admitted to the hospital the next day. 
Later that summer, i got an apartment of my own, and after not having drank all summer, i said ""i can handle this"" and started drinking again. My place became party central. There was always weed, or booze and at least 8 people in my small bachelor apartment. Fast forward a couple of months, I begin dating a girl. I'm getting sick of the way my so called friends were treating me, so I ended up moving back in with my parents. Still drinking though! But don't worry, i got it under control. I start back into school(21, still not done high school!), and end up meeting up with some people that i go out and party with after class. One night, I'm drunk, stoned, locked out of my house by mom(she knew, didn't like it... their roof, their rules). The next day, i hopped on a bus, and pretty much moved to another town. Spent the first few weeks living off my income tax, and... you guessed it! partying! Cause, hey, no one tells ME how to live my life! Finally got a place, and made a TONNE of mistakes. But some good came out of it. I used an online dating website to find girls to hook up with. One of them lived about an hour and a half bus ride away from me. I was determined to bang this chick and never call her. But she kept shooting me down. The more I tried, the more i got shot down. The funny thing was, the more I got shot down, the less about sex it became. I was falling, and hard. Still drinking though! By this point, i've completely stopped taking my medication for my bipolar. I'll just self medicate with alcohol, marijuana, caffeine, and nicotine. Got a job working overnights at mcdonalds, and my roommates kicked me out of my rented room in a townhouse. Not exactly sure how that worked, but I didn't care! I had booze!
 Finally, i got this girl to say yes to meeting me, and i took a bus down. We spent time together, I got drunk, and we got high, but the one thing i took away from this weekend was this: this girl is it. She's the one. Go ahead a couple of months, and we decide to get a place together in my town. She moves in with me, we spend the next year together, drinking(always my decision), and while we both make enough that we can live, we have no savings. No emergency funds, nothing like that, because guess what! I need beer! I finally scraped together the money i needed, and proposed. She said yes! I was engaged! However, I was super drunk one night, and started talking to a girl online. One thing led to another, and some pictures were exchanged. Not the smartest of decisions. But then again, who makes smart decisions when you're drunk. My fiancee found out, and was livid. There were several more incidents of me being black out drunk, and getting emotionally abusive, but I shrugged it off and kept drinking. Finally, just before a year and a half into our relationship, we hit a wall. I was unmedicated, and I was a jackass. We split up, and I had a massive breakdown. I moved back in with my parents(Seriously, they're crazy how much they've put up with me. I'm so blessed to have parents like them.) But I was still drinking! I didn't have a problem with it. 
I lived with my parents for a while longer, but my fiancee and I realized we loved each other too much. We had gotten past my indiscretion, and were now focusing on getting me mentally healthy. I was back on my medication, and she was seeing the change. So was everyone! Her mother was actually starting to like me. Finally, in the new year, her, myself and my brother got a place in the town she was from. Maybe not the best decision, but we make the best of it. I started school, and instantly hit off with 2 guys in my class.(I had finally graduated high school the june of the previous year) We would go out for beer during the week, and always on fridays. After an exam? BEER! Cheep pints? BEER! I don't recall too many events where i would get aggressive, but i'm sure they did happen once or twice.
 Finally, that september, my fiancee and i decided we were going to get married, finally! November rolls around, and we have our wedding. She spent the week at her moms before the big day, and i don't think i was sober a single night that week. Wedding reception comes, and I cannot actively recall not having a drink in my hand at any point during the night. But, no worries. Booze isn't winning. I got in under control. Things all came to a head on April 13, 2013. I'm a musician. I do acoustic shows here and there, and I played a BYOB show. We showed up with a 24 for me, my wife, and a buddy. It was enough. I wanted more. I ordered more. My wife, and mother-in-law both said i shouldn't get more. But what do they know? We end up leaving early, and i'm up till 4am with 2 friends drinking. I finally head to bed, and my wife is visibly angry. We get into a screaming match, my one friend is out cold, the other one takes off, obviously feeling awkward. I don't remember the rest, but i remember her leaving. I went to bed, saying screw everyone.
    I woke up later, nursing a hangover, and just laid in bed watching comedy central roasts. I get a knock on my bedroom door, and there is my brother, asking me to come into the living room. My mom, dad, sister, brother, wife, and mother-in-law are all there. I have a problem. I can't control my drinking. If i don't stop drinking, my wife is going to leave me. Then my mother-in-law speaks. My father-in-law is an alcoholic. He was emotionally abusive to my wife as a child. He told her ""don't bother trying, because your best will never be good enough."" while he was drunk. He doesn't remember it. I'm being told things i said to my wife when i was drunk. I don't remember those saying those things... oh god... i have a problem. I spent the night with my parents at their place. I couldn't be alone, and my wife didn't want to see me. I had hurt her too much that morning. I was on an internship for college, and i had missed some days, due to hangovers, and apartment issues(we had some plumbing issues.) I was unreliable. They fired me. I lost a good reference. For the first few months, I still didn't believe I was an alcoholic. I didn't think my problem was that severe. But, the more i reflect on my behaviour, the more I see my mind didn't see it as being as severe as it actually was. I wanted to drink to get drunk. If I wasn't drunk, I was in a bad mood. But the thing was, when I was drunk, i was an asshole. I was in a bad way. I almost lost my wife, and my family. I lost a potential job, and I'm certain I've ruined friendships over it. While I may not have been a full blown, drunk every day alcoholic, I was on that path. Recovery hasn't been easy. There's days where I wish I could have one drink. My mind tells me ""i can handle it."" People look at me funny when I say I know if i had A drink, that would be it. Game over. Because i've never been one to do things half way.

That ended up being longer than i thought it would be, but i guess i just wanted to tell my story. I hope it helps someone see the problem when it's bigger than they realize. "

$103k total savings 

 $35k retirement

 $26k historical annual expenses (Included $2k for buffer)

 $27k for full master’s degree 2.5 years (Rounded up from $22k)

**Expenses (per month):**

1,350 rent for next year (I live in an expensive city. I don’t drive. I’m not moving. I’m not getting a roommate again. Can’t live with parents. I’ve made up my mind about this.) 

   200 food/going out

   250 utilities (electric, cell phone, internet, gym, transportation)

   200 shopping (clothes, shoes, pharmacy, presents, maintenance etc.)

2,000 total per month

I don’t know how much my health plan will be, as currently my ex company is paying for cobra. I contacted them last week, HR said they’d get back to me regarding the cost. I tried signing up to ObamaCare, but the site crashed. So currently I don’t know how much my health insurance be. If I don’t work I will end up going on Medicaid – since there is a penalty if I don’t have health insurance. Therefore, health should be 0.	

**My plans:**
After much research, I decided the best option for me is to go back to school full time and not work. Live off my savings. I want to get my Masters degree as fast as I humanly can but most importantly have a GPA of at least 3.65. I plan to study for/take the CPA while I’m at school. If I have a good GPA, I will be able to get a job at one of the big 4 public accounting companies after I graduate, I want to get a summer internship there first. I’m not worried about future employment. I have a very good job history as well as recommendations/references.

For 2013, I want to contribute money to my IRA, $5.5k since I won’t be able to contribute money in the future since it depends on if I work or not.

I will have to pay taxes of about $4k in 2014, for 2013.

Pay for school 100%. I am looking into scholarships as well as open 529 to save money on taxes.

This entire journey (from now until I get the masters) will take 3.5 years (Rounded up from 2.5 years, 1 year buffer)

**QUESTIONS:** 

1.	In my expense estimates, am I excluding something?

2.	I feel like I should decide on an amount I won’t allow my savings to dip below, but I can’t seem to decide on a number. How should I determine this?

3.	Does it make sense to contribute $5.5k to IRA? I will have to pay about $4k in Apr’14 for taxes.

4.	Should I pay for school or take out a loan for half just in case?

5.      Any additional thoughts?

I am a 25 year old guy who on the surface hits the gym 4-5 times a week, has a good job and generally a good circle of friends and a loving family. I am not  a virgin and I have had a girlfriend before (that ended back in 2008). Scratch the below the surface a little and you'll see I have been on the PMO wagon since the age of 11, doing the deed on average 3-4 times a day for a whopping 14 years, frequently going into double digits. Since 2011 I have started using cam girls and seeing escorts - in total I calculated the spend at being around $10k. I under performed in my undergraduate degree, wasted my time at university and left single, broken and unemployed. 

I think atleast for me the point where things got out of hand was simple and I'm sure a few of you guys reading this would agree. The second I bought a laptop and had my own dorm room resulted in fapping of epic proportion - until 3,4,5am. Waking up groggy the next day missing lectures, not really being a responsive boyfriend because you can just fap at home, not really being a responsive son or brother because all you care about is fapping and feeding the monster.

Another significant thing happened in 2008 during the summer, rewind back to January 2008 I still had the atractive girlfriend, had an internship at a great organisation for the summer and was doing ok academically (not brilliantly but well enough). Fast forward to the summer and I had been dumped just before my finals, flunked those finals, messed up my internship badly, my closest friend was my sister through my life until that point and she had gotten married and moved out, and a good friend of mine had passed away due to cancer and all of that happened in the space of maybe 8 weeks. The person I was before and after were very different - in one simple way I think I stopped caring as much. 

Since graduating I worked my way into a good organisation and completed other internships - I think the obsessive compulsive side of me applied myself just as hard to repairing my career as I was fapping but in honesty I wasn't doing much else. Work - home - fap - wake up routine. Things really changed in March 2012 - when I suddenly after four years of no sex I saw an escort, it was amazing. I saw her again and again and again and in doing so kicked off what became the unholy trinity. She returned to her home country and in being upset I saw more and more escorts, and my behaviour continued to escalate to the point where I truly have entered the realm of being a gigantic lust ball (you name it and I have done it). During this time I also started viewing cam girls so we had all the pieces of the trinity in place PMO - cam girls - escorts, I was on first name terms with maids in these establishments, got special treatment, every cam girl knew me as a good spender and I had bookmarked every website that you can name. I rationalised by think I don't go on holidays, I work hard, women still don't like me - I deserve this everyone does it (THEY REALLY DON'T!). 

TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES
At some point my mom saw all the camgirl receipts on a bank statement of mine - and inquired I told her the truth. Needless to say it broke her heart but she has confided alot of faith in me to beat it. 

It might have been because I have recently got hooked onto a tv show which details the rise and fall of a chemistry teacher turned meth king pin (no prizes for guessing which show) but the truth is I need to deal with the consequences of my actions. I spent years locked away fapping my energy and heart and soul out, trying to kid myself that the answer to my problems was PUA or religion or just hitting the gym or whatever it was. No the real issue in my brain is f'd beyond all recognition. 

I struggle to think of women now as anything more than objects and in truth I have become a true perverted mess of a person underneath a very clean organised exterior. 

There's been so many, clear outs and deleting sprees of what I had downloaded and deleting contacts of my phone and pics of my laptop and all these other things. I love that scene in Shame where Fassbender bins everything he owns and pours pasta over it into a giant black bin bag - I have done that so many times. 

And what am I left with now? Years of not really travelling, over working myself, over fapping and being a horrible friend and family member. A good $10k which could have been spent on so much more - than flushing it into the gutter. 

PRAGMATISM
My low point came when I was running through town from one working girls flat to another desperate to get my fix, she was European and didnt have very good English we communicated via google translator software on her laptop. I went did the deed and went home. I remember running through the rain being completely out of breath after a tough day at work and this must've been a Thursday so I still had to be in the next day. Or ordering a subscription to a well known P website and spending countless hours as a pig in filth, or how much has been spent on cam girls, there's so many troughs this year and my behaviour is just disgusting. 

In any event I told a couple of close friends and they highlighted this is not normal behaviour, what I am doing is not cool and I NEED to get through this and escape the unholy trinity I am currently in. Otherwise I will continue to be an ED induced, sex addicted pervert forever. 

So what have I been doing? Well I started coming here more and more, since November I have blocked every P website I could think of, started gymming again properly, eating properly and generally getting my head into the game a bit more. I probably halved my fapping in Nov and in December went clean for the first 9 days (my longest streak in years), I've stopped visiting escorts and cam girls, I have had a massive clear out of my place and generally have done all those superficial things which need to be done. 

The problem persist though - I need to get my dopamine fix and those days with no PMO or edging even after a few of them really were harsh, I became agitated, emotional, I felt like tearing my skin off. I have so much respect for those forum members who push through these things and don't relapse particularly those with PMO problems of similar intensity or worse. 

WHAT NOW?
I have no idea - I have relapsed this week and finding it really tough to get back onto that path. Cold showers, P blockers, accountability partners, gym routine, loving supportive family all the pieces are there and I am thankful for all of them, what I am hoping is by highlighting this to you guys and keeping a diary of it it will force me to continue powering through the tough times. 

I'm sorry for the essay, but it felt great to type it all out! I'm not sure how coherent it all is but you guys really are inspirational and I want to continue to NoFap transition from being this giant lust ball to being a normal functional man. 

Thanks for reading and will keep you posted :)"
1th28j,2,2013-12-22,"Me [23 M] with my GF [23 F] of 5 yrs, complicated please read.",RelegationWatson,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1th28j/me_23_m_with_my_gf_23_f_of_5_yrs_complicated/,"So we have been dating since the end of high school. And everything was fine with our relationship we were happy and things were good.

The this past summer (I am getting close to graduating from college) I took on a leadership position at a job and a small internship, I probably worked 45-50hrs a week. I did this so I could beef up my resume before being sent into the real world.

Everything was fine for probably June to the middle of July but then around middle of July I noticed that when I called her after work she didn't seen as excited to hear my voice as she usually does. I didn't say anything about it because I was super busy and tired when I got home and I thought she would say something if she was unhappy. She is usually a pretty straight forward person and tells me everything. SO I thought things were fine.

About mid august she starts hanging out with these two new people a F and a M. I noticed and I asked if everything was ok with us. She kinda pushed it off and I pried it out of her that she didn't like that I wasn't available or around for a lot of the summer. But she understood I had to do it for my career, etc, etc.

About the end of august there was this festival that she said she wanted to go to and I said ok. I took off work to go and I told her and then she said it was a work thing, and that everyone from work was going. And that I couldn't go, I didn't understand this and this is when I really got suspicious of things. We had big fight about why I couldn't go and I was really upset about it but didn't go. She said they would be out til about 11-12pm but she didn't get back until almost two.

She and this one guy (lets call him carl) from work seemed to get close really fast. They texted quite regularly and he called her things like lovely, sweet, etc. I didn't like this and she agreed to tell him to stop calling her things like this. He didn't really stop. 

Then in September there was  LoL tournament on the internet and carl invited her to a party to go to. She said she would go and then come over at around 10pm. She texted me until 10pm and then I didn't hear from her until 12pm and said she got a call from her dad at his house about her cousin being sick and decided to stay there and talk to her dad. I was really pissed that I wasn't aware of this for two hours and she couldn't bother to tell me or drive over to my house while on the phone. She basically completely ignored me for two hours when she was supposed to come over.

Fast forward to November it is our anniversary and I go over to her house at like 6am to pick her bro up for school. She is sleeping and I decide to snoop on her phone (I know not very respectful but w/e) I find this text between her talking about how he wants to kiss her. I woke her up and ask her what this is, she tells me they were making fun of some letter his ex sent him and says don;t worry about it. I say w/e and get really pissed off and drive to school. She calls me on when I get to school and I just start yelling at her about how I couldn't believe that she would think this is ok, etc, etc. I then say ""Happy Anniversary I guess."" She then starts to cry and says she is so sorry and asks me to come home. I tell her no I have school and I'll see her tonight. We talk about it when I get home and I tell her if anything like that happens I walk out that door and never see her again.

About mid-November I find out he has been calling her and talking to her on the phone late at night for hours. I confronted her and she said he is having some issues with his life about being successful, 27 with a part-time job (he doesn't have a college degree and everyone else in his fam does and doesn't know what to do.) blah blah blah.

TLDR: Basically this guy is seemly flirtatious and I do not like it. My GF wants to be friends with him and that I should trust her. I don't think she cheated because she has been cheated on and knows how it feels. She also seems to respect what I say when I am upset about it.

Am I overreacting? Should I trust her? Should I give her the ultimatum him or me? Or should I just end things and say goodbye for good even though I love her and feel like we are meant to be.

-I'm living alone, all my roommates have gone home for christmas/new year's etc.

-I don't really have much to do, since my internship begins only in early January.

-I'm in the film/photography/writing field, so most of my work involves a computer, which is basically a temptation-machine.

-Every time I get a strong urge,  I end up here reading subreddits and it's a big help, but the issue is, my mind knows that fapping after 2-3 days feels so much better than fapping the second time in one day, and so it really craves that extra elation since it's been 2 days. How do I fight this? I've fought a couple of times today already, but I don't know how long I can last. I need some good rationale to beat this urge.

Help!?!?! Anything is welcome!!!

TL;DR: Fapping after not fapping for a while feels great- how do you avoid the temptation?

Stay strong, fapstronauts!"
1tgy08,4,2013-12-22,Anyone working in media/journalism in NYC have advice for a fellow media/journalism guy?,AquaFunkyBeats,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1tgy08/anyone_working_in_mediajournalism_in_nyc_have/,"Hi r/jobs,

I'm not sure what to do anymore and if any fellow media folks can offer some advice I'd appreciate it.

Let me give you a rundown of my situation. 

I graduated college with a journalism degree back in June 2012. After my wife finished her degree we decided to move to NYC. I had a decent contact base in our hometown, but prospects in journalism and media were bleak at best. I figured if I'm to hustle and grind to get this career rolling I may as well do it in the media capital of the world. 

We moved and after about three or four months the wife gets a high paying job in her field. I was working retail. I ended up finding a nice internship in marketing in July, but left fairly quickly (verbally abusive boss).

Now, I'm unemployed and basically in the same situation as when we first move here. I have no idea what I'm doing.

I've been doing freelance work while looking for full-time positions, but payment is always an issue. The stories I work on take too long to do and pay pennies (especially in this city).

When I manage to get interviews they always tell me they appreciate the work I put into my app, but it takes a pretty long time to do that. I end up getting 2-4 apps out a day and that seems slow to me.

I'm told I have an amazing resume, and I'm proud of it too (did it myself). However, it hasn't gotten me much thus far.

Finally, I generally focus on hip-hop culture as my beat. Most of my clips have something to do with hip-hop and its elements. I'm proud of this work, but it doesn't seem to be getting me anywhere as I can't seem to find a company willing to give me a shot at full-time. I worked hard in school to be as versatile and flexible as possible, but I fear it may not translate as well in my portfolio.

I just need some advice from some folks that have made it in this field, in this city. I spend far too much time in our apartment online and I feel like I should be out making moves. I just have no idea how to make said moves.

TLDR: More than a year out of college and still nothing on the job front. Working in a tough field in a harsh city. Discouraged, confused and rapidly going broke. What should I do?

Thanks r/jobs!"

I've had a good summer internship as a Software Engineer at a great company this past summer, and have accepted a computer science management like internship position at an amazing San Francisco company for this summer. In addition I have received several offers for different software engineering/program manager internship positions. That being said, I was wondering if there are any jobs out there that are adventurous. I love Computer Science, but I everyday I want to have an adventurous job using Computer Science. I know this is a very corny thing to say and seems very idealistic, but are there any jobs like this that maybe deal with the ""field."" One job, which I view as my dream job, that fits this role would be Palantir's Forward Deployed Engineer position.

The athlete I hate.",[deleted],nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1tg0iw/started_writing_this_as_a_response_to_an/,"** tl;dr I hate Lebron James too. I hate Lebron James because I don't think he works as hard as everyone else does, and that bothers me as someone who has to work hard**

Before I begin, if you are tired of conversations about how much Lebron sucks and how annoying the Heat are, you should stop reading now. It's another one of those conversations. 

I've always felt this way but when I started writing it down it was kind of lethargic for me, so I kind of went overboard. It's kind of long. 

I've always ""hated"" Lebron. Not him as a person, but what he represents in my point of view. 

First off, let me say the positives, because this man has a lot. He is incredibly talented, works his butt off and seems to genuinely care about his community, family and teammates (I don't know him personally of course, these are assumptions).  

But I fucking hate him. I hate his kind. First, let me tell you why I love the legendary #23. Now I'm too young to have experienced most of this, but this is the legend of Michael Jordan as I see it. 

Michael Jordan, he's been doubted. He's had to prove himself. He was never supposed to be as good as he was. He had to fight tooth and nail to earn it. There are stories about people that called Chicago sports radio stations after the draft complaining about the pick. Crazy in retrospective right? 

Michael Jordan has faced *adversity*. So has Kobe Bryant, Tom Brady, Jerry Rice, Wayne Gretzky, Derek Jeter, all these great players have faced real adversity. 

Lebron James? I've been hearing about how's the next Michael Jordan since he was in High School. He was on sports illustrated as a high schooler! He comes into the league and doesn't disappoint; the GOAT(Greatest Of All Time) conversations start early in his career, comparing him to *legends*. Then in my humble opinion, for the first time in his career, he started to face some *real* adversity. 

The NBA title wasn't easy for him to win as many expected. Then in Beijing in 2008, stories were written about how Lebron James was in awe of how hard Kobe Bryant worked. This guy was supposed to be the GOAT, and 5-6 years in the league and he was still taken surprised by how hard KOBE BRYANT worked? [This kind of story](http://www.thestar.com/sports/basketball/raptors/2008/04/19/if_hard_work_counts_kobe_league_best_by_far.html). That was supposed to be his rival. That moment was when I hated him, he has all this talent, he isn't winning the championship everyone assumes he's going to win, and he has allowed himself to be **outworked**? 

This made me think that he expected to coast on his talents in the NBA. Even *after being swept in the finals*, he wasn't the hardest worker in the NBA. How is that possible?! I hate everyone in the world that is lucky enough to be born with advantages and thinks those advantages make them good enough to be the best. 

See I work in sales, and LBJ reminds me of the guys who inherit massive accounts, have the top sales numbers, are considered the top salespeople but they're really just glorified cashiers. Those guys probably majored in psychology, took 12 credits a semester, didn't have any commitments like work or internships, had spending money from his parents and brags about his 3.5 GPA. 

I had to work 40 hours a week with an 18-19 credit course load in a  relatively difficult major. I barely had time to study and was grateful to graduate with a shitty GPA. I managed to find a job, only to find myself coming in second to those guys. I'm the guy fighting tooth and nail for a shot, nickel and diming his way to the top while the LBJ's of the world work half has hard as I do and have twice the success.  

If he worked as hard as Kobe Bryant does in basketball or as I do in my corporate job, I believe he could have won several titles in Cleveland. Winning NBA titles back to back isn't easy. Going to 3 (or more) NBA finals in a row isn't easy. It takes a great team. Lebron James is the best player on the best team we're going to see for a while. And people will look back and say how smart he was to go to Miami, how many titles they won there and how dominant those teams are. 

A lot of people consider him the best player in the league. There aren't as many people that consider him the hardest working player in the league. That's not how the world is supposed to work. The best guy doesn't have to be the one with all the tools to succeed, he is supposed to be the hardest working guy. Michael Jordan and other greats set that standard, and I've lived my life believing that as long as I work harder than everyone I can be the best. 

Coincidentally, around the same time that Lebron James won his first title, the world started to show me, that in this day and age, the Lebron James of the world are the winners. Not the hardest working guy. I think he represents that, and I hate him for it)

*Note: Hate is a really strong word. I am really happy I get to watch him play, he is a joy to watch and amazes me everyday.*

We started during the second half of our last year together at high school and we get along extremely well. I've never before been this satisfied with another human being. Things were great during the school year; we had a healthy relationship and were both genuinely happy. There were a couple fights, but we got through them and grew closer. At the end of the school year, I had to move to a town 90 minutes away to stay with my family. When we got together initially, we didn't expect it to last this long (it started out of a FWB arrangement). We eventually decided that we'd try long-term because it wouldn't be too difficult since we both had cars and the commute wasn't too hard.

The summer went pretty well. We were so incredibly happy to be back together during every visit. We talked and video chatted constantly. We decided, though, that it would be best for us to break up at the end of the semester. We're going to fairly distant colleges (~4 hours apart) and neither of us have access to a car. We didn't want to shut ourselves out of the experiences we'd have at college.

We broke it off and went to our respective schools. About a month later, she visited me and some of our mutual friends. We realized that neither of us had moved on and that we missed being with our best friend. We got back together in the heat of the moment and I don't regret it. She's been wonderful for me.

As the semester waged on, she became more unhappy. Not with me, but with her life circumstances. She hated her roommate, she couldn't find a job or internship, and her relationship with her parents got more visibly rocky. She revealed to me that her parents often verbally abuse her and that had contributed to her low self-esteem. She is in a constant state of flux between extremely depressed and okay. She only seems to be happy around me and some of her really close friends (unfortunately none of whom go to school nearby).

I'm getting really concerned for her mental health. She views herself as a genuinely worthless individual and her circumstances aren't helping. Her parents can be really brutal to her. I want her to seek counseling, but she says she can't afford it. I don't know what to do. She means the world to me and all I want is for her to be happy."

This week something changed with my sleep patterns and I had a few memorable dreams. The dreams were terrifying, but comical in retrospect. 
   
**Dream One: Infiltrating the mafia via time travel (with my incompetent friends):**   
It was all of the most naive people I hand met in community college (just a set of faces that I knew, in the dream, to be naive, one or two specific people from my past) and I. We were selected to go on a mission. It was some sort of strange internship. We were to be sent forward in time, about 2 decades, in an attempt to infiltrate the future mafia. My peers were enthusiastic, I was skeptical. My friends began assembling disguises, but had no information from the future as to what fashion would actually look like. Their disguises were purely out of speculation, and I felt they would come off the was a sci-fi film set in the year 2000 does today. How would people respond when we were oblivious to the latest pop-culture icon. What would happen when the violent organization we are infuriating discovers we are lying about our identities? I suddenly understood that we would likely all be executed. Even a successful mission would probably result in a ~%50 survival rate, but it's likely that once one of us were made, we would all be executed in a cold, dark ally in the harsh future. I asked a companion who was well briefed on the scenario how he expected people would react to our presence. He told me that, at first, we would be treated very well, as our contact in the future will have us all taken under the wing of mob members. I knew this would involve accepting drugs, prostitutes, and committing violence as a rite of passage. I was prepared for this, but I knew the others were likely not. It was the day we were scheduled to enter the time machine. I was weary of, and wasn't fully committed to the mission, and thus was the least prepared.  The machine was hidden in a closed store at the mall. I found the others sitting around a table, waiting, and laughing. They had D&amp;D character sheets and were making alignment charts and skill sheets or something (Iv'e never played D&amp;D) for their ""roles""  they would be playing under cover. They thought it was funny. I knew they were going to die. I pulled one young girl aside and asked her ""why are you doing this? What do we gain from this risk?"" she explained that she was not given any other opportunities, and felt too guilty to decline. There was fear in her voice. The End.    
    
**Dream Two: Drugged by my roommate**
This one I was sure was not a dream. I often lucid dream, but this one really, really fooled me. It started in my bed where I was sleeping. My roommate knocks on my door, and asks to come in. I mumble ""yes"" somehow. He enters with his girlfriend (who sort of lives here now but not really) and they told me they had baked a trey of brownies. Soo far, nothing unusual. I eat one, and then they tell me they are going to wonder around wall-mart for a while and invite me.  This is unusual, and I decline. They leave. I stat to feel light headed and try to go back to sleep. My vision becomes distorted, the walls pulsate. I recognized that I was high on hallucinogenics, and that my roommate and his girlfriend intended to trip and wander around wallmart. I thought this was very strange, I had some experience with drugs in the past, but I knew my roommate did not.  Then I loose motor skills. I tumble onto the bed. I get up, and now Iv'e lost it. I'm gone. I start swatting at ghosts that I see in my doorway and then I fall over again. I decide to try to lie still and wait it out, but then I start convulsing, and can't move half of my body, and half of my face was limp. Those amateurs didn't know what they were doing and OD'd me, and now I am in real danger. I thought I was having a stroke, and wanted to call 911 but did not have to ability to do so. Then I woke up. The stroke dreams happen a lot due to my consciousness of sleep paralysis.    
    
**Dream 3: My mother runs over 2 farmers, writes a screenplay about it, Harvey Weinstein options it, and the Cohen Brothers hop on board.**   
My mother is driving somewhere, I am a passenger. We are on a back road. She is not speaking. Something is wrong with her. She veers left, through a wood fence, i react she says nothing. Totally blank expression on her face. She somehow gets back onto the road. The property owner and his brother are standing near their pickup truck ready to confront us. My mother deliberately runs them over.    
    
She isolates herself in her apartment, and remains silent. She then writes a screenplay about the event. Somehow Harvey Wienstiene organizes a meeting with me. I am embarrassed because I forgot the name of his production company, and mistakenly refer to it as lion's gate (it's Miramax IRL). He told me the Cohen Brothers loved the screenplay, and he wants to make it happen. I told my mother. She said ""that's nice"". We were driving somewhere. "
1tfohr,2,2013-12-21,Mother can't handle me [21 F] wanting to stay in college state for summer for the first time w/o visit,Utasora,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1tfohr/mother_cant_handle_me_21_f_wanting_to_stay_in/,"Let me preface this with the relationship I have with my mom as it will shed light as to why this is so devastating/a problem.

I am an only child. My mom has been the only person I've truly loved, relied on, and knew was always there for me. My parents fought a lot when I was a child, my dad was emotionally, verbally, and sometimes physically abusive, and they finally got a divorce when I was 12. I lived with my mom and I do not feel much of anything for my dad. He's my dad, however, and we have gotten along better after the divorce, him remarrying, and controlled some health issues.

My mom is a very insecure person (because of the abuse and her childhood). My mom and I are very close and are best friends. I've been told by a few therapists that we are too close because my mom depends on me too much. We've both slowly realized how emotionally damaging this can be or is, so we've been better about how much she relies on me or how much I let her rely on me. That isn't to say she doesn't still emotionally.

---

Now for the problem:

I am in my third year of college (in Florida) and home (Missouri) for Winter right now. Up until now I have came back for every summer and winter break. 

Now, however, instead of living in the dorms, I am living in an apartment with my boyfriend of a year in FL (since July) and wanted to stay ""home"" (apartment) for the summer - just this summer. I'd like to keep a job (my dad helps me pay my rent/college at the moment - not my mother), go to conventions that happen the middle of the summer, hang out with my friends since they have a break from school, etc. I'd like to possibly even get a summer internship in later years.

I, for some reason, thought I had told my mom this sometime during the Fall in passing and she was fine with it. I mentioned it today in passing and she **flipped**. She was furious, yelling, crying, telling me she was buying me a plane ticket and that I was coming home for a month.

She thought I was coming home every winter and summer until I was finished was college. She said almost every kid does it. I told her I'd come for a week but she said she wouldn't pay for that little of time.

She is now so offended that she doesn't want me to come home at all. She says we are not as close as she thought and she's just not going to tell me anything from now on. She goes on to tell me that I am not invited to her and her fiance's wedding (they have been engaged for several years and he lives with her), she's going on a vacation this summer and won't tell me so I can't buy my own ticket to visit her at the house, and she tells me I'll most likely find out about her daily life through just Facebook from now on.

I know she's saying most of these things to hurt me  (which it did, very much so), though she is serious at the moment, and she makes very rash decisions when she's hurt. I'm letting her cool down and we haven't talked much for the rest of the night. I'm very afraid she's going to keep these promises. I'm also afraid this is going to happen every time I decide to stay away from home for a break (I don't plan to do this all the time but perhaps I spend a Christmas with my boyfriend a few years later or stay for an internship?).

My question: What do I say to her? Am I in the wrong for what I did and am I wrong for wanting to have some breaks to myself for the next 4 or more years (I'm on my second semester of associates, then I'm resuming my bachelors in another field.. Trying to raise my GPA to transfer for bachelors)? How do compromise with a mother who's so upset about this and can't bear to not see me for until next winter? HELP! :(

---

**tl;dr**: 3rd year college student, financially dependent on only dad for rent and college. Want to stay ""home"" (FL) for the summer and mom can't stand that I won't see her (in MO) for a year. Expected to see her every year until done with college. Am I wrong for not feeling the same way? How do I compromise but not have to travel 1000+ miles every year? I'm not sure what to do without ruining my most important relationship."
1tfmun,1,2013-12-21,The holiday season has been my rock bottom. Please help me improve my life.,[deleted],MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1tfmun/the_holiday_season_has_been_my_rock_bottom_please/,"You’ve been warned…this is my rant, my story thus far. Please take the time to read this—and help me change it.

A long time ago, I found this story (link here: http://pastebin.com/veR0H73j). I have realized it has become my life. I really want to change my life.

This is the first year that Christmas has brought me no joy. This is a sign that I must change my life before it’s too late.

I’m in my early 20’s about to graduate. Yet, I’m empty. I feel like a ghost. I have about 5 true friends, but to everyone else, I am like a fairytale, a spook story. Do I even exist? I’m basically that guy you say hello to and give that kind smile, and then go about your day. And to my five friends, they have shown me a good time, but I feel like I am only desirable to them when no one else is around. I’m constantly put in situations such as “Friend 1, 2, 3, and I are going to X, want to come with us?” or “Are you coming out with us?” What this is implying that it is always me joining the group, like I’m never good enough to be part of the group in the first place. As if I were a dog they have to lead around.

There is a lot of assuming about me, which is ruining any sort of self-esteem and image I actually have.

Back at home for the holidays; I have no friends at home. Never had any friends in high school. I always knew it. Of course, it was evident at graduation when people avoided me for pictures. I stood there like an ass. When I come home, I see one girl (but friendzoned).

A damaged social life has instilled in me trust and confidence issues.

As far as academics, I’m stellar. I have all of the honors associated with a degree. I have a good working relationship with professors and administration. I get the grades and am a positive example of what a student should be. But I messed up professionally over a blunder with an internship. THIS has me most worried as I try to find a job. Naturally, all of my friends are getting good jobs and I might be working a dead-end job. I've been all over the world and have done every extracurricular program, which may about to nothing. 

Overall, I want this to change. I want to feel good enough. I'm tired of spending my life by myself. I want to experience love from another person that I could spend my life with. 

I want to experience life before I reach the point where I am about to die realizing that I never lived a day.

My gpa is 2.5 right now so I got 3 a year left after this spring semester. Am I seriously screwed right now? Although I was actually able to get a someone at PSEG to network me (The owner of the shop my mom is working at told my mom that she knows someone working at PSEG willing to network students) I'm still scared about how my grades will impact on these decisions.

For skills, I've learn autocad, java programming and have only done 2 years of volunteering at hospital and retail job.

any advices? (by the way, the career service in my school is so bad)"

Our cs program is pretty decent and top tech companies come to campus to recruit. I've applied to a bunch of valley startups/companies like yelp, amazon, salesforce, microsoft, etc. I haven't really applied to any smaller companies yet because there is an internship fair next semester. I don't know anybody at these tech companies and I've been applying and sending a resume online. I haven't had any luck whatsoever. Not even a response, just automated mumbo jumbo. To be honest the primary reason that I initially started CS was because of the ""many"" career opportunities and ""there are more job openings than developers"", but I'm finding this to not be true. I've been in CS for 1 year now and I love CS and I couldn't picture studying anything else now, so I am definitely in the right field for myself.


I am, however, starting to doubt my ability to get an internship position when I'm competing with thousands of other people who go to better schools like Stanford, MIT, etc. Also I goofed my first two years and I have a 2.8 overall and a 3.08 CS GPA, which just further lessens my confidence. 


So wtf am I doing wrong? I have a GitHub, academic resume, learned linux, can program in C, Java, Python, know OOP and Procedural... and ... STUDYING CS!! and day in and out on here and learnprogramming, you hear of people who aren't CS or are self taught and even people who can't code their way out of a wet paper bag AND THEY HAVE DEV JOBS!! Its so depressing that I'm in a major that supposedly has jobs left and right and supposedly I'm one of only a ""handful"" of developers compared to the number of jobs, and I can't even get a response for even phase 1 of an interview.


Sorry for my rant. I just feel that I'm very competent with programming and I'm a good problem solver who can work hard, and no one is giving me a chance.

1tkbbz,0,2013-12-23,[25m] To Move or Not to Move with my S.O. [25f],RogerfuRabit,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1tkbbz/25m_to_move_or_not_to_move_with_my_so_25f/,"I live in Idaho and my significant other wants to move to Califonia. We’ve been dating for about 6 months. I work half the year as a wildland firefighter and spend the other half unemployed/traveling/hunting/vacationing/working odd jobs. She just graduated undergrad and works in a laboratory.  My SO wants to move to California. She’s been thinking and talking about it for a while. She’s from Idaho and wants to move somewhere warmer, but more importantly, she wants to move away from her dysfunctional family, most of whom still live around Idaho. Unfortunately, I am not really interested in moving, especially to California, at least in the near future (1-2 years). Here’s the breakdown from my point of view:

Reasons to Move to California:

1) to be/stay with my significant other, who is pretty fantastic (smart, funny, active, beautiful)

2) I am looking in going graduate school and a school in California which is both 1) on of the best graduate schools for my field of study and 2) happens to be in the same city she wants to move to. Not bad.

However, I have lots of reasons not to want to move to California:

1) I have lived in 5 different states in the past 3 years. I am sick of moving and starting over again. It’s expensive and emotionally wearing.

2) I have my dream job in Idaho, fighting forest fires, and it actually took quite a bit of effort to acquire said job. I did an internship [in Idaho] after college, took some classes out of pocket, worked in two other states to build experience, and then finally found an awesome place to work back in Idaho, but I’ve only worked there one summer now.

Yes, California is heavily forested but it’s not the same. There are not the expansive wilderness areas devoid of people. And while I don’t plan on making a career out of forest firefighting, but for now, I am totally content/in love with where I work. Also, firefighting is run different in California and, from what I hear, it might be harder to move up.

3) I have an excellent friend group in Idaho. I have made several amazing friends with superb moral compasses and similar life goals as my own, AND I convinced several very good friends from college to join me there.

4) Overall, Idaho fits me like a glove - socially, politically, and economically. California is different: more liberal, more people, less open spaces (where she wants to move). I love the cowboy/logger/outdoors life of Idaho. From what I hear, California - yes, has loggers - just aint gonna be the same. I moved to Idaho to live in the wilderness (which I literally have done), not to move to another big city/metroarea with some mountains nearby [I am from a large eastern city]. Furthermore, I have not had the opportunity to go hunting in Idaho yet, because I have not been able to qualify as a resident until recently (in other words, it was prohibitively expensive). Hunting is a huge part of the lifestyle in Idaho and can be a far greater undertaking than hunting anywhere else in the lower 48. If I move away, I would either miss out on hunting in Idaho and/or have to take like a 1-2 month long trip back to Idaho (that wouldn’t be cheap) next fall. AND I wouldn’t have the opportunity to scout out hunting areas ahead of time (whereas, I can do that while working in Idaho). 

5) Her deadline for moving is at the time of year I will be most vulnerable financially, in the spring/early summer. This is when I am just beginning to work again (thus requiring some new equipment, boot repair, stuff like that), money from the previous summer is all but gone, but new paychecks have not yet begun to flow.

6) Are we ready to live together? We’ve been dating 6 months, it will be about 10 months by the time she wants to move. Will we be ready to live together, LET ALONE start over in a new city together? I dunno, but that seems like a huge risk for any couple.

7) I’ve already turned down one job opportunity to stay with her. It was short term job that would have padded the resume and wallet nicely, but would have required moving out of state for 4 months in the dead of winter. I had been vying for that job for over 6 months and pretty much solely turned it down to spend the winter with her instead. I feel she is doing the opposite by aspiring to move.

So to move or not to move?

I already know the answer to this question. I think I should tell her I am willing to move with her to California, but not this year. We haven’t been dating long enough and I have dreams and aspirations to accomplish in Idaho before I could be remotely okay with leaving. Sadly, I think she’ll break up with me and/or move anyway. Her reasons: she’s lived in Idaho her whole life, her family is bonkers and she wants nothing to do with them, and California offers amenities that Idaho doesn’t, specifically the ocean and a more environmentally-conscious culture."
1tk8rh,1,2013-12-23,cows are yummy,buffalosoldier2014,funny,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1tk8rh/cows_are_yummy/,"The cow is the only animal that looks delicious while it’s still alive. Sometimes when I drive down the road and I see a cow grazing in the field, I stop and lick my lips. Oddly enough, he’s usually licking his too. Cows have massive tongues, just like Miley Cyrus. Believe it or not, they have quite a few things in common with her. Like Miley, they’re not very smart, and they spend most of the day grazing in the pasture, and eating grass. Humans should figure out how to eat grass too, not to solve the hunger epidemic, or as a substitute for mowing the lawn, but just because it would be neat if we could eat grass.

Cows are good for a lot of other reasons, and we would do well to learn from them. For instance, most cows are black and white, which means there is no issue when it comes to racial inequality. Maybe to alleviate racial tensions among humans, white people could paint black spots on themselves and vice-versa. There are also brown cows, though. As for them, it would be a lot of work to paint them so maybe we could build a huge fence in order to keep them from digging under, climbing over, or sneaking across in vans to be with the other cows.

Sometimes cows get a bad rap, and it must be insulting to them. One time, someone called this guy’s mom a “fat cow” and he got really upset. I was confused because I figured it would be a compliment, because cows are great. He was mad, so I was like “no dude, your mom’s a fat cow. Don’t you get it That mean she’s awesome”… no shame in that! He just didn’t get it though, I think he was retarded or something.

Another reason cows are so awesome is because they produce milk, one of the greatest beverages on the planet. In this regard, I feel like we got screwed over by mother nature when it comes to “teets.” What I mean by that is I only have two “teets,” and to the best of my knowledge, they are useless. Maybe if I was a female, this wouldn’t be the case. On the other hand, cows have four big teets that produce all sorts of milk, including but not limited to 1%, 2%, Whole Milk, Vitamin D, non-fat, and most importantly, chocolate. For some reason, the government is so scared of milk, that it limits how much it can be sold for. I bet this makes the cows feel dirty and used. Probably not as dirty and used as they must feel just before that bullet goes through their head when they’re big enough and worth it to be eaten, but used nonetheless. If I were cows, I would consider banning together and doing something about this injustice. But, given that they are capable of practically nothing, I understand how unrealistic this might be.

I bet one of the worst parts about being a cow is they never get to taste the fruits of their labor, so to speak. No cow has ever drank its own milk. It’s a tragic sort of irony in a way, I think. It’s like those little kids in China who work barefoot all day as interns in a shoe factory.

We all know that cows are an excellent source of Calcium, but did you know that they are also an excellent source of entertainment? For instance, before TV, there was cow-tipping. This is when cows just stand there at night, meditating or something, and while they’re doing it you walk up and push them over, ideally breaking their ribs so they can’t get up. It’s supposed to be pretty funny, but I don’t actually know because I’ve never done it, I just saw it on TV one time; it might be a myth.

The only downside to cows is the fact that they’re so slow. They barely move. This makes it incredibly difficult to taunt them, or get them to do anything. You can say “come here” or “go over there” and they just stand there and stare at you. Occasionally, if you irritate them enough when you’re standing behind them, they will try and kick you. But that’s about all the action you’re going to get from a cow, so don’t expect much when it comes to movement.

1tk77i,0,2013-12-23,A shower thought about American public education from a foreigner who went through 11 years of it,tintininaustria,Showerthoughts,https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/1tk77i/a_shower_thought_about_american_public_education/,"National Public Education Reorganization

Organization

-National governance of education by a new Department of Education under a superintendent-in-chief (Level I executive schedule)

-State education departments --&gt; Scholastic Provinces
 
-School districts --&gt; Scholastic Wards (county boundaries)

-Schools are set-up on a POPULATION basis and will not be shut down for any other REASON than too much 
reduction in local population (unless the federal government goes down)

Funding

-Funded by federal government through income tax

-Federal funding will not be allocated to school athletics programs.

-Concentration on needy schools that file “aid proposals” that will be scrutinized and investigated; schools must prove their needs (infrastructural etc…) with thorough evidence

-Random audits and prosecution of mishandled or misguided funding

-Scholastic provincial authorities are responsible for salary and benefits regulating accounting for disparate cost-of-living across states

Curriculum

- Expected education standards will be universally raised to AP certificate/IB diploma levels for students entering kindergarten after the implementation of the new national curriculum.

-The new curriculum will take from advantages of the AP and IB programs and will be created and adjusted by an appointed convention that includes eminent psychologists, educators, scholars on education and childhood development, as well as researchers in the forefront of their subjects.

-The new curriculum will introduce rhetoric and philosophy to promote a liberal-arts education that focuses on independent critical thinking and clearly articulating one’s thoughts as well as arts and sciences.

- Core Subjects: English (rhetoric &amp; philosophy included), Math, Natural Sciences (all Chemistry, Biology, Physics), Foreign Language I, Social Sciences (two of History/Anthropology/Psychology/Economics)

Major Subjects: Creative art (Music/Visual art/Drama), Literature, Foreign language II, Extended math studies, 
Extended natural sciences (astrophysics, further organic chemistry, etc… , teacher departments of the school will decide on which courses will be offered)

Minor Studies: Conflict studies, Computer science, digital art, cinema, specific ethnographical studies (AA studies etc…) – offerings may depend on school

Standardized testing

- Every year, the DoE will form a board of university professors transported to a confidential, insular setting where they will write the new high school graduation/ college entrance exams based on the national curriculum. The difficulty of the test will be so that 0.01 % of test-takers, followed by 0.1%, 1%, and so forth can be clearly distinguished. 

-Students will be examined on all core subjects and two major subjects of their choice. Creative art will not be tested but a confidential board of faculty from eminent art schools will examine anonymous standardized submissions.

-Taking primarily on the form of short answers and essays, the difficult questions will test the student’s ability to creatively adapt what they learned in school to unfamiliar and challenging problems and situations (e.g. gnarly matrix and vector problems applied to engineering, obscure pieces of literature). The federal government will provide generous (often full-ride) grant gifts for higher education to low-income students who perform highly in the test, unless the institution already provides full-ride scholarships to the said student through its own grants.

Mandates

- Government will strictly police students to attend schooling unless parents can provide evidence of similar-level home-schooling

-Select school wards especially low in performance, especially urban ones, will be under direct DoE jurisdiction and provided with targeted concentrated funding and resources until their college entrance examination scores improve to the national average. 

-Teachers and staff will be given broader powers to enforce discipline and rectitude among the students. They will also be able to report and sue parents whom they can prove be disruptive to their children’s education. If the suit is successful, the educational authorities will be allowed to dictate the child’s activity (time spent in special 1:1 instructions after school etc…)

-Government will provide more generous cost-of-living welfare to households of exceptionally high-performing students to incentivize parents not to interfere with their children’s education. This will hopefully make impoverished parents more serious about their children’s education.

Outreach
-The DoE will subsidize PhD education for educators on a competitive basis

-In schools in impoverished areas, dinner services will be catered in schools so that students and teachers can stay late in school and concentrate on their studying

-Government will provide strong support for schools to form partnerships with local universities and businesses for college-level classes, internships, and apprenticeships.


Future

-Understanding that not all students plan to pursue higher education, the DoE will launch studies into the vocational training/apprenticeship track education in Germany and strive for a general framework applicable to U.S.’s demographic and economic situation.

1tk6wa,3,2013-12-23,I wish I could quit.,iamPause,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1tk6wa/i_wish_i_could_quit/,"I've a good job.  It pays the bills and then some.  I've great benefits and I'm able to save for retirement, but I hate it.  I hate everything about the job, where it's located, who I work with.

I make decent money, but it's not enough.  I make ~$55k a year.  You'd think I'd  be happy with that.  But I'm not.  I'm the only person in my department who can do what I do.  If I got hit by a bus tomorrow, operations would grind to a halt.  It'd takes months to bring someone on and have them be caught up enough to identify where a problem lies let alone fix it.

All that, and I make ~5$ an hour than a college intern.  We can't even find someone to hire as a helper to me because nobody is willing to do what I do for as little as I make.  In other departments people who do much, much less make $15,000-$20,000 more than me.  And I wish I was exaggerating.  What I do isn't even in my job description.  He'll, it's not even in my job grade.

I'm an analyst.  My degree is in mathematics.  But have I done even a single bit of analysis in the past 3 years?  No.  I develop.  I code, I create, I document, I troubleshoot.  They won't even give me a test environment to work in or a real SQL server.  I'm stuck using a network drive and Microsoft Access to perform operations that are mandated by the federal government. Worse off, a large percentage of what I do is customer facing.

So here I am, doing mission critical work for a fraction of what I could be doing.

""If you are unhappy, just quit!""  I don't have the balls to.  I've a great resume from folks over in /r/resumes but I'm scared to apply elsewhere.  It's not even because of my benefits.  I don't care about 401k matching, I don't care about my pension.  I'm scared to leave and be on my own.

I'm bipolar; diagnosed and on medication for the past 2 years.  I've had what I call ""episodes"" and I lost a lot of friends.  But the ones who stuck by me, we're closer than ever.  They are my support group, they are my structure.  They are who I go to when I need a hug.  Yes.  I'm a 28 year old grown ass man and I need hugs sometime.  Fuck off.  They are what keep me going when I feel like this.  How would I survive if I moved across the country?  What if my new job is even worse?  Then what? I barely kept myself alive *with* them by my side, how do I expect to manage without them near, when I won't be able to call them and say ""I need someone with me, now"" and have them be at my house in 10 minutes?

I hate the person I used to be, I can barely tolerate the person I am, and every morning I wake up and I count the hours until I can get home and drink or game or just do something so I can pretend that my the life I'm living isn't actually mine."

I was going to be the perfect teacher. My kindergarten classroom was going to be covered in inspirational posters that the kids would actually believe in and the walls were going to be filled with my students’ best work, which in turn would of course show what a great teacher I was. I was going to follow my district’s curriculum to a T while still managing to add my own creative spins to make the learning fun. My parent-teacher conferences were going to run flawlessly, and I would meet any concerns with a brave smile and reassuring pat on the shoulder.

Then I entered a classroom.

The University of Delaware prides itself in getting its elementary education majors into classrooms early. This plan backfired with me; I did get in a classroom early on in my college career, but that experience made me start to doubt everything about the major I had chosen. For a few semesters, I tried to stick it out. I figured everyone struggled at first, and once I got used it, I would be the shining teacher I had always planned to be. My epiphany came when my supervisor was criticizing one of my lessons; the students had made quite a mess creating models of ladybug using art supplies. To me, it had looked like they were having a fun time and getting creative with some glue and pipe cleaners. To my supervisor it had looked “chaotic.” I will never forget the words that came out of her mouth when I told her I had enjoyed the lesson: “You can never be out of control in the classroom. Kids can smell fear.”

That day, I decided to change my major. Before I submitted the final form to do so, I met with a professor turned friend for some final guidance. She heard my concerns about the rigid culture boundaries in traditional schools, the condescending curriculums, and the puzzling endorsement of all of it from the University. She suggested that I do a web search for “Sudbury Schools.”

I don’t think I slept for a few nights after that. I skipped my Friday classes and stayed in all weekend, spending my time reading articles from sudval.org. The more I read, the more enthralled I became. I remember thinking, “this is what school is supposed to be.” It was an emotional few days. I felt a great sense of relief, but that was quickly followed by a creeping feeling of dread. Now that I knew this other option existed, I knew it was all I wanted to pursue, but at the same time, I knew I was going to be facing a huge uphill battle with the University.

The story of my struggle to gain the University’s support for my endeavor into the Sudbury schooling world is long and complicated, but the “too long, didn’t read” version goes like this: I was never able to gain their support. Their concerns were valid: it would be difficult to evaluate not only my lesson plans when I wouldn’t be teaching any, but any part of my experience “teaching” at a Sudbury school using any of the University’s standards. I came close to giving up many times, but with enough persuasive conversations and a few professors on my side, I was finally able to convince the University to begrudgingly allow me to complete half of my student teaching placement at The Philadelphia Free School (PFS), a new Sudbury school in South Philadelphia.

Before I got to PFS, I had to complete eight weeks of student teaching in a 4th grade classroom in an area of Delaware that is, to avoid euphemisms, very affluent and very white. The school was beautiful; every classroom had the latest technology, the Parent Teacher Association was both wealthy and involved, and the school boasted about their extensive after school programs and activities. It was a dream school for any parent, but somehow, all the teachers were miserable. In my eight weeks there, I saw every one of the five other fourth grade teachers break down into tears. Their biggest complaint was about having to follow the Common Core standards, and the worry of being punished for not meeting testing standards. I saw students who wanted to explore and ask questions and play reprimanded for their curiosity. I would tell you what their biggest complaint was, but I don’t really know because they never had a chance to speak their mind. I have lots of horror stories about my time at that school and could probably write a novel about it, but for the sake of brevity I’ll just share one here: there was a school wide policy of “no touching.” This not only meant that students were not allowed to lay hands on each other in a violent way, but also that students were not allowed to high five, hold hands, or hug. No touching was permitted between students, ever. I remember having to scold, after being explicitly told to do so by my cooperating teacher who I worked under, two girls at lunch who were playing a clapping game. That was one of the many days I drove away from the school in tears. The real kicker is, though, that there was also a school-wide policy that before entering their respective classrooms, every student in the school was required to give their teacher a “hug, handshake, or high five.” There were no exceptions. So, every student was absolutely forced to touch their teacher – who in many cases (even if under the cloak of smiles and praise) was a complete stranger to them – but could not give their best friend a hug.

*On an interesting related note, Sudbury Valley School recently posted a video about a Canadian school who enacted a similar “no touching” rule. See the link here.

Leaving that 4th grade classroom was harder than I imagined it would be. I felt like I was abandoning these students; I was escaping while they would be stuck in this coercive system for another eight years. I also felt guilty about the negative feelings I was harboring (and still do) about the school itself. My cooperating teacher was one of the kindest women I have ever met and I truly believe that she did genuinely care about her students. Whenever I speak about my experiences or traditional public schools in general, I always say: “it’s not the teachers who are killing the students, it’s the system.”

That being said, my first day at PFS felt like the freshest breath of air I had ever taken. The school was only barely in its second year when I was there, but the vibrant energy that seemed to flow effortlessly throughout the school was so genuine – it felt like home. I’ll admit, parts of the school were still (and probably still are) a little “rough around the edges.” The law book wasn’t numbered yet and JC didn’t always start on time, but seeing those beginning steps of a democracy and all the growing pains that go with it was not only valuable but so rewarding. I remember on my first day there, I introduced myself to a young student as the “new student teacher” (which, to be fair, was my official title!). Their response was: “The first thing you have to understand about our school is that there are no teachers.” That’s when I knew I was in the kind of school I was supposed to be in.

PFS will always hold a special place in my heart and I continue to maintain a strong relationship with all my many close friends there. My experience there was the perfect first step into my lifelong career in Sudbury schools and I use things I learned there here at Arts and Ideas every day. I definitely wouldn’t be able to be where I’m at as an intern at AI without the time I spent at PFS as a foundation. Even though I had to fight tooth and nail to get there, I know I did the right thing and I hope I’ve paved a way for future education majors to explore other education options. I can’t find a way to say this without sounding painfully cliché, but the truth is: it’s only uphill (from some pretty low valleys) from here."
1tjeoy,9,2013-12-23,Stacy's Bet - Part 1 - Stacy wins a bet and I end up with my face down and ass up in the air - F/m - anal play on a male - bondage,readeranon,BDSMerotica,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMerotica/comments/1tjeoy/stacys_bet_part_1_stacy_wins_a_bet_and_i_end_up/,"This is a story about Stacy, who is difficult to explain.

At this point in our relationship, Stacy identified as a submissive . . . but made you fight her or beat her in some way before she would submit. I don't mean, mock rape, because it was never that. No, Stacy wanted to be beaten in a game or physically overpowered and then give in to the winner. She viewed her body, her sexual skills as a prize that she wanted you to win. But she MADE you fight for it, she never just gave in.

She explained this to me once using the classic “caveman” story.

“I'm like a cave woman,” she said, “You have to hit me over the head with your club and then drag me to your cave by my hair, but once I am there, I recognize you as my mate and  will spread my legs for you happily.”

Another time, she used the example of the princess whose hand is the award of a contest that all the princes of the land come to compete for, but that she secretly enters herself. In the fairy tales, the princess bests the men. Stacy, wanted to best all the men but one and then give herself to that one for proving himself better.

On top of this, Stacy didn't like to admit or ask me to do certain perversely sexual things that she was interested in. Some things, like anal, she loved and was verbal about, but things she saw as incredibly submissive, she didn't like to admit to wanting. So, she would often, when she wanted to try something new or wanted me to do something incredibly perverse to her, would maneuver me into it or piss me off to get me to go overboard.

As an example, she wanted to try being forced to be my sexy maid one time. Kept nude, forced to do housework, fucked on a whim. Instead of asking, she used it as a bet in a game we were playing. If I won, I got her as my maid slave for the weekend. If she won, I had to take her to see a musical in the city that she wanted to go to and that would be very expensive. I won and she was happy to full fill her end of the bargain.

This is one of those stories. Beware reader, this story contains some violence, some anal play on a guy and some water sports. It contains a lot of sex as well.

Part 1 – Stacy and I make a bet

I was spending the summer with Stacy. She was living in a small city about 40 minutes away from an internship I had won and as we were off again on again FWB we decided to spend the summer living together. We had explored a number of kinks including progressively more BDSM related items when Stacy asked me about why I was never submissive.

The answer is that I had a horrible experience my first time being tied up that involved almost dieing. I was already VERY dom and hadn't really been into trying submission in the first place. It was years before this happened and Stacy asked if I would be up for trying with her.

I considered it and she made me an offer. IF she dommed me. She would make the session all about me and that it wouldn't include any pain. That she would basically tie me down, tease me for a bit, sexually pleasure me for a bit, perhaps verbally dominate me and sit on my face. But that there would be no pain involved.

Now here is the thing. I knew Stacy at this point. I knew that I could trust her with my safety. I knew that she was being serious about what she was offering. BUT I also knew that she was most likely hiding something and that this was going to be a set up for something. The idea actually intrigued me and made me nervous. What was she planning? What was she considering?

I decided to go for it, but to play her game.

“Ok,” I said to her, “It will be out next wager. If you win, you can tie me down and play your little game.”

“Ohhhh,” she said “And if you win?”

“If I win,” I said, “You have to tell me the truth, of what you were planning and what secret thing you want to try but didn't want to admit too.”

She gave me a look that said, “that would ruin the fun,” but she agreed.

I don't really remember what the wager was over. Something later that day, an argument over an actor in a tv show or something. The end result was that I lost though. And it would be that night that I was tied down for the second time in my life.

*

Stacy and I took a shower together and while this often ended in sex, she would only let us rub each other a bit, she wanted to save it for later. She did pay special attention to cleaning my butt and I did the same to her as anal sex was common for us.

She was a lovely curvy woman and as we got out of the shower I gave her butt a playful smack and she hit my hand away.

“Nuh uh,” she said, “I'm in charge for the night, you go watch tv for a bit while I get ready.”

About 20 minutes later she called me into the bedroom. She had set candles all around, there were fresh sheets on the bed and she had a few of her sex toys out including the lube. I nervously looked at the candles and said, “we agreed no pain, you aren't planning to get coy with those candles.”

“RD,” she said in a soft voice, “I wouldn't hurt you, I know how you feel about pain. I promise that I will focus on nothing but your pleasure and mine. OH and call me Mistress.” She ended with a big grin.

I laughed, “Ok Mistress.” It was hard to say it without sounding sarcastic.

She was wearing a sexy sheer black nightie with black panties, I was only in my boxers.

I shrugged. “Ok Mistress, you are in charge.”

She nodded and said, “strip.”

I pulled my boxers off, I wasn't hard yet, still nervous about those candles.

“On the bed, on your stomach,” she said. I complied and laid down on the bed. She walked around and with the rope I had bought to tie her down, secured my my wrists to either side of the headboard and then my legs, pulled apart and tied to the foot board.

She started to walk around the bed, letting her fingernails scrape lightly on my bare skin, it felt nice, and then she climbed up onto the bed, straddled my butt and I felt something warm drip onto my back. I tensed, thinking it was wax, but it didn't hurt.

I realized it was some sort of lube that she had warmed and then, as I felt her panties on my ass, she began to massage my back and shoulders. She rubbed a warm oil into my shoulders, and my back, the whole time grinding her pussy against my ass, my legs, my arms. She would straddle my arm and rub her panties up and down its length while she kneaded a shoulder. She pushed her clit into my thigh as she did my back.

Then she did my legs, reaching between and up a few times to rub my cock. It didn't work well. I know there are videos of guys whose cocks seem to bed behind them, mine doesn't. When my cock is hard it sticks straight out and up.

She was able to reach my balls and ass though. She knew how to handle my balls (carefully!) and we had months before began to experiment with rim jobs. She teased my butt a bit, letting her finger slide across it in a way that felt like a tongue. I was incredibly relaxed, almost falling asleep actually, when she decided to take things up a notch.

She untied my ankles and wrists and had me get into a  position on my elbows and knees. She tied me back like that to the bed and then put a towel under my midsection. I guessed that she was going to rim me. We had done that a few times. What I wasn't counting on was that she had been reading up on prostate play.

I want to be clear. Up to this point in my life I had NEVER had anything pushed into my ass. I had NO interest in it at all. I had told her so a number of times and the closest I came to it was a few times that she or another woman had pushed their tongue in a bit. 

I started to feel a bit exposed, but as she had promised nothing but my pleasure and no pain, it didn't occur to me that she might assault my ass. I actually made a joke about it.

“I hope you don't have a strap on Mistress,” I said.

She laughed. “No,” she said, “just my body.”

Then she moved in behind me and started to lick my asshole. As she did, she reached in and under me, her hands still covered in the oils from the massage, and began to stroke my cock.

She had great stamina and I just relished the sensation and felt her hand stroking my cock to an orgasm when her mouth pulled away from my ass. “Remember,” she said, “you can't cum without permission.”

I laughed at that but said, “sure mistress.” and felt her lean back in to slide her tongue across and around my asshole.

I find rimming to be a pleasant sensation. In no way to I find it to be more pleasant though than a deep kiss. It's pleasant, but alone the pleasure would barely even be enough to get me hard. I do however, find rimming to be very hot mentally. I love humiliation and it's hard to not view someone licking your asshole, even if you are tied down, as being humiliating for them.

So the feeling of her tongue on me, of it sliding a bit deeper into my ass and her hand stroking and stroking my cock, lubed up and warm, sent me close to the edge of orgasm very quickly.

“Mistress,” I said, trying to sound humble and subservient. “May I please have an orgasm.”

She stopped rubbing my cock immediately and her tongue left my ass. “No,” she said and I admit that I groaned in frustration. I felt her tongue go back to my asshole and her fingers began to lightly caress my balls. After what felt like hours, her hand went back to my cock and started to stroke again.

Again I grew close to orgasm and she stopped as soon as I asked to cum. We waited and she started a third time.

This time though, she taunted me. “How badly do you want to cum?” 

“Very badly . . . mistress,” I replied. She giggled and started to lick my asshole again.

Her hand quickly whipped me into a frenzy and I asked to cum, expecting her to deny me. She did . . . but she didn't stop stroking me. Instead, her mouth left my asshole and I suddenly felt her finger, heavily lubed, pushing its way into my backdoor.

The shock was enough to keep me from orgasm.

“WHAT THE FUCK,” I roared.

“Does it hurt,” she asked, pulling the finger out.

It didn't. It felt strange, but didn't hurt at all.

“No,” I admitted and felt the finger push its way back in.

“Well too bad, then,” she said, “I promised no pain.”

“You know I am going to make you pay for this,” I said to her and felt her start to fuck the finger in and out of my ass as her hand kept stroking my cock.

“I'm counting on it,” she said, “you may cum as soon as you are ready.”

The finger in my ass was strange. She was fucking me with it and I felt no pleasure from it, but still, the hand on my cock was coaxing me closer and closer to orgasm and finally I came pretty hard.

I don't know if I'm just not a prostate guy, but I've never found anal penetration to add anything to my orgasms. When I was done Stacy pulled her finger out of me and said, “Holy shit, I see why you love anal so much, that was fun and your asshole like spasmed when you came.”

I grunted, still recovering and manged a vague threat about what was going to happen to her when she untied me.

She laughed and said, “Sorry bucko, you are going to have to wait, I'm not done with you yet.”

She left me tied and went to the bathroom to clean up. I did this to her all the time, so it was fair. When she came back, she pulled the towel away and tossed it and then untied me and had be get onto my back, tieing me spread eagle again.

Bless you if you read the whole thing, otherwise just check out the TLDR.**

I had a shitty provincial childhood, was fat and had braces in college (and also dropped out for awhile), and had surgery on my face summer '12. This led to me being incompetent with women and generally fucking up any date I ever got. So here I am, 22 years old and only gotten to third base with one girl, Beth (whom I was hooking up with, but not having sex with, for about a month.)

Fast forward to the week after I get my braces off (fall '12). My life was finally turning around. I was taking classes, the business I started was taking off, and I met an awesome girl, Jamie. We went on some dates and got back to my place. When she asked me what my ""number"" was, I made up some dumb story about sleeping with 10 girls, out of embarrassment. I'd been in that exact position at least half a dozen times before, said that I was a virgin, and gotten nowhere except soul-crushed. So I made up some dumb story, slept with her, and kept it up for the next 7 months. It didn't come up much and I generally didn't think about it. I wasn't trying to manipulate her, but rather I was embarrassed and just internally believed my bullshit story because I was so busy with school and life that I didn't sit down to stop and think that I should confess. I was a new person and didn't want to think about my pathetic past.

We kept seeing each other, and I kept hooking up with the other girl Beth, until around February when Jamie said she couldn't handle me with other people anymore. I cared about Jamie much more than Beth and so I broke it off and became exclusive with Jamie. It was fantastic for 3 months and then she went back home for the summer. 

We decided that being exclusive was unrealistic, but once she left we started talking every day because we missed each other too much. About 2 weeks in, my plans to visit fell through, and she let slip that some friend kissed her the night before. I got upset about it and told her so. I spent that week ruminating over it and decided that I couldn't care about her and be ok with her sleeping with other people. I told her so. She agreed, but then I pried out of her that she slept with one of her good friends the night before, the same guy who kissed her the previous week. That really upset me and I almost ended it there. I just couldn't believe she could see me so upset about it one week and then 5 days later go out and sleep with the guy. To me, if you care about someone, you don't go out and screw your friend a week after my plans to visit fell through. (This dude was obsessed with her and even made plans to fly out and visit her here this fall, while she was with me, so he was obviously not some random guy.)

But I decided she was worth it, so we officially started ""dating"". (Note: I hadn't even been on a date with anyone during this time, so I didn't sleep with anyone else. )

We did the whole Skype song and dance and tried to make the distance work. Maybe a month later, it finally occurred to me that I should fess up and tell her about my number and the bullshit story. It was eating me out from the inside. So I told her, and she was extremely pissed. It was rough and I expected her to break up with me, but we got through it. She came back in August, we spent a lot of time mending, but we seemed okay and seemed to get closer. We did the whole ""I love you"" which was the first for both of us. Everything seemed great for the next 3 months, minus the occasional arguments and such.

About a month ago, she came over, started picking some dumb fight, and broke up with me, saying ""we're not good together anymore."" I did not take it well and acted very childishly. I kept begging her to at least try and fix things, which she had no interest in. The next day we started arguing over text again. I gave her back all of her stuff, including gifts she gave me, which was a bit petty I suppose. The last thing I told her was basically that I'm glad she handled this so coldly, because it was a nice reminder that I should surround myself with people who care about me, and not those who just pretend to. Harsh and immature, no doubt. We haven't spoken in 3 weeks.

She acted so, so cold and robotic about the whole thing that it honestly scared me. We had a lot of special moments over the past year and she threw me away like it was absolutely nothing to her. She started giving me generic breakup advice as if I were some stranger off the street. All in the coldest, matter of fact tone possible. Just the week before we were extremely warm towards each other.

Now, in retrospect, I am realizing two things:
One, this was a long time coming and she's been cold to me for some time. It's obvious looking back that she was deliberately trying to pick fights with me over minor things, I guess so that she could feel better about it. She told me about a month beforehand that she still didn't forgive me for lying to her for 7 months and that she wanted to break up over the summer. I tried my best to make up for it, but I guess it wasn't enough. We seemed to recover after that, but I guess she didn't.

Two, that she didn't treat me very well. I genuinely cared about her and her future and did everything I could to help her with homework, internship applications, etc. and was as loving as possible. I got zero appreciation, and she never once really made any thought towards my future or what makes me happy. I was just blinded by first love, I suppose. Looking back it's obvious to me now that our relationship was very one-sided. Yes, I fucked up big time lying to her for 7 months, and I regret it more than anything.  I guess we were equally hurt about the summer, but I did eventually forgive her. I realized that we hadn't communicated clearly to be exclusive so I can't fault her for a drunken mistake. 

Where I am now:
I'm doing pretty well and am glad I've got the time to focus on myself again. I'm not upset with her for breaking up with me, as it seems like that was inevitable. But I still can't fathom how cold she was about the aftermath. We used to be that disgustingly cute couple that random strangers commented on. She used to show me so much love, and I to her. But she ended it like I was a business deal gone wrong. 

So any advice or thoughts on my situation? It was my first ""real"" relationship and so it's hard for me to compare this to anything. I probably overreacted to her sleeping with some other guy over the summer, but I think it was more that it was her long time friend who has a huge crush on her, and not some random dude. The fact that she was my first probably makes me more overreactive about the whole situation too.

She keeps in touch with her exes for whatever reason, so I think that cutting her out of my life is going to be a shock to her. Originally I was thinking we'd just go no contact for a few months and then try to mend a friendship, but the way she handled it was so icy that I'm not even sure she's worth keeping as a friend. Obviously I'm not innocent in this either, but I sincerely gave my best effort to try and make things good again, and I did genuinely care about it.
---

**tl;dr**: tons of baggage accumulates over 7 months, but we seem to get past it and love each other more. Then she randomly breaks up with me in the coldest robotic way possible. I care about her and would like her as a friend in the future, but I'm not sure if her acting so heartless at the end is something a friend would do, much less a lover"

She would straddle my arm and rub her panties up and down its length while she kneaded a shoulder. She pushed her clit into my thigh as she did my back.

Then she did my legs, reaching between and up a few times to rub my cock. It didn't work well. I know there are videos of guys whose cocks seem to bed behind them, mine doesn't. When my cock is hard it sticks straight out and up.

She was able to reach my balls and ass though. She knew how to handle my balls (carefully!) and we had months before began to experiment with rim jobs. She teased my butt a bit, letting her finger slide across it in a way that felt like a tongue. I was incredibly relaxed, almost falling asleep actually, when she decided to take things up a notch.

She untied my ankles and wrists and had me get into a  position on my elbows and knees. She tied me back like that to the bed and then put a towel under my midsection. I guessed that she was going to rim me. We had done that a few times. What I wasn't counting on was that she had been reading up on prostate play.

I want to be clear. Up to this point in my life I had NEVER had anything pushed into my ass. I had NO interest in it at all. I had told her so a number of times and the closest I came to it was a few times that she or another woman had pushed their tongue in a bit. 

I started to feel a bit exposed, but as she had promised nothing but my pleasure and no pain, it didn't occur to me that she might assault my ass. I actually made a joke about it.

“I hope you don't have a strap on Mistress,” I said.

She laughed. “No,” she said, “just my body.”

Then she moved in behind me and started to lick my asshole. As she did, she reached in and under me, her hands still covered in the oils from the massage, and began to stroke my cock.

She had great stamina and I just relished the sensation and felt her hand stroking my cock to an orgasm when her mouth pulled away from my ass. “Remember,” she said, “you can't cum without permission.”

I laughed at that but said, “sure mistress.” and felt her lean back in to slide her tongue across and around my asshole.

I find rimming to be a pleasant sensation. In no way to I find it to be more pleasant though than a deep kiss. It's pleasant, but alone the pleasure would barely even be enough to get me hard. I do however, find rimming to be very hot mentally. I love humiliation and it's hard to not view someone licking your asshole, even if you are tied down, as being humiliating for them.

So the feeling of her tongue on me, of it sliding a bit deeper into my ass and her hand stroking and stroking my cock, lubed up and warm, sent me close to the edge of orgasm very quickly.

“Mistress,” I said, trying to sound humble and subservient. “May I please have an orgasm.”

She stopped rubbing my cock immediately and her tongue left my ass. “No,” she said and I admit that I groaned in frustration. I felt her tongue go back to my asshole and her fingers began to lightly caress my balls. After what felt like hours, her hand went back to my cock and started to stroke again.

Again I grew close to orgasm and she stopped as soon as I asked to cum. We waited and she started a third time.

This time though, she taunted me. “How badly do you want to cum?” 

“Very badly . . . mistress,” I replied. She giggled and started to lick my asshole again.

Her hand quickly whipped me into a frenzy and I asked to cum, expecting her to deny me. She did . . . but she didn't stop stroking me. Instead, her mouth left my asshole and I suddenly felt her finger, heavily lubed, pushing its way into my backdoor.

The shock was enough to keep me from orgasm.

“WHAT THE FUCK,” I roared.

“Does it hurt,” she asked, pulling the finger out.

It didn't. It felt strange, but didn't hurt at all.

“No,” I admitted and felt the finger push its way back in.

“Well too bad, then,” she said, “I promised no pain.”

“You know I am going to make you pay for this,” I said to her and felt her start to fuck the finger in and out of my ass as her hand kept stroking my cock.

“I'm counting on it,” she said, “you may cum as soon as you are ready.”

The finger in my ass was strange. She was fucking me with it and I felt no pleasure from it, but still, the hand on my cock was coaxing me closer and closer to orgasm and finally I came pretty hard.

I don't know if I'm just not a prostate guy, but I've never found anal penetration to add anything to my orgasms. When I was done Stacy pulled her finger out of me and said, “Holy shit, I see why you love anal so much, that was fun and your asshole like spasmed when you came.”

I grunted, still recovering and manged a vague threat about what was going to happen to her when she untied me.

She laughed and said, “Sorry bucko, you are going to have to wait, I'm not done with you yet.”

She left me tied and went to the bathroom to clean up. I did this to her all the time, so it was fair. When she came back, she pulled the towel away and tossed it and then untied me and had be get onto my back, tieing me spread eagle again.

1tj9zk,13,2013-12-23,Stacy's bet - Part 1 - Stacy wins a bet and I end up face down with my ass in the air,readeranon,ReaderAnonErotica,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReaderAnonErotica/comments/1tj9zk/stacys_bet_part_1_stacy_wins_a_bet_and_i_end_up/,"This is a story about Stacy, who is difficult to explain.

At this point in our relationship, Stacy identified as a submissive . . . but made you fight her or beat her in some way before she would submit. I don't mean, mock rape, because it was never that. No, Stacy wanted to be beaten in a game or physically overpowered and then give in to the winner. She viewed her body, her sexual skills as a prize that she wanted you to win. But she MADE you fight for it, she never just gave in.

She explained this to me once using the classic “caveman” story.

“I'm like a cave woman,” she said, “You have to hit me over the head with your club and then drag me to your cave by my hair, but once I am there, I recognize you as my mate and  will spread my legs for you happily.”

Another time, she used the example of the princess whose hand is the award of a contest that all the princes of the land come to compete for, but that she secretly enters herself. In the fairy tales, the princess bests the men. Stacy, wanted to best all the men but one and then give herself to that one for proving himself better.

On top of this, Stacy didn't like to admit or ask me to do certain perversely sexual things that she was interested in. Some things, like anal, she loved and was verbal about, but things she saw as incredibly submissive, she didn't like to admit to wanting. So, she would often, when she wanted to try something new or wanted me to do something incredibly perverse to her, would maneuver me into it or piss me off to get me to go overboard.

As an example, she wanted to try being forced to be my sexy maid one time. Kept nude, forced to do housework, fucked on a whim. Instead of asking, she used it as a bet in a game we were playing. If I won, I got her as my maid slave for the weekend. If she won, I had to take her to see a musical in the city that she wanted to go to and that would be very expensive. I won and she was happy to full fill her end of the bargain.

This is one of those stories. Beware reader, this story contains some violence, some anal play on a guy and some water sports. It contains a lot of sex as well.

*

Part 1 – Stacy and I make a bet

I was spending the summer with Stacy. She was living in a small city about 40 minutes away from an internship I had won and as we were off again on again FWB we decided to spend the summer living together. We had explored a number of kinks including progressively more BDSM related items when Stacy asked me about why I was never submissive.

The answer is that I had a horrible experience my first time being tied up that involved almost dieing. I was already VERY dom and hadn't really been into trying submission in the first place. It was years before this happened and Stacy asked if I would be up for trying with her.

I considered it and she made me an offer. IF she dommed me. She would make the session all about me and that it wouldn't include any pain. That she would basically tie me down, tease me for a bit, sexually pleasure me for a bit, perhaps verbally dominate me and sit on my face. But that there would be no pain involved.

Now here is the thing. I knew Stacy at this point. I knew that I could trust her with my safety. I knew that she was being serious about what she was offering. BUT I also knew that she was most likely hiding something and that this was going to be a set up for something. The idea actually intrigued me and made me nervous. What was she planning? What was she considering?

I decided to go for it, but to play her game.

“Ok,” I said to her, “It will be out next wager. If you win, you can tie me down and play your little game.”

“Ohhhh,” she said “And if you win?”

“If I win,” I said, “You have to tell me the truth, of what you were planning and what secret thing you want to try but didn't want to admit too.”

She gave me a look that said, “that would ruin the fun,” but she agreed.

I don't really remember what the wager was over. Something later that day, an argument over an actor in a tv show or something. The end result was that I lost though. And it would be that night that I was tied down for the second time in my life.

*

Stacy and I took a shower together and while this often ended in sex, she would only let us rub each other a bit, she wanted to save it for later. She did pay special attention to cleaning my butt and I did the same to her as anal sex was common for us.

She was a lovely curvy woman and as we got out of the shower I gave her butt a playful smack and she hit my hand away.

“Nuh uh,” she said, “I'm in charge for the night, you go watch tv for a bit while I get ready.”

About 20 minutes later she called me into the bedroom. She had set candles all around, there were fresh sheets on the bed and she had a few of her sex toys out including the lube. I nervously looked at the candles and said, “we agreed no pain, you aren't planning to get coy with those candles.”

“RD,” she said in a soft voice, “I wouldn't hurt you, I know how you feel about pain. I promise that I will focus on nothing but your pleasure and mine. OH and call me Mistress.” She ended with a big grin.

I laughed, “Ok Mistress.” It was hard to say it without sounding sarcastic.

She was wearing a sexy sheer black nightie with black panties, I was only in my boxers.

I shrugged. “Ok Mistress, you are in charge.”

She nodded and said, “strip.”

I pulled my boxers off, I wasn't hard yet, still nervous about those candles.

“On the bed, on your stomach,” she said. I complied and laid down on the bed. She walked around and with the rope I had bought to tie her down, secured my my wrists to either side of the headboard and then my legs, pulled apart and tied to the foot board.

She started to walk around the bed, letting her fingernails scrape lightly on my bare skin, it felt nice, and then she climbed up onto the bed, straddled my butt and I felt something warm drip onto my back. I tensed, thinking it was wax, but it didn't hurt.

I realized it was some sort of lube that she had warmed and then, as I felt her panties on my ass, she began to massage my back and shoulders. She rubbed a warm oil into my shoulders, and my back, the whole time grinding her pussy against my ass, my legs, my arms. She would straddle my arm and rub her panties up and down its length while she kneaded a shoulder. She pushed her clit into my thigh as she did my back.

Then she did my legs, reaching between and up a few times to rub my cock. It didn't work well. I know there are videos of guys whose cocks seem to bed behind them, mine doesn't. When my cock is hard it sticks straight out and up.

1tj5we,1,2013-12-23,Just found out I have been cheated on. Advice. PLEASE! I REALLY DO.,SourCream3000,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1tj5we/just_found_out_i_have_been_cheated_on_advice/,"Hello everyone, 

I'm pretty down at the moment, actually I'm broken to pieces. I just got told by my gf[19/f] that she cheated on me[22/m]. I never thought this would happen to me. But it did. She said she was crying and vomited before. But when on the phone just now, she was speaking calmly as well. And she admit that she was also texting him

Anyway she told me that she agree to go out with this friend(that used to have a little crush on her but now nothing, he even had gf but broke up) She thought it was just a hang out at city as friends. But he kissed her, she didn't stop him.

This is the text message she sent me: I'm person A, she is person B, and the third is person C...

""We(B&amp;C) agreed to meet up yesterday. I(B) thought it was just a hang out at city as friends. But he(C) kissed me(B) and I(B) didn't stop him(C). Then I(B) cried and we(B&amp;C) talked about what to do. He said he(C) liked me(B) but said it was fine if I(B) still dated you(A) and just let that moment go. But I decided that I ruined everything and I'm not going to date anyone.""...""I'm sorry...""

I phoned her and she admit everything. We had several arguments already before but it cooled off. Just now she also said that the last getting back together after movies. It felt a bit right... then it doesn't feel right with her.

We argued before was because we both have different opinions on everything(it didn't before but only recently yes like 3~5 months) and the 2nd argument was because I gave the wrong answer. 

She asked me ""do you think I'm the person you want to marry"" I said yes after some thinking how she will later on be understanding and also be more mature as well. So I said ""yeah, but also keep in mind we will have to work pretty hard, our commitment as well."" and she said ""oh..."" I know she said that I missed the point of the happiness of being together. Which I already thought about that and think ahead about the work/commitments. 


So yeah... I don't know what to do. I'm her 5th bf and she is my 1st. Person C has always been chatting to her on facebook...but she tells me that it isn't anything. But now she is already has been texting him.(I am not the boyfriend that checks her facebook chat/phone msg or anything, I respect my partner's privacy)


Her 1st - She didn't really like him but also pressure from high school every girls was having a bf. Then again she still gave him her Virginity.
Her 2nd - They have something going on but He was something I don't really remember.
her 3rd - Its the 2nd's little brother...He some how became fat due to gaming all the time and does not see her in his house when she was over. Also their parents was cool with it too.
Her 4th - They were strong too, but since he started driving and he became a dick apparently. And also she cheated on him to go back to her 3rd one. But didn't really have a relationship with 3rd. She just had sex with the 3rd. Also she told me that even she wasn't with the 4th one...my gf and the 4th also just pretty much like a sex buddy for a couple of months in. Just before I met her at Uni.

and 5th - That is me. We have been together for 1 year and a half. Although I guess the last couple months were also hard since we argued a lot, played the ""i'm breaking up with you"" card. Mostly her. I also fight for her.


To be honest, she is a wonderful girl. She is organized, loves series(knows a lot of actor and actresses names), her painting are amazing(water painting, she wanted to oil paint too), she always no matter what will put me first, no matter how busy she gets...where as me.. I sometimes push her away, because I get stress very easily with reading learning guides, being a ""man"", Finding a career, growing up(I've been bubble wrapped by my mother).

So what do I do ? I don't want to lose her, she is wonderful. You guys may have experienced the same or similar I don't mind listening to your story. I even bought her a dream catcher, because she told me that she had a bad dream of losing me. I also bought her a Dr.Who key chain for her so she can see in the dark when she gets home.

I was the nice guy when she first met me. She was the first that I actually fight for and also we clicked so quickly and easy when we first met. I don't know what else to say right now. All my friends are asleep right now. I have yet to complete my Intern-ship. But I can't sleep or not think...It actually happened to me... I'm willing to forgive because it is just a kiss. But the fact she said ""he kissed me and I didn't stop him"" THAT REALLY HURTS, I know how much she misses me and how badly she wants me time to time. Guys and girls. Thank you for reading and if you want to know more, let me know and I'll tell you what happen in details(If I remember). Please help me... I love her.

______________________________________________________________________________________
Next message:
Me:I said you didn't feel much love after the movie with me?
her: I felt your love, I know you tried but I felt for me the relationship was forced. we have too many problems. For you the problems can go away but its too much pressure for me.
her: Its either I let you go and be free or you wait months without me til I'm ready to be in a relationship. Obviously the relationship now is too damaged to recover because I cheated.
Me: I wasn'ted forced. I was feeling real and happy than before. I know there is a lot for you to go on. I want to help me and I think the same.
her: what do you mean still think the same?
Me :I still love you. its only a kiss
Her: I love you too but I can't promise you anything. I have to be on my own for now.


_____________________________________________________________________________

New update: 

I'm not going to blame her for cheating, she probably wasn't doing it intentionally, while the Person C decided to kiss her. I agree that when she thought it was just a hang out... was fine but really it isn't.

So tonight when I see her after work. I'll drop off Christmas presents and let her go. Either she wants to fuck him or not. I guess like what other commenter said ""She wants a way out, she wants out of this relationship. For whatever reason, she is done and you need to move on."" I'll let her go and I'm speaking in 3rd person right now. I'm calm and think I know what I have to do.

Thank you everyone for helping me...when I'm struggling. Some people may have had it far more worst than me. Perhaps their gf went having sex with another guy. Mine is just a kiss by the other guy.

1tj28s,2,2013-12-23,"I [24 M] am stuck at home with an alcoholic, abusive mother [57 F] and I need help.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1tj28s/i_24_m_am_stuck_at_home_with_an_alcoholic_abusive/,"Hi /r/relationships. I'm a first time poster, long time reader. I'm having a very serious problem lately that I do not know how to deal with.

I'll give you folks a little bit of backstory. Several years ago, my father died from cancer. As my father was dying, my mother turned to alcohol as a coping mechanism. After he died, she continued to drink excessively. There are many times that I can remember having to drive her home from public places because she was too drunk. She eventually started sneaking entire boxes of wine into her room and drinking them over the course of a day. In time, my mother eventually saw a substance abuse counselor and stopped drinking. She has also been on antidepressants ever since my father died, but has not taken the time to speak to a counselor about the things going on in her life.

I very recently graduated college. I still live at home, and I pay rent to stay here. As the days to graduation grew closer, my mother would tell me how proud she was of me. At the same time, she started experiencing several stressors at work, stopped taking her antidepressants, and started going out with her best friend to restaurants to ""have a few drinks."" The drinking has slowly been increasing over the past six months ever since she went on a cruise with my sister and the rest of her family. They are all fully aware of her previous addiction problems, but they allowed her to buy fruity drinks on the cruise. Since then, she has been drinking more and more, after having done so well for years and not touching a drop of alcohol.

The day before I graduated, I was very tired and very stressed out. It was my father's birthday, which is always a very tough day for me, and I worked 3rd shift along with going to school full time and driving an hour away from home twice a week for a mandatory internship. I had gotten home from school that day and went to bed. My mother decided to have a surprise celebration on that day and had a couple of family members over for dinner. I told her that I was having a very rough day, I was exhausted, and I just wanted to sleep. I told her I was sorry, but I did not want to take part in the surprise party. She must have come in and out of my room at least three times over the course of the night, demanding that I come downstairs and spend time with them. Each time I told her no until she finally stopped doing it.

I graduated the next day and called her and asked her if I could come see her at work. She was very short with me, and made me feel like graduating was not a big deal. I decided not to go and see her at work. When I got home, I received a phone call for a potential job opportunity and got set up for an interview. I was so excited! I call my mom as soon as I got off the phone with the recruiter and told her that I had an interview set up. Again, I felt like I was getting the cold shoulder from her, so I hung up to avoid confrontation. I received a text from her shortly afterwards saying that I made the entire family feel like garbage, and I should be ashamed of myself.

I took it upon myself to get in touch with my family to see if they were really offended that I had not seen them the day before, and none of them were. I sent a text message back telling her this, but received no reply. Since then, I've got the cold shoulder from both her and my sister. They are very close and think alike. My sister lives in the house with us. I did not make any attempt to try and talk to either of them because I thought this was all very unreasonable and it would blow over. I was wrong.

On Saturday, my girlfriend's parents invited me over to their house for a family dinner and to celebrate my graduation. When my mother find out that this was happening, she went on a tirade and called my girlfriend garbage and said that her parents were useless. She said if I wanted to be part of the family so badly, I didn't have to be part of her family anymore and I could depend on my girlfriend's parents instead. I was angry, and I retaliated and brought up her drinking and her refusal to take her antidepressant, which she had been off for several days at this point. I left the house, I went to my girlfriends parents house, and I had a great time.

Yesterday, my girlfriend came over to my house because we had plans to spend the day together. I was still getting the cold shoulder from my mother and my sister, so I had been avoiding them and locking myself in my room. They have not made any attempts in the past few days to try and come in and speak to me. Before I left to go out with my girlfriend, I tried to go and speak to my mother to see if I could smooth things over before the holidays. I wanted to apologize to her again for not taking part in her surprise party. She was completely wasted, and told me that my girlfriend and her parents were assholes, she no longer considered me her son, and told me I was a disgrace to her. I kept my mouth shut the whole time, hoping that she would rant and I would have a chance to speak to her. Instead, she shoved herself past me, left the room, and went to get more alcohol. She told me that she was going to get wasted, and she didn't care what anyone thought. My girlfriend and my sister heard the whole exchange. My girlfriend was very upset by what my mother had said, and my sister tried to get my mother to stop drinking, but she had become violent. I left the house with my girlfriend before things could escalate any further. By the time I had gotten home, my mother was in bed, &amp; I did not speak to her.

I worked 3rd shift last night, so I went into work at 11 p.m. I got home at 7 a.m. and went up into my room only to have my mother barge in and demand that I take the lock off of my door. I told her I would not be doing that. She told me if I wouldn't, she would take the door down herself. I told her that was fine, and she could try if she wanted to. She called me an asshole and left the room. I locked the door because I've been getting very tired of the constant verbal abuse, the threats, and the cold shoulder due to her alcoholism and her being off of her medication.

I don't know how much longer I'm going to be stuck in this house. I have a job interview on Monday related to my career, but as of right now I do not have enough money to rent a place of my own. I am scared of the way she's acting lately and I fear things are just going to get worse before they get better. I know that she is under a lot of stress, but I also feel as though everything has been blown out of proportion and is escalating very quickly. I don't know what to do, so I am writing this as truthfully as I can to see if anyone can offer me any advice for the time being. I will be seeing my own personal counselor later on in the afternoon, and I will be telling her about everything that's happened over the past few days. Any advice you folks can give me would be greatly appreciated. I want to fix the situation and the abuse to stop, but I fear as long as she continues to drink, stay off of her medication, and refuse to go to counseling, it will not. I'm sorry for the length of the post and I'm sorry if everything is not completely clear. If there's anything else that you would like me to add, please let me know.

I ended it for a multitude of reasons. 

1. At the time I could not escape the thoughts of my previous girlfriend because she was legitimately a 10/10 all around and I was convinced I could get her back. Interestingly enough, she got engaged last week to the guy right after me.

2. Even though I was incredibly attracted to this girl and everyone assumed she was of college age, I could not get past the moral conflict of losing my virginity to a 16 yr old. 

3. I, understandably so, wondered if I was missing out on opportunities  with an army of college girls.

Anyway, I cut things off with this girl and long story short ended up nailing a few sorority that chicks that I had zero connection to (aside from a quite literal/physical one). These may sound like ""first world"" problems as far as romance goes, but it gets stickier. So as time continues, this girl and I never truly drop communication. We go through phases of texting/calling frequently for a few weeks and even hanging out on occasion. 

Fast forward 4 years. Things were going just fine. I had some short flings, but never truly cared about any of them like I would like to have done. I lived abroad for a year and truly got this girl out of my mind. Until one chance encounter this fall. We run into each other in public and end up going for some drinks that night. She spills all this stuff to me about how I was always ""stuck in her mind"" and ""could have it anytime I want."" 

Now I almost wish we had never started this because it is a complete mess. We have been hooking up off and on for three months now. Its off and on because she has at least one other guy that she is off and on with. Recently she got ""blackout"" and threw a tear-filled violent tantrum explaining how she despises me and never wanted to see me again. She then convinces me in the morning she had not idea what she was talking about and it wasn't the truth. I give up on the situation. Yet, after ten days of zero communication she hollers at me and I come crawling back like a desperate bitch. 

I do like her a usually. I do not know if she is just out for revenge because I let her down a couple of times or if she is sincere about this. I should have just gotten her out of my system 4 years ago when I had the chance, but I am determined to at least boink her. 

Here's the catch. She is moving out of state for an internship in January and right when she gets back, I am moving back to Europe. Is it worth being treated like this? Am I just a shitty person for continually going back to her? Any advice, no matter how brutally honest, would be reassuring. 

tl;dr - I am still very physically attracted to a former relationship and intrigued by her drive and sense of humor. Though she constantly says she wants to be with me, she is also seeing a guy at another school. She even talks about making trips down there in front of me. We are about to be far apart for I don't know how long. I don't know whether to trust her or not. What would you do?

Here is my previous [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1tcnh7/i_attended_a_toastmasters_meeting_today/) but that is just one part of the solution. I will be documenting my pursuits and continually updating this subreddit.

**Bio:**

* Age- 23.
* Gender- Male.
* Signs of social anxiety began when I was : 18 years old.
* severity of social anxiety - 5/10.
* Seeing therapist: No.
* Taking medication: No.

**********************

**Problem 1:**
Nervous meeting new people in a formal setting, like a boardroom or in the office or even a casual environment with a formal meeting agenda.


**possible cause:**

**Social isolation:** 
 After I was finished with college, the last six months have been noticeably harder to deal with because for a large part I was at home.

**Possible solution 1:** 
I am accepting an internship offer that I have received from people I am familiar with. It will however, involve meeting new people everyday. So basically I'm ensuring that for a majority of the day, I will be interacting with unfamiliar people. I will post how I feel after 10 days of doing it.
**********************
**problem 2 :** 
Nervous when I'm expected to give a speech in front of a medium to large group of people. I'm much more nervous if the speech is not a prepared one. 

**Possible cause :**
I had a bad experience in college, where in I was asked to introduce my self and I just sat in my seat without saying a word(was also sweating), things started getting harder from then onwards.

**Possible solution :**
I'm already attending toastmasters sessions. I'll document my progress after a few sessions.

**********************
I'll post a new thread titled part-2 in which I will document my progress and a few more problems. 

Join me in finding out how to tackle this hurdle we are facing. The more we know....."
1titm0,12,2013-12-23,How to plan for the long term and keep moving countries?,startwearinggreen,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1titm0/how_to_plan_for_the_long_term_and_keep_moving/,"Hi personalfinance,

I am in a pretty good situation. I'm 24, I'm an engineer at a fortune 50 company with a highly demanded skill set. I'm also a globe trotter who's trying to not settle down in one place just yet.

I grew up in France, I've worked smaller jobs and internships in 4 countries, and right now I'm working in Switzerland. I'm making about 170kCHF/yr, and in a year and a half I've saved 100k. I'm moving to the US in a few months and I'll be in a similar situation, $150k/yr (gross, including bonus and stocks), and a plan to save at least $40k/yr. I plan to stay there a couple years and move on to another country (I'm looking at several, and I don't want to pick one yet). Rinse and repeat a few times until I decide I've seen enough and I settle down somewhere.

Overall I'm making more than enough to save for later, I'm not spending that much (I'm aware that moving all the time has  financial drawbacks, but I'm trying to plan for that too). The problem is, how do I plan for the long term? I will probably settle down eventually, I don't know when and I don't want to have to pick the country and the date yet. Should I keep savings in each country? (This reduces the chance that my money will lose all its value in a crash right?). Should I make use of retirement plans in each country (401k-like programs, but each country has its own  peculiarities)? Should I rather take all the money and invest in stocks?

I also want to avoid ending up with an endless flow of paperwork. I don't want to have to file taxes in 5 countries every year or have to keep an eye on the stock market daily.

Any general tips? I understand that I'm not taking the most planning-friendly route, and that it's basically impossible to plan exactly without knowing the exact countries, but how can I make the ideal compromise between traveling and saving? 

Tools to track assets in many countries would also help. Thanks!"

1tip27,5,2013-12-23,Help (very long post).,[deleted],BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1tip27/help_very_long_post/,"Hello /r/BipolarReddit … This is my first time posting, so I feel awfully nervous. I was DX’ed three years ago. I had returned from a research trip in the Middle East, and returned feeling melancholy. I took my close friend and roomate’s advice to seek help at the counseling center. I did not anticipate that I had an affliction like Bipolar. I dismissed their conclusions as over-prescribing and had a rocky relationship with my health care providers. I was put on Suicide Watch and threatened to be hospitalized a number of times, but I said if they dared, I would kill myself because I could not deal with the shame of my family knowing. I cannot foot the bill, either.

I eventually gave up on counselling; I felt the entire idea of me being bipolar was an excuse for my own failures and immaturity. I attributed all of my issues to workaholism, since I was tackling three majors, four academic programs, various odd jobs and an internship. Lashing out at others was just due to my weak character and inability to cope. 
Two years later, I experienced a huge slump after my close friend had graduated. I locked myself up in my room and barely left, unless I was wandering around the mountains with hopes to die in a ‘misfortunate accident.’ Then my symptoms became more extreme. After a scuffle with some friends, I had completely lost it and became incoherent and wrote massive texts of complete nonsense and sent them to people. There was this awful sound that would not leave my head, and this ‘urge’ to cause harm to others (… which I am deeply, deeply ashamed to say I had briefly acted on). My mind felt like it was going to split into pieces because the physical pain of this week-long migraine would not stop. I kept hearing the sounds of a drill and a train bell going off and I couldn’t stop it. I saw faces on the wall at night and took off to the street, barefoot, in the rain, in the middle of the night screaming and yelling, calling people up. 

Later in the year, a friend had done something terrible to me, and I had lost it again. This time I began to babble incoherently for hours, tried to cut off parts of my body with a knife (but I stopped), I was laughing and screaming. Eventually, they had called the police to put me in a mental hospital. I told the officers it was a mistake, and they left very disgruntled. Sometime later … it had finally hit me what had happened – it felt like a strange, bad dream. I messaged my old room mate, my best friend, for help. I just wanted one person in the world to tell me it was okay, that I wasn’t crazy. Though I found little support. I felt crushed. I felt alone.

On one hand, I understand why people are disturbed when they see me at my worse – but on the other, I feel so abandoned. 
Recently, things had went South again. I took a reckless trip into the wilderness, and Kanji and Roman characters started to appear on the boulders. The rocks turned into people, taco trucks – the earthen ground became certificates, papers … Yet I didn’t question any of this. It seemed ‘normal’ to me. I even took photos to show people the words on the rocks, but of course, when I came home and looked, it was just plain rocks. 

I broke down again. This time there were people where I lived and they could hear me laughing and screaming while curled up in a tub fully dressed. One person tried to drag me to a hospital, but remarked how many people all over the world suffer. I live an OK life, but how did I ‘end up like this.’ I was screaming and crying for them to go and leave me alone, don’t look at me, don’t look at me. Please don’t look at me. I went on a rampage online and posted like an idiot on social media – something I hadn’t done before. I felt so humiliated.  I don’t know what is going on with me. How did things become so much worse? I feel alone. I feel scared. I feel like no one in my own personal life understands. 

I had lost my closest friend. I now avoid people who have ‘seen’ how I get because I feel so embarrassed. My remaining friends I avoid, too, because I am in such a pathetic shape. I just don’t want them to know. I’m afraid they’ll abandon me to, like my other friend did. 
I finally attempted to receive help at a neighboring city, and they suspected I had schizoaffective disorder. I am not even sure what that is. I eventually did not go.

I'm so exhausted. I cannot sleep without experience hyper-realistic dreams. I wake up not feeling 'rested,' but I was transported to another world.

You know what the “craziest” thing is? I still cannot fully commit to the idea I am mentally ill. Despite of I have written. Deep down inside, I still want to believe this is all a personality issue that I can sort out through wisdom, experience and will-power. Even if I can look at the evidence, and realize that there is something wrong beyond my control, I cannot feel that way. I cannot take therapy and psychiatry seriously when I go. 

Just what is going to become of me … ? Had anyone had this experience?

1tijap,2,2013-12-23,How to appropriately contact and network with acquaintances as professional connections?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1tijap/how_to_appropriately_contact_and_network_with/,"Wasn't entirely sure how to word this. I'm currently in college and setting out for art/entertainment based jobs. Obviously, these are networking heavy industries. I do fortunately know quite a few people loosely who may have the ability to assist, but I'm not sure how to really go about that. It's not difficult contacting a stranger or friend, but those I speak to infrequently raises more questions. I also did not always have the most professional of demeanors and am only recently learning how to network appropriately. I feel like I may have damaged some of these connections in a professional manner.

I'll number every situation off separately; Feel free to give advice on one or all.

1) I briefly spoke with a founder of a video game studio who later added me on Facebook. They posted a short 'Hey, hope your holidays are going well' generic type thing to me last year around this time. I said something similar back ""Hey, you too"" or something and then segued into possible internships (stupid on my part). There was no further response. We haven't spoken since, but we also didn't speak often to begin with. Is it appropriate to attempt to initiate this again?

2) I have a family friend since childhood who has strong connections in the entertainment industry, has won Oscars, and is constantly working. I've never contacted them myself and only know this person through my Mom. She does not appear to want to contact this person to ask about internships. I could this person's email online and contact them, but don't know if it's appropriate to sidestep my family.

3) I have a friend at a larger animation studio with multiple locations. I was hoping to get an internship at this studio as they're local, but I also just applied for a job through another of the company's studios a few weeks back. I could simultaneously have the job and internship; Neither would affect the other and both would be beneficial in their own way. Should I contact this friend about the internship or wait until the job portion is settled? If I don't get the job (they'll know, since I referenced them), should I ask about the internship?

4) I met someone at an industry event who works at a large film studio who offered to give me industry advice and gave me an email. Emails went back and forth a few times shortly after then they didn't respond. I think I got back and they just mentioned being super busy and apologizing, then not responding again still. I tried again maybe a year later mentioning I was going to attempt applying to their studio's internship as I mentioned in person I planned to in the future. They said they would get me some information for their hiring manager then never responded. I may have followed up again; Don't recall off-hand. Either way, I never got the information. I didn't get the impression they were ignoring me, but rather the email just got lost in the ether. Their studio will be accepting internship applications again soon, should I email this person again asking for any information again? How should I go about this?

Again, I know not all my actions were necessarily wise from a professional standpoint. I haven't ruined connections as a friend with any of these people or done anything ridiculous or outlandish, but I do believe on a professional level, I may have ruined any credibility. Is there anyway to make sure any emails do get replies? Is it wise to attempt to contact people working at studios I'm interested in interning at and making connections? What is it appropriate to say when emailing a stranger out of the blue? I'm only just adjusting to professionalism, so while I'm generally extremely comfortable meeting new people and talking when being myself, I'm finding it nerve-wracking how to professionally network and connect with people. Mainly because I feel I will do something that may kill my current or future chances with a company in an industry where jobs are scarce already.

So, any advice would be extremely appreciated in any of the above scenarios or in general. Apologies this is a bit long; I just have a ton of situations occurring at once. Thanks if you bothered to read through all this!"
1tibyt,1,2013-12-22,I want out of home and university.,HopeLightning,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1tibyt/i_want_out_of_home_and_university/,"Hey guys,

So I really need some perspective because I'm trying to make some major decisions in my life.


I'm at my 2nd university after dropping out of my first one 3 years ago. I'm 2 years into this one but I keep dropping classes which brings me further and further from ever graduating. I have never been able to handle a full-course load so I haven’t actually experienced a decent summer break in years since I have to take summer school to try and keep up.  It keeps costing me an insane amount of money that I can't afford and it has gotten to the point several times where I had to take personal loans from people to stay in. Everything I do in university just feels like... a waste of time. I'm not happy, even though I achieve great to alright grades I just feel like I'm missing out on life grinding to get a bachelor’s degree that I started in 2009. I'm 23 now, everyone that I see on a daily basis is much younger than I am (18 to 23 does actually make a big difference) and I don't really have any people I consider full-time friends. I see people on facebook that I graduated high school with and who I should’ve graduated with from my first university starting internships and even getting married… and well I’m still at my mom’s house (rent free), hanging out with people 4-5 years younger than me, I see some friends once in a blue moon if they’re in town, and I’m jobless and dead broke.


I've lived with my mother since 2008 but I still don't get along with her until this day and every day she just makes me feel like I’m a leach eating away at everything she has… even though I don’t ask for anything from her. I feel like absolutely shit by living off of 100-200 dollar allowances that my dad wires to me every now and then.  If I could help her out financially I would.. I’ve had a hard time finding stable work for 2 years now and whatever earnings I make is eaten up by the government because of my student loans (and those that I owe money to privately). I don’t have much of a relationship with my family because they’re very conservative and that I’m never taken seriously by any of them.


I'm fed up with living a very slow moving life... it doesn't seem to be going in any particular direction and I want to change things up by possibly going to college because I know I'd find it a lot easier and it'd get me out of the house quicker. I’d also be able to find a job that I’d be able to balance with school and be able to afford tuition with my own money and to make a savings to move away. There are also co-op programs in college that can get me working and making money even sooner. However, I can't do that without feeling personally defeated because everyone I have ever brought the idea up to keep telling me that I'm too smart for college and that a degree is better. The way I’m thinking about it is that I can always finish my degree but do that on a very part-time basis after I establish myself to be self-dependent and reliant and only as a personal achievement. 


My dream in life is to move somewhere far away from where I live now and to be a father – Hell I even have had my kid’s names picked out since the 8th grade.  I’m perfectly fine with the idea of a comfortable middle class life making 60,000 – 70,000 a year and being married to someone who makes close to the same. I’ve had ideas of how I want my future family to be from as long as I can remember… I feel like I have to make up for the lack of fathering my own father gave me. As long as I have those things, I’d be happy working an average salary office job for awhile before saving up enough money to open up my own business. I want to get married and have kids while in my 20s because I want to be able to relate to my kids once they grow up. 


In summary, I want to apply for college, find a stable job and save at least 20,000 in the next 2 years to move out of the country and find my way from there. With all the switching I’ve done in my life I don’t know how much of crap talk I’d be able to handle from family members. They will convince me that I’ve given up on myself once again… but they don’t know that everything I’m doing is to get away from here and from them. I want to step into a new life that is much different from the one I’m living now. I just want out.


Really give me perspective guys, I need it. I really appreciate anyone that reads this as getting perspective from complete strangers might prove to be more better than anything I’m hearing in my life now.

EDIT: It also doesn't help that I have a pending trial of academic dishonesty against me, which will make my university life much more difficult."

Could this be the 1 exception to taking out a student loan to help with living expenses? Job details, monthly expenses, debts, listed in post",PFPleaseHelp,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ti2kd/long_pf_please_help_me_severely_depressed_in_a/,"This is a throwaway. I am at my mental, emotional, and physical breaking point with a job I have been at for over 4 months that I felt forced to take in order to make my monthly expenses. I am severely depressed, cry to and from work every day and often lock myself in the bathroom and cry as well. The demanding nature and hours of this job has every other part of my life suffering, including school. I know I need a new job but my limited schedule, high monthly expenses, leave me feeling really stuck. I need help, advice, anything.

**Background**: I am early 20s, live at home with my parents in a suburb of NYC (high cost of living here, some of the highest taxes in the country), still in school. I do not pay rent. 

**School**: Finishing up BA degree, graduating in June. I go to school at night, 3 nights a week in NYC. 45min commute each way that is down from 1.5 hours each way when I was taking mass transit. Our program is cross registered with another college where we take classes with both schools throughout the trimester. Typical trimester is about 18 credits. We have a federal grant that pays tuition for the school in NYC but the cost of tuition rose and there was a gap, so it is now all of the student's responsibility to pay the difference. Financial aid is not offered to us. If we want/need it, we would have to take out personal student loans. A certain number of internship hours are required each trimester so one workday a week is recommended to dedicate to that. I am only available to work 4 days during the work week because of that. Sundays I have another job. Come the spring our internship hours required are doubling so I fear I will have to dedicate yet ANOTHER day during the workweek to internship hours which will be a huge hit in pay.

**Jobs**: Worked as a nanny for a few families over the course of a bout 4 years. Recently worked for a family for a year, was supposed t to continue, but the mom's schedule changed suddenly and because of my school hours, it was physically impossible for me to work for them. I was forced to look for a new job in August. I also have a part time job as a waitress that I work at on Sundays. I have been there for over 5 years and keep 1 shift a week so I can make extra cash. There are no extra shifts available there for me to pick up. After I lost my job in August I was frantic to find another nanny job. I applied to over 60 nanny postings over the course of 2 weeks, went on many interviews, etc. I accepted a job with a family to have them ""retract"" the job 2 days later because their nanny for 2 years ago said she wanted it instead. Ok. Start the process over. It was getting down to the wire and bills were piling up. I was offered a job from a family that was extremely un-ideal. 4 days a week, 10 hours a day (615am-430pm), nanny cams, a child who is extremely difficult (how the parents described the child), they want me to be a pre-school teacher basically. No tv except at meal time. VERY underpaid - paying me $10/hour, going rate in this area is $15/hour. I work on a teacher's schedule. When the parents are off, so am I, but I do not get paid. Because of this, it is hard to budget money when it's not consistent.

This job is the worst thing that has ever happened to me. I wake up at 515am in the mornings, leave my house at 6am, work for 10 hours, then go to school for 3 hours. I get home at 10pm at night. By the time I shower, get my things ready for the next day and do a bit of reading for school, I get about 5-5.5 hours of sleep a night. I have gained about 15lbs, I am severely depressed, I cry all day, my school is severely suffering because I have decreasing time to do my work and my mental alertness is now complete shit because I am so exhausted and depressed all the time. I have grown resentful of the children I care for and am no longer a good nanny. All I care about is passing the time as quickly as possible and biding my time until it's nap time and I get a minor reprieve. After being a nanny for over 4 families and always loving my job, this particular child has completely broken my spirit and I feel like a part of me has really died. I no longer want children and I now understand why parents of difficult children sink into deep depressions and become unable to competently care for children. Sleep deprivation and feeling hopeless are very strong emotions/experiences and can affect you in ways you could never imagine.

**Debt**

- Immediate: $2k in credit card debt. Appx. $1k on 2 cards. 0%APR. Most of this is from Time Payment Plans for school. 
- Long Term: Student loans. Been in school for over 5 years. $50-$70k. Deferred until graduation. All will be eligible for loan forgiveness after 10 years, so I will have to make the minimum payments and that's it (please correct me if I have the loan forgiveness info wrong).

**Monthly Expenses**:

- Car payment: $200
- Gas: Varies. Anywhere from $50-$100. 
- Insurance/phone: $100
- Credit Card: $200 ($100 each. Would like to increase this as much as possible to pay this debt down faster)
- Time Payment Plans: $400 ($200 to each school)
- Groceries: varies depending on coupons/deals/produce that is in season. Typically around $50-$125

**Monthly Medical Expenses**: I am on my parents insurance. My medications are extremely high in copays. Trust me, this is a rough bullet to take each month. I have been on about 7 kinds of birth control over the past 8 years and all of them have negatively affected my body (not just weight gain, actually negative side effects) and this is the only one that has not. Same for depression meds. Only one that has not negatively affected me. I am on birth control to manage PCOS that I was diagnosed with at 15. Therapy is at a community counseling center and much cheaper than most other options available to me. 

- Birth control: $75 (copay)
- Anxiety/depression medication: $75 (copay)
- Therapy/counseling: $72 (copay)
- Metformin: $15

**Not Consistent Monthly Expenses**:

- EZ Pass: $40. My boyfriend is long distance and I visit him about once a month. The $40 is for round trip. I understand this is a luxury and many people would suggest cutting this out. Please understand this is the one thing that brings me happiness and the only thing I allow myself to ""splurge"" on. I love my boyfriend and our visits are the only things that get me through my shitty days at work.
- This is also why my gas payments vary. Obviously more when I drive to see him. Cost to take amtrak is slightly more than the gas it takes me to get there + tolls

**Options**

The fact that my school work is suffering is the biggest red flag to me. I can be exhausted, overweight, and depressed but if I fail out of school I truly have hit rock bottom and everything I worked for is for naught. Staying in school is so important. I am very worried about how to make this work. It is obvious I need a new job. What I'm stuck on is this: I can only work 3-4 days during the workweek because of my internship hours requirement and weekends I already am committed to another job on Sundays so that leaves Saturdays open if necessary. As seen from my monthly expense list, I have a high list of monthly expenses.

To preemptively answer a few suggestions I feel the community will make. **In regards to the car payment** I took mass transit to school for all of last year. Monthly train pass + monthly subway card came out to appx. $325. My commute was 1.5 hours each way. Not having a car really limited potential jobs I could get because I was limited to my area (public transportation where I live not in NYC is not only unreliable but insanely inefficient and not designed with the commuter in mind). Also, the costs of taking trains to see my boyfriend were expensive. I leased a car so I don't have to pay maintenance and I knew it was reliable. So my car payment, insurance, and gas is less than what I was paying and has also cut down on my commute time (very important for an extra 15 mins of sleep at night) and given me more freedom as far as jobs I can work/apply to.

I read this sub every day. I am aware this sub advocates avoiding student and personal loans at almost any and all costs. I tend to agree with this information because student loans truly fuck you dry up the ass especially if they are personal and not government student loans. This is also because I already have a high amount of student loans already. Could  this be the 1 time where it could be OK to take out a small student loan at a low interest rate to cover costs of living while in school? Just to minimally sustain me so I can quit this nanny job, pay off immediate debts, get myself back to a positive and functioning state of mind, catch up to schoolwork, etc? Then after 2 months find a new job that fits my lifestyle better. I get this still sounds crazy but I feel like I need help somewhere.

1ti1sx,3,2013-12-22,Negotiating full-time salary as iOS Developer. Does about-to-be-earned Masters matter or average iOS Developer salary? Thanks for input!,[deleted],startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ti1sx/negotiating_fulltime_salary_as_ios_developer_does/,"So there's a successful startup that I had an internship with that would like to have me back full time in Chicago after I graduate with a Masters this year. A friend of mine who works there says the current software developers earn about $60,000 with a Bachelors but I'm seeing averages for iOS Developers be in $90,000 and that doesn't even take degree into account. There's dental &amp; health insurance, up to 2 weeks of paid vacation days, and stock options although the company has so much investors involved that the stock options I assume aren't really that big of a deal (0.1%).

Would it be insane to ask for $90,000 from a startup that has more than a million dollars of VC money? I never knew the average for iOS developers was so high and I always saw myself as a software developer who happen to specialize in iOS, thus justifying a much lower pay. However in the end, I am an iOS developer so I could argue that the job market average is much higher and that I'd like to get paid more. I have become quite acquainted with their software and even know how to work with integrating the Windows and Mac client software with the iOS app since that's what I did during the internship, which makes me worth a lot in their eyes. Not only that but I'm going to have a Masters so that should count for something, right?

I don't want to be exploited but I don't want to sound like a cheap penny pincher that cares only about the money in the company. I love the work! But with the salary I was earning as an intern, they were clearly using me for cheap labor since that's what interns are in the end. What are your thoughts? Should I be expecting to be getting anything higher than the $60,000 that the other software developers get even though my specialization has a higher average and I will have a Masters degree? Thanks a bunch for the replies! :)"

I'm a Junior Computer Engineering student currently on winter break and diligently hunting for internships. I'm having a very hard time finding good fit opportunities to apply for and and since the application process for most is rather time consuming I only want to spend time on ones that I have a chance at and I would accept. I had one internship last summer (as a rising Junior) but it was with a family friend's company and although I learned tons it was basically tossed into my lap.

If you do a simple google search about three third party websites comes up with the same 15 opportunities. Having only a 3.2 GPA and somewhat limited organized extracurriculars I feel I don't have the qualifications to stand out from what will likely be a huge pool of applicants.

I'm most interested in working for a smaller company and I don't know how to find them. I had such a positive experience at the small company I worked for last year I would love to find a similar experience (I am not returning to my first internship because I would like to steer my career in another direction). Would it be inappropriate to find companies that look interesting and call/email to ask for more information about what they do and if they'd be interested in an intern? I feel like many small places don't actively look for interns. I'm also very interested in sustainability/green engineering and plan a minor in sustainability engineering, does anyone have any recommendations for finding a company that places an emphasis on this? So many company websites are outdated and have a very small amount of information that I'm not sure what my next step should be.

Thank you for your help r/AskEngineers!"

I know that top companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft are all just about done hiring for their internship programs, and I've been left with no interviews. The environment at school is very cutthroat, insular, and unforgiving so I guess I'm trying to get a second opinion and understand what's going on elsewhere. 

I kept putting off applying for more positions because I feel like I'm very rusty on CS basics and I haven't had time to review, and because I want to do front end but my skills there are less developed than they are in the back end. Should I stop worrying and just get my resume out there, or take my time and prepare? 

I know this might sound overly anxious (which I'm sure it probably is), but it's hard not to feel this way when everyone around me is constantly talking about their internships and comparing them, and I'm completely empty-handed. "

1tlvq2,1,2013-12-24,"Visionary College Entrepreneur Builds a Startup For College Students... Interviewed On Startups (While In School or Anytime) ""I WILL Start a Startup No Matter How BIG or SMALL""",roomscapeu,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1tlvq2/visionary_college_entrepreneur_builds_a_startup/,"RoomScape U: Redefining the College Dorm Living Experience

There is something brewing down in Tallahassee Florida…A nice little ecosystem of start-ups is shaping and coming into form, and this development is being led by Josh Hagler a senior at Florida State University, and founder of RoomScape U, a website dedicated to helping college students find unique and novel items for dorms.

The idea for his start-up came to him when he was a freshman at FSU, and noticed that most dorm room walls were blank and dull in color. He found the same issue as well when going to Target and Walmart, and noticed that both stores had the same boring items.

In this article Josh shares the RoomScape U story, and gives advice for aspiring college entrepreneurs.

Q: What is the elevator pitch of your business?

RoomScape U curates and sells essential, cool, and innovative products for college students. The goal of our site is to reinvent and re-imagine your college living experience.
Q: What does RoomScapeU offer to its users? What’s your value proposition?

On the site we offer everything from awesome wall peels to branded bar stools for schools. We offer an array of products such as cooking and drinking products, electronic products like alarm clocks, entertainment speakers and headphones and UBoxes. As pointed out in the website, UBoxes were created to provide college students with awesome products at great prices. Weekly deals are ran to promote UBoxes and are only available while supplies last.

The value proposition for RoomScapeU is discovering new products for college students that are curated to students. It too is themed specific for each school, for example, when I sign in with FSU the product results that are returned are FSU themed. Users can also view the cost between roommates in the product description. The products then become a Facebook for social shopping, where people can send products to roommates via Facebook and more.
Q: What was the hardest obstacle you faced starting out?

The hardest thing for me starting up has been teaching myself how to code and learning photoshop on the fly. This was accomplished too with only the help of a few interns. Having limited resources as a start-up has made me work 15-18 hours a day, which is not necessarily a bad thing because I love what I do.
Q: How did you decide what to sell?

When I started the site it began with just posters, from their I thought what are the essentials for college rooms. Wall posters, cool wall cloths, everything that can go on a canvas, this whole student marketplace sooned followed. Shower stuff, alarm clocks, tech items, I started to look at trending items on various websites like TechCrunch for new products in hopes of getting them on RoomScape U.
Q: Where are the products from?

A fun thing I love about RoomScape U is finding suppliers, constant research, googling college shopping, seeing what people are saying, locating the essentials, finding what is going to make this venture different. The process is a hard one to copy once you found your partners, each business has a method.
Q: What goes into keeping those relationships strong?

These people get 50-100 requests a day, have to be purple cow when reaching out to potential business partners. Always be friendly and keep up the conversation, look up their team, and see which person might be related to your business the most, Keeps the conversation positive and following up.

Stand out and be personable.
Q: How did you come up with the name for your start-up?

The name is something that stemmed from landscaping, or making beautiful things outside. So we called it roomscaping, literally making your room awesome “RoomScape” and the “U” is for university.
Q: How is balancing school and a start-up?

It is challenging. I used to enjoy going out, spending time with friends, but I don’t have the time anymore! The good thing is that I am extremely passionate about what I do. In addition, this semester I am taking two entrepreneurship courses, with great professors, these professors all have great advice which has helped with RoomScape U.
Q: What is the most important part of your business?

The most important part of RoomScape U is to make college students happy! We want students to have an enjoyable time browsing our products to discover cool stuff. Hopefully it gives them a new idea for their own rooms. It is all about making the customers happy, without them there is no site.
Q: What is the biggest mistake you have made along the way, how would you prevent it next time?

The biggest mistake I made was not seeking help early on, or not seeking a founding team earlier. Doing so would have probably helped accelerate the business. Having that founding team makes it easier to throw the idea around, get feedback, to kill it at the same time together.
Q: What is your advice from college students starting out?

My advice for college students wanting to start a business is to write the idea down on a paper. Write something like, “I will start a start-up,” when the goal is in mind it becomes much easier to reach. “No matter how big or small, I will start a start-up” is the phrase I used to motivate me to start RoomScape U.

How you discover what you want to start, comes from an idea, the execution, when reality meets, you take your idea, and get feedback early and test. Ideas are a guess, when the guess is given to another person, that is when you start to innovate and get something people want to use!

In short keep writing, keep testing, and keep innovating! Think big and be rational about what you can do. Believe in your idea, it can happen, and set out to change the world."
1tls51,5,2013-12-24,24 Year Old Computer Science Student. Do I keep trying?,ineedadvice24,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1tls51/24_year_old_computer_science_student_do_i_keep/,"In 100% honesty, I'm just not a very good student and I'm just not very intelligent.  I started this journey in 2007, dropped out for 2 years because of financial problems after my dad passed and transferred to a cheaper school.  I lost all of my credits but I'm trying again but I just don't know if it's worth it.  

I feel like an old man and I feel like everybody is watching and waiting for me to graduate and I feel like I'm a financial burden on my mom and more than anything, I just want a tech related job just to get me started, even if it's minimum wage and even if it's the most worthless tech job where I get treated like dirt.  I just want to get my foot on some rung of some ladder but I cant seem to get anything and I feel like I'm just spinning my tires in the mud.  These last 2 years I've been sending my resume everywhere, I've been trying to land just something, anything and I've had zero luck.  I'm quite savvy with computers and I learn quickly when I'm on my own and when it's practical but I'm no good at learning in a classroom or from a textbook.  Ill admit, I was a lazy high school kid and I've developed terrible habits but I think I've gotten better.  There was a time when simple Algebra terrified me, in fact when I took the placement test at school, they dropped me into Algebra and I hate to work my way up and just yesterday I took my Single Variable Calculus final.  Maybe I didn't pass that final but I have to admit, I do feel a sense of pride in being able to say that I got out from under my math-illiterate hole and have a keen understanding of at least a few concepts in Calculus.

Anyways, I digress.  I just don't know if I can keep doing this.  I feel like it might be time to drop out and just work at some fast food joint or something and accept that higher education isn't for everybody and perhaps I just don't have what it takes.  When I started this journey the plan was to become a competent programmer and to move out to Austin with some friends who have started a game development studio.  They knew that I wasn't the best programmer but the idea was to get my foot in the door and to just grind through it.  Ultimately, I wanted to work in design and it's where my passion is but I wanted to become a programmer so that I had a marketable skill to offer rather than being the ""ideas guy"".  But I don't know.  I don't think I'm bad at programming, I think I'm just bad at learning.  I have poor study habits and I don't really know how to start to learn.  I've gone through textbooks, I've sat down and worked on projects of my own but nothing truly perplexing comes out of it and I don't feel like I've made anything worth showcasing.  Ideally, I'd love to land some internship where someone forced me into a position where I had to learn to program but out here in New York, it seems like every position asks for 3-5 years of experience and a degree which is totally understandable but I don't know how I'm going to get started.

Thanks for reading all of this if you've made it this far.  I feel pretty god damn worthless and I don't want to give up but it just seems like it's what I should do at this point."

1tlmm7,1,2013-12-24,I can't move forward in life,plasmastar,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1tlmm7/i_cant_move_forward_in_life/,"A bit of background before the actual story. I live in Puerto Rico and I work as a programmer. I make $9 an hour working as an intern, having to renew contract every month. By now, you should know this implies that I could be let go at any moment, which is something that worries me every day. Now, I have tried to get another job, but here in PR entry level jobs for programmers are non existent. Every time I find a job description, they ask for 5 &gt; years of experience, and the salary isn't even that great for what they're asking. So I stay in my current job because I need it to survive, and because I need experience.

Now, here comes the story. Two weeks ago I was interviewed by the same company I work for but in the US. I was recommended for a Software Developer position. I did my best to try and impress the person interviewing me. Which, apparently, I did. Because yesterday I received an email that they wanted to do a second interview which would be by Skype, since I am far away. I was so happy because I was finally going to get the job I need and deserved. But it seems I will have to let go of the opportunity.

I live with my mother. I am the only person she has in her life. She has excluded from her life all of her friends and all of her family. We have been going through a really tough time this last year. She had to stop working due to health issues. Because of that, my salary was the only income we were receiving. She lost her house for not being able to pay it. We've been living in a rented house for almost a year, which I don't mind. I don't mind anything that's been happening for the last year. So, you would think that maybe she would be happy that I was going to get this job so I could help us both get out of these problems.

But instead, she just cries and cries. And I understand her. I've been at her side for all of my life. Not having me by her side was the most difficult thing for her to tolerate. And she keeps crying. She keeps telling me to not leave, that I was going to get a better job here in PR. To those who don't know, things PR are going from bad to worse. Our situation worsens every day, and there is no future here. Moreover, my profession is barely appreciated here. There are people in data entry who make more money than I do. I don't think there are many worse feelings in this world than seeing your mother cry her heart out. I can't believe my mother would be so selfish. She only cares about herself. This was my golden opportunity to finally get ahead in life, and I'll probably lose it because she'll die if I leave. I'm not kidding, Reddit. She will literally die if I leave. I know her. She'll probably stop eating and fall into a deep depression until she dies. She might even commit suicide. I don't doubt it. I couldn't take her crying anymore, so I told her I wasn't going to leave. And I thought that maybe if I gave her until morning, she would think it over and realize that it was for the best that I took this job offer. But no. She didn't even mention anything.

It's frustrating, Reddit. I can't leave her alone in my good conscience. I would feel like shit. I know I should toughen up and forget anything she has to say. But I just can't. It's just not the kind of person that I am. It's funny because she used to have this friend who couldn't get ahead in life because she had to take care of her mother until she died. She always used to criticize her mother, how she held back her friend and was selfish. Now she's doing the same thing to me. I don't know what I'm going to do. I already told her I wasn't leaving. If I told her I was I would just start hearing that heart wrenching cry again.

Thank you for reading Reddit. I probably left out some details about this whole story. I am just so frustrated and angry I just wrote my feelings out. Have a nice day and a Merry Christmas!"
1tllsr,1,2013-12-24,How do you deal when life seems to be against you?,Chance_Potomac,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1tllsr/how_do_you_deal_when_life_seems_to_be_against_you/,"The past year has been really rough for me.  My marriage of five years came to a screeching halt leaving me to take care of my self for the first time in my life.  I moved in with roommates (another first) and got a job to pay the bills.  During this time I had also found out that my Grandmother was diagnosed with Pancreatic cancer. Due to the stress of it all, I withdrew from school and decided that I needed to take the next semester off.

I thought I had made a difference and that I was feeling better about my life in general to continue school in the fall. But I soon realized that I was not.  I attended school this fall semester and two weeks before my internship was over I was asked to withdraw from the program for unprofessional conduct. In the last six months I have not been able to pay off my credit card and I am now in debt.  Because of this I was not able to go home for Christmas.

I am struggling financially which results in stressing that I will be able to pay rent, let alone any other bills. It makes it more stressful when the credit card company calls three times a day wanting a payment. 

This has been affecting my sleep, which in turn affects work.  I have the option to move back in with my parents and have debated it.  I think the problem is that I am stubborn and that if I move back in with my parents I have failed and once again need someone to take care of me. But at the same time getting your pay check and realizing that once rent is paid, you will have $30 to your name until next payday, really is no way to live. 

I am at a loss of what is going to make me happy in the long run. I fear that if I do move back home it is because I gave into peer pressure and not really doing it because I wanted too. And if I stay, that I will just bury myself deeper in debt.

I know that I probably shouldn't turn to the internet for this but I need to get these things off my chest and putting it out to strangers seems better than bothering my friends with this.

I want to break up, but he doesn't.",throwaway112233444,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1tlel1/my_boyfriend_23_m_of_two_years_has_feelings_for/,"This is going to be a long story, but I need to get it all out. Some background: We've been together since my freshman year of college; I'm a junior now. He was a senior at my school when we started dating, and he's now working and living at his parents. We have lived together for a year, but he recently had to move home for financial reasons. Our relationship is very loving, open and fun. Our friends describe us as an ideal couple.

This seems kind of unrelated, but bear with me-- the first summer we were dating, I had a full blown mental breakdown. I have obsessive-compulsive disorder, but I'm in much better control of it now. He was amazing through this whole time; I was amazed that he stayed with me after I stayed hidden in my room for months, lost 40 pounds and spent endless days in the hospital and doctors' offices. But he did. And he was wonderful. 

Jump to now, we're living about two hours apart (we were long-distance at the beginning of our relationship when he was on an internship). We still get to see each other a lot, but we've definitely been a little out of touch.

I'm visiting his family for the holidays, and in his room, I stumbled on a notebook where he'd written out a bunch of his thoughts. I knew I shouldn't have been reading it, but I thought we didn't hide anything from each other. I just didn't expect to read anything that he wouldn't have told me. 

Unfortunately, I was wrong. He had written all about another girl, a friend of his that we both know from college. His exact words included ""I should have dated her in college."" He also acknowledged that it wouldn't be fair to her, me or her boyfriend (one of his good friends). 

He does have some history with this girl-- they hooked up several times in college, but never dated. Unfortunately for me, he has a lot of female friends like this... He was a... sexual creature in college. Anyway. Now she's having a similar mental breakdown to mine; apparently she has an anxiety disorder and is having a really terrible time since graduating college. He has been there for her through the whole thing, and he's been pretty open with me about that. I have always felt a little uncomfortable about her, especially because she is always telling him that she wishes he would go visit her or move to live closer to her. I've told him that, but he always brushed it off because she's very needy. 

I confronted him about it almost immediately-- he feels really guilty and says that it's nothing compared to how he feels about me. He told me that it's new, and even in college when they hooked up, he didn't have any feelings for her. He said that it's just because he talks to her all the time, and he's sort of wondering ""what if"". He cried a lot and begged to stay together. I believe him, but I still can't get it out of my head. I don't feel like it's healthy to be together right now, even though I love him so fucking much. 

I don't want to lose my best friend, but I'm afraid that I'll never be able to put this behind us. He says he'll do anything, even stop talking to her at all. I don't want that; she's a nice girl and she needs a friend right now more than ever. But how can I be with someone who could have feelings for someone else? Who could say ""I should have dated her""?

I'm so scared that he's just with me because it's convenient; he can't be with her, and he doesn't want to be alone. He's assured me that that's not it... but I just can't wrap my head around it. I think maybe he wanted to take care of me when I was sick, and now that she's sick, he wants to take care of her. I feel like I really want to be sure about him, and I'm not. 

What am I supposed to do? 

**Tl;Dr: I snooped, found out my boyfriend of two years has feelings for a friend. I can't get it out of my head, and even though I know he loves me, I don't think we can stay together. He disagrees.**

Having better bots would make for great practice for those who can already beat the easy bots and are looking for more of a challenge, those who find pvp too toxic and those who really like to play Co-op vs AI, but find them too easy to beat.

They could create tiers of bots ( Bronze, Silver etc ) where they mechanical skill changes per tier.

Or just add an extra difficulity level.

    .

I am SHEePYTaGGeRNeP / Lorenzo a Diamond II jungler and I love Artificial Intelligence. So I thought I'd make this post to show Riot how important this is, not just for the game itself, but also for the Software Engineers at Riot Games who will learn a lot more about the game ( when to do Dragon etc. ), but also give them more experience in AI programming. I also applied for an internship at Riot Games, in hopes of becoming part of this. Plus it can create job opportunities for those willing to create the complex bots.

Or Riot could possibly just host some form of tournament where the community can create their own bots and all Riot has to do is pick the best one. This way they won't have to hire people and it won't take any of their man hours.

Could be that Riot is already working on improving on Co-op vs AI, but then I wonder why we haven't heard anything from them.

Let me know in the comments what your thoughts are about this.

Happy Holidays!

EDIT: For those wondering, I haven't heard anything from Riot about this post. Hope they will share some good news on co-op vs ai.

Nothing that I do to the numbers 1-10 makes them sum 88 under the conditions given. Can anyone spot how that works? Or are they just wrong?

Thanks :)"

Hey there,

I'm a 24 year old information security analyst moving from Phoenix into the bay in the next few weeks. I'm starting to get worried about being able to find a place, so I figured I'd post here. I'd obviously like to live within SF proper, but it's been hard to find anything that wasn't a scam. I'm also open to the surrounding area (I lived in Berkeley during an internship and its doable), so long as its within a 15-20 minute walk to a BART/equivalent public transit station. I'm pretty mellow and like to have a few drinks from time to time, but I'm not 420 friendly (no offense, it's a job thing). Love pets as well, but don't have any of my own.

My budget is around $1500, but I can go a bit higher if it's necessary (I'm trying to allocate a bit for parking in the event that I end up somewhere that charges). I'm open to roommates if need be, but if anyone knows of any apartment complexes or someone looking to sublet or something it'd be helpful.

Thanks!"

**[COMPUTERS....IN....SPAAAAACE](http://youtu.be/reBzU8E_Ajk)**

 I've been poking around the websites of both governmental agencies and private space companies, and not surprisingly they're looking for people that have knowledge of the effects of radiation of electronics, and how best to protect against it. 

Searching on Google produced papers and other useful sources of information through some schools and the ESA. Does anyone have any recommended sources (websites, books, other publications) on the topic, and anything else that might be useful for becoming a better candidate for that sector?

A bit of my background: I'll be graduating in May with a bachelors in Computer Engineering. Starting in January I'll have an internship with a company that designs and builds instrumentation for the military and civilian aviation industry. The topics taken during university that were the most interesting to me were VLSI, computer organization, processor architecture, and other topics of that nature."

1tocs2,17,2013-12-25,Me [21 F] with my boyfriend [21 M] of almost 1.5 years- having a whole host of problems. Don't know what to do at this point,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1tocs2/me_21_f_with_my_boyfriend_21_m_of_almost_15_years/,"Disclaimer: I'm trying to as unbiased as possible here, but I'm sure it's still skewed towards my side. Here's to trying though.

His side: 
He thinks I've treated him like crap for the entire relationship. Main points include (from his perspective) insecurity with his ex, seeking other male attention, hating his family, too friendly with everyone (his main concern is that I'm friendly to men, but he admits I'm friendly with everyone in general). Oh and once I was drunk with my gay male best friend (although my boyfriend thinks him being gay is irrelevant) and I gave him a kiss. He is very worried (what I'd call paranoid) about any men who I ever go out to drink with or hang out with alone. He says it's because of my kiss with my gay friend and my friendship with people who like me, he has the right to be paranoid. 

My side: 
I was insecure with his ex and I do admit I picked many fights in the first half of our relationship over it. With regards to seeking other guys, these were male friends, some of whom I did hook up with prior to meeting my boyfriend, but who had been my confidants for a while. I get that he hates them though because they do still want me. I crossed the line by seeking advice from people who like me, but I don't think I ever flirted with them while I was dating my boyfriend. Today, he made me list out every person I've ever hooked up with at school before our relationship and then went through their facebooks and told me how pathetic and slutty I was for being with these people in the past.

Hating his family stems from a huge fight where his mom told me I was destroying their family (for no reason, she was mad over a fight she was having with him and not me) and the mom apologized to me but I guess I've held a grudge. I have a hard time because whenever he does something wrong (like for the past 3 days, he's kind of ignored me and promised to call/skype me but then doesn't), the conversation always turns to everything I've done wrong in the past.

The biggest issue: I had an abortion in July. I'm currently depressed over it. My boyfriend thinks I'm experiencing some sort of post traumatic stress disorder. I cry for days at a time. During the pregnancy, I believe he was very unsupportive at times. He would get angry at me when I was debating back and forth about what to do. He once said while he was angry that I'd ruin his life by keeping the baby. He now says that was just because he was angry and that he tried to be there for me as much as he could. A week or two after the abortion, he had to go on a family vacation to Bermuda. My pov is that the tickets were a sunk cost and I was alone in NYC for my internship and really needed his support afterwards. His pov was that it wasn't his choice and he had to go. I guess I've held a grudge towards him because I feel as though I got the abortion for him and not for myself entirely. I think I've started to really hate his family for trying to convince him to make me have an abortion and for making him go on vacation while I was alone and recovering from the abortion of their grandchild. Irrationally, I've really started to hate his sister I guess because I want him to experience the pain that I've felt these past 5 months.

I feel like I can't bring up anything he does wrong anymore. If I do, he just says I've been horrible to him for a year and a half. For the sake of the argument, let's just assume that I am some spawn of Satan as he called me today and that I've been horrible to him while he has treated me much better. I just don't think that we can go forward if he always says that whenever we fight.

I also feel like he doesn't take my depression seriously. I've tried to bring it up when we're calm and not fighting but he just kind of ignores what I say and responds with unsubstantive comments like ""Aw."" He stole the sonogram of the baby, which I kept in my special box of memorabilia, and threw it away although he says he didn't mean to throw it away. Today when we fought, he told me he hopes I'm infertile.

One last thing: we're very different people. I'm very social, love having friends around me constantly, going out, drinking, etc... He is EXTREMELY introverted, hasn't made any friends at our college b/c he enjoys playing video games in his room all day and doesn't like to go out and drink. 

How do we save our relationship?
---

**tl;dr**: Boyfriend thinks I've treated him badly for our entire relationship and holds this against me if I bring up anything he does wrong. Abortion has made me depressed and resent him. "

Three adults are downstairs preparing dinner in a large two level home. A four year old is locked in an upstairs bathroom. She cannot free herself. She begins to cry and after some time begins screaming. Eventually one of the adults downstairs, over the sound of cooking, washing dishes, talking and having the TV running, hears the child screaming. They all race upstairs. They free the child, who couldn't get out only because her hands had flour and butter on them from making sugar cookies. 

While calming the child, they discover that in the upstairs room next to where the child was trapped, is an adult who has been drawing. Working on an art project. The mother of the 4 year old is livid that the upstairs adult didn't go to the aid of the child. The upstairs adult says she didn't hear anything and seems flustered and out of sorts when questioned about her inaction. She then, almost immediately after questioning, invites the angry mother in to her room to view the art piece she's working on, seemingly disconnected emotionally from the actual moment and preceding emergency of the trapped child. 

The upstairs adult is my girlfriend and we have our own child, who happened to not be in that home at the time of this incident. 

Backstory:
My girlfriend and I lived together for over five years. We have a 3 and a half year old son. Recently she began a sexual relationship with a manager at her job where she is an intern. The manager is married. A few weeks ago she ended up leaving over this affair. 

Initially I was very upset. I felt deeply betrayed. The way she left was by staying out at a hotel with the man for 4 days. During this time she refused to let anyone know where she was. She also did not speak with me or our child. 

After four days, she returned home and told me that she thought I should move out and she and our son stay in the house we were renting. I disagreed and so she, as the leaving party, decided she would move. And now we get to the part where I need help. 

She is challenged with at the very least, ADHD and is HIGHLY distracted due to it. I am worried about her care of my son when she will have him alone. She is distracted to the point where most of our common friends understand her to be and referred to her as 'dingy', 'space cadet' or 'out of it'. She has stated that she wants a 50/50 custody arrangement with me. 

She tried to obtain an apartment for herself and our son to live in that was close to where I will be living with him but she was tricked out of her money by a low level scam artist. She lost, 700 bucks. After this, I helped her secure a room to rent with another family that we know through our child. They have a 4 year old daughter. She has only been renting with them for one week now. And already the aforementioned incident has occurred. I don't think she has any ill intent towards our son but him being with her 50% of the time is scary to me. He cannot yet tell me what kinds of things happen to him and she is so conscious of her limitations that I definitely CAN NOT trust her to reveal anything to me, no matter how important that might make her look bad. 

She has no family closer than 500 miles from us. She can't be reasoned with about her mental state and the potential dangers presented. 

I want to try and protect my son. What should I do?"

VJ is my initials.

I'm a junior at UH-D transferred from UT-Dallas. 
UT-D gpa was 2.9 and UH-D gpa from my first semester here is 4.0 (on resume). 

Currently I'm trying to apply for various internships under accountants, business analysts, project managers. I have limited work experience and haven't put past Kroger job and current Domino's Pizza delivery job on there.

Also, I won 1st place in a high-school 'University Inter-league' Accounting Competition in 2008. Wondering if and where to put that? Should I add a new section for it?

Any serious feedback is appreciated.

Update #1: [Imgur 1](http://i.imgur.com/G5m8Wgv.png)

I added more fill and moved Activities higher up as suggested. Do you guys think I should replace the word 'Activities' with something else? Any suggestions? 
Also, I listed both my Institutional GPA and my new Cumulative GPA. Which one should I delete and which one should I keep?

1tnu5y,9,2013-12-25,Girlfriend[20F] of 10 months came to me[21M] crying and apologizing for cheating. Lead to long discussion about the issues in our relationship. Looking for help.,eggsoversleazy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1tnu5y/girlfriend20f_of_10_months_came_to_me21m_crying/,"First, some details: my girlfriend and I are students at the same university, both studying similar programs.  Our relationship started off well, but during this past school year has gone through a rocky stretch, which I'll try to summarize here.

-Our studies and extracurriculars are very demanding on both of us, which means we sometimes have stretches of a few days where we don't see each other (we don't live together).  
-We've had sex once, but afterwards and said she that didn't want to do it anymore for religious reasons (she's Christian, I'm not religious).  Out of respect, I did not press the issue.  
-We've been together ten months now, but about three months were long-distance as she got a summer internship in Europe earlier this year.

Late last week, I got a text saying that I had to come over right now.  I get to her place, and she's clearly been crying quite a bit.  I ask what's wrong, and she tells me that after finishing her last exam, she went and got drunk with some friends, started texting one of her guy friends after getting home, invited him over and ended up hooking up with him (not sure what hook-up meant considering the not-wanting-to-have-sex-anymore thing, but I couldn't bring myself to ask). Her exams ended before mine, so I was still cooped up studying while all this happened.  I kind of just sat there shocked as she apologized profusely for doing it.

I told I her I was very hurt by this and asked why she did it.  An hour conversation later and to make a long story short, she said that because of the way I act, she feels like she's not actually important to me and that I'm not emotionally invested in the relationship.  She said that she feels I'm distant, which has caused her bottle everything up to an unhealthy level, making her an emotional wreck.  

To sum up, she thinks I'm pretty shitty at the whole boyfriend thing.  It's important I mention that she didn't blame any of this for the drunken incident and still apologized numerous times, but I eventually left feeling the strangest combination of hurt and guilt.

So now we're spending the next two weeks apart (we were going to be apart anyway, as I am away with my family for Christmas, and she went home to hers) as I try to piece together this whole thing.  

One part of me is pissed and hurt over the drunken hookup, especially because I've been drunk myself many times and never have nor never would do that to her (or anyone else for that matter).  

Another part sees how genuinely remorseful she was over the whole thing, and wants to forgive her and move on.  A related part is saying that this is my partially my fault since I do often come off as emotionally distant, even though I don't actually feel that way, and that's something I need to work on to be a better boyfriend.

A third part of me is sexually frustrated and feels like ""the spark"" that we had initially is gone and just wants to break up with her.

(I don't actually hear voices in my head haha, I just have a lot of conflicting thoughts).

At this point I've kind of decided that, if me being the way I am causes her so many emotional problems, it might be better off if we weren't together anymore.  I lost a lot of respect for her because of the hookup thing, and don't think I can ever really salvage that, even with forgiveness.

With that, what do you think, r/relationships?  I know it kind of sounds like I've made my mind up already, but I'd really like an outside perspective on the whole thing.

I'm from the US, so i was headed back over here to take my board exams and do residency here. She also wanted to come here as well.


It was all great for a couple of months, but then problems started. At that time, she had told me that she had just gotten out of a long term abusive relationship with a guy that had gone on for 4 years or so. She would flip out on me for little things, she would think i am ignoring her, or not caring about her. She flipped out about some girl i had sorta dated prior to her, who wasnt even in the country anymore, etc, etc. We had a lot of fights, we would make up, be fine for a couple of months, then fight again, and then make up again. Finally it came time for me to come back to the US and get started with studying for these exams, which if anyone knows, are really killer, especially for foreign grads. 


The fights started again, this time, it was more about how i wasnt talking to her enough, or about how i didnt ask specifically about how her day was going, or what she was doing, or how she was feeling, etc, etc. The first thing i would do whenever i would call her is ask about her and what she was doing. Bassically to tell me about her life...but she would just sit there, like a log, and just be like whatever, or nothing is happening. Other times it would be fine and we would be normal. She would say sorry and try to work on things. I also told her that i would try and communicate better, which i worked on. 



Unfortunately, these fights kept on happening. Her basic premise was that i ""didnt care about her"". I tried telling her, instead of flipping out, why dont you just tell me directly whatever it is...or if i talk too much, stop me and be like okay i need to discuss something with you, can you please make time for me. I would have been more than happy to do that, but no instead i had to babysit her and be the mind reader and pull everything out out of her head. All i wanted her to do was not flip shit, but it kept happening. She would be okay for a while, then fall back into this old pattern. I tend to talk a lot because i hate silence and i really dont know anyone back here in the States now, so i talk to whoever would listen. She thinks i didnt listen to her, but i did...but she didnt talk or would just say whatever half the time. Instead of telling me her problems directly, she always said ""You have to want to talk to me"", ""you have to want to change""...



Fast forward to last week, i had finished the first of my board exams and was busy with planning my vacation and helping my father with his office work when she was like...are you not going to message me (in fact i had been talking to her about random stuff and what not). I told her to please wait for a bit since i was busy and i would text (we use Whatsapp) her as soon as i can. Immediately she was like, ""Oh so you can only talk to me whenever its convienent for you huh"", ""You dont care about me and my issues"", ""do whatever"". I finally had it, i decided to just stop talking to her because it was the final straw with me. 



I didnt talk to her for a week, so as to clear my head and have some space, and i got back from vacation last night. This morning, i started off with a simple hey, but in about 10 minutes, she texted me a huge ass message saying that bassically i've given up and that i dont care about her anymore and that i dont respond to her, etc, etc...and that i've really hurt her and what not. 



Before i could say anything, she herself told me that she thought she was done with the relationship. After that, we had a huge fight in which i told her what i thought and that i cant be there for her in the way she wants me to. I didnt blame her for her personality but she wouldnt accept that. She wants to blame me and put everything on me i guess. She kept saying i gave up and that if i really loved her, that i would keep trying. Anyways, the whole thing ended with her being pretty bitter. I dont know why i feel terrible because ive tried so much, yet she never listened and she kept falling back into the same patterns. All i wanted her to do was listen, but she didnt do that. She was/is so needy and dependent and i dont have the time or patience to deal with that while i'm trying to get ready for a career in medicine, something she should have been doing as well. One minute she would insult me, next minute she would be like thank you for being there for me, i dont wish you any ill will, etc. 


I dont know how to deal with the fallout now; its like i've committed murder and i have to ""deal with the consequences"" now, according to her. She said that i deserved my ex (who cheated on me) for what i've done to her.

**tl;dr**: Needy/Dependent GF wouldnt change her old patterns, as much as she tried, i had to end things before it really got worse and affected my studies/professional life, but why do i still feel really bad about this? :(. "

 **828** readers for **6 Months!**

Most people know of hurricanes. You know, the giant storms from hell which are basically a big middle finger from mother nature. They destroy entire towns, destroy peoples’ posessions, and devasate entire regions. Each year, these storms affect people all around the world. This is why /r/TropicalWeather was created. This great group of redditors help predict, track, and cover storms and their aftermath.

This subreddit benefits all types of people, from the casual guy sitting at home checking on the tropics, to the person living in Miami whilst a hurricane or other tropical system is headed their way. The people who contribute to this sub are awesome and helpful as well, be they casual posters, or experienced meteorologists (yes, they post to this sub!).

Now for something personal. I grew up in the south, more specifically SE North Carolina, and I plan to move to Miami when im older to work at the National Hurricane Center. I was born in the late 90’s so I don’t remember Hurricane Fran or Floyd. From family accounts, however, it was horrific. Trees blown down everywhere, farms and roads flooded under feet of water, all that fun stuff.  We lost a ton of stuff at my grandma’s house in Carolina Beach, NC. Thank god all the important stuff was in the actual house for this scenario. Ive been through numerous minor hurricanes, but nothing major that I have memory of. But, the founder of this subreddit does, which he will talk about in the Q&amp;A.

 &gt;##1. Tell us a little about yourself!
 &gt;&gt; **_supernovasky_** I am a lifelong resident of the Gulf Coast in various locations in Louisiana. I was interested in tropical storms and hurricanes since I was only 4 years old. I remember sitting and watching the weather channel while most other kids sat and watched Saturday morning cartoons. When Andrew was forecast to hit my hometown, I told my parents and was the first one to let them know that we should evacuate. We lived on the coast at the time and I was learning some weather basics then, and saw that the center of the track went right over my home town. We boarded up and left. I remember the excitement that I felt then, and from then on loved weather in general, but especially Hurricanes and Tropical Storms. I've since grown to ""respect"" them with storms like Katrina and Gustav, but nothing will ever take away my awe for tracking and watching them.

 &gt;##2. How did you get involved in /r/TropicalWeather?
 &gt;&gt; **_supernovasky_** I have been a member of online forums for a long time that are dedicated to weather, specifically tropical weather. I started at storm2k.org, but also frequented the weather underground forums. Once I got more used to Reddit, I learned there was a subreddit for everything. Post-Hurricane Sandy, it became even more important that we have a central place to discuss tropical weather. So I typed in /r/tropicalweather, the first thing that came to mind, and noticed that this subreddit did not exist!
So I created it. I recruited mods from /r/weather, people who are very good at what they do and who have been tracking storms for a long time. There was a lot of excitement because a lot of other people had apparently been looking for the same thing, a centralized place to discuss tropical storms and hurricanes.
The subreddit is still in it's early days. I made it right before this tropical season, and for what it's worth, most forecasters would say that this past season was a tremendous bust. I advertised the subreddit on city/state subreddits when storms were heading there way, but there was an extreme lack of tropical activity this season, so the subreddit did not grow as much as it would have if we would have had a serious storm brewing. This is a good thing though, in my opinion, because it allowed us to come up with a solid user-base and add things like flair as well as find the best mods for the job so that we can be in full swing next hurricane season!

 &gt;##3. What's your favorite post so far?
 &gt;&gt; **_supernovasky_** Probably the posts leading up to Hurricane Karen's ""landfall. Hurricane Karen was only a Category 1, but for a lot of us who had absolutely nothing to track most of the season, we were excited for at least a little storm. For those who do not know about Hurricane categories, Cat 1 storms are as weak as Hurricanes come, but stronger than tropical storms. They are mostly just an excuse to take off work, although they can produce some dangerous conditions. As long as you are cautious, a Category 1 is nothing to worry about. Anyway... it summed up the season pretty well. It looked like it was heading right for my hometown, and then poof... just disappears before it has a chance to hit land.

 &gt;##4. What lesson have you learned from browsing / modding /r/TropicalWeather?
 &gt;&gt; **_supernovasky** It's been really fun to start a subreddit from scratch. I kind of wish we would have started a little earlier before the season started, but /r/tropicalweather is a challenging sub to keep going. This is always going to be the case when your subreddit is entirely based on something that is seasonal. There will always be a chunk of the year where absolutely no new tropical activity is going on, and so I like to post every now and then a ""post your favorite x"" type post to at least keep people coming back. However, once tropical season is on, a lot of cities link to our subreddit and people come to us for first hand information. Next tropical season, our subreddit will benefit from what was essentially a dry run this last tropical season. We look forward to having people join us next summer!

In conclusion, /r/TropicalWeather is hands down the best sub for everything pertaining to Tropical storms and hurricanes. Go subscribe to them, it will make the guys over at Tropical Weather and I happy.

my boyfriend broke up with me last night and I just need help or some sort of advice..I'm sorry it's a bit long

my boyfriend is from the netherlands and i live in the us. we have been together a little over a year and have been in a long distance relationship for 5 months. on January 23rd, he is flying to the city i live in. he had paid an internship company a lot of money to get an internship for 6 months in the city i live in to be with me. he was also going to live with me for free and maybe stay longer if offered a job or I would move to Europe with him. 

2 days before the breakup phone call, we had not spoken because the last time we were in the phone I had asked him if girls that have been hitting on him/ex girlfriend were at the bar he was at since they all used to work there together and since I left, have increased their advances.  he later yelled at me that I didn't trust him and he wanted an apology for asking the question. he also told me that he knows I'm ""working in myself"" so I need an objective viewpoint on the matter.  so after 2 days, he called me and asked me what I thought about the situation. I apologized for hurting his feelings, but did not apologize for the comment since I did not think that meant I mistrusted him. 

he then proceeds to get very angry with me and says that he always apologizes if he upsets me and that what he does is never enough for me and he puts in all the work in our relationship. then he contradicts himself and says we both tried out best effort and cannot make it work. he told me he will still come to America, but not as my boyfriend and he will ""look me up"" to return some items to me. he told me he would answer his phone if I had any questions after my emotions have settled down for a few days. when I told him I did not deserve this phone breakup and couldn't he at least skyped me he replied that there was never a good time/everything must always be done when time is good for me. 

I am devastated and shaking. I feel this is coming out of nowhere and was an incredibly callous and hurtful way to do this, especially 1 month before moving in and 1 night before Christmas Eve. 

should I call him and ask for a more detailed reason why he does not want to this anymore, or is that just more self degrading? if anyone has any perspective in this or advice on coping with a breakup please help me, I've been alone in my room all day and need help.

TL;DR: long term boyfriend broke up with me over phone exactly 1 month before moving from his country to be with me and live at my house..

1trmsw,3,2013-12-26,Please help! Confused and need advice!,red455hawk,askseddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/1trmsw/please_help_confused_and_need_advice/,"Alright, so this is my first time on this subreddit. I'm here because I'm in a pretty confusing situation. It may not be confusing to most, but I'm a total novice when it comes to romance and picking up signals. So here's the situation:

I had a class last semester with a pretty hot girl (at least to me) and towards the end of the semester we had a really good conversation for the first time and exchanged facebooks (she doesn't have a phone). We messaged back and forth for a while and then she asked me to go with her to a thing a friend of ours was hosting. 

I was kind of surprised she asked me, but I just assumed it was just because we shared a mutual friend. She seems like one of hose girls who is super friendly with everyone and comes off flirty even though she isn't so I didn't want to assume anything. 

Anyway we went to this event had fun, talked a lot, and then parted ways. I didn't message her for a few days because I didn't want to look too interested and I was also pretty busy with Christmas and all. 

So today she hits me up and we message back and forth then she asks about some piano lessons I mentioned to her last time we talked and she asks when we can set a date for me to teach her. And so tomorrow we're gonna hang out and play the piano.

My question is: do you think this girl may be romantically interested or just friendly? I have no clue. I'm also not really looking for a relationship right now that's why I haven't really pounced on the opportunity. 

I'm gonna be leaving the state for an internship next semester so this is really the most inopportune time for something like this. But she's really cute and there might be something there and I don't want to miss out. What do you guys think I should do to see if she's really interested?"

I responded to a Craigslist post about a software internship. I'm a high school student with no formal computer science education (except a few courses on Coursera and Udacity), so I was very surprised when I got a response offering me an interview for the internship.

I've never done a job interview in my life, let alone one for an internship at a software company (kids my age are getting jobs at McDonalds and Starbucks), so I have some questions. I would really appreciate it if you guys would help me out.

- This internship is in Sunnyvale, CA. As a high school student, should I expect to be paid for it? If so, how much? If not a real salary, should I expect to be paid for transportation costs?

- What should I expect in the interview? This startup is a mobile app development studio and I'm pretty good with Android development. I know its just an internship, but should I expect any advanced programming questions?

- Should I bring a printed resume? Business cards? 

- Any other tips you guys have? I'm really excited but very nervous.

1tr9ma,0,2013-12-26,Help me make the linux plunge,[deleted],linux,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1tr9ma/help_me_make_the_linux_plunge/,"I think that it might be time for me to switch my main operating system to Linux, and I would like some advice to help me take the plunge.


I grew up on Windows and have been using it my entire life (I'm in my 20's). Windows has been satisfactory for my computing needs over the years, but with each new version of Windows, Microsoft takes away more functionality and makes it less and less customizable. Additionally, I strongly disagree with the direction that the OS seems to be heading. In particular, I don't want an OS designed for a tablet, and I don't want a ""cloud based"" OS. I do not want to smudge up my screen with fingerprints, and my data and applications should be mine and should not require any reliance on Microsoft (or any other second party) to access them.

I fear that future versions of Windows will become unusable due to a combination of functional, aesthetic, and ethical reasons. I have been thinking this way for some time now, and I have been experimenting with different operating systems. I used a mac for one year in high school and found it to be rather insulting; it seemed to treat me like a child. This is also the direction that Windows seems to be heading, ""the user is incompetent, remove functionality until he cannot hurt himself"". In college I did a lot more coding and worked a lot with my university's RHEL terminal. Of course I had no administrative responsibilities on that system, and so I basically only learned to navigate the system and do basic tasks. My first exposure to a desktop version of Linux was Fedora, which I used for a summer internship (11 weeks). I got used to using the OS, but I had no admin privileges and everything was all set up for me. The next year I decided to get my feet a little wet and actually install Ubuntu on my laptop. I made an effort to try to use Ubuntu as my main OS, but the learning curve was too steep for me to keep up with schoolwork. There were too many things that ""just work"" on Windows that on Linux take hours and hours of digging, reading forums, trying faulty solutions, and asking for help to get working. For instance, I have an external monitor that I connect via HDMI. In Windows, I just plug it in and it works at native 1920x1080. But on Ubuntu I couldn't get it to use the full resolution without being distorted or flickering. It seems that every new piece of hardware or software that I want to use on Linux requires a full day investment at least to get working, and I typically don't know enough to actually get it working properly. Linux also seemed significantly slower than Windows: basic programs like Chrome would take one or two full seconds to start, whereas on Windows they start instantly. Anyway, it was too much to keep up with and so I have been using Windows 7 ever since.

My laptop is on the verge of 4 years old and has serious hardware issues, so it is about time for me to buy a new one.  I built my mom a new desktop recently and put Windows 8 (now 8.1) on it, and I can hardly stand to use it, so I don't want a new laptop with Windows 8. I don't want a mac for similar reasons. I am skeptical about putting Windows 7 on it since buying an out of date operating system leaves me open to support issues in the future (I may hold onto my new laptop for another 4 years). I think that it might be best to just take the plunge and switch entirely to some version of Linux.


Background info and preferences:

* Currently running Windows 7
* I want a fast, simple looking, logically designed operating system with little to no GUI ""fluff"". (I am using the Windows ""classic theme"" with a solid blue desktop background, reminiscent of Windows 98)
* I want built in customizability, e.g. lots of preference menu options. I do not want to have to code common tweaks myself. (E.g. moving the taskbar from the left to the bottom of the screen should not be an hour long project)
* I want lots of *optional* features and shortcuts. E.g. window snap to left/right, autoconnect to wifi, easy workspace management
 

My concerns about Linux:

* I need hardware to ""just work"". If I need to give a presentation on my laptop, I don't have time to get drivers and configure my OS for whatever projector happens to be there, I need it to work the first time, without fussing, every time. If I get a 2560x1440 native resolution monitor, will I be able to use the native resolution without problems?
* Compatibility issues. Do all of my commonly used applications have Linux counterparts? The majority of the people around me will be using macs and windows machines, will I be able to collaborate with them?
* Antivirus on Linux. Most places I look say antivirus isn't needed on Linux, giving unconvincing reasons like ""there just aren't many viruses for Linux"".

My computing needs (a list of my most frequently used applications):

* SumatraPDF (lightweight .pdf viewer)
* WinDjView (.djvu viewer)
* Chrome (internet)
* TeXworks (.tex editor)
* Mathematica (math computing)
* Thunderbird (email)
* Dexpot (workspace management)
* VLC (media player)
* Git GUI (version control software)
* Excel (spreadsheets)
* Powerpoint (presentations)
* PuTTY (SSH)
* Command Prompt (low level scripting)
* IrfanView (image viewer)
* gVim (text editor, coding)
* FileZilla (file transfer)
* eclipse (coding environment)
* mIRC (online chat)
* Dropbox (online storage)
* Skype (video calls)
* MATLAB (math computing)

Note: I am not a gamer, but viewing quality / screen resolution / audio and video smoothness / OS responsiveness is still an important factor for me.


What does reddit suggest for me? Your opinions on: which flavor of Linux to choose, where to buy a completely hardware customized Linux compatible laptop (~1500 USD range), addressing my concerns about Linux, whether you think I should take the plunge or stick with Windows, and any other Linux related advice is all appreciated. Also I realize that I have a lot of wants and that there may not be a single system that does everything that I want. I am willing to compromise, so feel free to suggest something even if it doesn't exactly fit what I described.

Advice I am *not* looking for:

* Cloud computing and tablets are the future, you should eat whatever Microsoft feeds you! (not that I expect anyone on /r/linux to think this)
* There is no such thing as simple *and* customizable.
* If you don't want to write your own kernel then you shouldn't choose Linux.
* Hardware and compatibility issues are part of the Linux experience, learn to love it!
* You aren't smart enough for Linux.


Thanks for your support!"

1tr6bs,1,2013-12-26,Advice with my future in accounting,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1tr6bs/advice_with_my_future_in_accounting/,"I recently graduated college with my undergrad in accounting.

1tr4v1,0,2013-12-26,I (22F) dont know whether to stay or move on from my boyfriend (26M) of 5+ years,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1tr4v1/i_22f_dont_know_whether_to_stay_or_move_on_from/,"My boyfriend's father left him just before he finished high school. He told him that he was going away for business. He had no idea that would be the last he heard from him. He was left with two younger brothers to look after and an unstable mother. On top of that, he found out that his father had also left behind a generous amount of debt, and being the oldest son of three, the responsibility to take care of his family and the debt was given to him. 


With the idea that his father would return, he went away to college after finishing high school. After his first year in college with no contact from dad, he came to the realization that dad would not be coming back so took a hiatus from his college education, went back home and worked full time to support his family and begin paying off whatever needed to be paid off. 


He eventually went back to school commuting from home while continuing to work part time. One of his younger brothers worked hard through high school, earning a full ride to a university out of state. This took some load off of him, but his youngest brother was still only beginning middle school and his dependent mom after the loss of her husband was having a rough time mentally, emotionally, and financially.


I met him when he was 21 in the midst of all the chaos. I was merely 17 and unaware of his difficult situation. He carried himself very well and you would have never guessed he was going through all of the shit his dad left behind. He’s charming and funny and friendly as hell. He’s just one of those guys that everybody likes. He’s hardworking – he’s learned to be independent and to do things for himself and to be the best at what he does. 


Obviously money has always been an issue for him. He has held numerous jobs, one of which being a dealer for the WSOP. He worked in several local poker halls prior to his Vegas gig and played himself, but I never knew the extremity of his gambling problem. You could only guess how helpful working in Vegas was… He ended up losing a ton of money, to the point where he couldn’t get a return flight home. He was at an ultimate low. Sooner or later, he made his way back home with the help of stealing and more gambling.  This whole story came about when the person he stole from contacted me. Needless to say, we went through the roughest patch of our relationship during this time.


We worked through the gambling and the lying. We have been dating now for 5+ years. He is currently 26 and holds a steady job at a consulting firm. His mom’s house was foreclosed earlier this year, so she and the youngest have had to move into a small apartment which is being paid for by the help of the aunt. I just recently found out that he lied to me about finishing school. He has yet to complete his undergrad, again due to financial reasons, but couldn’t get himself to tell me in fear of disappointing me and ultimately losing me. I (22), in contrast, come from a very supportive family and am blessed with parents who paid for my entire college education. I finished in the expected 4 years and am now completing an internship while taking classes that will count towards my masters. 


I don’t mind that he did not finish school. I am more upset over the fact that he lied to me and had me believe that he did. I would have been more that supportive and it’s saddening to think that he was uncomfortable talking to me about it. I am unsure of whether I should stick by his side even though he lied or if I should move on. He really is such a good guy at heart; he’s just been through a lot in life.


(This is me furiously typing, so the story may be disjointed. Feel free to ask questions for fillers.)

TL;DR Boyfriend (26) has had a rough life. We've worked hard to make our relationship work for 5+ years. He recently lied to me about finishing school in fear of disappointing/losing me. I (22/f) am not disappointed that he didn't finish school, but upset the he lied about it. Not sure what to do at this point - leave/stay?"

I am a 21 year old college student looking for the best steps, for both spending and investing, to have my financial outlook as positive as possible when I graduate in 2 years.

I went the community college route so I had zero debt coming into my first semester at a university this past August. A large issue is that my parents had no savings, so all of the money is coming from federal grants/ loans, but thankfully no private loans. At the end of the two years I'll be roughly $40k in debt. General bullet points are welcome as well.

EDIT:
This was poorly worded... I'll give a little more detail: I'm a Computer Science major so if all goes well I'll be well off right off of college. While I'm not currently working, to concentrate more on my grades, I've actively been searching for an internship for the summer.

I work for a small company doing some embedded systems development for an upcoming product. We just got a guaranteed order for $75,000 which will push this project more to the foreground. I really like this company and would like to continue working there after I came back if I left for the summer, especially because I will probably be studying here for 4 more years (double major CS and Mathematics)

There is another company (http://www.etcconnect.com/) that develops the most advanced and best lighting controllers in the world. I really like the company for many many reasons which I won't go over but I will say that it is my dream company. Dreams change of course, but for now it is what I want. I found they had an internship program in R+D and decided I should apply for it. I began the process months ago by getting on the phone with the VP of research and development. He told me to send my application directly to his office and I feel really good about this opportunity. 

If I apply I don't want my boss to get a surprise phone call from another company about me but I don't want to tell him I might be leaving a few months before the release of a project that I am the primary (only) committer for. It would leave him in a bad spot and might ruin the relationship I have with the company. 

How can I break the news to him with the least amount of damage? I would like to submit my application to ETC by Jan. 3rd or 4th at the latest. 

Thank you,

I am thinking of trying this, http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829700, about changing the registry.

Besides this, what could lead to this sort of slowdown? Especially when the previous workstation handled this like a champ despite being less awesome hardware.

Update 1: NIC drivers seem to be up-to-date and the right drivers. Still disturbingly slow when accessing network resources, some files being more slow than others.

Update 2: Windows 7 Professional, wired, previous workstation on same jack still works fine. Can access files on the data server just fine, save it be the one specific file in question. Every other non-new workstation can access can ""slow-ass-file"" fine, just not the CEO's workstation. The other new workstations access it fine too. Fracking frack frack frack frack frack. Did I mention it's a Dell OptiPlex 9020 that was reimaged by a third party?
Sorry on the sparseness once more.

1tqz8w,75,2013-12-26,Long time lurker... 138 days in. A success story of sorts?,thrownaway0042,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1tqz8w/long_time_lurker_138_days_in_a_success_story_of/,"SO. I finally decided to get a flair and post here about my story, what I've done, how far I've come, and where I'm headed. The only reason I'm posting is that I hope it's inspiring, others can relate, and because it's stories like this that got me here. I'm not a great writer, so I apologize if this is all over the place.
 
When I started NoFap back in August (can't believe it's been that long already), I had pretty much given up all hope of a relationship, connecting with other people, and always felt that I was disconnected from the rest of the world. I assumed I would be a virgin for life (I'm 22 years old now), and had pretty much accepted this fact. I had been fapping for almost my entire life (I started in elementary school - I was molested once. Over it now, but masturbating was something that stuck with me), and really didn't realize what I was doing with my life. I found this subreddit right before I started an internship, and after some extensive research, realized that so many of the ""symptoms"" applied to me. I up and decided to quit the next day.
 
 
 
 
First 2 weeks: 
 
by far one of the the hardest things I have ever done. The amount of self control you have to have over yourself is insane! I had never gone a week without PMOing, and over these two weeks all I could think about was how much I wanted to, and how great it would feel. These were also my first two weeks in the new city with my internship, and I think that helped - moving somewhere new allowed me to change habits.
 
 
 
First Month:

The habit changing was a huge part of this experience for me though. I  forced myself to do things that I've never done and never thought I would do- hanging out with random people from my school, joining a rock climbing gym (i have a fear of heights!), meeting new people at random social events, and even seeing a therapist (I cannot recommend this enough. seriously. I'm kind of neurotic and worry about how I come off to other people, and more than anything, he helped me come to understand myself and appreciate the things I am great at). I started going to the gym every. single. day. I looked up a workout routine for beginners and started this routine called 5x5, where I picked certain excersizes and had to do 5 reps of increasingly heavy weights. I can tell you more about it if you'd like, but this combined with rock climbing regularly helped change my body from undefined and awkward blob into a slightly toned mush (I'm not embarrassed about my body anymore, which is key). In terms of urges over this time, since I was working out so much I would get home and actually be tired, and not use PMO to fall asleep. I also recommend the rock climbing because it's something you do as a group- during this time I made a lot of new friends and definitely improved my social skills, not to mention all the physical benefits as well. 
 
 
 
2 -3 months- flatline/crazy emotions:
 
So around this time, i still continued to go to the gym very regularly.  However I stopped having sexual urges completely. I did notice I was checking out girls a lot though- something I have never done in my life as I was too shy to  even make eye contact. Now I didn't really care. I think during this time, it wasn't that I was depressed, but that I finally realized all of what I was missing. It's incredibly difficult to put this concept into words, but I was definitely living in a fog for my entire life, and these two months I was sort of emerging from it, and was so, so sad at how much time I wasted not being social and not meeting people. It wasn't that I was depressed about not having sex, it's more that I realized how much I pushed people away my whole life instead of inviting them in. This realization phase was the worst, and made me feel terrible about myself. I would even tear up for no reason during the day, and at random times when out drinking too.
 
 
 
Months 4-5 (to the present):
 
After a while I stopped being sad with myself and sort of moved on. I made a conscious decision to try and flirt with girls- on the bus, in line, wherever. failed each time. But I now had a group of friends I climbed with, cool roommates to hang out with, and fun parties and social events through my work. There are actually quite a few students from my school interning out here, and I met this one girl at a picnic we set up. We started talking and stuff, and after a few weeks we went on an actual date. The past month has been a whirlwind for me- we've gone on dates, she's actually really into the geeky things I'm into, and we talk like old friends. 
 
 
 
 
trigger warning?
 
Also, I've now had sex :) I feel really bad that I'm so late to this game, and know that at 22, I'm well past the curve of what's normal here in the US. But she's totally cool with that, and in fact I think she likes teaching me things and showing me how to do moves and positions. I absolutely suck at it! Before we had sex, we actually went on a camping trip, and we were alone together in the back of an SUV for the night- she started to dry hump me and I, since I haven't orgasmed in months literally jizzed my pants (just like the song...). I don't think she knew, but I definitely prepared myself for the fact that I would not be lasting long in bed - I guess I have P.E. a little bit, as the feelings are absolutely crazy. We've had enough sex that I can last a little longer now, and kind of just keep going post-orgasm. If you have any good tips for beginning sex/moves I would really like them!
 
/end trigger
 
 
 
So that's my story. I seem to have found a relationship with an absolutely gorgeous girl, made lots of friends, starting cooking and eating healthy, and found hobbies. I don't think any of this is attributable to ""super powers"", and is far more because of my need to fill time with things to do that are not PMO. I also learned to be selfish- I always thought I was being nice by giving in to whatever other people needed. I stopped worrying about others, and focussed completely on improving myself. When you find a hobby (like rock climbing, for example), not only does it give you something to do, but it makes you an interesting person with something to talk about. I dread those silent moments alone with people- now I can just bring up rock climbing or cooking, and instantly people are interested. 
 
 
 
I don't think I'm healed or anything in any meaningful way- I more have accepted who i am, and what I need to do to be the person I want to be. My goal for the upcoming semester is to become an athlete - I have always been the pudgy one, and am now halfway between normal and super in shape (ran 7 miles yesterday! I couldn't even finish the mile in high school...). My goal is no longer don't masturbate for 90 days, it's instead to be super toned, and to do activities that lead to that. I hope that I am past the PMO thing, but we'll see what lays ahead.
 
 
 
I hope this inspires someone, and if you have any questions about my journey/what worked for me/what a therapist is like (my experience)/how to rock climb/other things, please ask. I feel like I was able to turn my life around, not without some serious emotional stress, and am on the road to being the person I've always wanted to be.
 
 
 
go team! you can do it!"
1tqyok,1,2013-12-26,I shall not be the only one.,Fabinout,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1tqyok/i_shall_not_be_the_only_one/,"Hello mates!  
As I visited this mighty sub, I remembered a story that happened 5 years ago.  
A young intern (me) worked at the tech support of a small IT company.
Their job was focused on providing machines and softwares to customers. Customers would almost only be small businesses and that typical customer would not be savvy at all. 
We thus sent technical sales engineers to them (they weren't technically engineers, but they had the title), who would try to solve the issue, and send us the broken hardware if that was the cause of it. We had to repair, replace or reset items before sending them back.

Fast forward to this day, the almighty engineer sends us broken hardware, just a screen, for repair or exchange. With a little note ""Broken screen"".
I try it on my computer, screen's dirty, but it works. It works quite well actually. I check everything. Everything works like a charm. I phone call the dude, who explains to me that the screen was totally broken and always displayed a blue screen. 

I shit you not. He saw a BSOD, sent back the screen, and left the desktop computer.

As I was in the job for a few month during summer, I suppose every tech support must have already faced this mistake. If you did, how much common is this mistake?"
1tquv3,0,2013-12-26,"I'm at the verge of a career identity crisis, and could use some inputs.",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1tquv3/im_at_the_verge_of_a_career_identity_crisis_and/,"Background: Currently active-duty military officer with 2 years in, got my B.S in Comp Sci before I joined, and my M.S in Industrial Engineering (IE) while I was in. The field that I am currently in is Operations Research (OR), and the military has paid for me to get several professional certs related to this career.


The problem I have is this: I'm unsure if I want to continue down the OR or IE track, or revert back to a CS-related career once I get out of the military. From my own personal research, it seems like the OR/IE career fields are small and less financially-rewarding than a CS career, and a vast amount of the OR/IE-related jobs out there are in the government in some shape or form.


If I continue down my current career track, I would most likely go into consulting as that's what a lot of Industrial Engineers do. However, the average salary difference between an Industrial Engineer and a Software Engineer is pretty big. At the same time, I don't feel like my experience in the military has adequately prepared me for an IE career in the private sector (my academic experience is pretty broad but my actual job uses very superficial analytic concepts).


However, if I try to go back to a CS-related field when I separate from the military, I'm afraid of starting at square 1 at 28 years old. I've had 2 internships relevant to the field in college, but that was almost 4 years ago, and I'm afraid that my skills will get rusty by the time I get out.


My current plan for the next 2 years (when my active-duty commitment ends) is to catch up on my programming skills (I mainly used Java and C++), while continuously making sure that my OR academics don't get rusty since I never get to use it. I'm thinking of taking additional grad-level courses in CS but I'm unsure of just how much more that will benefit me career-wise.


To be honest, if the average salary difference and the job market outlook between the two career fields weren't that big, I wouldn't be worried about this right now. 


So my big questions to you guys are: What are some things I can do now to ensure that I can be competitive in the private sector once I exit the military, what additional decision-making factors should I consider, and what would you do in my current position?

Thanks.

1tqan9,0,2013-12-26,Would you Hire Me?,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1tqan9/would_you_hire_me/,"A little info about me-
-I've got a 3.7 GPA
-I'll be transferring to a TIER 1 state school for the fall semester- probably will take me 2 years to finish my BS in accountancy. (I'd probably be done by now had I not gotten into all that trouble)
-I've been in college since I was 17 (Graduated a year early-didn't drop out)
-I've been married (faithfully) for three years now, and I've lived on my own (with her) since I was 18.
-I hope to get some internships while I'm going through my undergrad program.

Now the problems I need to Overcome:
I've gotten two MISDEMEANOR DUIs. One when I was 18. The second, 7 months later (which also violated the probation for the first) So I also have a Contempt of Court Charge as a result of that. Can I still become a CPA?? How about Getting into Law school?? Just searching for some valuable insight. Does having two DUIs on your record from your teenage years screw you for life?? 

I really don't have any decent job experience yet- those duis have really kept me down- won't be able to afford car insurance until 5 years after conviction date (i fought the 2nd for a year) so I won't be able to afford insurance on a car until the year I graduate college.. so i've just worked what jobs I could find in the mean time while I've been plugging away at school. This tax season I'll be filing taxes for a local (employer similar to H+R Block, but not HR Block). 

I should be able to get some internships though, I have strong people skills and my teachers tend to enjoy speaking with me, and oftentimes I lead class discussions (In a good way).

I'm considering becoming an enrolled agent while I'm working through undergrad-just something else to put on a resume-- and from what I've been told EAs are experts on Tax Law whereas CPAs are experts on Financial Statements, so the added tax experience would look good for me.

If no firm will hire me then I'll start my own... thats the type of mentality I have-I don't give up.  ANYONE got any advice for me?? 

Were you able to get hired by a Big 4 firm with a criminal conviction??? or a mid-level firm?? I'm 21 now and by the time I get out of college with undergrad I will be 24-I don't know if I'll work for some experience then get my masters or just get my masters then try to get my graduates degree (This is assuming I don't get accepted into law school right away after undergrad- if ever).

Please gimme some advice any/everyone!!!


Also, don't most of the questions regarding convictions ask for crimes that you have been convicted of within the past x number of years?? 5-7 usually right??

I'd like to point out that in my state .02 gets you a DUI if your under the age of 21... Which was the case in my 2nd one... I think they nailed me on it because they knew it was my 2nd... I'm not even going to sit here and make the post about how arbitrary that is. But theres no way my employer would even be able to see what my BAC was from back then would they? 


Its the same charge as if I had blown a .12 or if I'd been high on some illicit drug... DUI/DWI (and yes, they are the same charge-I don't know if I agree with that but they are the same charge despite what a lot of people think-at least in my state)

Please upvote so more people can read this-- I've read a lot of posts where people have asked similar questions, and I think a lot of people could benefit from seeing my situation--its about as bad as it gets without getting a felony-- and also shows that I've worked hard to ""rise above it"" -- with good grades and commitment-- and ITS HARD to get through school without a car and living on your own-- maybe thats why I feel like I've paid my penance-- almost"

I've been doing my PhD for over a year and I'm fed up with the job and the field in general. I want to do something else.

For my MSc thesis I taught myself LaTex and loved the process of learning it. In fact, it was the most enjoyable aspect the whole thesis. Ever since, I thought that I should give programming a whirl.

Two weeks ago I finally gave it a shot with hour of code. Then I moved on to start the Python course at codecademy and fell in love with it. Since, I have spent 2-6 hours a day, practicing python. While I'm no genius, it does come not come difficult to me. I find myself completely immersed and have no problem putting in hour after our. I learn python because it's been recommended as a great beginners language that helps you grasps the concepts of coding.

I put codecademy on hold at 60% because a lot of time instructions and explanations were poor. I moved on to 'learning python the hard way', 'python programming for the absolute beginner', googles python class videos and the new boston tutorials. I'm doing a lot of exercises to make sure I've understood everything. **Sometimes I feel like I should be learning more new material instead of perfecting things I've learned.** I also made my own little program, a calculator for molecular biology applications.

So that's what I've been doing so far. Here's my future goals:

1. 'Finish' python. That means knowing the content of at least one book from cover to cover.

2. Take the harvard CS50 course online. Without the 350 dollar certificate.

3. Learn Javascript, HTML and CSS on Code Avengers + books

4. Make my biology calculator as an android app

5. Be good enough for an internship at a software developer

6. Quit my PhD (maybe 6-8 months from now IF I found an internship)

7. Find a job in programming

This probably sounds ludacris but I've never wanted something so much in my life. I'd greatly appreciate any advice you could offer, any insights you could provide. If you have questions for me, I'm glad to elaborate on everything.

1tq6vr,1,2013-12-26,I want some sleep,Pharmaki,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1tq6vr/i_want_some_sleep/,"This one has been bugging me for a while. 

To give you a quickly give you my background: 23y/m who just started his PhD. Lifelong athlete / triathlete. And I want to finally get some sleep :/ 

So the story began last winter when I had my first real internship, where I had to work from 7 to 3. Which having double trainings per day anyway meant I had to squeeze in one before work and one after work. Also the job wasn't what I wanted, nowhere near the research field I wanted to work in but nevertheless obligatory by my university programme. To make things worse in a way, my parents asked me to find a job near where they live, so I could at least spend 4 more months living at home (I was only visiting for weekends since I was 15 as I always went to school somewhere else) to spend some time with them (and given that they have lost one son I thought it would be a good idea) before I changed the country again. In those 5 months I lost contact with most of my friends, since I lived in a semi-rural place,  from which it took me at least an hour to get anywhere I wanted. That further led in a semi depression that I now that I am on my own again went away. I can honestly say I'm happy its just this sleep thing that I can't fix. 

What happened is, because I had to train at 5AM I started to wake up at 1 to eat a light breakfast, go back to bed and train. I think it was that and the slight depression - but honestly now I'm happy. I'm still more or less a loner like I started to be when I did the internship, but I don't mind it. I thought it would be temporary, but a year later I found myself in a vicious circle. Even though I now usually do my trainings later, and could easily sleep from 10 PM to 5AM, have a bannana/porrige and go for a run/swim I wake up at 1 to eat. And thats even on my off days. Now since it is christmas, I went to visit my parents again for a week and things even got worse with me waking up every hour of the night (and the house is silent!).  Even though I'm not even training as hard I keep on waking up every two hours after I fall asleep. Somehow I feel like I don't even get a proper sleep. It's more like a state of not being fully awake and it's killing me. I tried changing nutrition, going from carb based to protein, mixed and so on but it's not helping. I also tried cutting out caffeine (which I don't drink after five anyway). Only thing that really helped for a while was smoking pot when I am at my place, but I have a slight fear of getting addicted. Being in the medical profession, I know what antidepressants and sleep medicine do to you, so I'm not even considering it. "

He told him that he was going away for business. He had no idea that would be the last he heard from him. He was left with two younger brothers to look after and an unstable mother. On top of that, he found out that his father had also left behind a generous amount of debt, and being the oldest son of three, the responsibility to take care of his family and the debt was given to him. 


With the idea that his father would return, he went away to college after finishing high school. After his first year in college with no contact from dad, he came to the realization that dad would not be coming back so took a hiatus from his college education, went back home and worked full time to support his family and begin paying off whatever needed to be paid off. 


He eventually went back to school commuting from home while continuing to work part time. One of his younger brothers worked hard through high school, earning a full ride to a university out of state. This took some load off of him, but his youngest brother was still only beginning middle school and his dependent mom after the loss of her husband was having a rough time mentally, emotionally, and financially.


I met him when he was 21 in the midst of all the chaos. I was merely 17 and unaware of his difficult situation. He carried himself very well and you would have never guessed he was going through all of the shit his dad left behind. He’s charming and funny and friendly as hell. He’s just one of those guys that everybody likes. He’s hardworking – he’s learned to be independent and to do things for himself and to be the best at what he does. 


Obviously money has always been an issue for him. He has held numerous jobs, one of which being a dealer for the WSOP. He worked in several local poker halls prior to his Vegas gig and played himself, but I never knew the extremity of his gambling problem. You could only guess how helpful working in Vegas was… He ended up losing a ton of money, to the point where he couldn’t get a return flight home. He was at an ultimate low. Sooner or later, he made his way back home with the help of stealing and more gambling.  This whole story came about when the person he stole from contacted me. Needless to say, we went through the roughest patch of our relationship during this time.


We worked through the gambling and the lying. We have been dating now for 5+ years. He is currently 26 and holds a steady job at a consulting firm. His mom’s house was foreclosed earlier this year, so she and the youngest have had to move into a small apartment which is being paid for by the help of the aunt. I just recently found out that he lied to me about finishing school. He has yet to complete his undergrad, again due to financial reasons, but couldn’t get himself to tell me in fear of disappointing me and ultimately losing me. I (22), in contrast, come from a very supportive family and am blessed with parents who paid for my entire college education. I finished in the expected 4 years and am now completing an internship while taking classes that will count towards my masters. 


I don’t mind that he did not finish school. I am more upset over the fact that he lied to me and had me believe that he did. I would have been more that supportive and it’s saddening to think that he was uncomfortable talking to me about it. I am unsure of whether I should stick by his side even though he lied or if I should move on. He really is such a good guy at heart; he’s just been through a lot in life.


(This is me furiously typing, so the story may be disjointed. Feel free to ask questions for fillers.)

TL;DR Boyfriend (26) has had a rough life. We've worked hard to make our relationship work for 5+ years. He recently lied to me about finishing school in fear of disappointing/losing me. I (22/f) am not disappointed that he didn't finish school, but upset the he lied about it. Not sure what to do at this point - leave/stay?

1tua6m,7,2013-12-27,Moving to Houston soon and have some questions about specific areas!,Ereyn,houston,https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1tua6m/moving_to_houston_soon_and_have_some_questions/,"I'm from Oklahoma and will be moving to Houston this summer!  My boyfriend and I are both engineers starting new jobs in the area after graduation in May.  

I have been trying to research where we should live for months, but let me tell you, it certainly is a headache when you aren't knowledgeable about the area.  I lived in Clear Lake last summer for an internship, so I'm not completely clueless, but it's still overwhelming.  I would really appreciate being able to talk to you guys.  And I have done a lot of research and read all the newcomer threads, but they all seem to say the same general, somewhat unhelpful information about each neighborhood, so I'm hoping to get more details.

We've basically been looking at living in the loop on the West side of the city.  I guess I mean somewhere around River Oaks, Rice Military, Heights, or Midtown.  My main concerns are living somewhere safe that's on a nice enough street to walk around and go to some restaurants, preferably where my boyfriend won't get his brand new truck broken into that he's going to buy before we move, since neither of his cars have air conditioning and probably wouldn't survive the drive down.  We need to rent, and the high end of our budget is $2500, so hopefully we can find what we need.

Specifically, here are my questions for you guys.  We like some places located [here](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=2000+bagby+street&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=dg6-UrLSL8qFyQGu14HIDQ&amp;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAg).  I've creeped on street view and it seems nice enough.  Is this a safe/nice area to be in?  Anywhere nearby to avoid?  

We've also been looking up on W Dallas Street, between River Oaks and downtown.  Any comments about that area? 

My boyfriend keeps trying to look at places in the East Downtown area because they are a bit cheaper, but from my research it sounds like it's not as safe, and I don't see anything about it on the newcomers thread.  Is it unsafe in general?  I seem to remember driving through it after a Astros game I went to and seeing sketchy people sitting on curbs outside old buildings/houses.

Thanks.  I really need someone to talk to about this."

1tu4nq,3,2013-12-27,Me [26 M] was emotionally cheated on by my [26 F]. 5 1/2 year relationship ending.,hetres,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1tu4nq/me_26_m_was_emotionally_cheated_on_by_my_26_f_5/,"I came to this very helpful subreddit looking for help a few days ago when I found out. 

http://bu.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1tq2mo/me_26_m_with_my_girlfriend_26_f_of_5_and_12_years/

I am back again so soon as I have some worries and questions that I am hoping someone can help me with.

Shortened Overview:

* Discovered infidelity by accident Christmas night after dinner with her brother and my parents
 
* Stayed up all night at parents hotel and discussed with dad

* Thursday talked to her face to face after her work

* Woke up Friday and chatted some more (I stayed in our apartment with her, slept separately)  

* Received a facebook reply from the guy she has been seeing and it just made me angry as it revealed things I did not know (not physical cheating, but things she hadn't admitted and outright lied about)  This made me angry and after a flurry of texts to her she started getting upset at the hounding.

* Stopped messaging her and we agreed to talk after work and/or Saturday morning.  I am going to go out to dinner with my parents when she gets out of work and return to our apartment later (I am most comfortable sleeping there)

I have been reading a lot of stories and posts here in /r/relationship and in the old /r/breakups.  It is pretty clear to me that no matter how much I love her, we are through, and it is probably the best for me.  She appears has no interest in staying with me anyway.

My questions:

* How do you all find the strength to start moving on.  I mean finding places to live, returning to your usual work schedule, etc. etc.  I just feel overwhelmed with this depression?

* Do these things ever work without ""No Contact"" rule?  We have two dogs.  I love them both, but one of them I would consider more mine than hers.  She definitely favors one, I favor the other.  She got the dog I favor at an internship while we were dating and adopted her (the dog).  She works with animals and has some ins so *most* of the treatment, bills, and documents for these dogs are in her name; legally the dog is hers.  We have even talked about it before (during old troubles) and she says there is no way in hell she would give up the dog to me.

I love this dog, have had it for 4 years, and really can't imagine myself without the dog.  I know no matter what happens I just feel like I will want to see the dog after.  The dog is an incredibly important part of my life.  I just can't imagine living without her. (much as I thought about the girlfriend...)

* Finally, reading tons of the stories here, it makes me feel better knowing that many of you have gone through similar situations--or worse--and come out the other side, but...your stories also scare the shit out of me.  I obviously feel like I can't trust anyone right now, but hearing about all these people being blindsided by cheating, lying, devious significant others **fucking terrifies me!**  It scares me to think how I can ever trust anyone and that *most* of you people out there (at least the average ones) are going to hurt me.  Badly.

**tl;dr**: Scared about finding strength, about no contact, and about moving on."
1tu4dv,7,2013-12-27,I [22 M] was cheated on by my girlfriend [23 F] of three years. Want some guidance.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1tu4dv/i_22_m_was_cheated_on_by_my_girlfriend_23_f_of/,"Some background: My (ex)girlfriend and I met during our freshman year of college and began dating at the very end of that year. 

Throughout our relationship, we had our differences and 
some problems would arise, but we were really good about settling them and not going to bed angry. I can only think of two times that we slept on our issues. The first was about a year into our relationship and it was scary, but I think we got through it. It doesn't seem pertinent to this, so I'll leave it out for now. The second time it happened was in January. To explain this, I need to say that I am an introvert and going to the bar to listen to a band and dance isn't my first choice on what to do to have a good night. Anyway, my girlfriend and her sister and their friends get a kick out of doing such things and my girlfriend always wants me to join, but I don't join every time because it's not my cup of tea. Also, we have a history of getting in arguments when drunk(mostly because she would misinterpret things I did and said as mean things. She once started a several hour argument over the phone after I said ""I love you"" because she thought I was going to hang up. She has no memory of this happening.). I decide to join one night because I haven't gone dancing with my girlfriend in a while and I know that will make her happy and I want to spend time with her and such. So we get all drunk at her and her sister's place before walking to the bar. Then we go to the bar and get more drinks and talk a bit outside before the girls decide its time to hit the dancefloor. There's some 80s coverband playing and the lead singer absolutely disgusted me. He was wearing tight pants to show off a bulge and was trying to get girls in the crowd to come on stage and strip or suck on lollipops in a seductive manner. No girls in the crowd were going along with it, but people are dancing. I had followed the girls  I came with onto the dancefloor so I had to look around a bit to find my girlfriend. I found her and walked up behind her, tapped her on the shoulder and smiled at her when she turned around. I began my awkward attempts to dance with her and she just turned back around and took a step away. I was confused so I moved closer to her and she stepped away again. So I moved closer again and she pushed me away this time. So I was hurt and confused and then Mr tight pants on stage started (unsuccessfully) doing his thing to get girls on stage to suck on a lollipop. My girlfriend was dancing by herself and I felt like such a damn fool that she wouldn't dance with me. So I get closer again to talk to her and she pushes me away again and then runs away. Her sister and friends follow her and I'm left there feeling like a jackass. So I followed her. I walked up to her and just leaned forward and said, ""Why won't you dance with me?"" Her response, ""YOU'RE A BITCH!"" Without thinking, I reacted to that by smashing my head into the cinderblock wall next to us. Repeatedly. Until I'm suddenly being drug out the door and thrown on the sidewalk.



 My girlfriend runs out after me crying and her friend follows and they pick me up off the sidewalk. I shook them loose and ran down the street until I fell over and my friend (I just realized I forgot to mention that my friend was along on this outing) gets on top of me to stop me from running away. The rest of the night is trivial. I didn't see my girlfriend until the next morning, and she had a bruise on her knee. Apparently she fell on her knee when I shook free from her grasp and ran away. I had to tell her about her refusing to dance with me and calling me a bitch because all she remembers is me getting thrown out and then ""hurting her"". Great, this was all my fault until she talked to me.



So, as you can imagine, this was a huge reason for the both of us to be very scared of our relationship. I was scared because my girlfriend creates controversy a majority of the time she gets drunk. It had been trivial shit until that night. She's scared because I don't respond to her drunk shenanigans in a healthy way. My thought is that I wouldn't have smashed my head into a wall if this sort of thing were a one time occurrence, but she always created friction when she got drunk. Hell, we once went to a similar sort of thing and had a fantastic time together. When we left, she was mad at me before we got 20 yards away from the door and she can't tell me to this day why she was mad at me.



Anyway, we both wanted to be with each other so we tried to move on. For some reason, my girlfriend thinks we needed space and so whereas I was used to seeing her daily and sleeping in the same bed with her at least 4 days out of the week, our relationship turned into us seeing each other mostly only in passing and the few occasions that we would hang out, she didn't want to have sex. She would go to the bar with friends a lot over hanging out with me. She would jump at any excuse to not hang out with me. But she claimed it was all to keep our relationship alive and she told me that she wasn't cheating on me. Keep in mind that we had talked before and I was cool with her dancing with other guys but not kissing or sex or anything like that. She had brought up trying an open relationship before, but I told her I wasn't comfortable with that. I trusted her. But damn, I felt like she was probably doing something I wouldn't approve of.



Spring semester was both of our last semesters and at the very end of it, my girlfriend invites me over to her place and tells me that she completely regrets keeping me at a distance. I tell her it's ok. I felt that pushing me away wasn't healthy for our relationship but I couldn't convince her otherwise so I was happy that she had realized that. We have makeup sex and we at least spend a little bit of time together every day until she moved back to her parents house. She was about to go 14 hours away (by car) to do an internship and I was staying in our college town to live out my lease on my place while I looked for a job. A couple weeks after she had gone to the internship, we met up at her parents cabin in the mountains and spent time together with her family. I lined up a job interview while I was there. Also, about a month before she was to come back to our state, we met up again at a cabin that I rented. And we had a romantic getaway for a weekend. I moved to a new city(for the job I lined up the interview for on the last cabin trip) in our state the week after I returned from that second cabin trip. All in all summer was pretty good, except for my girlfriend bringing up the open relationship thing again while we were at the first cabin and not understanding why I would break up with her if she were to ""merely have sex with someone else"".



So here I am living in a new city where I don't know anyone, just working and waiting for my girl to come back because it seems our relationship is going good. One morning I wake up to a text of ""there's something I need to tell you."" I felt pretty good about our relationship, but I just knew she was about to tell me about the hundred guys she's fucked in the past 7 months. She tells me the story slowly... she went to some festival or something and got drunk one night. She left her tent because she thought she was going to vomit and ran into another intern who was a guy. They started talking and whatnot. She said that eventually he kissed her and she ""didn't stop it immediately"" which I guess means she was sucking face for 20 minutes. She said she felt really bad. I was hurt, but, in a way, I felt relieved because she did not hide it from me at all. I figured she couldn't have had sex with hundreds of dudes over the past 7 months because she didn't keep this information from me. 



That was about a week before she was to drive back to our state and stop by my new place on the way to her parents (I live about an hour and a half from her parents). I figured she felt bad so the worst was behind us and we could just move on when she returned home. Well, I woke up the day before she was supposed to come home to ""I wrote you a letter and sent you the text document on facebook."" Right away, I knew she did something stupid. The document she sent me said she had sex with someone the previous night, and it ended really quickly because she started crying. The rest of it was her apologizing for not treating me correctly and her feeling sorry for getting herself in a shitty situation. 



Basically, that has been our relationship since then. I let her come by my place still on the way to her parents, and we had sex four times in 12 hours, but I told her I didn't want to be with her. After that I didn't talk to her for a while. Not for lack of her wanting to talk to me either. She sent me messages and called me every day for the longest time, and I would just ignore her. I figured I should do what the default response to cheating is on her: cut her out of my life. Well we dated for three years and cutting her out of my life entails not just cutting her out, but other people that I had gotten close to such as her sister and her parents. It was painful and I was going along with it. I was trying to meet new girls... I got a number from a girl but she was 19 and married. I wasn't about to fuck with that kind of infidelity. I made out with another girl who my brother's friend is dating. Their relationship is toxic, and as dumb as it sounds, I did it to demonstrate to my brothers friend that this girl isn't worth his time. But he still keeps her around despite her punching him and throwing things at him and making out with me. And, most recently, I asked a girl out and got turned down because she had a boyfriend. 



All the while, my girlfriend is asking, begging really, for me to just talk to her or see her. I won't talk to her except to tell her that I feel like shit and it's all her fault. 



So I'm talking to some people I work with and I learn that a female coworker of mine is married and has kids with a guy who she has dated on and off and they both have had sexual partners other than each other in the time that they've known eachother, although they are monogamous now. I also learn that one of my male coworkers is about to get married to a girl he has cheated on in the past. They stopped dating for about a year, but I guess made up and now are getting married. So it seems to me that infidelity isn't always nails in the coffin to a relationship. And even though I feel like shit because of my girlfriend, being an ass towards her doesn't make me feel any better and knowing she's hurting because I'm ignoring her also makes me feel like shit. 



I start warming up to her a bit... I told her that I realized I was being an ass and that I felt bad about it. But I'm just reciprocating how she makes me feel. She still wants me to see her or call her or something, but I can't bring myself to do it. Then I go back to being cold toward her because I'm scared of her and of being with her. And I'll warm up again and go cold again... so on and so forth until actually seeing her in person seems within the realm of possibilities. 



And that leads me to the recent past. I drove to the city my parents live in for xmas and that entailed driving through the city my (ex)girlfriend lives in with her parents. She knows I'm driving thru so she asked me to come see her. I told her I might not be ready for that, but I would call her at the very least. So I waited until I had driven past where I would turn to go see her and then I called her. I told her on the phone that I believe I want to see her, but I can't just stop by to say hi in the middle of my 5 hour car drive. I ask her then if she wants our relationship to continue. She says she isn't sure. Then I asked if she had slept with anyone else since she came by my place in August, and she says that she got close, but no. Essentially, that's where I'm at. I would have slept with my brother friend's girlfriend if she had been game. Am I the only one who finds it depressing that his abusive girlfriend wouldn't cheat on him, but my apparently loving girlfriend did cheat on me?



So here we are on an almost level playing field I guess. We both don't know if we want this relationship to continue, but she wants to see me and I'm open to that so it seems like we're both open to working through this. She hasn't had sex with a hundred dudes in the past 4 months, so there's no behavior from her that makes me jealous. I'm hurt from being cheated on, and she feels bad for cheating on me. 



There is one point though that I'm hung up on. It's the number of partners each one of us has had. In my time, I have had sex with two people. My girlfriend just chalked up #8 over the summer. Towards the beginning of our relationship, I felt a little uneasy about being her 7th because we both lost our virginities in high school in relationships that we ended at the end of senior year. That means in the exact same amount of time that I was unsuccessfully chasing girls freshman year, she had sex with five people. I was fine with this disparity in our number of partners in the past because I felt so good about our relationship that I didn't care about something that seemed so trivial. Having our candle blown out by her drunken hookup, two sexual partners in 22 years isn't satisfactory to me. I've had sex countless times... it was only during that last semester (and post-breakup, obviously) that I felt like I wasn't having enough sex. However, there's billions of pussies out there, and I want to know what more of them feel like. I want to have that one night stand. I want to have a friend with benefits. I want to have a threesome. There's all sorts of extra-romantic relationship sex that I want try.



But I can't be in a relationship with this girl and try all the sex that I want to try. Hell, I can't even be in a relationship with her and get our number of partners to match up. You might respond to this with ""polygamy is a thing, you know"". I know, but I don't want to share her. I either want to be romantic with just her or cut her out of my life because rearranging the way we relate to one another does not seem worth it to me. I'll always be hurt by what she did. Especially if I give her the satisfaction of keeping me in her life. It's not that I'm opposed to us being in one another's lives... especially in the romantic way, but I don't know how she can make this up to me. 



It seems to me that maybe we could level the playing field by giving me a free pass to have sex with someone else or by having a threesome or something, but it seems to me that further infidelity is no way to fix a relationship. It also seems to me that romance can't flourish when I feel like she owes me something or if I hold something against her. 



So here I am... thinking of inviting her over one weekend to sit down and discuss all of this. I figure that if both of us feel at least slightly inclined to continue our romance, this needs to happen. What is your opinion? I'm not looking for you all to make my decisions for me. I've waited so long to ask the internet about this because I've always figured the internet doesn't know me or her or our relationship, so how will they be able to help? Well you're a neutral third party and that's who I need to talk to right now.... I realize this post was really long, I hope it wasn't too long. I did my best to re-read it and make it not so wall o texty. This is my first reddit post ever so I hope I do this right with the flair and all that.

---


**tl;dr**: My girlfriend of three years cheated on me, and is remorseful. I have a small feeling that perhaps our relationship can continue. I'm jealous because I haven't had sex with very many people and she had sex outside our relationship. I probably can't have a relationship with her AND have sex with more people without her doing the same.


EDIT'd to break up wall-o-text"
1tu49h,7,2013-12-27,My [35f] mother [68 F] doesn't respect that I want to cut ties with my brother [34M] who is diagnosed with schizophrenic psychosis.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1tu49h/my_35f_mother_68_f_doesnt_respect_that_i_want_to/,"This is such a long post and I apologize for rambling but I'm very distraught right now and can't focus on editing it down to the essentials. 


**Backstory**: We always were typical siblings that are too close in age and that struggle for power. One day fighting till one of us had a serious injury the next day besties forever.  I was always told that as the older sister and as the healthy child etc. I had to step back, be considerate, that I am provoking asf, asf. Basically if there was a fight, it was always blamed on me. 
My brother has been always a bit strange. Cute as a button but always was the trouble maker at school he never had a lot of friends. They put him on Ritalin at the age of 7 and then when he was too old, put him in an expensive boarding school and as a teenager he ended up spending half a year in a closed psychiatric facility due to his ADD. He was always told that he is different. 
____
When he was about 20 years old, I mentioned to my parents, that I was worried about him. I assumed he had gone into more serious drugs but had no proof. Kids in our town had started looking into psychedelics such as mushrooms and LSD and he had asked me to drive him to a place where he could buy shrooms. Myself, I was wanting a healthier life as I wanted to be able to focus on the assessment tests for a study abroad program and I refused to support him. He got angry at me for this and we had a shouting match. When my parents asked what the fight was about,  I mentioned my suspicion and their response was that they had asked him and he swore that he was only smoking once in a while a joint and that therefore their conclusion was that I must be lying and badmouthing him to make him look bad. 


At this time my brother spent his whole time with online role playing games, smoking one bong after the next and then he would miss school and work the next day. This got him fired from three apprenticeships, including the safe job my father got him at his own company. 

----

**First incident:** At the time, wireless internet was non-existent and you usually would have one computer in one room that was connected to the internet and it was in his room. We had the agreement, that if I or my mom needed the internet connection we could give him a headsup and within 30 mins he'd finish up and let us go online. It was always a struggle even with the headsup and usually ended up in a fight but this was easy to avoid as I only visited on the weekends at the time. One day, I was getting ready to leave for an assessment test for a university and last minute before going to the train station remembered that I had left an important paper at my own place in the city. I asked to use the internet quickly and he completely freaked at me for not asking earlier. I waited for ten minutes, then asked again, telling him about the urgency for me. In his stoned high, he must have lost track of time, he always said, yes in a minute, in a minute and didn't move. After twenty minutes begging him to let me quickly print the paper, I got angry and unplugged the modem. He pushed me away from the table with such force that I fell on a shelf with my face and ended up with a bruised eye and bloddy nose. This didnt even stop him, he continued kicking me in the stomach over and over again. This was not the first incident of aggression but before it had never been with such force.  

___

My mother ran upstairs. When I told her crying, she said that I was just as wrong as him.. because I had unplugged the modem, I had provoked him into doing this. Adding to it she said I was overreacting and that he didn't really push and kick me (he claimed that I lost my balance on the ""slut-heels""). Her solution was to give me some cash and to tell me to stay a few days away.

Whenever I would tell my parents about his aggressions and ask for support, I was blamed and no support was given to me. I was told that I provoked him by calling him sick and psycho in earlier years, that I had to understand he was not as fortunate as me with my good school diploma and going to university, etc. I did indeed call him very hurtful things because usually a fight would erupt when he would disregard a basic common sense thing and a verbal insult was the only way I could hurt him back. But still in my opinion this does not justify his physical abuse.

*I ended up moving abroad for uni, will post the incident that happened in that time in an addendum.*

____

**2nd major incident**

Since I moved back to my homecountry eight years ago, I avoided him. I moved to a town on the other side of the country. For Christmas and Birthdays I would find excuses to avoid going home. Anything not to be close to him. 
___

Another instance, manifested the hatred and fear I have towards my brother. My mother asked me to take care of the house whilst she was gone on vacation.  She told my brother I was responsible of the house as every single time he was alone at home, he left it a complete mess (dirty dishes everywhere, beer bottles in the living room, expensive stuff missing etc.). My brother had his own place but always ended up at my mother’s place (free food/roomservice). So during my mother’s absence he ended up bringing home some of his ""new"" friends. I asked them to leave as I didn't know these people (they looked shady) and it was around 2am on a workday and I didn't want the neighbors to complain. He taunted me and played himself up that he doesn't have to listen to ""a woman"". He started threatening me by making aggressive ""head-butt"" movements towards me, acting as if he was about to hit me with the fist. I ran into my room and called the police and the men left the house. The police couldn't do anything as it was just a domestic disturbance. My brother went mad after the police left. He chased me in the house, yelling that he will kill me, that the most glorious day would be the day he would see my blood splatter on the wall by his hands and that I shouldn't believe that locking myself into the room would be safe. He said he would get in there and that I should better jump out the window as he'd be making sure my death would be more painful otherwise. He then went into his room upstairs and I escaped to stay at my friend’s house.


Again when telling my mother about this incident, she told me it was my fault. I was provoking him etc. etc.

They were many more situations like this. Basically every time I am in the same room with him and nobody watches, he will make those threatening fist or head-butt movements to intimidate me. When I tell my mother and she doesn't look he will smile viciously and laugh. 

____
**Currently** 

My parents eventually clocked that he was sick. He was sent to several psychiatric facilities but he refused treatment because he doesn't see himself as sick. Three years ago he was finally diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and has been in and out of psychiatric facilities.  He is broken according to my mother and often cries but he still refuses treatment, he thinks some famous politician has put an ""antenna"" into his brain and that the government is watching him. Not that it would change anything with my mother though. It made her even more protective about him. 


I  halfway across the country. Last year my brother moved here, too. In the same suburb even. He's been trying to contact me on Facebook and calling me. I was very clear to my mother to not give out my contact information to him. In July, he suddenly stood at my door. My mother, had given him my address so I could help him out with money. I was furious. I told her that this is unacceptable and that she has to respect my wishes. But it is to no avail. She continues saying that I have to be the understanding one, I have to be considerate. To top it off, she is using that she had breastcancer last year against me, saying that I am making her health worse with my behavior.


___
My current boyfriend, who is also the father of my unborn child, lost his mother a few years ago. He really wants to see my mother as a substitute to his and whenever I have a fight with her, I can sense how sad it makes him. He purposely moved a work appointment in our town on the weekend of my mother’s birthday last weekend. I asked my mother if it was possible to stay over and if for the first time in nearly 15 years I could celebrate Christmas with her. She said of course, but my brother would be there. Then I told her that I felt uncomfortable with my brother in the house and if maybe it was possible, to ask him to spend Christmas with his father. She said no. So I asked if we could compromise and he arrives only on the 23rd so that we can at least spend her birthday with her. She told me no. She wouldn't tell my brother when to arrive as he was sick and she needed to be there for him. So after 15 years she couldn't even give me this one day. 


I wrote her a letter about two months ago and explained to her in rational and friendly sentences how it is hurting me that my feelings, my need for safety and my own psychological wellbeing is not respected and that I wish of her to accept my decision as an adult that I do not want any contact with my brother. Her response was something along the lines that she doesn't want to go into the details of my email and that she needs support from me in this situation. She completely ignored the subject.


We ended up renting a hotel and then visited on her birthday for coffee. We weren't even 20 minutes in the house when he comes downstairs to go to the kitchen. She calls him to come to the dining room and the moment she did, I couldn’t breathe anymore. When he entered, I sat with the back to him and I jumped up and ran to the other side of the room. He introduced himself to my boyfriend, asked where he was living whilst I grabbed my boyfriend’s arm, and dragged him out of the house. I even forgot my scarf and beanie, I just wanted to get out of there. Outside in front of the house I told my mother again that she has to respect my wishes in this regards. I was furious but I tried to keep it calm. She didn't listen to my feelings, didn't respect that I am getting really upset by this, she didn't consider that I had to drive 9 hours to my hometown and to top it off, as we were standing there, I notice my brother viciously smiling and raising a thumb in the kitchen window.

___
Today I found out that I am pregnant. I called my mother to tell her about this but first I wanted to talk to her about what happened on Monday and tried to make her understand. She again made everything my fault. I told her that from my point of view she was forcing a victim to get along with an offender and that it was not acceptable to ask this of me after everything that happened. She blamed me of overreacting. She said she can hardly remember all the things and that I should just get over it. She even had the audacity to say that I was depriving my ""poor"" boyfriend of a family. I got so angry and so furious, I told her to go fuck herself and hung up.


___
**tl;dr: My brother is a diagnosed schizophrenic with psychotic episodes. Time and time he has been physically aggressive towards me. I am too afraid to be in one room with him. My parents, especially my mother, don't respect my wishes. She is trying to guilt trip and trick me into getting along with my brother. I can't handle fighting for what I feel is right anymore and I cannot handle the stress anymore, especially now that I am pregnant. I need help.**

Edit: **Addendum - some of the stuff that happened whilst I lived abroad**


Despite all odds, I made the assessment day and I left my hometown for five years to study abroad. During this time my brother got in trouble a few times and had several signs of psychotic breakdowns. For instance, he was on vacation in some Arab country and my father had to book him a flight early back home because he had a paranoid attack in the hotel, claiming the hotel waiters where out to poison him.

I knew my parents wouldn't understand that my brother had some serious drug abuse problem. Myself I didn't understand that at this time it already had manifested. Hence, in an effort to help, judging from how my living abroad helped me be happy, I contacted my estranged father and negotiated with him, that it would be best for my brother to come visit me for half a year in the country I studied so he could do a language semester and gain some positive influence from other ambitious students. I thought getting him away for a while could help. It was all agreed upon but then my brother out of the blue started insulting me in an email and claimed I had been badmouthing him in our hometown – another one of his episodes. His insults became so mean, that I blocked all contact.
I forwarded the emails to my parents and of course they found something at fault in my writing. In their eyes I was being patronizing. 

___

During my stay overseas, my that time boyfriend went to live in a city close by my parents for three months to do an internship and a language class. He visited my parents once in a while and one day my brother asked him if he'd like to go out with him and his friends. They all met for warm up drinks at one of my brother's thug friends and then three guys held my ex-boyfriend and my brother yelled at him bootcamp style ""My sister is a good Christian woman, dont you dare touch her!"" I have no idea where my brother came up with this bullshit. My boyfriend broke up with me. He said the situation he got in with my brother was too much for him to handle. He said he felt threatened for his live because my brother was so aggressive. And I understood him. I know the staring eyes and the tension my brother has when he is aggressive

1ttxu7,3,2013-12-27,"New Graduate, Financial Plan Critique Requested – Want to start off on the right foot!",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ttxu7/new_graduate_financial_plan_critique_requested/,"Hi r/PersonalFinance! 

I'm a new graduate who will begin working at a technology company in March of
2014. Hoping to get some advice on investment strategy, allocating a 'fun'
budget, and retirement planning. I've been extremely fortunate (*‚ô™ Wonder of
wonders, miracle of miracles‚Äì ‚ô™*) and want to be sure I make the most of it.

## The Job

- $110,000 Salary
- 10-20% Yearly Bonus, based on individual performance
- $55,000 Signing Bonus, disbursed over two years
- $75,000 of Stock Vesting over three years
- 401(k)+Matching: 50% match for up to 6% of eligible compensation.
- Employee Stock Purchase (ESPP): Can purchase company stock at a 10% discount from
  market price at select times during each quarter.

## Current Financial Condition

- $25,000 of cash in checking/savings. Interest rate is negligible (with BoA)
- Roughly USD 3,500 at current exchange rate of foreign currencies; I will
  probably use about half of this for visiting family and friends
  in Europe.
- No outstanding debt, student loans, etc. Scholarships, freelancing, and
  internships paid for tuition and living expenses.
- A CC, also with BoA. I've had this since 2012 but only started using it in the
  past three months. I use it for day-to-day expenses and pay it off
  in full at the end of each month.

## Predicted Expenses

- $1750 Rent: Living alone, near to the office, in a building with attractive
  architecture is something I'm willing to pay a premium for. I realise the
  rational course of action is finding a roommate or two and going in on a
  townhouse, but it's not something I'm willing to compromise on (at least for
  the first year or two)
- $40 Cell Phone
- $60 Internet
- $200 Utilities (TBD)
- $500 Groceries, Going Out
- $600 Misc. Spending, Shopping

- Subtotal: ~$3150/mo 

## Predicted Planning, Pre-Advice:

- Move all of my existing cash into emergency fund, utilise signing bonus for
  furnishing new apartment, and living expenses going forwards.
- Immediately allocate 6% of income to 401(k)
- Move 5-10% of post-tax income towards ESPP, reinvesting proceeds in the
  stock market.
- Save all remaining income to go towards purchase of a home, car, etc.

## Long-Term Financial Goals

While I love my career and the opportunities it affords me, being an architect
was always a dream. Since I don't get to design/plan cool buildings all day,
living in one will have to suffice. With the way the housing market in the areas
I can work in are trending, I'm afraid to think how much this may cost.

Additionally, my family is spread across the globe, and I've discussed pitching
in with my father to purchase a second home where we could all summer together.
This would likely happen within the next 5-8 years, and being able to contribute
150k+ to that would be a wonderful gift for their anniversary that year. 

These two goals are my highest priorities, with the family home coming first. A
spouse, compounding raises, and prayer is the current plan for my own
residence.

## Questions

1. I'll be ineligible for a Roth IRA, correct? The signing bonus and stock
   vesting both seem to count against the $110,000 maximum income. En lieu of
   this, is the best tax advantaged investment vehicle my company 401(k)?

2. How much should I allocate for future health care expenses? I have no
   pre-existing conditions and will likely remain on my parents healthcare until
   I turn 26. Should I start putting away some small amount of cash, say
   $1,000/yr into an HSA?

3. In order to have the cash on hand for a family home in eight years, it looks
   like it would take ~$1200/mo compounding over that same period at 7%. The
   $1,200 is doable, especially one you factor in stock and bonus compensation,
   but finding a long term 7% return, while not out of line with historical
   stock market performance, still strikes me as risky. Are there any
   alternatives I might consider?

4. With current savings I more or less have an emergency fund accounted for.
   What should I do with future lump sums such as yearly bonuses and stock
   grants?

4. Have I glossed over something, overlooked potential major expenses, or
   otherwise made a dumb mistake? Please point it out! I'm a total novice to the
   realities of financial planning, and it's certainly an endeavour where
   getting it right the first time is important!


Again, I realise I'm in a very fortunate position, and want to be sure I can do
right by the family and friends who got me here.  Thanks in advance, and sorry
for the long-winded post!

I am currently trying to decide on a career path, and CS certainly interests me a great deal. I've heard that the job market is great for Computer Science. I just have a few questions that could help me to decided if I want to study CS.

1. What is the job market like for IT in Canada?
2. What are some of the cool internships or jobs that you got right after graduating school?
3. What is the average salary for a fresh graduate?
4. What are some good schools in Canada for CS?

Thanks in advance!

Long time lurker on this subreddit.  I am currently a graduating electrical engineering major but, have worked mostly in software.  I am about to graduate after working at a fortune 500 company.  I have other experience other than that in some summer research programs.  I was shamefully not offered a fulltime position at my internship due in part to my inexperience at the particular type of programming my group did.  I have received an offer from a smaller company in my area and am worried that working my first fulltime job at a small company will hurt my chances of coming back to a company like qualcomm or google.  I would really appreciate some advice on this.  

Other notes, I favor the smaller company because the work load will most likely be smaller, and I will have the option of sitting in on classes at my university.  The pay will also be less but since the workload will be less I will have more time to keep learning.

Thank you for the advice.

What's the meaning of life, and how did I get trapped in this text box? (But seriously, could you point me in the right direction, kind person?)",[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ttjb3/out_of_college_with_minimal_coding_experience/,"I checked out the FAQ and didn't see this exact query asked, so I really hope that you guys will be able to point me in the right direction.

I'm looking to start a career in **web development, possibly**, but I'm not certain if that's the direction to head in at this time. I want to get into a field within programming that'll make me the most marketable because, from what I studied in college, did not make that happen and I've been working retail jobs for the past two years and am now currently unemployed (and looking!)

So I'm looking for guidance as to 

1. What should I (or should not) be learning language-wise
 
2. What sort of tech work I currently qualify for that would make me a thousand times (or to some similar degree) more knowledgeable and super duper in my work, and 

3. Any other information that you might find pertinent in my particular situation.

**My background:**
I have my BA in Communications Media: Media Management, so I have a good grasp in general marketing, PR, and management ideas for various subsects of media including television, radio, and general web. I also have an AA in general Liberal Arts and took two internships in news related agencies (a newspaper and an NPR station).

**Coding experience:**
I have a working knowledge of C++ from a course I took in community college plus a book I fiddled with over the summer (I love video games and was going for learning them, but eh, I live in NY). 

I had started learning HTML on Neopets as a kid for the pet pages and have used the markup language in a few endeavors, including when I worked briefly for a (very, very minor) game site as a reporter for editing blogs I've had in the past, and a geocities site (that I coded by hand, mind you, not it's weird drop interface). I came back to it recently on Codecademy, finishing the course in that and finding a few other websources to fiddle around with as well.

CSS I didn't really start grasping until recently, though I did fiddle with it when myspace was a big thing. Again, Codecademy got me there.

Khan Academy is actually what got me started into programming again with their promotion of the Programming Power Hour (I might be getting the name wrong). I finished the full Javascript course about a week ago and feel rather comfortable writing in it now. But I'm not really sure what to do with it from here. If you're interested, [here are my projects](https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/JJinx/programs).

Lastly, I've been dabbling in a few random languages based upon what I've seen in help wanted ads. I've seen Ruby on Rails, jQuery, PHP, a slew of other things. I've been told by other programming friends different things as well, so I'm a bit confused as to where to go from here.

**So to sum my experience:**

* Some C++
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript (working with OOP a bit more now)
* A *very, very* small bit of Ruby, PHP, and jQuery

If anyone else thinks it's necessary, I could list my work history as well, but as I stated above, it's mostly retail positions. I've worked briefly (non-paid) in film as well as a few other things. Just let me know. Anything to help get the right guidance. I'm sick of living with my parents at 26 without anything to really show for myself."

In the beginning of my college career I wanted to do CIS but I had to settle with CS because my college has a GPA requirement in order to get into the College of Business(CIS). 

I was still able to get a job in the College of Business as a lab manager where I managed a help desk of 15 employees and oversaw the technology for our lap(200 clients, 100+ laptops, 5+servers). It was by far the best job I've had since.

Last summer came around and I decided to get an internship so I could see how I like coding in corporate setting. I got put on the reporting team and taught PostgreSQL to myself and was in a closed room with 3 other introverts programming for 8 hours a day with no human interaction.

Needless to say I don't feel as though programming 8 hours a day non stop is my cup of tea. I absolutely hated it at my internship and there was no human interaction whatsoever.  It was definitely a learning experience but I am safe to say that I don't like that environment. 

My question is what type of job still offers the human interaction, sys admin, coding position. I loved the ""minor"" sys admin position I held at the College of Business and I still like to code so I am looking for an in-between kind of job. My only delta is that I've read stories of the full blown sys admins that have to work weekends and holidays and are always on call and have to deal with the shitty customers.  I am not looking for a ""full blown"" type of sys admin job but something in the middle would be nice.

Any suggestions on what type of position this might be would be greatly appreciated!"

I remember the very first day I signed up here and anxiously anticipating my badge to slowly creep to 3 or 4 days. It seems like it's been a very long time but perhaps it is because this week hasn't been a blur; I have actually experienced each moment and remember memories! I know that it is still early but I feel resolved to maintain sobriety. Drinking disgusts me and when I do feel that I could have just one beer or one mixed drink (does anyone ever drink non-alcoholic cocktails? I miss the whole pomp and circumstance of a margarita... maybe this is a bad idea), I remind myself that it will a) only make me feel full, tired, and sick, and b) it will never, ever be just one. While the rest of my early-20-something friends go out to bars tomorrow night, I will be attending my very first AA meeting.

I am also feeling extremely nervous because I start a new job January 2nd. I graduated from my graduate program in August and finally landed a job through a friend this past month (how I did this while drinking, I have no idea... how in the world I completed a grad program while working a full time internship, working part time on the side, and getting black out drunk basically every night, I am completely baffled). It is an entry level position but depending on my performance I have opportunity to advance to a higher position. I am way over-qualified for this job and I know that they hire from within. While I am confident about my new setting (everyone has been extremely nice thus far), I feel that I do not have enough time sober to become truly successful at this new job. I am worried about all the remnants from drinking: the brain fog, shit concentration, poor memory, lagging reaction time, and everything else. My job will require me to be on my toes, at all times. I know that I won't fully recover for a very long time so I am nervous about starting this job. I am also nervous that any job-related stresses will be bad for my sobriety. However, I know that at my age it is time to really start my career.  Also I am so super stoked about this job and can't wait to start!

We've been together for 7 months and she has stayed numerous weekends at my apartment (I live on my own).

I generally do not talk about my ex's with current partners unless asked about them since I think it's disrespectful to my current partner.

Understandably my girlfriend has asked a little bit about about the ex before her, such as why we broke up, things like that, but we never talked about her at great length.   

However, I mentioned my ex in conversation when talking about my apartment, something along the lines of 'when my ex lived here...' and she was completely stunned and incredibly upset to hear about it now. (When dating my ex she lived with me for 2 months and it was out of convenience and not a 'next step' in the relationship. We knew it was temporary as she had a short term job placement near where I lived and was going abroad to do an internship as soon as the placement was over.)

I can understand why she was so appalled to hear it. She didn't have any idea that another girl lived in the apartment that she's slept at so many times.

I never purposefully lied or withheld the information from her in any way and the only reason it was never mentioned was because it never came up in conversation. 

My standpoint is that when in a relationship, any ex's are firmly in the past and there's no reason to drudge things up without reason. I didn't see it as important to let her know that I lived with my ex for 2 months. In my opinion, it was an important event *in* my past relationship but bears no significance in my *current* one.

Her standpoint is that it's too much of a big deal, or significant event in my relationship history to leave out, and that neglecting to tell her at any point during our relationship says something about how I'm easy to dismiss such things and that if living with a past girlfriend for 2 months is not significant enough to mention at any point, it means our relationship, which is long distance and has much less contact and time together than my previous relationship means little in comparison. 

The argument got extremely heated when she said I'd made her very upset, and I said she was making herself upset by thinking about my past relationships, and shifting the blame on to me. I then made a huge mistake and accused her of being emotionally manipulative as she was saying how upset I was making her, and how little she thinks she must mean to me. Now things are in pretty bad shape.

Was I wrong to not tell her such details? I can totally understand how it would have been a shock to her to find out, but it's always shocking and shitty to hear and think about a SO's relationship history. I just don't know if this was something I really should have told her sooner. Thanks for the advice!



**tl;dr**: In an LDR with girlfriend of 7 months. She recently found out from me that when I dated my ex, she lived with me in my current apartment for a couple of months. She insists it's very significant and is very upset I never told her about it sooner. I'm not sure what to think.  "

I'm looking to intern at a great agency this coming spring semester, and hopefully full-time after I graduate, in account planning/management/strategy. I have a few questions, though...

1) Is it too late for me to be applying to spring internships (now being the end of 2013)? There are some listings that went up earlier in the month that I've already applied to in the last week and that I'm continuing to apply to until my winter break ends.

2) As someone without a portfolio (and no truly great creative skills), how do I sell myself as an awesome planning/strategy person?

3) Kind of related to question #2, but what should I emphasize in my interviews, beyond ""I'm a strategic thinker, here's what I did for my IMC project"" and ""I really want this""? Especially given my limited internship experience (no large/recognizable companies), I'm a little concerned.

4) When's the optimal time for me to be applying for full time positions? Is it too late now? (I'm guessing/hoping not.)

What I *saw* was a team that, coming off a truly *devastating* loss on Christmas Day, refused to give up, even in the face of incredible adversity, and a hostility that has become virtually nationwide.  Make no mistake: we are the most degraded team in the NBA.  Your fandom is a transgressive act.

Clips Nation, we are in heartbreak season.  Like Barack Obama in his first term in office, I feel as if I've rapidly aged in the last two days of basketball.  Very few teams – *and almost no fans* – can survive back-to-back nail-biting finishes that result in close losses.  But that is what our devotion to this team has called upon us to do.  Clips Nation is a fanbase of survivors.

I was with my dad – who is only a Clippers fan because of me – and on our ride back home, he said that it's good to be a fan of a team like that, a team that breaks your heart and mends it on consecutive nights.  I think he's right.  This is the winter of our discontent.  Now is the time to rally behind this team *stronger than ever*.  To be a Clippers fan is to truly live.

Long live the Clippers Nation!"

Dear Cigarettes,

We have had a lot of good times together. I think that’s what makes saying goodbye so hard. You were, without a doubt, the one friend I could always count on. If it was a bad day at work, you were there. If I was struggling through school work, you were there. If I was out drinking with my buddies and some girl shot me down, you were there. No matter how shitty things felt, I could always go outside, have a few drags, clear my head, and come back a sharper, happier, better, more alert version of me. And that’s what makes saying goodbye so hard.

We began our affair when I was still in high school, a swimmer no less. My friend Isaiah talked about how much he wanted a cigarette one day when we were finishing up skiing. I had never had one before. A few weeks later I stole one out of Uncle Richard’s pack. When I was home that weekend I snuck out onto the back porch and smoked it; it was terrible.

But then one of my friends bought me a pack of cigarillos, mini cigars the size of cigarettes. I remember sitting on my back porch with those, inhaling as you are definitely not supposed to do, and enjoying my first nicotine rush. I felt light headed, the stars spun, and I understood why some people loved tobacco so much.

And so it went from there. I never really enjoyed smoking weed, but I had no shortage of friends who did. So when it came time for them to go outside and spark a bowl, I would go have a cigarette with them. It was a way to be a part of the experience and continue the conversation without feeling too out of place.

I worked at Target my senior year of high school. That job sucked, but I made use of my 15 minute break to step out back and have a smoke. It felt good. There were a few girls I went to high school with who worked there too. “You? You smoke? I never would have guessed!” It felt badass; it was a counterpoint to my straight A, captain of the swim team, Eagle Scout image. It felt good.

My parents caught me a few times on the back deck. My mom was livid, Dad was unhappy in a separate “I’ve been there, but don’t fucking do that to yourself” kind of way. I was in high school, so I promptly chalked their disapproval up to the cliché ‘you don’t know me and my life’ phase that most high school kids face.

I knew it was a bad thing when Hannah, a very good friend who I had an enormous crush on all through high school, signed my yearbook in part “please quit smoking.” Fuck. She probably wouldn’t have dated me anyway, but it was still a wakeup call.

I had grand ambitions of quitting when I went to college. Who wouldn’t? It’s an opportunity to reinvent yourself. That lasted about a week, until our first fire alarm on a Tuesday because somebody burned popcorn in their microwave or something. And there we were standing outside, and I found myself bumming a cig off my buddy Noah.

And so it sorta went for the next two years of college. Funny story, smoking at a top tier, elitist liberal arts college does not go over well. But I didn’t care, because I had a paper due tomorrow, and hey, whatever, I’ll do what it takes to get that done. And god damn, there was no more beautiful place to have a smoke than the fire escape off my dorm sophomore year. And shit, we’re on the table next bro, we’ve got some beiruit to play, get your head in the game. And yet, I wondered how I had a hard time finding a girlfriend. Yeah, here’s a hint: ciggs. smell. fucking. gross.

At the time I was blinded by the fact that a lot of girls at parties would bum them off me. And that I had friends who smoked. And it was a great way to take a break from the party. Step outside, clear your head, chat for a bit, then head back inside and grab another beer.
 
And my god, if you’re working late on a paper? I still have a theory about people my age “abusing” Adderall and other similar drugs when they’re in school; I’m pretty sure it stems from the fact that it’s socially unacceptable to drink a pot of coffee and smoke a pack of cigarettes anymore. Talk to Mom and Dad, I’m pretty sure that’s how they got it done. But that’s a rant for another day.
 
I quit the summer of my junior year of college. I was home for that summer working an internship in the city. I worked out a lot. I felt great. I told myself I would come back to school ready to chase down pretty freshmen girls.
I went out that fall, free of cigarettes. I definitely did not get laid more. But I felt better. And I could swim farther, and run faster without feeling terrible. I went abroad that spring. I met an amazing girl. “I’m so glad you don’t smoke anymore,” she said, “I would never have kissed you.”

Is there any better reason to not smoke ever again? Well funny story, after about 8 beers, it starts to seem like a good idea again. Because that’s the worst part about it. When you’re drinking, you just want. a. fucking. smoke.

I came back to school senior year with a girlfriend, albeit long distance, who I loved deeply. And because I was long distance, I could get away with things. I never cheated on her. Ever. But did I smoke a lot of cigarettes when I was at the library late working on my thesis? Yes. And I still feel bad about it.

I interviewed a lot and got a good job lined up for when I graduated. I graduated. Started said job in a town where I knew nobody. Girlfriend couldn’t make the move. Tried again to quit. Started again shortly thereafter, because yeah, working? It’s stressful. And I wanted an outlet. And my buddy Wen-Fu who sat next to me was walking outside a few times a day for one. Might as well join him right?

My roommate at the time both enabled each other. We found each other on Craigslist. Probably the first night we were in the apartment together, there came a point where we both quietly slipped outside. When we came back, we could smell it on each other.  What’s that meme with Denzel from Training Day? Yeah, we had one of those moments.

Had a lot of tests to take that were work related. The CFA is a nightmare. Got through it, don’t think I could have without the excessive amount of smoking I did. Still while flying down to see my girlfriend once a month.

Took a job in New York City. Big professional advancement, big pay raise. Girlfriend decided she had had enough of long distance, didn’t want to move to New York, we broke up.
 
Smoking picked up exponentially. I still don’t do it at work, but anytime you go through a tough time, you find yourself leaning on old friends. I have old friends in this town, but they aren’t always there, particularly when you’ve had a rough Tuesday and just want to sit on your couch, crack a beer, and rip a butt.

So I find myself alone in New York City. I’m not asking for sympathy, because I think there are few places in the world better to be single than New York. 

But this is not Mad Men, and most twenty something girls fucking despise smoking.

And that’s why I want to quit.
 
Because I don’t want to be alone.

And I don’t want to have to make to choice between the cute girl I met the other night and a night out boozing and smoking with my friends.

Because I don’t want to have to hide anything from you on that first date.

And more importantly, because I don’t want to have to hide anything from myself. And be happy with who I am as a person.

For those who have friends who smoke who you want to quit, I offer the following advice:

•	The time to say “I care about you as a friend, and I don’t want you to smoke” is NOT at the bar after a few drinks. My college roommate used to try to swat cigarettes out of my mouth. My friends who are now in med school have tried to confront me before after a few beers. Trust me, I know this is bad for me, but I am drunk, I don’t care, and my gut reaction is “FUCK YOU, I want a smoke.” Most smokers have done stupid things in search of cigarettes. I have gotten behind the wheel when I definitely should not have, just to go to the gas station to buy a pack. Talk to them when they’re sober. (Side note, don’t let them do dumb things like drive to the gas station when they’re drunk).

•	Quitting is about you, not about anyone else. Nobody has ever successfully quit because someone else wants them to, they quit because THEY want to. Trust me. I can buy a pack of Camels at any gas station, unless I do not want to buy them, I can. And I can be very creative at hiding it from you or anyone else.
 
•	Smokers have trigger mechanisms. Smoking and drinking go phenomenally well together but everyone knows that. Beyond that, we typically have something not so fun that pulls us back to it. Parents, ex girlfriends/boyfriends, etc. Trust me, it’s there. Like I said, I think for most smokers cigarettes are an old friend to lean on when no one else was there.

•	It is an addiction. Unless you’re 16, it’s not something you do to be “cool” (and trust me, if you’re reading this when you’re 16, cut it the fuck out). Most of us who smoke started a while ago, and it has become engrained in many parts of our life. Picture all you’re craving is a hot, juicy, pepperoni pizza and all you can eat is salad. That is what anyone trying to quit smoking is going through. And all they have to do is call Dominos and it will be there in 30 minutes. That’s what makes it so hard. It’s there, they want it, but it takes a lot of will power to say “no, I don’t want this anymore.”

I will be trying to quit come January 1. This will be the third try, hopefully this time it takes. If there is anyone in New York with similar New Year’s resolutions, I’d love to start a support group.

All semester I have been applying for jobs in my field but so far nothing has come of it. My plan was to get into marketing/pr/advertising field. I have no idea what I am going to do now. I have no idea how to actually get into a full time job I won't hate.

What do I do now??

I am a single 22 year old American female. No kids or pets. I can go pretty much anywhere.

Things I enjoy doing--Traveling, learning to play guitar, singing, helping people, finding solutions, puzzles. 

Other interests-music, other cultures, medicine (particularly osteology)

Things to consider-
Last summer I worked 2 internships in my field, but unfortunately neither one of them are in a position to hire another full time position.

I currently work part time in retail but again, they can't hire me full time. 

It will really hard to leave my circle of friends. One of my best friends is getting married next November, I am in the wedding. And my other best friend may be getting engaged later this year and I want to be there for that.


Any ideas on what I should do now??"

I am a ChemE but I mostly work on controls and software.
My Questions :

1. Thesis vs Non-Thesis ( Comprehensive Exam ) Which does Industry prefer?

2. Can I get a MS in a field different than mine ? For example : My background is a ChemE but can I get a MS in Material Science or Mechanical Engineering or even Computer Engineering ?


3. This maybe a stupid question and I understand that key to employment is internship but : Does the reputation of the school where I am getting the MS from really matter ? For example if I get a MS in Cal State Long Beach vs. Arizona State University, does it really matter ? Should I stress out about rankings for employment ?

1tsd3n,1,2013-12-27,What are the absolute best ways to get rid of my insecurities?,Atrayul,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1tsd3n/what_are_the_absolute_best_ways_to_get_rid_of_my/,"I have recently been going through some changes in my life. This includes going through a break up. I have also finished my 5th semester in University.

I have done some self analysis and some research online and have finally realized most of my unhappiness is because of my insecurities.

Some examples (to help give you an idea) include:
1. Social situations I am insecure in - I laugh at any chance that is given to me. ""Oh you said something that was sorta sarcastic..? 'laugh...'  "" 
2. I never use large words when speaking to people because I panic that I will say it wrong and they will think i'm an uneducated idiot.
3. I get really angry when I do poorly at games such as Trivial Pursuit, or even video games because I think - ""If i suck at this, I am not quick at thinking, which means I won't be smart enough to get a good job. Now this means i'm going to be poor when I'm older. 
4. If I say a joke and nobody laughs I immediately have to say something afterwards to try and break the silence. Then after saying what I said, after the silence, I feel more like an idiot. It kills me and can kill my confidence for the rest of the day/night.
5. When someone starts talking about something I am not certain of such as: what job they will have after university, or the internship they are getting, or the promotion they got... I envy them and begin to feel scared and worried and angry because none of that is happening for me. I will let that ruin my day as well.

I think one of the main reasons for my insecurities is how i view life. I have too many values that rely on what others think of me. I feel like my life is almost fully based on other people's perspectives. ""If i do this... what will this person think??"" Always thinking about what other people think of me.. Or how they see me. 

I know this post is all over the place, but I am just sick and tired of feeling this way all the time. All of my friends (to my knowledge) don't see how insecure I am. I try my best to hide it and because of my active personality, I can. I am just always always always feeling uncomfortable and I want it to change. I haven't really thought to ask the internet for help, but maybe redditors can help me out.

What can i do? Does anyone else feel this way? How severe can it get if you can relate? "

Ended up having the worst semester in my 3 years there.

Grades came out today and I have two Ds, two Cs, and one B. I am most definitely on academic probation now. My GPA has dropped from a 3.5 to a 3.1 and I'm horribly worried about what to do for my internship and job hunt.

I know this really isn't the biggest of problems and it's such a common one too. I just feel like a complete failure and I really can't get this pit in my stomach to go away.

For the longest time, academics was the only real thing I was good at. Wasn't too great with girls. Wasn't the most social person. I sucked at video games. I looked like an idiot playing sports. School was the only real thing giving me confidence.

But I feel like college changed so much. I ended up exercising. Now I'm running marathons and am pretty good at basketball. I have a good circle of friends. Girls somehow magically began noticing me. I felt like a much more confident person.

But failing this semester makes me feel like I've just regressed to where I was before — a completely unbalanced and not well-rounded individual. And given how academics was my only source of comfort for a long time, I feel especially sad. And angry.

Mad at my own failings. Mad at the self-pity. Mad at losing my focus.

I have ""excuses"" that I hope will allow me to explain away what will (hopefully) be an unfortunate blip on my transcript. My grandmother passed right before midterms and my aunt's cancer came back.

Sure, it threw me off, but all my professors have been nothing but understanding and accommodating. I just failed to meet even their accommodations.

I'm too embarrassed to tell my parents or even my closest friends. All I feel right now is that sinking feeling when you know you've fucked up.

I know what I need to do. I think I can step my game back up, retake the classes I failed in. But I'm still worried. I'm so terrified of not being able to regain my focus. I'm scared that the next semester might be worse and it would just confirm that I'm just not as good at school as I thought I was.

And I'm so worried about the internship and job hunt that's coming next year and what will happen to me if I don't get my GPA back up. My parents and I are already swimming in student loans and I feel like I would be failing everyone relying on me if I don't get a good job.

But mostly, I just needed to get this off my chest. Writing about it won't change anything and it's on no one but me to change my situation. But man, my shoulders are feeling really heavy and I've just taken a huge blow to my confidence. I just needed to write I suppose."

My degree? Is basically a general 'IT' degree. They allowed you to pick different tracks like database, programming, web development, networking, project management etc etc etc etc. Of course there is at least one requirement for each of them but then you specialize. I was pretty set on programing but then the professor(for c++) I had was horrible. I didn't realize it at the time and I ended up taking up the networking track. Then in my junior year I was forced to take Java. I dreaded to the class but the professor was so passionate about it that I loved it. He showed me all the great things we could do and I ended up blowing through the class and creating things on my own. I created my own swing application that I normally show off and just showing that one app that I developed has gotten me a internship and an actual career job which is great. Yet the work I'm doing is not work I'm passionate about so I actually want to strike out and learn more to fill the void I missed and start my own software firm (in the mobile and web technologies. 

I've recently started reading 'Clean Code'
and honestly after reading three chapters of the book I feel like I don't even know how to program hahaha...Some more background on my education:
 I took only one data structure class (Ive googled and it appears I didn't learn a lot) We learned how to make linked list, binary search trees, etc). I've searched around and it seems I've missed out on a lot of data structures, general algorithm study, operating systems, testing...

I wanted to know if anyone had any tips on what books to read or study. I feel like from school I only really have the real basics...control statements, inheritance, a little exception handling... Any advice or direction. I feel like I missed alot. Also any times for starting your own Software Firm is greatly appreciated.


Thank you :)

This Christmas season has allowed me to reflect on my life in a lot of ways. Over the past few years, IFU. I want some serious help how to turn around my life. I have built myself extremely academically strong. The amount of awards, accomplishments, and experiences I have attained is breath-taking, yet there is something missing.

Hopefully, I have described them below.

* I realized that my social life is dying. It never really was alive. I was never really noticed by anyone, always marginalized as the uncool kid. Consequently, it is partially my fault. I turned away most people because I have trust issues, assuming what they would think of me. Now, I’m getting better, but still need to improve because I mostly keep to myself.

* I ruined my professional life by creating an unintended scene. Some may think that I “won”, but the only thing I won was misery. I replay every day of that in my head. I am disgraced to know what happened was because of me. I wasted an internship that another eager person could have had. Now, I have no positive references when applying to real jobs. There should be no pity on me.

* I feel like I am loved too much by my relatives. They are willing (and they do) everything for me. It seems like their willingness to love me is taking a toll on them. They are (or more like, I am) afraid that I’ll never grow up, that I’ll never move on. Some days I feel that once my parents die, I will follow.


I deserve to amount to nothing because of my actions, but I won’t accept it. My entire life I was the poster child for success and goodness (I was voted most straight edge in high school), yet I don’t feel it. I still play it safe, afraid to experience anything risky or wrong. I want to show sincerity, maturity, and thankfulness to all of those around me. There is a roadblock some place that I need to move past. I want people to know that there is no subtle reserve behind his lucid frankness.

I know HTML, CSS, SQL, Javascript, but not the rest. I've got a fairly advanced knowledge in Java (very similar to C#).

The main thing they're developing on is .NET, and I haven't the slightest clue as to what it is/how to use it.

How do companies expect college graduates to have experience like that? They also list other software/solutions that we get no experience with at college at all. I can only do so much to learn at home by myself. 

I've also looked at junior sys admin positions, but I feel my skills are much higher then the basic skills needed for that position. I feel it would be a waste of time for me.

I've already been working in IT for about 7 years now, but only as a technician. I've also had bigger internships, but nothing along the lines as a sys admin role.

Anyone have any tips on how to somewhat apply for these companies that I feel are over compensating on their applicant requirements? Should I just apply anyway? During the interview should I say ""Oh yea I have experience with LAMP. I've set it up, got my own site running..... but haven't had to support it for over 10 years....

TL;DWR

* graduated with good GPA in December 2012 from a state school in Ohio with a bachelor's in History.
* since graduation, have been searching for local and nonlocal jobs even sort of related to my major (museum, library, writing, editing, publishing, government work)
* I've got no internship related experience for a variety of reasons (see below)
* loans are on government payment plan: interest and a little bit of principal being paid off each month through money made from current job. Rent is currently a nonissue.
* will going back to school for a technical degree at this time be pointless, or will it help me get out of “retail hell”? Are CS/tech majors plagued with the same post-grad problems as social sciences?



LONG STORY

Two weeks ago marked my one year anniversary of graduating college, and since then I've done my level best to find a job that is even remotely related to my field of study. To me, that means the obvious choices of research and library work, but as of eight months ago I expanded that search to include things like writing, publishing and editing. Living in a small town in NE Ohio, I've obviously have been open to relocating for the position,  

I've been to job boards like Indeed, and I have the USAJobs website e-mailing me daily about new job opportunities. I did freelance work through Elance for about two months before I got my current (part-time, soul-crushing) retail job.

To my detriment, I admit that I have no internship experience. Due to the unpaid nature of such internships, my then-current part-time job, my class schedule, and the commuting times between home, work, and school made such internships impossible.

Needless to say this whole ordeal has been very frustrating and anxiety-producing. I'm fortunate(?) enough to live with my family (nuclear, 7+) rent-free in exchange for pitching in with groceries, some bills, and watching over the younger kids (cousins) when their parents are at work.

For the last couple months, I've seriously been considering going back to school for a more technical field of study, namely computer science or accounting. The school that I'm looking at offers career assistance and co-op programs for its technical degrees, which makes it seem like I would have a fighting chance after graduating. I'm not proud of it, but I was also thinking that, being female, going into computer science could help get my foot in the door.

I know that I messed up in a lot of areas (particularly in internships), but I just need some advice as to whether or not this is an advisable course of action. Any serious advice on the matter would be greatly appreciated."
1tvqh5,2,2013-12-28,"Need an advice on the first date [23, m]",[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1tvqh5/need_an_advice_on_the_first_date_23_m/,"1. I first met this girl at a party, a few days ago. We sat on the same table with a bunch of other people, and I seemed to have made a good impression on her. I managed to obtain her number so that I could text her to arrange time for grabbing coffee/tea and get to know her better. So far, so good.

2. Next morning, I promptly texted and asked her where would be more convenient place to meet (either north or south of the city). She said it depends on when we meet. If we decide to meet on her working day, she told me it would be more convenient for her to meet me in the southern part of the city, where her internship is located. I thought meeting on her working that might be too accomodating on my part (e.g. meeting her during lunch break or waiting till her work is over) and might create an impression that I am being too desperate. So I asked her if she works on sunday, and she said no in general, but not this sunday, and she suggested the next sunday, Jan 5th. (which is nine days from the day I sent her the text). I told her that works great for me.

3. From now is the part that hasn't happened yet, and the part which I need help on. I thought meeting her when she is free and has less time-constraint would be nicer (less perfunctory). Also, I thought meeting her on the northern part of the city would be more advantageous (by the way, this is in Seoul, Korea),  because 1) it's the older part of the city, and may potentially be more romantic. 2) I hang out more often on the southern side, and she works on the southern side, so we both are more familiar in the south, so hanging out in the northern side may create more unique/memorable experience than the average day. 3) logically, I can deduce that she lives on the northern side, and it might be easier for her (now I'm being nice subtly).

4. I think the city is large enough to have a place that is both scenic/quiet yet still urban part of the city (like park), where we could take out a coffee/tea, stroll around,  talk about stuff, and get to know each other. Though it's winter, hot drink should keep us warm. I thought that would be nicer and more fun than sitting down at the starbucks. I probably won't stay outside for too long, and move into some place like movie theater. How adventurous should I be?

5. I thought bringing her a little gift that is not too excessive but sweet would be nice. My plan is to make her a mix CD. People always compliment on my music taste and my playlist, so I think it would be a great way to reveal some part of myself indirectly in a memorable way.

6. I'm going to send her another text on the new year morning (Jan 1st) with a happy-new-year message, to work out the exact location and time of the meeting. I will do some research on the good place to meet beforehand. I'm not sure how long the first date should last, but I am thinking meeting her at 2:30 pm. 

7. I'm a rookie on dating/relationship, and I want this to actually work. Am I over-thinking all this? Does this plan sound alright?  "

So I'm graduating in the beginning och next year and I currently have two job offers that I'm weighing against eachother and some help nudging me in the right direction would be appreciated!

Job 1 is a place where I had an internship on, great company with 3000 employees world wide and 200 at the office that I might work at. One big con is that I'll have to that city permanently (not a viable option to commute) and I have a girlfriend in my current home town that has one year left on her studies.

Job 2 is a smaller company, 30 employees in total, 10 of which at the office I might work at. Only been there on interviews, seems like a nice place but not as many benefits as the bigger corporation. A positive is that it's situated in my current home town so I can keep my current apartment etc. 

What of the two would you consider most viable? I want to advance in my career within a 3 year period, where would that be most viable? What looks better on a CV? Where would you think pays the most? 





Thanks so much and I'll add more if anyone has any questions!  "

I'm sick of retail and want a better job but don't know what I'm doing wrong. I apply to at least two jobs a day and get rejection letters weekly. I gotta be doing something wrong, but don't know what. I know I've got a few spots that might make me undesirable, but I have no idea.

I have some college but had to stop due to lack of funding. I went to college in Seattle, but now live in a small town in the middle of nowhere low-rent with friends trying to find a job that pays more than min wage.  

I have computer skills but no certifications. I completed A+ training but couldn't pay for the certification test (which was $175 at the time I took the training.) But I can type 100wpm and have 6 months of data entry/office experience from my internship. I also have experience working with Microsoft Office, the Adobe Creative Suite, Autodesk software, Jira, and Perforce. I also have experience opening, solving, and closing tickets. I have roughly 4 years experience in doing random under the table computer repair. I also have 4 years customer service experience and several months experience working as an assistant in a pharmacy, taking phone calls, working with medication, and changing data in the computer.

The thing I don't understand is, I know people working at jobs that pay them $20 an hour to use a computer that they don't even know how to use. Data entry, mild programming, and these people can't even type without hunting and pecking. One of them had all of her programming training paid for by the company. 

I want to know how to get those kinds of jobs. I work amazingly in an office environment, and I'm a quick learner to anything computer related. Anything I don't know, I can learn. But the only returned calls I get are spam for pyramid scheme work-from-home type deals. Since moving to this place, the only jobs I've been able to do are farming jobs and retail.

The show helped me realize some valuable life lessons and to this day I still reference the compilation that we created.  Enjoy.

*All information below this is not my work and is merely a transcription from Scrubs and is property of NBC and Doozer*

* 1.1 My First Day – You see I can’t survive on my own.  Even now when I finally get home, I know the hospital is here wide awake.  But what the hell the most important thing is I got through my first three days without looking like an idiot…. I’m the man.
* 1.2 My Mentor- I think the one thing we never stop look for is acceptance.  Acceptance of our own shortcomings… Acceptance that some things are gonna be what they’re gonna be.  Still, I hated Will a little, cause, thanks to him, I started to look at all the people who were important to me in terms of what will probably kill them. Heart disease… Liver disease… Somebody choking her… I dunno probably stress.
* 1.3 My Best Friend’s Mistake- I know the idea of choosing friendship over sex is the last thing any guy wants to hear.  But you know what? This time, it actually made sense to me.  Besides, I challenge anyone to survive as an intern without a close group of friends to lean on.
* 1.4 My Old Lady- So, they say that one out of every three patients admitted to this place will die here.  But, some days the odds are worse than that.  And on days like that, I guess the best you can hope for is that you took something from it…Anything…Anything at all…Even if it’s just taking the time to lie in the grass and think about all the things you still have left to do.
* 1.5 My Two Dads- I know it sounds melodramatic, but in my mind, as I watched the two of them, they weren’t battling for patients or insurance… they were battling for my soul.  It’s an old story, really—good versus bad, right versus wrong… the Dark Side versus The Light…
* 1.6 My Bad- I don't know why she did it; maybe I got to her, maybe she knows how much the hospital needs him, maybe, somewhere, she remembers why she cared about him in the first place. Whatever the reason, it made me realize that every ending leads to new complications...New problems to be dealt with...New issues. I'll always remember that moment as the first ""thank you"" I got from Dr. Cox. It felt good. Philosophy is tricky.
* 1.7 My Super Ego- The scariest thing was that I thought he was stronger than all of us. But maybe it's not about being the best. Maybe it's about finding the little things that get you through the day. Whether it's the support of someone close to you...or letting yourself feel overwhelmed...if only for a moment. Or being selfless every once in a while, I don't know. I guess, in the end, it's about surviving...any way you can.
* 1.8 My Fifteen Minutes - It’s funny how our perceptions can be so off…Like, when you’re searching for a place to fit in, and you don’t even realize you’ve been there the whole time. Or how a bunch of posters can’t turn you into a role model if you’ve already been one for years. Of course, in my case, I knew exactly where I stood.  And it didn’t feel that good.
* 1.9 My Day Off- I guess what they say is true the people you work with really do become your family.  Like your brother, and your sister in law, or that cousin you have funny feelings for and the crazy angry uncle everyone sort of hopes isn’t coming this year.  Ah uncomfortable silences and alcohol…just like Thanksgiving at home.
* 1.10 My Nickname- Sometimes the only way to take a really good look at yourself is through someone else eyes.  If you’re lucky, you’ll like that you see…Or you’ll learn from it.  From that moment on, I knew I’d be “Bambi” forever.
* 1.11 My Own Personal Jesus- Babies are amazing.  Especially the way they bring people together.  I really think ’s impossible to be unaffected.  Because a baby can stir something deep down inside you didn’t even know was there.  They can help you find something you thought you’d lost.  So, I guess Turk was right after all: Miracles do happen.  I think you just have to be willing to look for them.
* 1.12 My Blind Date- I’ve been thinking a lot lately about taking chances…And how it’s really just about overcoming your fears.  Because the truth is, every time you take a big risk in your life, no matter how it ends up, you’re always glad you took it.
* 1.13 My Balancing Act- I guess they key to a lot of things is balance.  Whether it’s balance of power…balance in love…or sometimes just balance. For some of us, it seems too far out of reach….too difficult to achieve…but the important thing is just to never stop trying…especially if you like girls named Alex…and chicken salad.
* 1.14 My Drug Buddy- The speech always sounds the same, no matter whose mouth it comes out of--even if it’s someone you thought you could really like.  We ended up talking for a while after that…And I gave her some names of people that could help her.  But she never got back to me.
* 1.15 My Bed Banter and Beyond- (Dr.Cox) Relationships don't work the way they do on television and in the movies: Will they, won't they, and then they finally do and they're happy forever -- gimme a break. Nine out of ten of them end because they weren't right for each other to begin with, and half the ones that get married get divorced, anyway. And I'm telling you right now, through all this stuff, I have not become a cynic, I haven't. Yes, I do happen to believe that love is mainly about pushing chocolate-covered candies and, you know, in some cultures, a chicken. You can call me a sucker, I don't care, 'cause I do...believe in it. Bottom line...is the couples that are truly right for each other wade through the same crap as everybody else, but, the big difference is, they don't let it take 'em down...One of those two people will stand up and fight for that relationship every time, if it's right, and they're real lucky. One of them will say something.
* 1.16 My Heavy Meddle- I think everybody has their own way of releasing all the good stuff that gets bottled up inside them.  I guess it just took me a good friend to help me find mine.  It felt really good.
* 1.17 My Student- I think a lot of us get freaked out when med students come because it feels like being forced to accept new people into your family.  It changes everything.  Me, I was more struck by how these ‘newbies’ made me look at myself…Who I used to be…Who I am now…And who I might someday become.  But hopefully not too soon.
* 1.18 My Tuscaloosa Heart- The worst part of being a doctor is that you fall short a lot.  The best part is that if you wait around for a few seconds, you’ll get a chance to redeem yourself.  I guess there’s good and bad in all of us.  And once you’ve accepted all sides of yourself, it’s a lot easier to sleep at night.
* 1.19 My Old Man- Maybe the mistake we make is thinking our parents ill change.  And maybe they did a better job than we give them credit for.  And maybe there, amid all the crap they dumped on us, are some things worth keeping.  Like a passion for something you never knew you had.  Or the ability to constantly surround yourself with people who love you.
* 1.20 My Way or the Highway- When most of your time is spent fighting a constant stream of death and illness, you’ll look for any victory you can get, even if it’s just a victory over your own self-doubt.  Of course, sometimes, your ego leads you into battles you can’t possibly win.  And sometimes, you have to admit that feeling competitive isn’t a bad thing.  Because, if you truly believe you’re right, you have to be willing to fight for it.
* 1.21 My Sacrificial Clam- You know, when you start med school they warn you that you’re gonna have to make sacrifices…But I guess that means different things to different people.  Like giving up something you really want now for something you’ve wanted your whole life.  Or spending less time on yourself so you can spend time with someone you really love.  At some point, you might even have to give up your own sense of safety and well0bbeing.  But after a while, it doesn’t feel like you’re giving up anything at all.
* 1.22 My Occurrence- It was weird how everyone had come to see Ben off.  After all, he had only been here one day, and there wasn’t even anything wrong with him.
* 1.23 My Hero. I think one of the most universal human experiences is feeling alone.  You’d never know it, but there’s most likely tons of people feeling the exact same way.  Maybe because you’re feeling abandoned.  Maybe because you realize that you aren’t as self-sufficient as you thought.  Maybe because you know you should’ve handled something differently.  Or maybe because you aren’t as good as you thought you were.  Either way, when you hit that low point, you have a choice.  You can either wallow in self-pity…Or you can suck it up.  It’s your call. As for me, I decided that if Dr. Cox couldn’t do it, well then I would have to be the one there for Ben.  To most people, it might have seemed like nothing had changed. But it had a little.  As for Ben, he actually responded to the chemo and went into remission.  Hopefully, he won’t’ be back, but who knows? Still, that’s not what this story’s about.  It’s about the day I realized that admitting we’re not heroic is when we’re the most heroic of all.  I guess he’ll always be a hero to me.

One thing I would like to explain is that my mother has actually told me that there was a customer who works at PSEG willing to network students and that person asked me to send the resume to her email. Although she didn't ask for cover letter, I'm just writing it in the email.

cover letter:

I would like to thank you for making time to take a look at my resume and providing an opportunity to be part of the PSEG company workforce. Although I had the drive to work for PSEG after reading about the company many times, I was even more motivated to do so when my mother, (name), told me that you were willing to network for the internship position. I have attached the resume to the email.

Having received awards in community support and corporate performance as one of the most diversified energy companies, PSEG greatly piqued my interest. As the company provides various career opportunities while developing a green workforce which is heavily labor intensive, I believe that my passion for engineering and the past experiences will allow me to make a great contribution to the company,

As shown in the resume, along with the general engineering concepts obtained through academic progress, I was able to learn the effective ways of dealing with typical situations working as a volunteer and a part-timer. While I was volunteering at Englewood Hospital, the supervisor provided additional jobs for me to take care of acting as an administrative backup in the management field; she has taken an interest in my working process and offered useful information regarding how I could take these skills further. Taking advantage of these skills, as a cashier, I was instructed numerous times by the manager to act as assistance for instructing the newcomers. Although having good background knowledge in the specific field is necessary, I believe that knowing how to take advantage of it to its full potential when dealing with a problem is just as important, as it is greatly need in bringing about the best outcome. This show that I have what it takes to be part of the workforce and my willingness to get the job done properly for the company.

Should you wish to reach me, please feel free to call me at xxx-xxx-xxxx.

Once again, thank you for your time and consideration

1tyz0i,8,2013-12-29,"EET and EE, choosing the right school and career path",aParkedCar33,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/1tyz0i/eet_and_ee_choosing_the_right_school_and_career/,"I'm currently a sophomore electronics engineering technology student attending a state university that only offers a bachelors in EET and CET, no traditional engineering. The programs are part of the school's college of science and technology, and not particularly large (the school is primarily a business and education school, but well known for its Polymer Science department). Anyways, I'm strongly considering transferring to another state university my junior year to finish up EE. 

The EE school is  more engineering focused, including its career services. I have some scholarship at the school I'm currently attending, so the cost of the EE school would be bit more until I manage to find some scholarship there. I could cut back on living expenses at the EE school, and even have to option of living at home with my parents since this university is in my home town and about 30 minutes away. Even then, I think it would still come out to be a bit more expensive.  

So my question is, will it be worth the extra debt (probably around 2 grand more per semester for tuition) to obtain the EE degree? I met with the EE department chair a couple of months ago and he told me that my EET courses would not transfer over (which is somewhat frustrating considering I might have to take a circuit analysis course, despite already 3 hours of DC and 3 hours of AC). So I might even have to go another semester to make up for sophomore EE courses missed. I should be fine on GEC and math (I've had DE, linear, and all calc). 
I was also curious if anyone had any experience with MSEE programs accepting BSEET students? I might try to get the BSEET degree here and then get into the masters program at the EE school in question. I've heard some schools will allow it but require bridge courses, which I would be fine with. BSEET and BSCET graduates from my current school that pursue a masters do a computer science masters here that seems very hardware focused. This is also an option for me. I'm not sure what kind of work I would fine with this.

I suppose my main concern is being able to find a job after I graduate. I'm a pretty solid, dedicated student. I enjoy most of the electronics course work, especially digital design and the trig involved with AC analysis. Haven't figured out which field I would like to go into though. I generally understand and enjoy the math (which is why I feel a traditional engineering degree my be better suited for me). I have a 3.6 gpa and am a lab intern for introductory electronics labs. I just read so much now days about engineers not being able to find work, which worries me. I want to go with the choice that gives me more options for employment. So if anyone has any related advice, or any experience with BSEET compared to BSEE, it would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for the wall of text, I'm just going through some tough decisions and needed to vent a bit. "

I'm about to start my second semester of my freshman year in a top 10 computer science program. I'm trying to build up my resume for potential co-ops and internships starting as early as this summer. 

What should I be working on to make myself a better candidate for jobs? I just took an intro class in Python, and I'm taking a Java class next semester. Should I be working on an individual project in one of those languages, or should I try to teach myself another language? Any advice about what language to learn or what kind of project I could work on would be greatly appreciated!"

[Why does being part of a ""legacy"" help you get admitted?  Just because their parents went there, why should that help the child get in?  If a legacy applicant and a non-legacy applicant had pretty much the same qualifications (or the non-legacy just a little bit of an edge\), would the legacy applicant be chosen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecphcy?context=5)|If it were equal, yes.  That is simply how the Ivy League schools operate.  It is a, perhaps, unfair form of elitism...but, it is real.
[How does having grand parents whom were both professors at Harvard help with admissions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecrw54?context=5)|Harvard, and some of the other school place a strong value on legacy.  It helps.
[Is anyone even doing anything about this? To me, it goes against everything social and economic mobility has stood for. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecrvnd?context=5)|Private schools are private schools.  They are not a democracy.
[*Perhaps*?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecse73?context=5)|Elitism exists.  It depends on your take on it.
[Do you prefere a ballsy kid and application or the picture perfect kid who started a non-profit and had 4.0 ect? What is that ""it"" factor that you look for? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecp8gr?context=5)|Original thinker.  Someone who has done something different than the kid next door...whether in background, or interests.  I want to find someone interesting.
[How does it feel to be not Yale?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecofr8?context=5)|Haha. 
[If my parents are filthy rich, can I get into Harvard? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecof3s?context=5)|If your parents went to Harvard, you might have an easier time because of the legacy.  Wealth alone...you may be able to hire upper level admissions consultants at a very young age to ""groom"" you for the school.
 |So, just having money, no.  Having financial resources to get you where you want to go...it helps.
[What was the most unusual entrance essay you've ever read about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecp854?context=5)|I had a student who developed an advance method of wound healing, that was then adopted by the U.S. Army, and is currently used in combat as an ""on site"" medical treatment that has since helped soldiers all over the world.  
[Did you check to see if s/he was lying?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecr8l7?context=5)|I actually did decide to check her credentials, and she had actually won the Intel award for a completely different project, so I decided she was probably telling the truth.
[Advanced*? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecsc3r?context=5)|Yes, forgive my typos.
[If I single-handedly build a fully functional, and to scale gundam; can I get into Harvard? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecsgj2?context=5)|I don't even know what that is.
[So, what does it take to get in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecogog?context=5)|Demonstrating confidence in your essays and interviews.  Having the proper background in terms of AP courses, or equal college-level work.  Having very focused academic interests and goals for your potential future.  Backing this up with work or interests outside the classroom.  Demonstrating that you are an individual thinker.
[Any candidates that really stood out? Why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecogog?context=5)|I had a client just get into Princeton, early decision.  He had a very unique background, from Russia, very well-rounded cultured and educated interests (art, philosophy, music), spoke more than one language, and had outside awards and summer work experience that fit in with his future path and goals.  He was interesting, and had done so much already, though only 18.
[Do you believe Harvard is better than Oxford or Cambridge? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecpyrn?context=5)|Harvard is different than the English schools.  It also depends on your academic field of interest.
[What are the top 5 things a middle schooler needs to focus to get into Harvard?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecqlg0?context=5)|Take the most advanced classes your school offers.
 |Find out what you're interested in academically, and try to pursue things outside of class that will take that interest to a high level.
 |Study an additional language.
 |Start a business, a volunteer group, anything that shows...even on a very, very small level...leadership.
 |Do things that are interesting, and that sets you apart from the rest!
[6: Be black.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cectncw?context=5)|Be INTERESTING.
[Does it help if I make you laugh as long as I am grammatically correct?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecqvyi?context=5)|Yes.
[Do I HAVE to be grammatically correct?..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecr5ax?context=5)|If you want to be taken seriously...
[What are your opinions on Harvard grade inflation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecog7i?context=5)|I've read some articles.  I'm not so sure I believe it.  The students are very driven there, and most work very hard to get their A or (the horror) B.
[My dad's 44. He started working in his family business at the age of 19. At some point they were the number one company in India in their industry. Recently, due to his differences between the partners (his dogmatic uncles and megalomaniac cousins\), he mustered the courage to stand up to them and split up the business. Following this, he carefully invested his share in stocks and real estate. Now he makes more money through rent and real estate speculation than he ever made in the business. Essentially, his money is basically just multiplying itself.  My father was never given the chance to make his own decisions and follow his dreams. Now he finally feels that he is free to start fresh. And he aspires to pursue an MBA at Harvard. Does he make a strong applicant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecq8ds?context=5)|He would make a strong applicant, if he has a strong and focused plan regarding what he wants to pursue in the future, in terms of business, and how he believes an MBA will help him pursue his goals.  It's all about the narrative and story he can create and present in his essay, but age alone shouldn't deter him at all, as I have had many clients in their 40's get into the top Ivy programs.
[Do people from third world countries get accepted? Taking in count the education system in some countries aren't that advanced. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecpmeu?context=5)|Yes, they do.  The admissions committee wants to diversify their class. You still need to show that you can THINK at a very high level, even if you didn't have the opportunities that someone from the suburban U.S. had access to.  
[Perhaps some family connections and a generous donation to the university could grease the skids for him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecrv07?context=5)|Family connections do help in terms of legacy.  Donations, do not, except for the fact that they are usually made in terms of legacy.
[Is age a major consideration in hbs admissions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecpk4r?context=5)|They want MBA students who still have room to grow, and can make use of the degree, but I have had clients in their mid-40's who have gotten in, so no.
[Am I at a huge deficit that I didn't use a hbs alumni as a rec?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecpk4r?context=5)|No. A lot of recs come from various sources.
[If you don't mind, if I get an interview, I will certainly ask you more questions.Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecpk4r?context=5)|I do also offer interview consultation for my clients.  You can contact me through my website for exact fees.
[Hello! I'm curious how Harvard admission works regarding a spouse.  When I did my undergrad at BYU, I tutored a very beautiful girl who was taking classes at a local community college.  She married the son of a Marriott (of the hotel chain Marriott\) that was enrolled in the Harvard MBA program.  Soon after, she enrolled and graduated from Harvard.  I'm not sure how to put this, and I do not want to be rude, but the girl was not very bright.  Is entrance easier for the spouse of a concurrently enrolled student?  Or do family members of fortune 500 companies just have a easier go of it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecqlru?context=5)|Legacy + resources (money) + connections simply perhaps means they can hire the right people to help her say the right things to, perhaps, push her application through.  Is this ethical? No.  Does it happen?  I'm sure.  Of course, I don't know about your specific example.
[You could have saved your fingers and just said, ""Yes.""  It's like with many groups and clubs, you look after your own. Own, in this case, being 'legacy' as you put it, rich and influential people, and family there of.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecs8m6?context=5)|I, myself, had no legacy and got in.  I'm just saying it does exist.
[Why did you reject me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecr7rh?context=5)|Because you didn't give me what I was looking for.
[Aka he was white and didn't cure cancer ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecto5n?context=5)|Again, not true.
[Why would I want to go to a school that will keep me in debt for the rest of my life? Realistically, about how much on debt would someone be in after attending one of these schools?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecqeew?context=5)|Debt is something to seriously consider, as well as the career and money-making potential of the field you are aspiring to go into.  You could end up $80,000 in debt if you truly came in with no assets.
 |I know people who have done this and have done extremely well for themselves in life, and the school and connections they made while there are priceless...I know others who are still, 20 years later in debt. 
[Let's get to the main question here: how many applicants have tried to seduce you to get into Harvard? And how did that go for them? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecr9oz?context=5)|Hahaha...well that gave me a good laugh.  I will answer with: no one...though, did have some professors along the way, try to get my attention.
[What's your biggest pet peeve about applicants?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecot1j?context=5)|I have a problem with international, non-native speakers, who send me essays in really bad English. 
[What's the average interview question?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecor80?context=5)|""What are you interested in pursing, after graduation?""
[I don't know what I want to purse.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecr52e?context=5)|A lot of students don't know what they want to pursue.  I tell my students to pick something.  Everyone understands that, at this age, you can change your mind many times, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Just have a PLAN of what you MIGHT want to pursue, as schools like to see students who are focused (even if they later alter their plan or change their mind).
 |They want to see that initial focus.
[Well I'm curious.  What are you now pursuing?  (As a Harvard grad\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecrap4?context=5)|I run my own top tier admission consulting firm, based in Manhattan (NYC):  MBA Ivy League.com.  I am also very interested in managing investments, and real-estate, and growing my business world-wide.
[Do you believe that racial discrimination exists in college admissions at the Ivy leagues? I.e. Some races need higher GPA's and SAT scores than others? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecqu0l?context=5)|No, I have not seen that at all, truthfully.  
[What is one of the most important thing you look for in a college application, also how important is the essay?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecpizk?context=5)|The essays are the most important aspect, in my opinion.  I look for students who are confidence in how they come across on paper, have interesting and perhaps unusual pursuits and backgrounds, and are able to demonstrate they can excel at a very high level in their field (or show the potential to do so).
[What percentage of Harvard students receive Pell Grants?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecoen8?context=5)|Don't know.  It's really not looked at when evaluating an application.
[How optional are the optional essays?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecqxt3?context=5)|Not optional.  I tell ALL my clients to take the opportunity to provide the admissions committee with more information.
[Does the iB diploma actually receive a higher consideration as much as my high school says it does? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecrz1s?context=5)|Schools know the Baccalaureate has a higher standard than most U.S. high schools.
[Have you met Mark Zuckerberg?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecp5o5?context=5)|No. 
[What are some of the questions you ask every MBA applicant and what is the best way to answer them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecorpb?context=5)|I want to see a resume.  I want to see that they have at least SOME work experience (and preferably 3-5+ years) and I want to see (and I ask) that they have very focused goals and a reason for pursuing their MBA now, at this particular time, that makes logical sense.
[What did your high school transcript look like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecqtsj?context=5)|Interesting question.  I had straight A's, from a suburban high school, where I took all the AP classes offered.  Though my GPA was 4.0, my SAT scores weren't that great, because I would freeze up out of nervousness on standardized tests.  I still got in.
[Damn. Define your version of a 'great' sat score? And thanks for doing the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecr4cj?context=5)|You're welcome.  I'm still on the old scale with SAT's, because I don't pay attention to it anymore via my admissions firm (where I really just focus on essays and interviews).
 |On the old scale, any score over 1350 was considered good, anything over 1450, excellent.  Someone who knows how to convert the old to new scores, can perhaps do so, and post.
[I'll bet that you were a pretty fantastic student, academically. However, as you've said, there seems to be a lot of emphasis in modern admissions on unique or compelling narratives, or demonstrated originality. That being said, do you think you would be admitted today? Thanks so much for your answers!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecr7qu?context=5)|Yes.  I have always been a pretty original thinker, and came from an unusual literary and artistic background.
[If a 70 year old wanted to apply and had all the pre-requisites would that be a plus?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecpuqz?context=5)|It would certainly be interesting.
[How much of a difference does being an Eagle Scout make on an application, assuming you are otherwise similar to the next guy on the list?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecr256?context=5)|If you can show how that has influenced your life, values and goals, it would be considered and weighed as any other interesting extracurricular activity.  I have known some Eagle Scouts.
[High school students, I assume, can tend to have similar applications. What stands out to Harvard Admissions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecoz3g?context=5)|Someone who has done interesting and different things, or has an unusual background, story, or goals.  Ivy League schools are looking for ORIGINAL THINKERS.
[Why is there a big feud between Ivy schools? like Yale and Harvard?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecpss3?context=5)|People like to be competitive, and they like history, and that is a very long-standing rival (that is, I believe, all in good fun).
[What are the prospects for someone trying to get into Harvard for a Masters in an Engineering field, seeing as most Ivy's are more geared towards social sciences and liberal arts? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecojvg?context=5)|The Ivy's have solid engineering programs if you are interested in attaining a well-rounded education, and know someone in particular you want to work with (a certain professor or lab, for example).  If you are interested in extremely focused engineering though, you might be better off at MIT or Cal Tech.
[What are the general criteria for getting into Computer Science? Criteria that you list officially and don't. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecomml?context=5)|AP courses, 4 or 5 on the AP test in the field, and GREAT math scores on the SAT, as well as via your GPA.  Outside work in the subject also always helps, too.
[Awesome thanks. Unfortunately they don't offer AP classes in South Africa, would that be a problem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecor73?context=5)|No, not at all, as long as you could demonstrate college-level work in your subject, even if that is something you just do and read about independently in your spare time.  They want to see that you can converse and think on a college level...before you get to college.
[Assuming I read about things in my free time, but I don't have any actual volunteer work or work experience in that are (such as grant writing, for example\), how do I show that I know what I'm talking about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecquwk?context=5)|Get involved with something, outside of school, that does show your interest.  There is always some way to join something, participate in something, even if it's online.
[My little sister is graduating from high school next year, and while she has good grades and I know she's smart, she's less of a social person and this has hindered her interests in extracurriculars.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecquwk?context=5)|For example, I had a high school student who was interested in studying finance.  He decided, with his parent's, to open a day trading account and learn about the stock market via penny stocks.  It was something that made him interesting, didn't cost much at all, yet was something most high school students don't do...find something that parallels your sister's interests that she can get involved in.
[I wonder how my sister can pad her resume with tweets and Instagram photos.  Maybe something tech-related.  Or perhaps I'll convince her to start at a local community college.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecresg?context=5)|Taking classes at a community college would be great, as would perhaps trying to develop her own website or tech-related business online.  Anything that shows extended interest beyond the classroom...I don't know about tweets and photos on the resume? Sounds rather avant-guarde.
[If an applicant isn't necessarily perfect on paper interviews far and above other applicants how heavily does that weigh on admission?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecohzc?context=5)|Everything is taken into consideration.  I, personally, think the essays are the most important.
[Many colleges have started recommending gap years. What do they ivys's specifically harvard look for in a candidate who has taken a gap year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecovpu?context=5)|I am opposed actually to gap years, but if that is what a student has decided to do, I want to see that he/she has truly spent that year wisely, in vey interesting and unusual ways.
[What are your reasons for being opposed to the gap year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecqvun?context=5)|I think it possibly hints that something is wrong...that there is a reason the student couldn't or didn't want to simply continue pushing forward with very focused ambition and drive.
 |I work mainly with the top schools in the country, and it just makes me wonder why a student would even feel they ""need a break.""  I am, personally, more interested in students who are extremely competitive and push forward.
 |That said, if you are truly doing something interesting and it's fascinating, etc., I would change my opinion.  I had one student who took off for a gap year, because she was in the Olympics.
[Have you ever had any content in an application that made you laugh your ass off? As in, ""Did this guy actually think this would be appealing to an admissions office?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecr4fp?context=5)|Laugh, yes.  Feel sorry for a student because of their misguided attempt at an essay, also yes.
 |The funniest sentence I ever read, was from a kid whose very first sentence in his Common App read, ""I often play games where I am a very large Wizard.""  I had to actually pick up the phone and say, ""No, you cannot write about this for your Common App essay.""  It was pretty hilarious.
[What are the criteria for evaluating an admissions essay? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecoitf?context=5)|Good writing. Accomplishments that show the student's interest in the field outside of classwork, and a unique and CONFIDENT narrative.
[Serious question, hopefully I don't get a BS answer.  How do you think admissions at Harvard would change if the admissions committee did not have access to the applicant's race, last name, or any other piece of information from which race could be inferred?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecscjz?context=5)|I sincerely did not have race or gender come across as an issue.  I paid attention to international versus domestic applicants, and that was about it.  Beyond that, for me, it was all about what was on the page (essays, scores, etc).
[Do you look for similar qualities in both grad and undergrad  applications? E.g.

Thank you for your time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecry7e?context=5)|Work experience and your resume is much more important for the MBA, than any undergraduate experience.

I just feel so awful for them, and without demonstrating confidence and an ability to carry an adult conversation, there is just no way I can recommend they get in.  It breaks my heart, and I try to make them more at ease and comfortable, but sometimes there is just nothing I can do.
[Have you gotten any applications from Finland? If so, why did they get in? There is no culture here of people having a bunch of extracurriculars.

You could just have one, but if you do it well, and have some major, serious accomplishments in that arena, it's so much better than spreading yourself too thin.  I don't know (really, at all) but I would assume a program that has a strong computer/art foundation.  Cal Arts, on the West Coast, has a program I have heard of.  It means having an internship, at your age.  NYC is the best place in the country to get one -- just contact someone who is working in your field, even if it's just sending them a blind email, and ask if you can perhaps shadow them for a few days and/or apply for an internship, or volunteer.

Should I be worried?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecscv2?context=5)|Ideally, one would want to have A's in their AP classes, and attain the highest GPA possible, but as said elsewhere, everything is taken into consideration and it's not just based on grades alone.

1tybch,7,2013-12-29,Internship Program vs Current Good Situation,ShipOfHopes,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1tybch/internship_program_vs_current_good_situation/,"Howdy!

I'm in kind of a predicament that I didn't anticipate I'd ever be in as a CS student.

Currently, I have a good thing going for me.  My current position as a student developer for my school has me leading projects, working on actually important software, and not being pigeonholed into some ""intern project"".  I interact with our client (Dept. of Transportation), I get experience with all phases of development and testing, and I get to work directly with a Senior SE nearly every day.  Additionally, I get to work with awesome people in an open space with powerful workstations that have two screens.  We have licenses for every .NET piece of software, use TFS religiously, and get to work with the latest versions of everything.  This position will, assuming I don't take another position, last until I graduate.  However, if I take another position over six months, I can't guarantee a spot for me when I get back.  My boss, the Senior SE, is well-connected in the Portland area and many students end up working for a company under his referral.

On the other hand, I'm a part of a competitive internship program.  The program I've been accepted to will *guarantee* me two six-month internships with companies in my area over the next two years.  I have no idea which companies I will intern with, nor do I have control over who picks me (aside from interview performance).  I know that internships run the gamut - some interns are just given a laptop and told to have some web application done in six months, but others get more hands-on work.  The program is well-known in the state, and most students who go through the program end up with job offers from one of the companies they worked for.  This will offset my graduation by a year.  The pay will be about $10 more per hour than my current position.

Then there's the X-factor, my life outside of school and work.  I have an amazing living situation with great roommates, a great location, cheap rent, and a whole house to live in (rather than just getting a room) with a very hands-off landlord.  I also have a girlfriend who I'd like to spend more than just weekends with.  If I left for an internship program, I'd be giving up my living situation and there would probably be some stress involved with the girlfriend, traveling over weekends, not necessarily having a wonderful place to go cycling in my free time, etc.

**TL;DR** - I have a great living situation with a great job, with the opportunity to get a better job while in school, but at the cost of my living situation and no guaranteed spot back at my old position.

What are /r/cscareerquestions' thoughts?  Could two higher-paying internships with companies in the area be worth leaving my current position and dealing with other issues?"
1ty5nd,1,2013-12-29,I'm so sick of my friends/family making me feel bad about being happy in my relationship. (TLDR at the bottom),[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ty5nd/im_so_sick_of_my_friendsfamily_making_me_feel_bad/,"I am in an amazing relationship with an amazing man right now. 

Brief history of the guys I've dated in the past:
Boyfriend 1: Currently addicted to heroin and play guitar is a crappy band.
Boyfriend 2: Failed out of acting school and is living at home, but generally a nice guy.
Boyfriend 3: Incredibly abusive relationship, lasted far too long, he's now out of jail and living in the same town as me (He always had) but he's sorted his anger issues out and he has apologized, but I told him that I wouldn't be able to be his friend after what we'd been through, and he's accepted that and we're at relative peace.
Boyfriend 4: I am a hardcore liberal, he is the biggest conservative republican I've ever met. Why we dated I have no clue, but it ended poorly after an abortion debate in the middle of a diner.

Current situation:
I am dating the sweetest guy, he's so considerate. We met at college and after I had to leave due to injury, we remained in a relationship and worked out the long distance. It's really hard, the distance really hurts, but we're working through it and doing what we can to keep things going. We get to see each other every other month or so (sometimes we're lucky, like this winter break he's staying with me for a week and then I'm going to his house for the weekend before he has to leave again) and when we do get together we're practically joined at the hip. I've never been happier in a relationship. We're very open with each other. If something is bothering one of us, we go immediately to the other person to talk it out and figure out a solution that works for both of us. We like surprising each other with little gifts in the mail and online in some games we play. We have the same humor, the same taste in movies, games, music, food, etc. Everybody who knows us can't believe we've actually found each other.

Here's where I can't take it, though. I'm so happy, yet I can't talk about it with anybody! My friends are all so shitty at relationships. My best friend has never been in one, my other friend has been is short high school relationships and now has a fuck buddy, and my other friend goes through guys like she goes through eyeliner. If I bring up my relationship with any of them, they get uncomfortable, and that's the last thing I want for them so I don't talk about it. My sister doesn't give a shit about anything or anybody and if I even tried she'd tell me to leave her alone. My parents are iffy. My dad doesn't like my boyfriend (probably because he's the first boyfriend who actually makes me laugh and so far through my whole life the only guy to make me laugh was my dad and I think that he realizes I'm growing up and he doesn't want me to be stolen away by some big hairy bearded man), and my mom makes me feel guilty about the long distance. 

My boyfriend is going to school to become a programmer, and I'm currently out of school after I suffered an overuse injury and can no longer continue my major. My boyfriend is a thousand times smarter than I am, bookwise. We're basically yin and yang. He's great at math and science, I'm good at english and current affairs, and we meet in the middle and geek out all the time. My mom focuses on the math and science, and often tells me that the long distance won't work out and that he could easily find a girl at his engineering school and that they'd make loads of money and that I'm just holding him back from this amazing future she's creating in her mind for him. The thing is, we both want to work in the video game industry. He wants to be a programmer and I want to do sound design and audio post production for games. We've often talked about starting a small company together and making a few games once he graduates. He wants to move to the city with me and get an apartment and an internship or job to help pay for the apartment so that he can be with me while I finish school. 

I can't tell anybody any of this because nobody will talk to me about it and it's one of the only good things in my life right now and it just hurts so much that the people I care about most are making me feel ashamed to be so happy. They know about my past relationships, and I speak openly about the abusive relationship I was in because I was in that dark place and somebody pulled me out of it and I've done the same for a few other girls by telling them my experience and helping them realize that they're in abusive relationships when they didn't realize it. 

TLDR: I'm in my first happy, healthy relationship and my closest friends and family are making me feel ashamed about it."

Please help?",collegekid707,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1txmda/complicated_situation_between_me_21_m_and_my_best/,"I know this is long but please give it a read if you have time, it would mean the world to me if I could get a different perspective on my situation:

---

I'm a senior in college now and met this incredible girl last December (junior year), she's two academic years younger than me. We quickly became best friends and I don't use that term lightly - we trusted each other a lot and it was us against the world. After I first met her, all her friends advised her to not hang out with me (I have a bad rep at college due to different reasons) but she still does and we get really close, really fast. Later in the semester, she has a falling out with a whole group of friends - a mutual group of friends that we made. I feel they're in the wrong so I choose to lose the group and keep her as a friend.

---

It gets to the point where she is one of the few friends I had left (definitely the closest one) and I was the only friend she had left at school - I would do almost anything for this girl. A month later in the semester, I found out she really likes me  (she never initiates any of these conversations but I can sense she wants to talk about it so I ask her how she feels) so I sit down with her and tell her that I care about her as a friend but not more because I'm still getting over a previous relationship which is the truth. I don't tell her that I'm not physically attracted to her. She says she understands but nothing changes in our relationship (we're both responsible for that because we like hanging out with each other so much) and right before the summer starts, she tells me she loves me. I'm surprised and confused (I had a feeling that she still liked me but didn't know it had actually escalated) and I tell her the truth - she's mistaking her deep infatuation for love, she's my best friend, I'm graduating in a year, I don't believe long-distances work and every emotional and/or physical relationship I have had has ended terribly with the girl and me not being on talking terms anymore (she's never kissed a guy or been in a relationship) and our friendship is too valuable to me for me to lose for a year of possibly being together (assuming we break up when I graduate) so it's not a good idea. I can see she's heartbroken but I felt it had to be done.

---

Summer comes around and I move to a different state for an internship, she stays here and texts me a couple of times but I don't respond - not because I didn't want to talk to her but because I'm making new friend and just engrossed in a new life. One day, I miss her and ask her if she wants to Skype and she says yes so we Skype and we Skype and it feels really good - we catch up on each others lives but don't discuss feelings at all. Rest of the summer passes by uneventfully, I hook up with a co-worker without feeling guilty and we talk a couple of times over text but nothing major.

---

I get back to school for my senior year and we meet up the first day and nothing has changed when we're together - our friendship is still fantastic. I make another really close friend (a guy) that I meet through her and I find out she also made two close friends (both guys) over the summer. Semester progresses and I get the feeling that she still likes me. We're alone one night and I initiate the conversation asking if she still likes me and she says yes. I ask her why and tell her that I thought the summer had helped over get over me - she says she thought so too but she realized it hadn't when she saw me again and she cannot explain why she likes me so much. I get a little mad at her and tell that she has to get over me because I won't be in school for too much longer and I hate seeing her get hurt like this. She cries and I comfort her saying that I want the best for her and I'm thinking long-term.

---

Semester passes by and we hang out even more than before - we enjoy each others presence a lot and spend a lot of our free time together, without even thinking about it. We both realize that I'm going to graduate in a year and go off to a different state (for grad school, most probably) and we keep talking about how we have only a little bit of time left (little more than one semester) and how much our friendship means to both of us and how we should make the most of the time we have left. She admits that I'm the closest friend she's had and I tell her that she's the closest friend I have at college which is the truth. She tells me that she never wants to jeopardize our friendship. Towards the end of the semester, I start hooking up with this other girl on a regular basis but it's purely physical - it reduces the amount of time I spend with my friend but I don't explicitly tell her about the girl I'm hooking up with because I don't want to hurt her. Every night I spend with this hook-up girl makes me realize how much of the emotional connection I miss with someone (we're emotional opposites) even though I'm very attracted to her physically. One night, me and my hook-up talk about feelings and as a part of the conversation, I admit that I would choose my friend over her (the hookup) because she means a lot to me. The hook-up ends soon afterwards (for different reasons) and I'm back to hanging out with this girl even more than before.

---

It's the last few weeks of the semester - I ask her casually at one point if she would choose to keep our friendship for a long time to come or be in a relationship with me if it means it's only for a semester and she says friendship - I'm pleasantly surprised to hear that but also a little shocked. Fast forward to her birthday and I throw her the most incredible surprise party. I get her a necklace and earrings that I knew she wanted (not diamond or anything) and she loves it. We start spending almost all our free time together - we start having sleepovers in my room since my roommate is never there. We watch movies till 5AM and then I let her sleep on my bed and I take the floor every single time. Something is different- even though I'm not physically attracted to her, I like her because she's always there for me and has never wronged me. She's nice to me and cares about me and I care about her too. One night, she gets really drunk and lies next to me with her head on my chest and I take care of her - she keeps looking at my lips because I know she wants us to kiss but I know I can't. A few days later, we even start to give each other massages while we're sober (it's not sexual but it's definitely something) and we both laugh it off saying out friendship is ""weird"" so it's okay but we both know it's different from just a friendship at this point.

---

Semester ends and winter break starts - we go back to our families and we live 40 minutes from each other. We spend two of the first three days of winter break spending the day with each other. Except something is different now - after the second day of hanging out, I don't want her to leave. I ask her when she can hang out next and she says not for a week at least because her parents are getting suspicious and that makes me sad. I want to hang out with her again the next day but I know I can't. I get home and things get worse - I can't stop thinking about her at all. I wake up in the mornings and if I don't see a text message from her, I get anxious. I can't stop thinking about her at all - I feel like I'm going crazy. I look at myself in the mirror and tell myself that I need to learn to be emotionally content by myself without having my happiness dependent on her but I can't stop. I even dream about her which is weird, she's all that is on my mind. We text once or twice during the day and I get anxious every time it takes her a while to reply. I can tell I'm insecure even though she hasn't given me any reason to be. I don't want to lose her. We Skype yesterday and day-before-yesterday at night and both days something is different in our relationship dynamic- we flirt a lot more and tell her I miss her a lot and half our Skype session is us smiling at each other, just happy to talk to each other and reminisce all the good times we've had back at school and how neither of us have any idea how we're going to manage without each other after I graduate. We promise to be there for each other even if the world turns against us in the future.

---

We've taken care of each other when we're drunk. She's been there for me the way a girlfriend would be there for her boyfriend me even though I was only there for her the way a good friend would be in the beginning but over the past semester, I've done for her equally as much as she's done for me. I was never physically attracted to this girl. It's gotten to the point now where I think that I'm dependent on her emotionally so much that I don't care what she looks like, I just be with her all the time. I'm a straight guy and physical attraction has always been a big deal for me but I feel like I don't need it right now with her. Our life goals are too different - she wants to date one person and wants to end up marrying that person by the time she's 24 while I want to date as many people as possible and settle down when I'm 30. Our families are too different. Our morals are different. I've been with multiple girls in the past - physically and emotionally while she's never been with anyone. She's a little immature and doesn't always think long-term but I can't stop thinking about the long-term consequences. She does have a lot of quirks that bothered me a lot when we were friends but I overlooked it because we were just friends but now I don't seem to mind them anymore. Our personalities are VERY different but we just get along really well. I don't see us getting married and I feel I would not be very happy if we ever got married but maybe I'm thinking too far.

---

I feel I might just be missing the emotional connection with someone and since she's always been there for me and I'm home for break, away from all my friends and the fact that she was always around me back at school, I'm just craving her presence with me all the time now. If that's true though, why can I not stop thinking about all the times ME and HER have spent together? Why do I keep thinking about her even 90% of my day for the past 5 days?
If I talk to her and tell her that I like her too, it gives her hope and assuming she still likes me, we might go for the relationship. I want this but I realize it's a terrible decision from a long term perspective - assuming we get through the semester, we either end the relationship as soon as I graduate in May which would result in both of us feeling MUCH WORSE as compared to how we feel now since at that point we'll be even more emotionally (and possibly even physically) attached to each other and it would be much harder to deal with it emotionally then. Even worse, there is a very good chance that we have to completely cut off talking to each other to get over each other at that point in which case we lose our friendship which matters immensely to both of us. I can only see a lot of pain for both of us.
 
---

But my fucking heart doesn't understand this and contradicts my brain. I think that if I don't do anything, it's going to drive me crazy because I can't stop thinking about her. I don't want to look back on this and think ""What if I'd gone for it with her?"" even though I cannot see any good way for this to end. If there's one thing I hate, it's having regrets and right now, I can't imagine her being with any other guy because I want to be with her even though it doesn't make sense.

---

**I'm supposed to be seeing her at some point again this week. What do I do now?**

---

TL;DR - I've fallen for the girl who's my best friend and possibly likes me too but I don't know what to do."

I've been away at university for about 5 years now (also in CBT for that 5 years) and for some reason as I was sitting on my parents' couch tonight, I got hit with intense homesickness. I got incredibly sad and excused myself to go to my room to cry. I'll be leaving in a few days to return to school and my new internship, but my heart just hurts and I don't want to. I sound like such a baby but I just want to stay home with my mom and dad. We haven't had the greatest relationship as I was growing up but over the past year or so my parents and I have gotten very close. Not being able to see them for more than once every few months (possibly not until May this time) has been impacting me a lot more than it initially did when I left for college.


I left my anti-anxiety meds at school so I'm just flailing around on my bed, sobbing and spiraling into extreme sadness and homesickness. I haven't had such intense negative emotions since I started my Celexa about a year ago and it's throwing me for a loop. I don't understand what happened that made me so sad as I was just sitting there. Is it normal to have intense homesickness years after separation? I'll definitely be making an appointment with my therapist as soon as I get back but until then I don't know how to handle myself. I don't want to be sad around my mom because then she gets sad and cries, which leads me to cry even more. |: Ergh...


Anyway, thanks for reading."

We would chat only a bit each time we ran into each other and I would always get a big stupid smile on my face when I saw her. I graduated back in May 2013 while she has two and half more years school left and I never told I had a crush on her because I was focused on getting a job or an internship after graduation and was really just to shy to tell her.

I gave here my email before I graduated so that we could stay in touch and we have been emailing each other since then. I had two internships with one being in the summer and one in the fall. Right now I'm back home, but I'm waiting to here back on internship and job opportunities. All of my opportunities will place me across the country (U.S) or in England. I'm wondering if should tell her I have a crush on her the next time I email her or just forget about it?"

I am currently 19 years old, living in The Netherlands. I'm doing my degree in 'technisch informatica' at a university for applied sciences. If I had to explain my degree in english: Embedded software engineering/system programming. Everything's going pretty good with university, I'm thinking about finishing the final 1.5 years trying to graduate cum laude (with honors) but I'm not sure about that yet.

Anyways, school requires me to do 2 internships (or rather, co-ops since they take 5 months each). I'm doing my first internship as we speak at a company in The Netherlands but I'm thinking about doing my second internship in the US (the second internship is also called a graduation internship since this internship determines whether you graduate university or not). I'm wondering if there are any companies in the US willing to go through the immigration process after I'd done with the internship and graduated properly from university with a bachelors degree?

It's pretty common in The Netherlands for companies to take in the graduate internees after they're done with their internship and graduated to work for them but I wonder if this also can be applied to companies in the US. I mean I'll be basically working for the company for a good 5 months, showing my capabilities.

Would it be preferred for companies in the US to do this instead of some just-graduated kid from Europe knocking on their door asking if they have a job and are willing to go through the immigration process? Should I mention this when doing internship interviews? Is there even an immigration process at all to go through for an internee from another country?"

1twv7t,1,2013-12-28,Please Critique My Resume!,[deleted],gisjobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/gisjobs/comments/1twv7t/please_critique_my_resume/,"Recently graduated with my master's degree in GIS, looking for some resume advice before I send it out.

I currently work as an intern for my state geological survey publishing geothermal data. I have a passionate interest in any type of environmental GIS (getting pretty popular these days) and I'm taking the next few weeks to really figure out where I want to be, geographically. World is my oyster.

Had a few relapses due to the people I called my 'friends'. My life was going downhill before that moment because I dropped out of college, spent all my money on raves, watched porn a few times a week. I won't go into too much detail but I decided to get my life back in order. I moved out of state because I got into CUDenver, changed my major, made new friends, got 1 B and 3 A's, and will be starting an internship.

What's different?:
-Now that I have a new life and so much freetime I've become more productive and motivated
-Less video games during school
-More social (except in class, not sure if I need to work on that or not)
-All girls become attractive
-I know what needs to be done so I do it, aka not lazy
-A lot of self realizations occurred
-Less anxiety (probably due to long term effects of weed)
-View on life is different
-Ability to learn improved
-People look up to me
-Not as timid and voice out my opinions more (doing so gave me more control in my life and highly recommend it if you are shy)
-I've been eating a lot more (I'm skinny)
-Exercise (don't have a car so I bike and walk a lot)
-Happy to be alive
-Strong desire to be very successful
-Very independent
-Always learning whether it be useful skills to know for my career, to random facts and self-improvement speeches
-Feel more masculine (kept my facial hair from no shave november still lol)


Downside to nofap:
-Wetdreams
-You become the minority in a sexuallized culture
-Pickup artists seem lame and needy/creepy (only works for slutty women)
-Urges are still there, just not as strong (same for drugs)
-More random erections


tl;dr
I recommend nofap to all men. I wish I learned this in school when I was young. 90 days isn't enough, 1 year is more like it, but I'm not expecting to relapse ever again because I like what I have going on on my life right now."

I'm getting to the point where I don't want to be in my home town for the coming summer, so I've been applying for various big name internships. So far, I've gotten one phone interview, which did not result in an offer.

One of the biggest problems I've found myself facing is the lack of experience. I started coding my first semester of college, while most of the friends I've made in my field at school have been doing development since the beginning of high school, if not earlier. Competing with them is obviously difficult at times.

Here is the resume I've been sending out, which I feel is fairly strong but could use improvement, so do your worst. I'd especially appreciate input from interviewers or people involved with recruitment. I do plan on replacing the snowboard instructing with a personal project that I've been working on over the holidays soon, but I'd like to get it a bit more polished before I put it on there.

September 18th 2013, 11:55pm
I had work tomorrow.
I was a few episodes behind and had just finished ”Say My Name” of Breaking Bad. As the credits rolled I warmed a cup of milk and popped two melatonin because I had to get some shuteye. All night I didn’t even bat an eye. From the warmth of my bed I laid and stared out of my window towards the silhouetted Flatirons thinking about work in the morning with my professor. I was entombed in plush blankets and mentally firing on all cylinders. All throughout the dead of night: The adventures of Jesse and Walter kept me awake. In my ponderings I thought about how in the show, Jesse’s knowledge of the underground drug market and it’s lucrativeness enticed Walter into “cooking” after a ride along with Hank. I thought about how in my life, my teacher’s knowledge of the legal medical marijuana business and educational background had enticed me into working in the marijuana business. 
Was I in over my head?
I watched the rising sun rinse the jagged rocks protruding from the Boulder tree line lathered in moonlight clean. I think I had been up all night. On the nineteenth of September my alarm chirped promptly at 7:00am before I swatted it into silence. Half asleep, I robotically snapped out of bed, showered, and dressed myself for an interview. I was starting my first day in the drug business, and my sociology teacher was putting his credibility on the line by vouching for me – I needed to look sharp.
I had grown up in the kitchen. I told him I had taken numerous cooking classes. I had, but that was some time ago. The dietary supplements of a Boulder college student are mainly comprised of Coors and Top Ramen, with the occasional late-night taco or deep-fried Twinkie. I knew I could cook, but would I be rusty?
Would I let them down?
I darted downstairs so quickly I had forgotten my car keys. However I did remember my “Colorado Support Medical Marijuana License Application.” A document which could only be properly filled out after reading a hundred-and-some pages about learning how to apply for a state-issued “badge” in the Colorado medical marijuana industry. Dashing back up three flights of fraternity stairs, I had broken a sweat. Now I was “sweaty”. This stressed me because I didn’t appear what I felt was “presentable”. Keys in hand, I wiped my brow and bolted back at breakneck speed. I was in the parking lot at 7:23am. Antsy to say the least, the drug business was already taking its toll on my psyche.
I reflected on our relationship for thirty-some minutes. In my sociology course, I had attended every opportunity to listen and talk. I made my attendance known. I had been yip-yip yipping away at him until he finally threw me a bone. I wondered, maybe this was to shut me up; maybe this was to challenge me, could it be a setup? Regardless, it wasn’t in the syllabus.
So, where does a student meet their professor for the first day of edible medical marijuana manufacturing? Someplace discrete, someplace populated, someplace that’s open at 8:00am. Of course! At an already existing socially accepted drug distribution center!

Texts exchanged at the Starbucks parking lot at Broadway and Baseline.
“I’ll be in a white Ford Explorer”
“I’m in Bagel Bros, be out in a couple min”
“Awesome”
I secured my coffee in the cup holder, pulled out of my parking spot, and followed his car blending into traffic. 
We puffed down Highway 36 through a foggy fall morning in Boulder. After some time, near Lyons we made a left into an old parking lot. Behind it, nestled into the mountain was a large system of tan buildings constructed from corrugated metal. Outside the front door was a cable system for the employee’s dogs so they could have limited mobility outdoors during the workday (I would later compare this to the apparatus that enslaved Jesse Pinkman in the season finale.)
Upon entry the owner, a stylish older woman donning a turtleneck and scarf greeted me warmly with a soft voice. I ditched my sweater, and rolled up the sleeves on my dress shirt, and got to work. I started with a batch of brownies and the owner helped familiarize me with her kitchen as they baked (and eventually burned per my first-day failure). Marvelously, industrial in feel, and immaculately clean I noted the name brands of her ingredients and equipment; and yet upon first glance, the kitchen was eerily similar the Gustavo Fring’s Laundromat for Walter and Jesse. On shelves and stoves were Paula Deen cookware (presumably purchased prior to her notorious ‘plantation wedding’), pounds of chocolate, cases of peanut butter, fair-trade spices, organic eggs, and other staple ingredients needed for a Boulderite’s bakery. It was clear upon arrival that she has never been a person to cut corners. This was evident after my in-depth lesson from her head chef on how to successfully paint her signature criss-cross chocolate drizzle pattern. I knowingly choose to omit her name, and her chef’s name because of the nature of her profession.
 There was a “no-bullshit” air about her that made me feel incredibly fortunate to have another straightforward friend. That being said, the only thing in life worth sugar coating is a gingersnap with 150mg of ‘activated’ THC. We shared a mutual appreciation that if an “edible” doesn’t look impressive, it doesn’t get sent out. Her product had a gourmet reputation that I would be responsible of upholding and that needed to be clear to me.
“Emerald butter”. That was the product I was asked to produce whenever I was tasked with decarbing trim. The device I used to manufacture it was originally a paper press, but it had been modified with bamboo and a mesh bag to filter plant material out of liquid butter. I criticized this tool for it’s crudeness and within a week, the hashish-maker next door had a reinforced steel six-ton “tincture press” sitting in its place. There was no wood glue binding bamboo board to bamboo board, there were industrial welds fusing an automotive jack to a steel basket. This device was serious, it compressed pounds of trim to the size of a hockey puck, something that it’s predecessor never could have fathomed. “Canna-butter” would be transformed into treats and cut with regular butter to reduce taste. The treats bake just as any other treats bake, yet they often have a green hue. These desserts are always made in large batches; it’s never a sheet of brownies it’s sheets of brownies at a time.
After creating a concoction, samples are sent off and tested by an independent lab before they are used or sold. This assures that the proper dosages are maintained and that nobody will be left drooling and clinging to their couch with beady eyes while their friend yawns in boredom and asks “is yours working? I don’t feel mine yet…”
This was no after-school smoking session; this was hard science in a laboratory.
Above one of the countertops was a line with multiple orders clipped to it. Each of these dockets was for a separate dispensary and displayed complex medical marijuana edible orders looking something like:
Terrapin
8:07am 11-18-2013

Merciful Brownies (4 of ea.) x 12
Mint Chill Brownies (2 of ea.) x 6
Sweet Dreams (indica) x 6
Day Trippers (sativa) x 6
Key Lime Kickers (2 of ea.) x 6
Pop-Star Caramel Corn (sativa) x 10
Hey, Sugar! (hybrid) x 6
Buddha Budda (indica) x 3
Dazed and Infused Olive Oil (sativa) x 3
Good Day Sunshine (2 of ea.)x 6
Raspberry Jam Bar (2 of ea.) x 6

Upon completion of an order, the page would be unclipped and put into an inconspicuous reused box, sent off to another medical marijuana facility within the state of Colorado. Whenever an order was being sent out to a dispensary, the driver needed a copy of the docket as a manifest in the rare event that they were searched by law enforcement and needed to explain why they had a gross of individually sealed psychedelic snack cakes in their Ford Fiesta. On the smaller refrigerator adjacent to the countertop there was a whiteboard with the names of dispensaries written in dry erase marker, under them were various check marks to show how close each order was to completion.  This was not just a business; this was somebody’s life passion. 
Another hilariously wild aspect of the medical marijuana industry is its lack of governmental oversight. Yes-yes, this is an industry based around regulation, but where in the hell was OSHA? I once watched the hashish-maker next door to our kitchen consolidate two cumbersome ceramic jugs containing liquid nitrogen before a day of work. 
The hashish maker is quite the character – taming the Wild West with weed. He always wears cowboy boots, ripped jeans, prescription goggles, and nitrile gloves. His wife is a talented baker, sweet, and a sucker for rescue animals and it’s clear that the two of them care for each other a great deal. These two arrive to work early just to make sure everyone is fed before a long day and they never shy away from asking if anyone wants a breakfast burrito before they go out to buy their own. He has many tattoos one of which clearly reads “STUPID HURTS”. He hails from the great state of Wyoming, and his knowledge of firearms vouches for it 
“Yeah I’m thinking about getting myself a little snub .38, a wheel-gun right on my ankle, you know? Something reliable and light.”

He needed all of his solvent in one vessel for that day’s batch. I stood there open-mouthed as he poured the frigid liquid from one jug to another. A white fog rolled down from the mouths of the containers and blanketed the ground. He was in a tee shirt. Another employee asked “is it safe to be in here while you are doing this?” I wondered the same thing. “Yeah! The atmosphere is like 70% nitrogen anyways, you’re fine man,” he chirped. I pictured his bare arms shattering from exposure like a rose I had seen in some science experiment. I thought to myself  “Employees must wash hands, mannnnn.” 
I was out of ‘the game’ even faster than I had entered it. After four weeks I told my boss I needed to focus on my remedial math course; she was sweet and witty about my situation. “You mean your parents won’t understand if I tell them I’m in real need of you, that I think baking pot brownies is more important than your college education?” We laughed. I asked if I could come back in the summer and she said “of course.” I drizzled my last batch of brownies and bid the bakery adieu.
Two weeks later, I received an email from work asking if I could help line them up with new packaging. I eagerly agreed. I investigated the laws of ‘child-proof packaging’ and ‘tamper-evident seals’ extensively on my Thanksgiving flight to Grand Rapids, Michigan. By my flight back to Denver, I could tell you that before heating and extrusion, clear injection-molded polyurethane costs slightly more than dyed polyurethane, this is because dyed polyurethane can be recycled from other dyed scrap polyurethane, whereas clear polyurethane requires a higher, definitively colorless, grade of resin pellet. I learned that if you’re buying child-resistant-tamper-evident and resealable containers online by the flat, you could talk the supplier down below their advertised ‘seventy cents per unit’ cost. I was ready to meet and talk packaging.
Texting my professor from the bakery parking lot November 21, 2013 at 11:51am
“Well I just got an earful from a cop outside of the bakery and the 9 News Team is there. I had plans to design master packaging today with the owner. …. Doors are broken down and there’s cops in camo with dogs and trashbags.

“They broke into the bakery!?! The owner said they’re just concerned about something farther up the road”

“I just saw them going in and out of the hash manufacturing facility [next door], the bakery door was closed, but when I got off the phone with her she felt like they were going to (and could) dismantle her kitchen. So much anger. The cops told me “the bakery is closed.”

“JESUS!”

“Yeah my heart sank. I’m always down to buy a Winnebago and cook brownies in the desert with you if the tough gets going.”

“Lol, thanks man. I needed that laugh. I’m freakin out right now.”

“It’ll work out amigo. This could be a nice conversation to cite in your dissertation lol”

My Explorer’s battery was dead that morning, so my girlfriend had volunteered to drive me to work to drop off my packaging suggestions. Upon arrival a DEA agent greeted us. He had camouflage pants (“for blending in”) tucked into black calf-high boots, a camouflage dress shirt with his last name in “BLOCK CAPITOL LETTERS”, mirrored sunglasses, a buzz cut, and a powerful ready stance (feet shoulder width apart, holding his hands behind his back). His German Shepherd was clipped to the previously mentioned cable system – that would have angered my co-workers. I held back a grin when the words “Kung-Fu Grip” came to mind during his questions; he looked like an action figure.

Chatting with the DEA

“Where are you headed?”

“The Bakery – I have a meeting with the owner”

“They’re closed, so I ask that you two pull in right here and make a U-Turn and be on your way.”

“Alright”



The interaction was cold and curt. I would later learn from my professor that the DEA knocked down doors to all of the businesses in that lot, and they had apparently read their warrant “incorrectly”.  They did not target the hash-maker or the owner of the bakery, they targeted the nearby marijuana grows. Legality aside, I enjoyed an educational internship in the marijuana business with my professor in the fall of 2013.
I had learned how to confect gourmet medical marijuana infused desserts with my professor, left the job, designed packaging, and been subject to DEA questioning in less than two months. I broke brownies with the best in Boulder."

I was a few episodes behind and had just finished ”Say My Name” of Breaking Bad. As the credits rolled I warmed a cup of milk and popped two melatonin because I had to get some shuteye. All night I didn’t even bat an eye. From the warmth of my bed I laid and stared out of my window towards the silhouetted Flatirons thinking about work in the morning with my professor. I was entombed in plush blankets and mentally firing on all cylinders. All throughout the dead of night: The adventures of Jesse and Walter kept me awake. In my ponderings I thought about how in the show, Jesse’s knowledge of the underground drug market and it’s lucrativeness enticed Walter into “cooking” after a ride along with Hank. I thought about how in my life, my teacher’s knowledge of the legal medical marijuana business and educational background had enticed me into working in the marijuana business. 
Was I in over my head?
I watched the rising sun rinse the jagged rocks protruding from the Boulder tree line lathered in moonlight clean. I think I had been up all night. On the nineteenth of September my alarm chirped promptly at 7:00am before I swatted it into silence. Half asleep, I robotically snapped out of bed, showered, and dressed myself for an interview. I was starting my first day in the drug business, and my sociology teacher was putting his credibility on the line by vouching for me – I needed to look sharp.
I had grown up in the kitchen. I told him I had taken numerous cooking classes. I had, but that was some time ago. The dietary supplements of a Boulder college student are mainly comprised of Coors and Top Ramen, with the occasional late-night taco or deep-fried Twinkie. I knew I could cook, but would I be rusty?
Would I let them down?
I darted downstairs so quickly I had forgotten my car keys. However I did remember my “Colorado Support Medical Marijuana License Application.” A document which could only be properly filled out after reading a hundred-and-some pages about learning how to apply for a state-issued “badge” in the Colorado medical marijuana industry. Dashing back up three flights of fraternity stairs, I had broken a sweat. Now I was “sweaty”. This stressed me because I didn’t appear what I felt was “presentable”. Keys in hand, I wiped my brow and bolted back at breakneck speed. I was in the parking lot at 7:23am. Antsy to say the least, the drug business was already taking its toll on my psyche.
I reflected on our relationship for thirty-some minutes. In my sociology course, I had attended every opportunity to listen and talk. I made my attendance known. I had been yip-yip yipping away at him until he finally threw me a bone. I wondered, maybe this was to shut me up; maybe this was to challenge me, could it be a setup? Regardless, it wasn’t in the syllabus.
So, where does a student meet their professor for the first day of edible medical marijuana manufacturing? Someplace discrete, someplace populated, someplace that’s open at 8:00am. Of course! At an already existing socially accepted drug distribution center!

Texts exchanged at the Starbucks parking lot at Broadway and Baseline.
“I’ll be in a white Ford Explorer”
“I’m in Bagel Bros, be out in a couple min”
“Awesome”
I secured my coffee in the cup holder, pulled out of my parking spot, and followed his car blending into traffic. 
We puffed down Highway 36 through a foggy fall morning in Boulder. After some time, near Lyons we made a left into an old parking lot. Behind it, nestled into the mountain was a large system of tan buildings constructed from corrugated metal. Outside the front door was a cable system for the employee’s dogs so they could have limited mobility outdoors during the workday (I would later compare this to the apparatus that enslaved Jesse Pinkman in the season finale.)
Upon entry the owner, a stylish older woman donning a turtleneck and scarf greeted me warmly with a soft voice. I ditched my sweater, and rolled up the sleeves on my dress shirt, and got to work. I started with a batch of brownies and the owner helped familiarize me with her kitchen as they baked (and eventually burned per my first-day failure). Marvelously, industrial in feel, and immaculately clean I noted the name brands of her ingredients and equipment; and yet upon first glance, the kitchen was eerily similar the Gustavo Fring’s Laundromat for Walter and Jesse. On shelves and stoves were Paula Deen cookware (presumably purchased prior to her notorious ‘plantation wedding’), pounds of chocolate, cases of peanut butter, fair-trade spices, organic eggs, and other staple ingredients needed for a Boulderite’s bakery. It was clear upon arrival that she has never been a person to cut corners. This was evident after my in-depth lesson from her head chef on how to successfully paint her signature criss-cross chocolate drizzle pattern. I knowingly choose to omit her name, and her chef’s name because of the nature of her profession.
 There was a “no-bullshit” air about her that made me feel incredibly fortunate to have another straightforward friend. That being said, the only thing in life worth sugar coating is a gingersnap with 150mg of ‘activated’ THC. We shared a mutual appreciation that if an “edible” doesn’t look impressive, it doesn’t get sent out. Her product had a gourmet reputation that I would be responsible of upholding and that needed to be clear to me.
“Emerald butter”. That was the product I was asked to produce whenever I was tasked with decarbing trim. The device I used to manufacture it was originally a paper press, but it had been modified with bamboo and a mesh bag to filter plant material out of liquid butter. I criticized this tool for it’s crudeness and within a week, the hashish-maker next door had a reinforced steel six-ton “tincture press” sitting in its place. There was no wood glue binding bamboo board to bamboo board, there were industrial welds fusing an automotive jack to a steel basket. This device was serious, it compressed pounds of trim to the size of a hockey puck, something that it’s predecessor never could have fathomed. “Canna-butter” would be transformed into treats and cut with regular butter to reduce taste. The treats bake just as any other treats bake, yet they often have a green hue. These desserts are always made in large batches; it’s never a sheet of brownies it’s sheets of brownies at a time.
After creating a concoction, samples are sent off and tested by an independent lab before they are used or sold. This assures that the proper dosages are maintained and that nobody will be left drooling and clinging to their couch with beady eyes while their friend yawns in boredom and asks “is yours working? I don’t feel mine yet…”
This was no after-school smoking session; this was hard science in a laboratory.
Above one of the countertops was a line with multiple orders clipped to it. Each of these dockets was for a separate dispensary and displayed complex medical marijuana edible orders looking something like:
Terrapin
8:07am 11-18-2013

Merciful Brownies (4 of ea.) x 12
Mint Chill Brownies (2 of ea.) x 6
Sweet Dreams (indica) x 6
Day Trippers (sativa) x 6
Key Lime Kickers (2 of ea.) x 6
Pop-Star Caramel Corn (sativa) x 10
Hey, Sugar! (hybrid) x 6
Buddha Budda (indica) x 3
Dazed and Infused Olive Oil (sativa) x 3
Good Day Sunshine (2 of ea.)x 6
Raspberry Jam Bar (2 of ea.) x 6

Upon completion of an order, the page would be unclipped and put into an inconspicuous reused box, sent off to another medical marijuana facility within the state of Colorado. Whenever an order was being sent out to a dispensary, the driver needed a copy of the docket as a manifest in the rare event that they were searched by law enforcement and needed to explain why they had a gross of individually sealed psychedelic snack cakes in their Ford Fiesta. On the smaller refrigerator adjacent to the countertop there was a whiteboard with the names of dispensaries written in dry erase marker, under them were various check marks to show how close each order was to completion.  This was not just a business; this was somebody’s life passion. 
Another hilariously wild aspect of the medical marijuana industry is its lack of governmental oversight. Yes-yes, this is an industry based around regulation, but where in the hell was OSHA? I once watched the hashish-maker next door to our kitchen consolidate two cumbersome ceramic jugs containing liquid nitrogen before a day of work. 
The hashish maker is quite the character – taming the Wild West with weed. He always wears cowboy boots, ripped jeans, prescription goggles, and nitrile gloves. His wife is a talented baker, sweet, and a sucker for rescue animals and it’s clear that the two of them care for each other a great deal. These two arrive to work early just to make sure everyone is fed before a long day and they never shy away from asking if anyone wants a breakfast burrito before they go out to buy their own. He has many tattoos one of which clearly reads “STUPID HURTS”. He hails from the great state of Wyoming, and his knowledge of firearms vouches for it 
“Yeah I’m thinking about getting myself a little snub .38, a wheel-gun right on my ankle, you know? Something reliable and light.”

He needed all of his solvent in one vessel for that day’s batch. I stood there open-mouthed as he poured the frigid liquid from one jug to another. A white fog rolled down from the mouths of the containers and blanketed the ground. He was in a tee shirt. Another employee asked “is it safe to be in here while you are doing this?” I wondered the same thing. “Yeah! The atmosphere is like 70% nitrogen anyways, you’re fine man,” he chirped. I pictured his bare arms shattering from exposure like a rose I had seen in some science experiment. I thought to myself  “Employees must wash hands, mannnnn.” 
I was out of ‘the game’ even faster than I had entered it. After four weeks I told my boss I needed to focus on my remedial math course; she was sweet and witty about my situation. “You mean your parents won’t understand if I tell them I’m in real need of you, that I think baking pot brownies is more important than your college education?” We laughed. I asked if I could come back in the summer and she said “of course.” I drizzled my last batch of brownies and bid the bakery adieu.
Two weeks later, I received an email from work asking if I could help line them up with new packaging. I eagerly agreed. I investigated the laws of ‘child-proof packaging’ and ‘tamper-evident seals’ extensively on my Thanksgiving flight to Grand Rapids, Michigan. By my flight back to Denver, I could tell you that before heating and extrusion, clear injection-molded polyurethane costs slightly more than dyed polyurethane, this is because dyed polyurethane can be recycled from other dyed scrap polyurethane, whereas clear polyurethane requires a higher, definitively colorless, grade of resin pellet. I learned that if you’re buying child-resistant-tamper-evident and resealable containers online by the flat, you could talk the supplier down below their advertised ‘seventy cents per unit’ cost. I was ready to meet and talk packaging.
Texting my professor from the bakery parking lot November 21, 2013 at 11:51am
“Well I just got an earful from a cop outside of the bakery and the 9 News Team is there. I had plans to design master packaging today with the owner. …. Doors are broken down and there’s cops in camo with dogs and trashbags.

“They broke into the bakery!?! The owner said they’re just concerned about something farther up the road”

“I just saw them going in and out of the hash manufacturing facility [next door], the bakery door was closed, but when I got off the phone with her she felt like they were going to (and could) dismantle her kitchen. So much anger. The cops told me “the bakery is closed.”

“JESUS!”

“Yeah my heart sank. I’m always down to buy a Winnebago and cook brownies in the desert with you if the tough gets going.”

“Lol, thanks man. I needed that laugh. I’m freakin out right now.”

“It’ll work out amigo. This could be a nice conversation to cite in your dissertation lol”

My Explorer’s battery was dead that morning, so my girlfriend had volunteered to drive me to work to drop off my packaging suggestions. Upon arrival a DEA agent greeted us. He had camouflage pants (“for blending in”) tucked into black calf-high boots, a camouflage dress shirt with his last name in “BLOCK CAPITOL LETTERS”, mirrored sunglasses, a buzz cut, and a powerful ready stance (feet shoulder width apart, holding his hands behind his back). His German Shepherd was clipped to the previously mentioned cable system – that would have angered my co-workers. I held back a grin when the words “Kung-Fu Grip” came to mind during his questions; he looked like an action figure.

Chatting with the DEA

“Where are you headed?”

“The Bakery – I have a meeting with the owner”

“They’re closed, so I ask that you two pull in right here and make a U-Turn and be on your way.”

“Alright”



The interaction was cold and curt. I would later learn from my professor that the DEA knocked down doors to all of the businesses in that lot, and they had apparently read their warrant “incorrectly”.  They did not target the hash-maker or the owner of the bakery, they targeted the nearby marijuana grows. Legality aside, I enjoyed an educational internship in the marijuana business with my professor in the fall of 2013.
I had learned how to confect gourmet medical marijuana infused desserts with my professor, left the job, designed packaging, and been subject to DEA questioning in less than two months. I broke brownies with the best in Boulder.

1u1etf,5,2013-12-30,I'm [25f] starting to feel resentful towards my parents.,thr0waway_1234,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1u1etf/im_25f_starting_to_feel_resentful_towards_my/,"A little back story: I'm an only child. I graduated college in Dec of 2012 and landed a paid internship. This is the first job that I've had that wasn't some shitty retail job and feel really proud that I'm making an income of my own. Unfortunately because I live in one of the most expensive cities in the US, combined with crippling student loan debt, I'm unable to move out of my parent's home. The home situation is frustrating enough because my mom is not a happy person. Being around her is like being around the Dementors... Maybe that's an exaggeration but you understand the gist. 

My family has never been well off, and probably will never be well off. There have been moments in our lives where we were just scraping by to moments where we would literally hide from the landlord because my parents didn't have the rent. It's pretty shitty but I don't dwell on it. 

Now that I'm making money on my own, I try to save whatever leftover cash I have after student loan payments, and other unavoidable bills so that I can start looking for a place of my own. The reason why I'm feeling resenful towards my parents is that demand 1/3 of my paycheck. Something along the lines of ""we've raised you, you owe us"". I know that they're not asking me for $ because they want to or out of spite, but because they really do need it. I get it, I really get it that they could use a hand. But I'm not responsible for them. Their debts and poor financial choices are not my responsibility. 

Now you need to understand Asian culture. Children are expected to take care of their parents no matter what. There's no such thing as cutting your parents off or removing them from your life like there is in Western culture. I really really resent that. I don't have those ideals. I think it's totally unfair that I have to assume responsibility for my parents just as my life is starting to begin. My parents depend on me for my job and the money that I bring into the family. I feel like I could never pursue another career path or quit my job for a new, lesser paying one because my parents depend on me. Is it wrong for me to absolutely hate this? I'm not a cold person and I love my parents very much but I cannot continue to support them this way if I want to make a life for myself. 

Am I wrong for feeling this way? As much as the resentment towards my parents is there, I also feel intense guilt for feeling this way. 

As I was typing this story I just learned that my parents' business might have to shut down and pay a bunch of fines for building code violations and can you believe the first thought that came to mind was so selfish and disgusting: great, now I'm going to have to bear the brunt of this fuck up. 

What do I do Reddit? I feel like a terrible human being. 

tl;dr: parents depend on me financially and I'm beginning to hate it."

-She always asks me personal questions like ""Do you date a lot of people that you work with?"" (I did date 2 other people from work but that was years ago) or if I say I'm going to the mall or something or movies she will go ""With a girl?!"" or ""Who did you go to the mall with? a girl?!""

-She doesn't really touch me though or anything, she will compliments my clothes and such (as do I to her) or hold up clothes to me that she thinks I should buy. Or for example on Christmas wanted to wear matching sweaters to work. She will throw things at me though or poke me with things jokingly. 


-She doesn't really text me or if I text her, she doesn't really text me back much, convo will just end randomly. Honestly though I have maybe texted her 10 times though in the past year.


-She brought up to me about 2 months ago about a guy she liked that denied her at school.

-Also I'm quitting this job for an internship next week and when I told her she was sad that she wouldn't see me and whose gonna compliment her (Like I said we point out when eachother looks good) and that I'll find a new girl at my new job and date her blah blah.




Not sure what to make of this, especially since this has been going on for months. I haven't done anything because honestly this is confusing to me and I had other options that have been less confusing (she doesn't really know this). But now the more I talk to her, I do like her.

1u1amd,423,2013-12-30,How do I not become a jerk?,ICUDOC,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1u1amd/how_do_i_not_become_a_jerk/,"When I started in medical school, I was surround by a field of very altruistic students, humanitarians and we all had heightened levels of empathy for our patients.  By the end of internship I was finding that the beaming, radiant humanistic physicians in training I was around were slowly becoming for lack of a better word ""jerks.""  Maybe this was happening to me as well and I wasn't aware of the degree.

I evaluated carefully what was happening to people's personalities through the duration of training and realized the time crunch was the biggest factor.  We constantly ask ourselves ""do I eat lunch or do I grief counsel this family?"" ""do I cut this patient off so that I can go to the bathroom sooner or do I allow this patient to finish his story?""  ""Do I address the psychological factors making my patient non-compliant, alleviate their anxieties or do I plow through so that I can see all my patients in a timely manner and also so I can keep from standing up my date for the evening?""

This time crunch issue really scares me because I don't know how I can practice humanistic medicine and see a new patient every 15 minutes or round on 40+ inpatients in a day.  I'm applying for positions in Pulm/Critical Care/Sleep and I'm concerned about having the breathing room of time to provide adequate care and not violating my core beliefs.

Do you have any advice for a physician looking for his first job and how to not sacrifice quality of patient care and personal lifestyle?  Any questions you suggest I should ask during the interview process to get a better idea of what the work environment is like?  Am I naive to think that a physician can see patients in a timely manner, effectively, still have time for him/herself and be profitable?

**tl;dr: My fiance's mom is a control freak and now blames me for her son wanting to be independent and is using his children as a hammer in the fight. We can't afford a custody battle, but he can't do what she wants either.**

---
My fiance, let's call him Ulric, went through a nightmare custody battle for several years for his daughters, who are now ages 7 and five.  When they had contact with their mother they were subjected to neglect, filth, and every abuse you could name from her, her boyfriends, and her johns. In the state where we live the courts are still very biased towards the mother, and it took a long time, help from Ulric's parents, and well over $40K to finally get custody, then remove their mother from their lives permanently (her rights were terminated).  
------
I came into the picture near the end of the fight, just over two years ago, with a now ten year old daughter of my own. At first, Ulric's family welcomed us with open arms, they loved me, and I loved them back.  His daughters and I bonded well, in spite of what they had been through.  Then about 8 months into our relationship his older daughter began to tell him and anyone who would listen that she didn't like me.  It put a terrible amount of strain on our relationship, and didn't make a whole lot of sense, because I treated all three girls the same, like a mom, because it is just in my nature to be a nurturer.  Over the summer we came up with new approaches to my relationship with her, and things seemed much better.  When we had been together for a year, Ulric and I got engaged, and my daughter and I moved in with him.  
--------------
Here's a little important background information:  Ulric was in a car wreck 11 years ago that nearly killed him.  As in broke his back in nine places, his heart stopped twice, traumatic brain injury, the whole nine yards.  He is disabled and draws disability, but has worked hard and is finishing up his bachelor's with a 4.0 GPA, is starting a prestigious internship in the state capital in January, and is about to take his LSAT and try to get into law school. During the time he started school and ever since, his mother has cared for his children. Ulric lives in a trailer that he owns outright, but is for all intents and purposes, in his mom's side yard. Her being so close, and the importance of him being in school has made her willingness to watch the girls a blessing. OR so we thought. 
-------------

After I moved in (I moved two hours away from my own family) I was under a lot of stress and strain, and so was Ulric and we fought a lot.  Also Ulric's mom (from here on UM) began to criticize the way I handled the children, including my own, and the way I kept our house.  In handling the children, I'm talking about taking a toy away or putting them in time out because my own daughter back talked me, or his oldest daughter broke something, threw a tantrum, or screamed you're stupid!!!!! in my face. She also got upset when I suggested maybe the fourth large bowl of ice cream she was giving his oldest daughter (who at 7 weighs a little over 100 pounds) was a bit much. When we would be invited to dinner in her home she would become angry with Ulric for trying to get his children to eat their vegetables (she never made him or his sister eat theirs!!, her own words).  As for the housekeeping, I'll admit, I'm not the best, but my house was never filthy, there was never trash or filth, or even dirty dishes, but I'd forget to dust the knicknacks, or hadn't picked up the clutter in a day or two because I'm busy with three young girls!)

Eventually the stress and strain and the fact that his oldest daughter (the youngest has always adored me) led to a really bad fight which UM inserted herself into in a big way, and he and I broke up.  I moved back to my own mother's place.  (I had been living independently for my daughter's entire life but gave up everything when I moved in with him.) 

We were separated for about a month and then started talking, slowly, and working things out. Eventually I started coming around again, and back in July we took a family road trip with all three kids and stayed at the South Carolina coast for several days.  During that time Ulric and I worked out all of our underlying issues and his daughters bonded with me again. The oldest and I were even getting along now.  We didn't move back in, instead deciding to wait until we were married (the date is set for the end of May to let my daughter finish the school year where were live now), but we've been spending weekends at Urlic's.  At first UM and UF (his father) were guardedly welcoming, but as our talk of wedding plans increased and Ulric brought up his plan to take his girls out of state with him and I to attend law school, suddenly the oldest hated me again.  UM was also getting very cold towards me as well. 
------
It's all come to a head right here at Christmas.  My daughter and I came down to spend the two week Christmas break with Ulric. Things seemed strained but I kept thinking it may all be in my head.  At Christmas UM and F gave us thoughtful gifts and everyone seemed happy. We played cards as a family late into the night, laughed together, had a great time! 
The kids had all three received laptops from Santa, and the youngest daughter picked her's up by the charger cord and shook it to unplug it (yes she is 6 but she does know better), and I gently said, Honey, you know not to treat the computer that way, if I see something like that again then Daddy will have to take it away. That night after we were back in our own house and the kids were settled into bed Ulric was on the phone with UM and she told him that if she saw me threaten to take away any of the girls' things again, she would, ""knock the shit out of me.""  Ulric didn't tell me this at first, instead getting his clothes back on (we were dressed for bed) and going down to talk to her.  She angered him and UF tried to be a mediator, taking Ulric for a drive and a talk.  Ulric found out then that his mother basically hated me and that she thought I was mean and mistreated her grandchildren, and that she was the one telling the oldest child (and the youngest, but the youngest has always loved me anyway) how terrible a person I was, how I didn't love them, and all kinds of horrible things. 
Ulric came home and informed me of this and I collected the gifts she had given me for Christmas and sat down and wrote her a letter telling her that I was sorry for for the way she felt, that I had done all I possibly could to be kind to her son and grandchildren and to show them love and stability. I told her I wasn't comfortable accepting her gifts and I set gifts and the letter on her porch, after Ulric had read and approved the letter.

The next morning as soon as UM found the bag she flipped.  She brought the things Ulric and I had given her and UF to our house, marched in the front door and started screaming at me.  Ulric told her to leave and when she kept screaming and slammed the door on her way out, Ulric went to go get his dad who was working in the barn nearby.  UM tried to come back in the house to scream at me again but Ulric stopped her and they had a screaming match in the yard.  She tore his shirt, slapped his face, and I'm ashamed to admit it, but Ulric slapped her back. Then he walked away.  Then UM started screaming that she was pressing charges and telling UF to take pictures and that Ulric could kiss his internship and law school goodbye.  He said, ""what do you want, Mom?  Do you want me to lose everything you've worked for?""  and she told him, ""yes, you need to quit school and stay home where you belong."" 

All of this was happening right in front of the kids and when I tried to get his girls in the house and away from the scene UM screamed at me to leave then alone, that they needed to see what I'd caused.  I was flabbergasted!  As things went on it all came out.  Apparently she'd even been having prayer meetings at her church about the evil influence her son had come under (me), and when Ulric told his parents that he'd found his best friend and that we were getting married and she needed to stop, his parents told him that he had to get the hell out. To get his trailer off their property and go.  They are blaming everything directly on me, saying I'm a horrible person, etc. We hurried yesterday, found a place to rent, and are packing to move, so his father tells him today that if he takes the kids they are going to file for custody, and they've got their whole church community and friends and family to back them up over how horrible I am.  (People at church have seen me put the girls in time out for acting out and being disrespectful).  We don't have the money for a custody battle. We just don't. 

It seems that the simple solution would be for me to break up with Ulric, and that it would solve everything, but his mom also undermines him. Tells the girls that daddy is mean, that they don't have to listen to him, etc. He wants to get away from her and her influence as well. There's also no way he can do his internship without someone to watch his kids. If he doesn't do this internship, (it starts Monday) then he can pretty much kiss the rest of his future goodbye. I don't know what to do and neither does he.

Also some other info I didn't know where to put: When they are away from his mom for a few days his kids both adore me, their behavior improves, they call me mommy (after me telling them they didn't have to, that they can use my first name or whatever they would like), and the oldest even spent all of Christmas eve morning cuddling in my lap watching Christmas shows and talking to me.

In other words, I just turned 21. I’m looking for summer internships right now but you wouldn’t care about that…
I’ve been fucking my high school girl of my dreams recently. This girl had always been a friend, and at times a very close one, but she dated one of my close friends on and off for a very long time. I feel like a horrible person every time I see him. I do it anyways. There are so many pros and cons to the entire situation… He did have his chance, and he played her as I've seen him play others. This has no effect on our friendship and he has no idea. He has moved on from her but they'd been the type to still get together on breaks. He is a great friend and a bit of a womanizer; We all know him. I did have feelings for her before they ever dated. I think I could have made it happen back in the day if I went after her, and had a better haircut. She was the first girl that ever made my jaw-drop in high school. Just being friends with the hottest girl in school was exciting and seeing her with him was painless because I knew we could never be. She was the forbidden fruit I'd never touch.

Entering college we drifted apart, in large part due to her tumultuous break ups with my friend. You have to pick sides and I had no choice; The friend group was against the ex. A year passed and she just so happened to transfer to a neighboring school and I was her natural connection to parties when she'd visit. The friendship reignited and I was happy to know her again. And then she was all over me in the middle of the party at my fraternity. I tried to divert her advances and assumed she was drunk. But she just kept coming and I fucking caved and kissed her right back. We proceeded to ""grind"" on the dance floor mauling each other, and made our way back to my apartment. We were Ron Burgundy and Veronica Corningstone and we definitely went to Pleasureland. I had a guilty hangover, but lusting for her again came easy. I'm not good at one night stands; if we have sex I want to hold your hand and get breakfast after. From there it progressed. We'd played cat and mouse while apart, before doing it over again at the next party. We knew we were bad, we liked it anyway, and became almost exclusively physical which was very new for me. We both would actually miss simply being friends, but then we'd just do it again. She claims to have always had feelings for me too, but I don’t know if I really believe her. The shrimpy high school freshman with a bowl cut inside me still can't be sure he had a shot with his jaw-dropper. But she's a real weirdo in every sense of the word like me which helps me trust her. When she asked me to choke her and hold her hands above her head I burst out laughing at her. I could never hurt a woman. But she asked me again and I eased into it, and it was like nothing else.

She is the first girl that ever made me happy since my breakup with my high school girlfriend. A huge part of me still wants my high school sweetheart often instead. I can’t have her anymore, and it was my fault. I didn't cheat and I never would. My honesty about time spent apart proved fatal, and I would've shown her the door if I heard the same from her. I’ll probably never know what we truly could have been and always miss a little part of her. Time with dream girl is limited because we won't be in the same state next semester. Long distance is out of the cards because that's how I ruined my first good relationship. The one that got away from high school will always be a 45 minute drive away, and it just might be the death of me. I have no idea what to do going forward. I can’t decide if I didn’t know what I had till it was gone, or only want what I can’t have…

I do good and I do evil. Figuratively, I would not put myself in Heaven nor in Hell. Literally, I don’t believe in either. I would never take a life unless I had to. I’m not Walter White, but I like him. I am straight as a nail, sensitive to the core, and believe sexual preference indicates nothing more than who that filthy animal likes to sleep with. If you truly believe anything about that or this piece is “gay”, please comment about it below so I’ll know that you read almost all the way to the bottom and like to express your feelings too. And respect that I spent the last 30 minutes planning out how to elaborately fuck with internet trolls against the gays. Now I’ll go to Heaven for sure. Wait… To dwell on it further, I’d guess the homo-hating high-speed  hobos hit it and quit after reading my hook. And of course I like to use alliterations and care what other people think and want you to comment. Wouldn’t you? I have yet to meet anyone else I believe to be truly similar to myself. Maybe nobody does. I feel like I could be unique, but don’t we all? This is my first piece of personal reflective writing. If you hated it, tell me. This is my new journal and I wrote this for me, not for you. But if one person out there enjoyed it, I’ll keep sharing my secrets with you.

I'm about to finish my masters in computer science (focus on AI) at a university in Europe and I had this idea about leaving the continent, at least for a year or so, to gather some work experience abroad. As a matter of fact I was thinking about an internship (6 months+) in an East Asian country before starting a full long-term job or maybe even a PhD.

I'm aware of the huge cultural barriers that must to be overcome for a foreigner like me but I'm confident about being able to handle these difficulties, at least for some limited time. The main obstacle might be that I don't speak any relevant language (yet) which obviously isn't the best prerequisite. Therefore an English or German environment would be a requirement.

So I'd like to ask for general advice about how and where to gather information about internships for foreigners in countries like China or South Korea. A good guess would probably be to target branches of western firms but my impression so far is that their offers are mainly restricted to their own employees. 

I'd love to hear from people who have done something similar before. Any kind of input is appreciated! 

Thanks in advance, mqmm

Im a student who is sick of my community college, I want to get out and go do something that can teach me something useful. Im not looking to be a chef forever, but it sounds like something I would enjoy doing for a while..

Anyway, to the point, I found a French cooking school called gastronomicom, they speak english, teach french, and also obviously teach you cuisine cooking, pastry,  and wine. They also give internships so I could go live in France for 7 months learning to cook and then go and do it. Sounds like a great time.

The question I have is, has anyone actually gone out of the country to learn how to cook, Someone who didnt know much and just went for it? Is it worth spending $10,000 to go to Europe? 

(With the 10 grand is housing, and school cost)

The problem I am having is I just dont know if its a smart thing to do, worth the money, and if Im ready for it. Im 20 and just cant wait to go to a real college, or just do anything that isnt living at home, I have no idea what I want to do for the rest of my life, but all I want to do is travel, see the world before Im old and retired.

I hope some of that made sense, and hopefully someone knows what to tell me on how to get started or something.

Thank you all"

Every slide was about how women are the victims and the school has a center just for women. 

At the end of the presentation I called them out on it.  I asked them why their entire presentation was always describing women as the victims.  They said and kept repeating that men can't be sexual assaulted.  I then said in front of everyone, ""Where was I supposed to go when I was raped last year by a woman and nobody believed me... including you Miss ______?""

At that moment there was silence and it felt good to get it out there because I hadn't told many people except my current roommate.  They called a halt to the presentation and declared there was no more time for questions.  Almost every woman and man in that room (ratio was about 70% women and 30% men) gave me a hug or shook my hand or said thank you for being brave.  

Since that incident they have submitted a paper to the student led newspaper about men that hate shame women rape victims and how men are always consensual.  They asked me to sit down and talk about it with them so I invited a female and male coworker along and when I arrived I was told they were not allowed in.  When I asked why, they informed me that since I had the issue that only I had the right to address it.  In the end they let them in with a few simple words.  ""I have police records of being sexually assaulted and in those reports I have you stating repeatedly that I wanted it.  I wonder what would happen if I were to file a lawsuit... or worse, mail it to every newspaper in the state""  When I dropped those words they gave in right away because they knew I won.

Nothing came of it and they still harass me time to time.  Every time they send me an email about women violence or something I just send back a picture of the police report and it quickly stops.  The school dictates that women are the victims and men the perpetrators. 

I never thought it would happen to me, and that feminists and men's rights groups were a little crazy, until it did.  I apologize for being short sighted.

This is why I need true Feminism and Men's Rights

I've got a degree in Economics and I'm looking over my options. My economics degree has been a bit more qualitative than quantitative. So far I've done differential and integral calculus and two courses in statistics with one applied statistics course. The most advanced thing we've covered is multiple regression analysis. I'm also going to take intro to computer science and have started teaching myself javascript and hopefully python on codeacademy.

So is this enough to prepare me for the analytics world. I get intimated when jobs require degrees in applied mathematics or even degrees like physics and I'm concerned that my quantitative skills may not be adequate to get a job in analytics and data analysis.

I do have an internship with a start up that one of my professors started, and I'm hoping to set up GA and do some work with that. I have some experience since last year I volunteered for a Non-Profit and did some work for them with GA.

So here are my questions:

How much math do you need to do the job, are there certain analytics jobs that require less math than others?

What are my chances now and what else can I do to improve them?

1tzssg,0,2013-12-30,I feel like I've been bait-and-switched on internship content.,sporkenfang,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1tzssg/i_feel_like_ive_been_baitandswitched_on/,"I was a TA for an engineering course this past semester and we had a guest speaker in who's high up in a well-funded and well-regarded big data startup. He asked for resumes from interested students, and as he was a pretty interesting guy, I also sent mine to him and we had a pretty good conversation. Long story short, he made me an internship offer, but the expected content of the internship is pretty much nothing like what was advertised up front. It is related to machine learning, which, despite being a hot topic these days, I have little interest in. Somehow I didn't realize up front that everything this company does is stuff I don't particularly care about and doesn't advance my career goals. He had said I would get to muck about with implementing a distributed system, but that's turned out to really be a marketing department tool to help analyze how well this startup is being spoken of and also get a handle on the data being processed by their clusters. 

I am not a high-level engineer. Hell, I'm not even a software engineer. Most of my coursework has been in either ECE or in computer science theory (e.g. theory of programming languages, computability, automata). While I have a very good time with systems-level things like device drivers, OS kernels, and compilers, the highest-level experience I have is writing and running configuration scripts on the cluster I'm helping build for my grad school research. I feel both as though he read me totally wrong and I am totally unsuited to the jobs he would like me to perform. In the email he sent me describing the position, he also said he couldn't have me spending my time on ""piddly shit"". Considering I'd have to start at square one as far as methods, algorithms, and even the bloody terminology in machine learning and big data are concerned, I think I'd be unwittingly stepping right into a huge *pile* of piddly shit were I to accept.

 I respect and like this guy but I have no interest in his work, do not have the skill set for it, and do not think it would help my future career in any way, shape, or form. I'm a computer science major but pretty much only because I took a bunch of theory classes and liked them. Everything I'm doing researchwise is ECE. This is very much a software internship.

tl;dr how can I decline this offer without sounding like an entitled douchebag?"

I have had a pretty awful year after graduating from college in May. I have been living off a miserly paying internship, after being a star student for four years. College was everything, best years of my life... leaving and then not having something work out career-wise right away made this whole year very difficult to deal with. The one good thing that happened was I met him in June and consciously or not, he has been the center of my universe. It's like I had nothing else great going on, after transitioning from the best years of my life. But I had him.

So I had to take a leap of faith and train at an agency that has great job placement rates. This agency is 3 hours away from my bf and I had to move here to participate. In about a month or so I could get placed anywhere in the country. If they ask me to move to the other side of the U.S., I have no choice but to.

I want to run two marathons this year, I've done four but I haven't done one since 2010. I also want to have a job after finishing my bachelor's degree, specifically to have some experience prior to my third resolution which is to take the GRE in the Fall or Winter. Before I can go to graduate school for an MBA I need to get another 1-1.5 years worth of experience in my field of study. My fourth and final resolution would be able save enough money to live independently from my parents for the first time in my life. This is the most important for me because I grew with my parents always worried about me due to having a learning disability. All my life they were told I wouldn't be able to attend regular classes in school, would have low motor skills and that nothing could be done. I have since over came many of those struggles thanks to my parents love and desire to not give up on me. In May I'll be graduating with honors from my university so after commencement is up in the air of what will happen next as I have no desire to return to my hometown due to lack of opportunities in my field of work.

To summarize, run two marathons, get a job/paid internship, take the GRE, become fully independent after graduation."

At first, I'd like to pin down that English is not my native language and is far from perfect so I apologize for any kind of mistakes you may find in my report. 

I am a 23 old guy and my story started back in the summer of 2011. I used to have a beautiful girlfriend back then, finished all my exams and was applied for an internship at a prestigous firm, so everything seemed perfect, except the fact, that I was struggling with severe social anxiety, but I could handle it more or less at my workplace so I didn't really care about it. My sexual life was really satisfactory, I could maintain a rockhard erection even if I was totally drunk, I was able to reach climax several times per day and I even fapped at my workplace fantasizing about my GF sometimes. However, in the end of August, all of a sudden, disaster striked, and I wasn't able to get an erection hard enough to penetrate...The following day we tried again but I failed, again, only responding properly to oral sex. After a few other unsuccessful occassions my GF got fed up, so did I, and finally she broke up with me. I wasn't in love with her so I accepted her decision, I was like ""man, you can concentrate on work even better"". It was the most stressful time in my life so I thought my new lifestyle was the reason behind my inability to perform in the bedroom. That was also the time when my excessive porn usage started. I was introduced to porn by my big bro at the age of 7 or 8 but we only had magazines and an old VHS tape. By the time I got older (13-14) fapping had become an everyday activity but we still only had like 30 movies on the computer, as highspeed internet wasn't really widespread in my country. I moved out from my parents house in 2010, got highspeed internet and had tons of free time so I was fapping, A LOT, but I was able to have sex back then, as I had some f.buddies. The serious sh*t started in December 2011, as I said, when my internship ended. My porn consumption got out of hand, I was watching it constantly, multiple tabs, directories for my favorite starlets, only really hardcore, rough stuff,  and I found out that erotic, even 'normal' movies (not featuring my fetishes) can't arouse me anymore. I kept watching rough stuff til the summer of '12 when I moved home and found YBOP accidentally while browsing a porn microblog :D. I realized that I am a porn addict so I deleted all the stuff from my computer and became incredibly enthusiastic about the discovery, I was also relieved that I found the cure for my ED. It was the most difficult thing to overcome my desires towards porn, I relapsed several times after 1-2 week nofap sessions, had some crazy binge days, but finally made it to day ~40 . At that time I started to experience the famous superpowers (however I was still flatlining), and one day, SOCIAL ANXIETY DISAPPEARED. I was the most confident, happiest guy on earth, what is more, I was dating with one of the hottest girls in my hometown. We didn't want to have sex for like 1 or 2 months as she was only 17 which was pretty convenient for me as I was afraid what would happen, but once, after a night out, we got home pretty drunk and we pleasured each other orally, however I could only get a ~60% boner, but I have to add that I was incredibly sh*tfaced. Unfortunately I f*cked it up with her, but managed to reach 80 (somewhere in Feb. '13) days in hardmode, when a girl gave head on a party, where I was sober and could stay 90% hard during the whole act, actually it only took me a minute to O. :D After this, I reseted my timer and stopped counting the days which wasn't a good idea, but I received several BJs at that time (during the spring and summer), and only masturbated every 30-40 days, w/o porn, so I thought I was OK, but to be honest, I always needed constant stimulation to keep it hard (rubbing the top of my penis w/ my palm was my principal method). 
In Sept. I was applied for my dream university, and started to experience mild social anxiety, especially after binge drinkings and smoking pot, so I decided to change my lifestyle, I gave up pot, alcohol and started nofap again, this time aiming for 90 days, and to finally cure myself. I've been pretty balanced since then, until this point, the winter break. I started to experience massive boners at day 60, I've never been that hard for ages and I could even maintain them for 30 minutes in the morning by fantasizing, what is more, I got some random boners too. This condition only lasted for 8 days, now I'm at day 70, but I feel like I'm flatlining again, my D is kinda lifeless and I don't even have morning wood.
The worst thing is that, while I was checking some succes stories here I ran into the term: Venous Leak. I looked up for its symptoms and got really-really deperated since I haven't been able to maintain an erection w/o constant oral stimulation for 2,5 years,  (except that 8 day streak when I had super massive boners). I haven't masturbated to porn for 1,5 year still I don't even have morning wood, I can't hold an erection more than 5 seconds, especially in standing position. 

Is there a possibility that I have a venous leak? It is worrying me that I've been trying to overcome this problem for almost 2 years now, but I still get those dopamine rushes while browsing torrent sites, and thinking about porn. I watched some xxx scenes during my journey (esp. when I got home drunk) and I didn't completely avoid edging and erotic pictures (some girls sent me naked selfies and I didn't want to refuse them).  I'm incredibly depressed right now, and planning to visit an urologist as soon as possible, as the thought of this venous leakage drives me crazy. It cannot be cured...and all I can think about how miserable/pointless my life would be w/o the ability of having intercourse.

Is there anyone out there who have been struggling with ED even after completing 180+ days of this challenge?! 

Sorry about the length of my account, but it was really comforting to let out  my problems, since I've never ttalked about it even w/ my best friend.

I'm a sophomore computer science major and I just got a call from GoDaddy that I will have a Skype technical interview next week for a summer internship. My background in programming so far is two semesters of college work in Python and this next semester I'll get some experience with C and C++. They let me know that the position will probably be with .NET and Java and I said I had no problem with self studying those before the summer. They're aware my language background is currently only Python.

What should I expect for the interview? I am well versed in data structures and search algorithms as well as Python programming in general (both functional and object-oriented). However, I feel a bit limited by only knowing Python for the interview. Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks!"

Today I received a phone call from my current employer. I just graduated with my degree a few weeks ago. Electrical Engineering. The company I was working for was a big name in the electrical engineering field and looked very good on my resume, along with other internships I had in the past. The call was to tell me that my drug test results came back and I did not pass, and therefore I was fired. 

I would give a lot more information but I am not sure what is relevant to the question but I will say that yes I did and do still smoke pot, I stopped as soon as they said I was going to take a drug test by the end of this year (I was told it would be in May so I had planned on quitting by the end of this year since it is a hair test as well). The test was 20 days from my last smoke, and using a home remedy (tide/salicylic acid/vinegar method) my hair still showed traces apparently. 

Well another important part is that I hated it there anyways. They never actually let me do what they hired me on for 8 months to do and instead gave me absolutely the most boring work I could do with my degree. On the side I did my own research there, and filed a patent with them as well. I showed them I could do more, but they kept me on this annoying project and I was just fed up with it. So this is actually a blessing in disguise I think. 

Where should I take my life now? Should I look to move and look for EE work in Germany (conversational German is good, the more technical I have issues with so might not be an option), move to California to be with a friend? Stay in the area where most of my friends and family live? 

I have been thinking about bartending, possibly side jobs in retail (I have lots of hobbies and could fill roles in many retail locations), traveling, and just trying to live freely for a bit. This is a very NOT me move. I love planning things out and having a plan. I had a plan if this occurred but holy shit it's new year's eve and I have a fresh start. 

I currently live with my parents, but I own two vehicles I can definitely remove the one from the equation for extra cash. I just sold off the few stocks I still held and applied to multiple jobs in the area as well as an old retail job I had a few years back that I quite enjoyed. 

I have no S.O so the attachments here are lifelong friends and family so traveling for good I do not see myself doing, possibly a year or two. 

I love space, I love Sci-Fi, playing instruments, microcontrollers, art, various board and card games and I have tons of hobbies besides these so I feel like I could really find a job that I would love to do (in EE field of course). I always wanted to work for NASA but know they have been cutting back greatly, Planetary Resources would be awesome but I am a fresh graduate with only 2 years of experience and most of their stuff is senior level. 

I know I can do whatever I put my mind to, I learn easily and am always curious. I feel like I have been given an opportunity here for something great. I posted here to help me see what others suggest while I go enjoy my new years with loved ones and talking to them about this as well. 

Will add more info if specifics come up and are requested. 

TLDR: Life open to me, how do I start?

A couple of summers ago I got an internship at a local ""Customer Operations Group"" for a company that runs an online service for retailers around the world. The only real mistake I made during the summer was when working with their servers, unfortunately. However, the mistake was quickly fixed and the only people that noticed it was the IT department. I now have an interview in two days for a full time job.

Basically, I'd like some more insight, or perhaps a link that can explain what happened with the issue. My terminology about servers is shakey at best, so if you could help me out there that would be great.

IIRC, on the right side of the server there are four ethernet ports to each section of the server. The first two ports essentially do the same thing; the second is for backup. I can't remember what the other two do. The left side of the server also has several groups of four ethernet ports, which I believe connect to the motherboard(?). Above the server are two boxes, I believe a switch and a SAN.

Basically, what happened is I think that instead of plugging an ethernet cable from the right side of the server to the SAN, I plugged it in to the switch, or motherboard, can't remember. It caused the server to crash, I got a call, unplugged everything and it was fine. I was super embarrassed, but no real damage was done. I recognized the mistake that I made later.

Alright, so can anyone ELI5 what happened and perhaps explain the significance of each part of a server and how they work together? I feel this is important for me to understand going into this interview.

I could start T in a couple of months, but my family thinks should wait until I get my first job as a female, and are pressuring me to wait until a few years after graduation because they're afraid I won't be able to get a job if I graduate. 

My plan was originally this: to transition ASAP so that I can have at least one internship under a male name for a reference for when I graduate, and maybe get my gender marker and name changed on my academic records. I'm not really sure what to do; I really want to start T but not if I'm jumping the gun and it's bad timing.

What did you y'all do about your resume, and your academic records? How afraid should I be about discrimination? I'm in software development and am graduating from a good school with slightly below average grades.

Also if there are any trans* people that went through something similar and have advice, or would be up to talk to me about this, I would love it if you PM'd me... I'm really confused and scared about the future and what I should do and I don't know many trans* people in real life."

In need of some advice!",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1u3pwr/a_new_year_and_a_new_guilt_trip_from_the_parents/,"This is going to be long and ranty, so...yeah, sorry. Mostly I'm just looking for someone to tell me if I'm being crazy or unrealistic. Also advice would be great because I feel kind of lost right now.

I've always been the kind of person who had her life planned out - I knew what my major in college would be when I was in the 10th grade, I had internships in high school and college, I started applying for jobs well before I graduated. Yet here I find myself.. at a company where no one respects me, I'm taken for granted, verbally abused pretty regularly, and it isn't remotely related to my field of study. (Like opposite spectrum. I was a creative writing major who works in accounting!) I'm miserable in my job, and I keep searching but I don't want to settle again. I want to find something relevant to what I studied and to my interests.

In the meantime, I've been getting a certification to teach English to second language speakers. I love traveling, I love the English language, I love grammar, I love learning new languages. I hate routines, I hate the 8-5 five days a week office job, I hate spending so much damn time browsing Reddit and reading Buzzfeed. Teaching seems like the perfect new job, and I'm very excited about it. 

My parents, and most of my family in general, is very routine-oriented. They were all born in the same area, moved within 15 minutes of where they grew up, and have no plans to leave. I've never wanted to stay, and am really excited at the prospect of traveling and teaching in a foreign country. This has been a dream of mine for so so long and I'm finally taking the necessary steps to make it my reality.

I had mentioned it in the past to my parents, but I guess they didn't see it as a serious (or sane) option. My TESOL course ends with a teaching practicum in Poland and I was planning to travel around with my boyfriend for a bit after. He's planning to move abroad with me, and has been nothing but supportive and amazing.

I told my mom first again about Poland the day after Christmas (Merry Christmas, let me ruin it for you!) and she said the whole, ""Oh give me a break. Come on, grow up."" thing. She's the kind of person who gets all of her world information from the local news, and tells me it's a dangerous idea. There are terrorists everywhere who want to kill Americans. Why can't I just settle down? I have a great job, making good money, I just moved into a brand new apartment with my boyfriend and acquired a ton of furniture - why am I going to mess it all up? 

Later I told my dad and his response was even weirder. ""Um.... Okay...."" Talking slowly like I had lost my mind. That was pretty much it from daddyo. He asked if my boyfriend was going to go with me, and when I said yes he didn't say anything else.. soooo I walked away.

I tell my parents all the time about how much I hate my job and coworkers. How I'm treated like a disposable employee, and I'm always yelled at for the most minor things. They've screamed at me and made me cry (overly-sensitive over here). Yet I stay because I need the money for those billsbillsbills and haven't found anything better. I'm probably being silly about it all; I could easily get another bullshit job doing administrative work, but I just don't want to settle into another job that I really don't care about at all. 

On one hand I'm really excited about going abroad, but on the other now I have a mixture of guilt and anxiety about it. Am I being an idiot? Maybe I do need to grow up and just get a real job. I just got a new apartment with my boyfriend and we furnished it and everything - am I really going to just put all the crap into storage and pick up and leave? I'm going to be 25 soon... is that too old to be doing this traveling around/job hopping/apartment hopping inconsistent thing? I have a cat, too, who I am very much expecting to bring with me, but is that fair to her? I'm planning to be doing this for a few years in a few different countries. I can't imagine ever leaving her behind though..

Being told that I'm being irresponsible is very offensive to me. I plan everything obsessively, I organize myself, I make sure I'm prepared in every way possible. My mom told me it wasn't a viable career to live abroad, and my little brother even told me to grow up. I don't like being treated like I'm some immature child who's living on an impulsive decision. This isn't something I just imagined a few months ago - I've been wanting to do this literally since my senior year of college three years ago. Plus I've saved up a bunch of money for this reason!

In the end, I just want the support of my family. I wish I could be the type of person to cut them off and say the hell with it, hop on a plane and ride off into the sunset. I can't, though. As crazy as they make, as much as I really don't think we anything have in common anymore, and as little as I think they know me... I still love them so much. That's why there's so much guilt. 

When I studied abroad in college, my mom told me all the time how she felt sick to her stomach with constant worry and fear and depression of me being so far away. I talked to them ALL THE TIME, but it wasn't enough until I was back in America. 

To me, it just feels like there's such a huge world out there - why waste my time in the same place forever? (No judgement to anyone who does want that, it's just not my cup of tea!) I don't know how to get my parents on my side anymore, and I don't know if it's worth the fight. Friends keep telling me to do what I want and then worry about things in the moment, but I guess I don't function like that. 

If anyone has been in a similar circumstance, I would love your insight. Thanks! (:"

Ever since I moved, money has always been a problem and every time I luck out with a job something happens and I get knocked back to square one. 

I am getting sick of it, I just want to be able to pay rent and live without worrying about money every time I need to buy food or gas or dare i say rent at the end of the month. I currently work part time in retail and if I do not find a new job soon there will be real trouble with my ability to afford rent. 


I love film and can edit to a certain degree as well as write, also I love music but that industry is not doing too well as well I do not know how to get my foot in the door for jobs in those fields considering I unable to/cannot afford to intern.
 

I have been working retail all my life and would love to get away from it, but I just want a job that I can live on for now.
 

I turn to you dear redditors, any help or advice would be appreciated.


Thank you in advance.

I have some project experience in EE and some personal projects too but no work experience. Should I include a letter of recommendation from my E&amp;M professor to help me get this internship?

(x-post from r/engineering),amaroq1371,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1u2pyq/lack_of_experience_making_my_job_search_difficult/,"Hey guys, I'm a recent grad (earlier this month actually), but I have no professional experience under my belt since I didn't do any internships while I was in school. This is making it hard for me to streamline my job search because I don't really know what's out there. I'm hoping someone can give me a little advice on how to get where I want to go.

A little about myself:
BS in Computer Engineering
I think I want to go into graphics or embedded systems development on the software side, but I currently don't know much about writing firmware or drivers. My dream job would probably be working at Nvidia designing/programming graphics chipsets.

The classes I most enjoyed in school were:

* Object Oriented Programming I/II -- Java
* [Systems Programming](http://moss.cs.iit.edu/cs351/assets/slides-intro.pdf) -- C
* [Computer Graphics](http://www.cs.iit.edu/~agam/cs411/information.html) -- C++
* Digital Computers and Computing -- RISC/CISC Assembly
* Computer Organization and Design -- Focus on computer design, some VHDL

I mention the firmware development position above, but how can I work towards that goal? What resources are available to me and what similar positions are out there that I can use to gain more experience. I'm not opposed to doing internships but I assume getting into one would be extremely difficult considering I've already graduated."
1u2ndi,4,2013-12-31,Need advice about taking a break from the sport...,Copperfield233,taekwondo,https://www.reddit.com/r/taekwondo/comments/1u2ndi/need_advice_about_taking_a_break_from_the_sport/,"I have been practicing tae kwon do for several years and am a 2nd dan black belt. 

However, I'm a junior in college right now, and with the combination of heavier school courseloads, worrying about internships, considering study abroad for a semester, and pursuing other interests in my last couple years of college, I have not really been dedicated in training in the sport as much as I would like to and was considering just taking a break for a while until I graduate college in a couple years and then start it back up again. 

Two questions I would like to ask...

-How many of you have had a situation in your life where you had to give up the sport for a while(at least a couple years) and returned back? What was the experience like?

-Has practicing TKD while in your 20's/30's and trying to balance your career/work life/relationships at the same time much more difficult then while you were much younger? What advice would you give to still stay active in it?

TKD has made a tremendous positive impact in my life, especially with many of the instructors that have worked with me, and it is still something I truly love and has helped me instill confidence in myself. It's just that with certain life circumstances right now, it's difficult for me to give it my all at this time, but I don't want to come off as not dedicated enough because I want it to still be a part of my life for as long as I can have it.  

Thanks for reading and any solid advice is greatly appreciated. :)

1u2iuv,3,2013-12-30,Aiming for a 6 week break,guywhoknowssomestuff,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1u2iuv/aiming_for_a_6_week_break/,"Let's start by saying that I really love weed. I started smoking my 4th year in college ( I did a 5 year program). I never thought I would ever smoke, let alone become a pothead, every day type of smoker. 

The very first time I smoked, I was hooked. I was doing an internship in Los Angeles. My buddy who was out there with me was a smoker at the time, and was always toking up in his room solo. One night I just decided to try it. Why not? He wanted to make sure I got high because he thought it would be the only time. Boy was he wrong!

Fast forward about 7 years. I'm a daily smoker. Hooked on the stuff. When I moved to LA permanently the first thing I did was get a weed prescription. Life since then has been a sort of blur. 

Despite my love for the drug, I am incredibly successful. I've worked at some great companies, and have an amazing portfolio of work (art director, advertising). I'm literally in the top of my field and am now a freelancer making close to $1k a day.

Weed has not ruined my life, set me back, or anything like that. But it does control me.

I can not be trusted around my own stash. If I smoke a bowl, I will be smoking every few hours until I go to sleep. Or pass out. 

There are days I work on site and can't smoke until the evenings. Those days I'm mostly in control but all day I crave being released to my home so I can smoke a hit or two. 

I would keep weed in my car in case I was ""stuck"" out somewhere. I would keep edibles in my bag so I had an option. I even kept a pocket vape on me so I could smoke some days discreetly. 

Long story short, my rx is expired and I now live in a new city. I exhausted my stash last night and am now without weed for the first time in 7 years (except for vacations and such, which has never been more than 10 days or so). 

I would like to go 6-10 weeks without the good stuff. I wanna reset. I wanna feel my own thought and consciousness again. And I don't want to feel chained to a pipe that gives me very little in return. 

I have no real interest in giving up weed forever. Like I said, I don't think it's holding me back necessarily but I do acknowledge that anymore it's not about getting high and relaxing. It's about maintaining. It's about ritual. 

It's about time I took a fucking break. "
1u2ggf,4,2013-12-30,What does it take to intern as a software developer?,bertweaze,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1u2ggf/what_does_it_take_to_intern_as_a_software/,"Im currently about to begin my 4th semester in a 4 year program of Software Development. So far I have learned C / C++ / Javascript / PHP / HTML / CSS / Some MySql stuff. As far as concepts I have a decent understanding of polymorphism, pointers, inheritance, classes as well as web development stuff like $_GET / $_POST stuff and can make some pretty complicated php websites.

Next semester i'll only be learning some UML / C# / .NET stuff because I failed the intermediate c++ course so I can't take the Java course this semester. 

My program offers me a co-op but that is next summer, I would like to get an intern ship this summer if possible."

Trying to figure out what I really want to do.  

Last term I completed by Control Engineering/Theory course, I loved it.  It was mostly system modelling and finding margins or error, but it seemed like it was the first time that we as engineering students were really able to ""engineer"" something, not just cobble together a bunch of parts, but actually show that what we have designed works. 

My peers are focusing on things like games/graphics/consumer software, I have determined after some frustrating internships that these thing are not for me.  

I think that I may be interested in industrial systems and designing software to control/monitor them.  However, I am not really sure what it entails or whether it will be something I am interested in.  

I am also considering staying in school and working towards a biomedical engineering masters after I graduate from my undergrad.  I have an interest in biology and medicine.  

So...questions....
- Does having a SENG degree put me in a bad position for industrial system type jobs? (my knowledge of mechanics doesn't extend much beyond 1st year, but I am a quick study and love to learn new stuff)

- How is the job market for this kind of thing at the moment?

- Day in the life of someone who does this kind of stuff?

- Job satisfaction etc...

- If I wanted to gain some experience in this area what can I do?  So far in software engineering I have been able just sit down and code an application or learn a new language if I want to gain some experience, however I am not sure this approach would work with large industrial system. 
Thanks
