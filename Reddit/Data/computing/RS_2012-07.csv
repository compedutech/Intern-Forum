vwdyo,4,2012-07-01,Need advice with mother/daughter relationship and I feel as though you ladies can help! It's making me majorly depressed! x-post from r/relationships,sambunny,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/vwdyo/need_advice_with_motherdaughter_relationship_and/,"I'm a 24/f and my mom is in her 50's.. The past 6 years have been extremely stressful and things are finally coming to a boiling point and I don't know what to do! Warning it's very long! There's a lot of history and I'll do my best to explain!

Six years ago my mom's business started failing. Money was being taken from every bit of mine, my brother's and my fathers lives.. She was (maybe still is) addicted to gambling. Some of my mom's clients decided they were going to get together and sue her for money that was taken and for work that was never done. Now, I believe that what mostly happened was bad business on everyone's part.. but I can't help but feel as though my mother gambled the majority of the money away. Anyways, once the lawsuits came to light my mom disappeared for two weeks leaving suicide notes behind to my brothers, me and my dad. I called the police immediately and after an agonizing two weeks of not knowing if she'd show up alive or dead she finally called saying she took a bunch of pills and was at a shitty hotel. We went with the police officers to pick her up and under the Baker Act she was committed for 72 hours. 

Once released, the damage from the money situation was worse than we thought. Bills, including rent, hadn't been paid for months and we were being evicted. I dropped out of college, took another job and began to save every penny to avoid too much disruption in my younger brothers life. I took a loan out on my car and used that money to find a house for my family to live in. (my dad had just stated working again after losing his job and my mother obviously used all of the savings)

So, we move to the new house and my mom finally becomes useful again shopping, cleaning doing things around the house.. My dad starts making money again and I finally have the chance to start college again, or so I think. Turns out my mom is not only being sued, but criminal charges are being made because of the amount of money that was taken. For the next year she is in and out of jail and court while I drop out of school again to make sure my younger brother gets too and from school so he can graduate high school. Eventually things are figured out in court and my mom has to pay restitution and will not see jail time. Things once again seem to go back to normal and I finally move out on my own to try and get my own life together.

Fast forward to about a year ago and my roommates and I all decide to go our separate ways. I decide to move in with my parents again for a few months only while I look for a new place to live. A couple months go by and my mom starts acting strange again, much like she did when she tried to commit suicide. However this time instead of suicide notes, my dad and I come home to notes saying she doesnt want to pay restitution anymore and is going to serve the rest of her jail sentence. She thinks it will be two months, it turns out she is incarcerated for more than 8 months. During this time I'm trying to finish my last semester of college, work and participate in internships. I have to drop out of my internship to help take care of my dad and the house, somehow still finding a way to finish school and completely disrupting my plans to move out again on my own.

Now, my problem with all of this is that my parents like to pretend that nothing has ever happened. We're a very traditional italian family, and my dad believes in family loyalty no matter what and believes things like this should not be discussed. I obviously feel differently.

My mother has never ever acknowledged the mental anguish she put my brothers and I through with her suicide attempt and had no regard for me when she decided to go to jail without talking to anyone first. She pretends that none of these things have happened and that my life hasn't been affected by any of it.

When everything was happening I lent my mother more than $5000 in cash. On top of that I paid off my car loans which was another $10k (used for rent went we had nowhere to live) and credit card bills for things that were needed for the house after the eviction totaled almost $8000. I paid all of this off with a lot of hard work and have never said anything to anyone about it yet my parents still act as though I'm so spoiled brat who didn't contribute to anything during tough times.

I just don't know what to do anymore, I feel so helpless. After everything i did to support my family during these tough times, my parents and mom especially act like I'm a horrible person who has no respect for anyone. They constantly nag at me and don't respect my privacy and completely refuse to admit everything I've done for them and our family. My brothers did nothing when all these things happened yet I stepped up and stopped my life to make sure everyone would be okay.

i don't know how to forgive my mother for these things when she's never once said sorry or even acknowledge that they've happened. She says she needs to be selfish but was she not being selfish when she ran off without saying a word to anyone else? Whenever I try to being these subjects up to my parents they just gang up on me telling me to get over it, but I just can't. Not when they ignore everything that happend.

So what can I do? Do i just cut them out of my life? Try to talk again? I am so lost and don't know where to turn.

TLDR; My mother has been making life a living hell.. Tried to kill herself, steals money, goes to jail yet refuses to admit she's ever done anything wrong. Ignores the fact that I took care of our family for years and just can't take the disrespect anymore. What can I do?"

connection with these other health care professionals—
for example, orthopedic surgeons may refer
their patients to physical therapists for rehabilitation

Oncology is the branch of medicine that deals in diagnosing and treating of cancer. Oncologists must undergo many years of schooling and training. They also work with different types of healthcare professionals, whether it is fellow doctors or nurses and technicians. Patients who visit oncologists are cancer patients who have been referred to the oncologist by their primary care doctors. Oncologists have many tools available to them to help aid in the treatment of cancer. Lastly, there will be many different types of medical transcription reports the transcriptionist will see in this field.

In order for one to become an oncologist, first one must attend a four-year college and attain a bachelor’s degree. After graduating college, one must then attend medical school, which is also four years. Following medical school, the new medical doctor would then do a three-year residency in internal medicine, followed by an oncology internship for two to three years. Nurses and technicians who work with the oncologist generally just need bachelor’s degrees in the required field (Wiki.answers).

Oncologists work closely with many healthcare professionals. They work most closely with a patient’s general practitioner (PCP), radiologists, pathologists, surgeons, radiotherapists, and organ specific specialists. The reason patients visit oncologists is through referral by their pcp when they suspect or detect cancer. 

Oncologists also work closely with radiologists and pathologists. Oncologists take a sample, a biopsy, from the suspected tumor and send it to the pathologist. The pathologist’s job is to define the cells in the sample as cancerous or benign (Pathology). Radiologists use different technologies to get a closer look at tumors, such as: ultrasounds, CT scans, and x-rays (Radiology). 

After oncologists confer with the patient’s primary care doctor, pathologist, and radiologist, they might then meet with an organ specific specialist. These doctors specialize in a specific organ or whole body system, so they are very knowledgeable and might offer special advice as to what is best for the particular patient in question.

With the advice from the specialist, and determinations from the other healthcare professionals involved, the oncologist would then decide what the best course of action would be to get rid of the cancerous cells. One of the options at this point would be radiation therapy in which the oncologist would then meet with a radiotherapist. The radiotherapist is one that applies the radiation treatments to the cancer patient. Another cancer treatment option would be surgery, so the oncologist works very closely with many different types of surgeons, depending on the type of cancer the patient has. 

Oncologists have many tools they use in their field. These include: diagnostic methods, therapies, and nuclear medicine. Diagnostic methods include biopsy, which is taking a sample of the affected cells, endoscopy, which takes an endoscope, a tool used to look inside the body, and examines a certain hollow area of the body (Endoscopy), and blood testing. Blood testing is used in oncology to test certain blood counts associated with different cancers.

There are also many different types of therapies used to treat cancer. The main ones used are chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Some oncologists might also use some less-known types of therapies like hormone therapy, immunotherapy, and alternative therapy.

Chemotherapy is a regimen of cancer-fighting drugs that kill cells in the body that rapidly divide; cancer cells. Unfortunately, chemotherapy has side effects such as hair loss, loss of appetite, weight loss, and these drugs can decrease the production of blood cells. Chemotherapy is usually given intravenously, orally, or injected directly into muscle tissue. Chemo is given in cycles. There are also different types of chemotherapy, combined modality, neo-adjuvant, adjuvant, and palliative. Combined modality chemotherapy is the use of chemo with other forms of cancer treatment such as radiation therapy. Neo-adjuvant chemo is given before surgery to shrink the main tumor. Adjuvant chemotherapy is used after surgery and when there’s little to no evidence of cancer left. Palliative chemotherapy is used when the cancer has progressed too far; it has to intent to actually cure the cancer (Chemotherapy).

Radiation therapy is more direct in that it uses radiation to kill cancer cells. It does this by damaging and changing the DNA of the cancer cells.

The lesser known therapies used in cancer treatment are hormone therapy, immunotherapy, and alternative therapy. Hormone therapy changes the growth patterns of certain cancers. Immunotherapy is sometimes called biological therapy and uses the immune system to help fight the cancer. Alternative therapy would include acupuncture and homeopathy. Acupuncture is the use of thin, tiny needles, stuck into certain points in the body known to correct imbalances within the body. Homeopathy is the study in which scientists determine what causes a disease in one person, but might cure it in another person.

Oncologists also use nuclear medicine, also known as internal radiology. Nuclear medicine is what happens when radionuclides mix with certain elements and then become chemical compounds. Sometimes they combine with pharmaceutical compounds; they then form radiopharmaceuticals.

My speculation on what reports I would see if I worked as a medical transcriptionist for an oncology office would be pre-op and post-op surgery reports, reports involving biopsy, and also reports with just regular check-ups.
In conclusion, oncology is the branch of medicine that deals in diagnosing and treating of cancer. Oncologists are well-trained medical doctors who work with different types of healthcare professionals. Oncology patients are cancer patients. Oncologists have many tools available to them to help aid in the treatment of cancer."
vvzlf,2,2012-07-01,He broke up with me out of the blue and I'm devastated. ,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/vvzlf/he_broke_up_with_me_out_of_the_blue_and_im/,"I'm 19/F and the guy I was seeing is also 19. We had been dating for a little over three months, and everything just seemed to be going perfectly. As short of a time that three months is, we never fought and really just spent most of it enjoying each other's company. Until last night.

I've bent over backwards for this guy, doing so much out of thought and consideration for him. When he needed someone to accompany him to an acquaintance's shotgun wedding, I went. When his fancy internship fell through, I spent hours googling for a new one until I eventually found one. When he was having a bad day, I went out of my way to make it better. When he had a long day at his internship, I was sure to have his favorite dinner ready for him when he came to visit.

Our relationship was semi-long distance. His internship is at the coast, about 3 hours away from our university where I'm taking summer classes, and conveniently, my family has a vacation home about 15 minutes from where he stays. I'd come every weekend just to see him and spend time with him.

On Friday day, everything was normal. I made him dinner, we had sex, and he slept over. He told me I was perfect. We cuddled and he kissed me before he left for his internship. Not even 12 hours later, I get in his car; we're going to see a movie. He even clarified the time and what we were supposed to be seeing a few minutes before he came. And then, he pulls the ""we need to talk,"" shocking me, as I never even saw it coming.

He didn't give me any ""reason."" All he said was, ""I've been thinking a lot lately and I just can't be in a relationship."" Even with all of my tears and questions, he just kept repeating that one line over and over, along with some cliche, ""you're a great girl,"" ""it's nothing you did"" bullshit. He assured me that he hasn't been unfaithful, but for something so unexpected, I have my suspicions. He was just so callous, unsympathetic and unfeeling through the entire time I was falling apart in his car; he was unable to even look at me while he was doing it.

It'd be nice to know why he ended things the way he did so I can have some closure. It's so difficult for me to accept this happening, as for so long, he's been nothing but compliments, telling me how lucky he is to have me and how perfect I am. It's even more shocking because some might say I'm out of his league - which I never thought I was, but I always envisioned myself breaking up with him if it ever came to that.

I know there's other people out there and once time passes, it'll get better. The problem is, I'm back at my university, in a single dorm room, with no friends around, trying to focus on a dry and boring class I didn't want to take in the first place. I feel so lonely and heavy-hearted, and haven't gotten a wink of sleep or a bite of food since it happened. I try to keep telling myself that I have a lot going for myself in life and don't need someone who doesn't treat me like anything less than a goddess, as demonstrated by his overall lack of tact as he broke up with me last night. It's just so hard to actually believe those things when I feel like my world is crashing down around me.

vvpwo,1,2012-07-01,How do I get things better? My Uncle and his family are a pack of douche bags and my Dad just takes it.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vvpwo/how_do_i_get_things_better_my_uncle_and_his/,"My Dad and his brother and Sister in law who are conservative Catholics last year we went camping at this stupid campground that the family goes to year after year and it's basically a crowded shit hole. The only reason he really goes there is because he wants to use his boat there (We live in Michigan there's more than one place to have fun with the boat)
Anycase last year and years before Dad could never get family to come over or have guests. It's always up to him to take care of my grandmother. My Grandmother should in all honesty be placed in a assisted living home) But Uncle will not stand for it. and basically says he will take care of her big surprise my Dad who is retired is obligated to do the heavy work by him. Dad has said to me countless times he's sick of driving her to doctors appointments and such. He won't stand up for himself at all or even me. My Dad when i was five years old went to Illinois to live and work and left me with my grandmother coming back to see me every other weekend. I just wanted to live with my Dad I never even visited his home in all the eight years he was away. He has gotten to the point where some days all he does is sit and play computer chess and surf online and drown himself with watching t.v. it was why we got rid of cable tv. He was watching so much tv to escape the house got put into shambles there are repairs to the house that need to be done and they won't be because he doesn't want to do them and when I do it he gets pissed.  
A little back story here since I was forming my own opinions. My uncle would basically verbally attack me for having another P.O.V. besides his. MY aunt would put pressures on me to become a baker. Why? I still don't know why. Yes I baked and decorated cakes before but that hobby made me fatter and quite frankly I enjoyed the digital arts and sciences better. I still struggle with my weight.  
I was a great college student at first. But later on when I was just going and going and going more to escape the crisis at home. I got caught in this viscus cycle of college classes at the community college that never took me anywhere. I tried to get work locally but i soon gave up because my skills in using digital editing software and Photoshop were all but depleted till I got a copy on Ebay of Adobe CS 5.5 now I'm working on an online career. 

But back to the campground last summer. No one wanted to come to our sight for a bonfire and after basically begging Aunt and Uncle came and so did my 88 year old Grandma. I was never more happy to have people visit us! But my happiness turned into sadness when no one wanted to roast marsh mellows or do anything they just sat and didn't stay longer than 15 minutes my Dad drove my Grandma back to her site at the campground. My Aunt left soon after and my Uncle stayed behind. The weird thing was my Uncle was really unnerved when he was alone with me he and I talked about sci-fi books and about Star Trek. Then as my dad slowly returned he started to get angrier and started to attack what I believed in he verbally attacked President Obama claiming he was a member of the tea party. He talked about how gays were ruining the American family on PBS and NPR where at one point I was an intern at. Then he said something that ripped my soul asunder.
He said me and my Dad were not a family because my Dad didn't remarry. 
I am trained in martial arts to control my anger and at that moment I wanted to grab my poker stick and skewer him. I at some point told him I was Bisexual and he got pissed off blamed me for the argument and grabbed his chair and ran off. I told Dad I didn't want to come out that way but it was the only way to get him to stop. 

But this afternoon was a low, low, low, blow to my Dad. My grandma's birthday was this afternoon and Uncle and aunt came over with my cousin with cake and ice cream. They called and said come at 12 we'll be here. 
We arrived earlier than we were expected as soon as we came they left. They had eaten almost all of the cake and sang Happy Birthday to my grandmother. 
I want to know what do I need to tell my Dad to make him realize these people are assholes and how can I get out of this mess? I'm pretty much running out of hope for myself. "
vviof,10,2012-07-01,How do I come out? (x-post from r/lgbt),[deleted],OpenChristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenChristian/comments/vviof/how_do_i_come_out_xpost_from_rlgbt/,"I recently came to inner terms with my sexuality - bisexuality - and I was wondering how I come out. I understand that this might not be as hard as coming out as gay, but I'm still strugglisng with it. I only feel comfortable telling the people I work with, as my job is literally called ""Youth Intern and Community Organizer for Inclusive and Diverse Communities"". Most of my school friends would be cool with it, but I'm still wary. The ones I'm most worried about are my family. My father is very conservative, and has said - while he was drunk mind you, but said nonetheless - that if I ""ever was a faggot, [he] wouldn't know what to do"". I think my mother and maternal grandparents would be alright, but I have very conservative uncles and aunts. 

If it helps any, I'm also a very devout Catholic - like, daily mass before school when I'm in school (it's a Catholic school).

HELP!"

My first therapist was actually still an intern at my college campus counseling program. The program only allowed you to get 12 sessions, but she requested that I finish out the year with her because I was working so hard and they granted me permission. I think that one of the main things that I liked about her is that she was so new at it. I felt as if she and I were discovering my anxiety and how to deal with it together. She didn't have a ""right"" answer, and I liked that because I still had a bit of my ""teenage"" rebellion in me. 

So, what characteristics do you like in a therapist or psychiatrist?"
vy8f2,3,2012-07-02,Need advice with my new GF. I don't really feel a spark there. What should I do?,cupidatlast,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/vy8f2/need_advice_with_my_new_gf_i_dont_really_feel_a/,"I'm 26, and she's 26. We've been dating for about a month and a half now, and I don't really feel a strong connection with her. Let me elaborate below:

I was in a serious relationship before my current girlfriend for just a little over a year. It wasn't until our one year anniversary (when she didn't want to hang out with me -- mind you, we were living together) that I knew things weren't going correctly. Long story short, I ended the relationship, and spiraled into a depression due to the absolute psychotic and abusive relationship I had with this woman. It took me about a month to get over the depression, and another 2-3 months before I was really ready to start talking to other girls again. 

After 4 months of being single, I created an account on a dating website. I hit it off with one of the girls on there (my current girlfriend) and after talking to her on the phone, and via IM, we decided we should meet. 

I drove to her place (which was about 4 hours away) and we had some drinks, and ended up having a really good time. We have a pretty good amount of things in common, and it wasn't hard to keep a conversation going with her. We ended up having sex that first night. I asked her to be my girlfriend the next night. We end up having sex that night, and again in the morning, then one more time before I leave .

It wasn't until two weeks after that when I could see her again. I made the drive, and everything started off what seemed like it was great. We basically have sex the second I get in the door, go out drinking, and have sex again when I come home. At this point in time, I'm starting to feel as if sex is losing its meaning. We wake up in the morning, and have sex again (I'm reluctant, and worn out, but we end up doing it anyway).

This continues this way. Now, mind you, she doesn't have any money. I pay for literally everything. All of our drinks, all of our food, everything. She has been working this job only making $9/hr and can barely pay for her rent and car payment. This started to wear on me after the third weekend we spent together.

We've been dating now for about a month and a half and I've seen her 4 weekends of that. I have spent an ungodly amount of money on gas, food, and booze while visiting her. I feel like sex has lost its meaning. I feel like the spark wasn't really ever there, and I asked her to be my girlfriend before I really knew her. 

I have a year left of college, and I'm doing an internship now where I have a pretty good chance of getting a job offer at the end of it. I told her this, and she said that she refuses to move from the city she's currently living in. I tried to politely tell her that if I'm offered a position for 50-60k a year, I'm not just going to pass it up to possibly get a different job in her city. (I moved for my last girlfriend, and it really didn't turn out well)

Does this sound like a typical rebound relationship? I really don't want to hurt her at all. The thought of me breaking up with her, or me making her cry in general, really makes me not want to do it.

I'm so god damn confused. This is my second girlfriend... What should I do?

tl;dr - I'm not feeling the spark I think I should be with my new girlfriend. What should I do?"

So I was a virgin until 22. I was awkward, didn't consider myself attractive, and was vastly overweight. Then I went on a Eurotrip with a friend. Stopped by Amsterdam, and in 3 days, I went from a virgin to sleeping with 8 model quality girls. 

I came back to the states, managed to get into a relationship. After that one ended, I got into another. That one ended traumatically, and after that I had a 10 month dry spell. My solution? Coming full circle - I visited 5 more prostitutes in 4 months.

After that, I stopped because I ran myself dry. I spent 6 months worth of savings from an internship on those 5 girls. The fact that I couldn't see one again drove me crazy - I was fapping atleast 3 times a day everyday. Once I graduated and got a nice paying job (past jan), I got back to the same old habit. From Feb until April, I saw 8.

In total, of the 23 girls i've been with - 21 were prostitutes. Average price? $300/h

I spent more than $6,000 on prostitutes, and had I not been a student during that time, I'm sure that number would've at least doubled.

Since April, I stopped. I replaced it with the same habit as before - fapping 3-4 times a day. As of 3 days ago, I decided enough is enough. I'm tired of not having control over my sex life and succumbing from one addiction to another (prostitutes to porn). 

PS. The reason I haven't had a relationship since my second sexual one is due to extreme trust issues, fear, and trauma caused by it. I don't want to go too indepth but the girl had a rough life, and a craving for one of her own addictions quite literally almost got me killed in a setup (she wanted my money). That and learning afterwards of chronic cheating and a possible STD pretty much traumatized me from getting close to another girl ever since. I've seeked therapy, but it's still a work in progress

Long post and a bit all over the place, but yeah, wish me luck. Day 3 and I'm already browsing that dark expensive side of the web. I can't give in again. 

If anyone went through something similar... I would love some advice

TLDR - Traumatized by an ex who literally almost killed me, cheated on me, STD scare. Resorted to prostitutes ever since. Tried to get over it with excessive masturbation but just got addicted to porn. Now going cold turkey to try and get control over my sex life again.

EDIT - Holy shit that felt good getting off my chest"

&gt;I'm from a town in the country where all we had was cows, chickens and, by chance, an internet connection (a bit dramatic but you get the idea :D )
&gt;
&gt;so i spent most of my early life on the internet where i learned to program, operative systems and all i could about computers
&gt;i had no up to date hardware so all i know about electrical engineering is from what I've read or heard, but as soon as it gets to software i feel at home
&gt;
&gt;it's useless to say that my parents were so disappointed that i didn't like the farm life but since my mother died (10 years ago) my dad would talk to me only to ask for help with the machines and stuff, we even ate at two different times!
&gt;(as today I'm not sure he understand the difference between a TV and computer)
&gt;
&gt;i graduated from High school with nearly minimum of grades but managed to get into the best university of my nation acing the admission &gt;test and studying as much as i could
&gt;
&gt;this first year has been a radical change in my life
&gt;
&gt;on the social side i had to learn to relate with new people which while it might seem easy..for me it has been madness
&gt;BUT i managed to keep a GPA of 4.00 (A+) (according to http://www.foreigncredits.com/Resources/GPA-Calculator/)
&gt;which will allows me to keep my scholarship so i won't have to work to pay living and university 


**TL;DR for the quoted text:** I'm totally lost in this environment and but i managed to pass the first year with very good grades


I've always dreamed about attending MIT as graduate since to me it always looked a boiling pot of amazing technology and people
and more importantly most of the papers/publications I've been reading in the last years were from there

during the last months i started to get interested in BCI (brain computer interfaces) and after talking about it to a few professors one of them pointed me to one of his students who has a start-up about BCIs
he suggested me to start hacking with some of those interfaces, which i will do as soon as I'll be done with my exams (a week).
i started to study how it works and already ordered the needed hardware


**what could i do to improve my university career?** i feel like aiming for A+ is a waste of time if i can work on side projects or internships and still get good grades but i noticed i have no real idea of what I'm expected/should do and how things work in academia


I'm studying biomedical engineering but considering to switch to EE"

Let me give you some background on my job, and my history.


I graduated college with a BS degree in Information Systems Management last November.  I started working for a big company in January under the title ""Software Engineer"".  


I work mostly in a perl enviornment, (lots of database based programming to be done), as well as SQL, and even write some web apps for internal use.
My previous expeirience consists of a 3 month internship as a student system adminatrator (at college), and some retail expierience (Best Buy, etc.).


My salary is 30k.  Is this low? After looking around on various websites, I see that the LOW end for software engineers in my area, is around 60k.  I know I am still in a somwehat entry level position, but half of the lowest bound seems unfair.


Can someone put this into perspective for me?



Let me know if you need more clarification to help out as well.



Thank you!"

This winter I tried to get an internship but I never passed the psychometric tests stage. I am simply scared that I will never get a job in my industry (accounting, all the applications are for a charted accountant training contract) just because I can't seem to be able to improve my score on these tests (especially the numerical ones).

I have a good math background, but obviously I am doing something wrong  when approaching these type of tests since I can't seem to finish them on time.

I know that I should ""practice, practice, practice"", but apart from this do you have any experience or advice/tips how to approach them when practicing? Do you know any good books I should read or any particular tests I should practice?

For example, for standard SHL test of 20 questions in 20 minutes (or 15 question in 20 minutes, I don't remember exactly) how do you get to do one question in 1 minute? Sometimes there is too much to calculate or you don't get the question from the first reading. Any tips or shortcuts I should know?

vxsyy,4,2012-07-02,Motherboard will not recognize new SSD with SATA operation set to AHCI,DFP_,24hoursupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/24hoursupport/comments/vxsyy/motherboard_will_not_recognize_new_ssd_with_sata/,"I've been in contact with Dell and Samsung about this for about a month on and off now, but I'm still completely in the dark about this.  My laptop is a Dell XPS L701x with 6 GB RAM and an i7-Q740 processor, it contains 2 HDD bays.  I've updated the BIOS and all drivers to their latest versions.  What happens is after installing the SSD (Samsung 830 series 64 GB) in the second bay when I turn on my computer with SATA operation set to AHCI mode, BiOS claims that the second HDD bay is empty.  When I boot with SATA operation set to ATA the drive dose appear in the second HDD slot in BiOS, but attempting to boot into Windows 7 installed on the primary HDD in ATA mode results in a BSOD (the computer turns off before I can read the error message).  Booting into Ubuntu when it was installed on the same HDD worked, and hardinfo also recognized the SSD, but trying to install Ubuntu to the SSD resulted in the system crashing.

What I've tried so far:

**Switching the slots of the drives:**
Impossible.  I tried this early on and found that one of the screws securing the bracked holding the primary HDD to the laptop was stripped before I got to it.  I can't remove it.

**Testing the SSD in another computer**:  Can't.  This is the only computer I own, none I can borrow, I'm in a new town for the summer doing an internship and don't know anyone here who would let me borrow their computer and test the drive out.

**Updating SSD firmware**:  The Samsung SSD Magician that came with the SSD fails, since it doesn't recognize the SSD is installed.  I tried to update from a bootable USB in ATA when the drive was recognized, but the UI was bizzare.  I could read Samsung in the corner of the screen, but the rest of the text was replaced with green bars on a black backdrop.  I can try doing this again.

Additional Notes:  Dell customer service rep said once that the minimum size of a HDD that can be recognized by this system is 256 GB.  I know this to be a complete lie due to the many reports on notebookreview of individuals running just fine with a 128 GB SSD.  I'm a little concerned that my BiOS can't recognize 64 GB sized SSDs, but Crucial guarantees that their SSD of the same size of my Samsung SSD is compatible with my system.

Specs:

* Dell XPS L701x i7-Q740 6 GB DDR3 RAM, 500 GB 7200 RPM HDD in primary drive

* 64 GB Samsung 830 series Solid State Drive

vxim5,3,2012-07-02,When it's too late?,Bitter_Peter,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vxim5/when_its_too_late/,"So, here is the deal:

I'm 22 and I'll finish my bachelor's degree in Statistical Sciences by the end of the year and I found out I pretty much hate it (I mean, I like the mathematical and the programming parts, but, as I found out, it is near impossible to find a job where I'll use it). Because I won't be hired in the place where I'm an intern I started thinking what the fuck I'm going to do with my life. I have a great interest in CS, and I actually was accepted in a university in this course, bud I didn't register because...well, because I was a rebel, I guess.

So I guess I have 2 options:

1. Pursue a master's degree in Statistics, maybe trying to find a intersection between CS and Statistics (while I do realise this intersection exists, and is a quite big one, I'm not in the US nor Europe (I'm in Brazil, if that matters), so finding a place where I can pursue this area of research is hard, especially coming form the Statisticas side).

2. Try to pursue a second bachelor's degree, this time in CS, starting it  at 23, probably finishing at 27, 28 (I would be able to cut many math credits). I would be damn afraid to start job hunting at this age in a field that I have no professional experience.

I am actually considering doing both at the same time, but maybe that's too much.

I don't know, can anybody give me any insight?"

_____  
I'm fairly bad at starting things out, but here goes. I'm Canada-born,  Texas-raised, 19 years of age, a man, and (despite the surrounding caustic Christian environment) I am an atheist. 

It's funny because I became an atheist around the age of 10 kind of... suddenly. Originally, I was Catholic, *very* Catholic. I prayed every night for my family's safety and the safety of my pets Emma (who passed last June) and Kitty (who got hit by a car 10 years ago), I attended Sunday church and Mass every day I got the chance. Then, when I turned 7, I read about the Holocaust. After that, I still believed in God, just that he didn't give a flying fuck about us. Then one day,  I just woke up and felt that there wasn't a god. A few years later, I found that I was openly and unabashedly calling myself ""atheist"" in public despite the overwhelmingly cloying air of ignorance and intolerance that purveys most of Texas. A few times I was called a Satanist, a few times I was called a Communist, and more than a few times I was called an asshole. The first two came as no surprise to me because, again, I live in Texas, but the asshole comment always stepped in my egg salad. I've been tolerant of everyone my whole life. I've even been tolerant of the people who tell me I'm going to burn in Hell for all eternity because I don't believe in their particular version of the magic sky daddy. Even when I was 7 and people were telling me I was going to burn in Hell just for asking *too many questions* I was tolerant. The only time I've ever been intolerant is when somebody calls me stupid over a subject I know very much about or when I feel like making a joke.

As another component to the backstory of my journey to atheism, I am the offspring of a wedlocked couple composed of an abusive drunk and a self-deprecating and very loving mother. I am bisexual and open to any kind of love. I don't give two shits what people do in this life and I don't give two shits about what they believe they'll do in the next. My friend once asked me why I became an atheist and I couldn't answer him immediately. It had just been who I was for so long, I forgot why I became one. The following list is something I made more for myself, so I never forget all of the reasons I became an atheist. So I never try and relapse into the drug that is religion. 

Reason's I became an Atheist in order of impactfulness:


* 1.The Holocaust- When I use this term, I'm not just referring to ""The Holocaust,"" (although that one played the biggest role), I'm referring to every genocide that's ever been recorded. It's just a standard ""If there was a God or what-have-you, why did so many people have to die?"" After reading Elie Wiesel's *Night*, I was utterly convinced that if there was a God, he just didn't give a *fuck* about any of us.
* 2. My Family- My mother is amazing. She is the most fantastic woman I've ever met. She doesn't care that I am an atheist, she doesn't care about my lovers or girlfriends/boyfriends, she doesn't care about any of that. *She just cares that I am her son*. So why did she have to marry that Irish piece of shit who physically abused her? Because of God's unholy judgement. Without the influence of my Great Grandma (RIP), who had a profound impact on my mother's life because her mother got hit by a truck, she wouldn't of had to marry my deadbeat, fuckhead sperm-donor. I could have been, and basically was, raised solely by the morals that governed my mother. He was just there to remind her that she was a woman and he was a man. Currently, I am best friends with my mother (who was 20 when she had me, roughly a baby herself) and I have disowned my father, who I now call ""Chris"" and haven't spoken to in 4 years. My last conversation was ""Can I have some help paying for college?"" to which he responded ""You sound like your mother."" I immediately removed him from every social networking site I am a part of. I don't plan on attending his funeral and I wish he would die sooner rather than later. I'm always waiting for my Grandmother to text me on Facebook saying ""Your father got raped by a bobcat and died of internal bleeding yesterday. He's dead."" So that I can immediately do the touchdown dance. As for my mother, she's married to her soulmate and in one of the happiest relationships I have ever seen. I can't wait to have what she has one day.
* 3. Death- I used to believe that when you died the place you went to when you died depended on your actions no matter what and that it depended on your religion. It was one of the more tolerant views that I've ever heard of. I still held this view 6 years ago when I was 13. Now I believe that this life is the only one that you have and that you shouldn't waste it. In the past 2 years, I have had many different sexual partners, many different kinds of hallucinogenic drugs, many parties, and many wonderful and many shitty friends. I have lived my life more in those two years than I could have hoped for. It's actually gotten to the point where I'm ready to have kids and settle down as soon as I finish college at Colorado School of Mines. I honestly feel I have lived a life worth living and I'm only 19. I don't impose this life on anyone and I'm not suggesting everyone should ""go do drugz, it r life better maker.""
* 4. Pot- I have smoked pot since I was 12 years old. I recently had to quit because I got an internship and they do random drug testing here in the states. It *always* got me thinking about religion and, well, just about everything. I'd grab a bag of cheetos or dorritos, munch away, and just... ponder. It has been a main source of inspiration and feeling for me and my current girlfriend/boyfriend's feelings toward it greatly affect my relationship with them, the same as their religious outlook.
* 5. The People- I don't have to tell you how stupid some people sound when they talk about the past. About history. Scientific evidence is normally visible proof that leads and points to a significant discovery. When I read ""Science is just like religion, no facts"" or its equivalent I shit a brick. I don't want to be grouped with people I consider to be clinically retarded, so I jumped off that bandwagon as soon as possible.
* 6. My Kids- My entire life, I've wanted a kids. Specifically, a raven-haired daughter named Violet. I want these kids to grow up unabashed and in a manner they see fit. If they want to practice LaVeyan Satanism, that's fine. That's their choice and I'll love them for it. I'd even permit all of the ""ground-grown"" drugs such as shrooms and pot. That's fine, I did them all the time from 12-18 (I'd tell them 16-18 until they were much much older though). If I were Catholic or any other religion, I'd basically be required to make them be that religion. Atheism doesn't really hold that above their heads.
* 7. The Various Religions- There's so many religions in the world, why choose any at all? That's my view and that may end up being my kid's view, but I'd rather not waste time beating a dead horse (not the saying, I'm pretty sure that's a custom of some religion somewhere).
* 8. My Profession- I'm going into a scientific profession, Engineering. I've known this since I was 5. I decided, then and there, that I would adopt a scientific mindset.  As we all know, science and religion hardly go hand-in-hand.
* 9. Rebellion- I have, since I was very young, had a ""fuck the establishment"" kind of attitude. I openly advocated gay rights and religious freedom when I was 8. I lived in suburbian half-rural Texass, so this was... frowned-upon. Most of the adults were like ""Oh, he doesn't know what he's talking about, he's 8."" This infuriated me more than anything in the world. The assumption that because one is young, one knows nothing. I knew more about the world than most of the people here know about *cereal*. When I became an atheist, it was also to say ""fuck you, fuck you, and fuck you"" to everybody who gave a shit.

There are more, but they're not coming to mind immediately.

Thanks for reading if you read. If you have questions I'll be happy to answer them.

TL;DR: My mom's awesome, genocide is bad, my biological father is a piece of garbage, everyone dies, people are stupid, I'm fairly tolerant regardless, forced marriage sucks, I used to smoke pot, I want kids some day who make their own choices, I'm bi, I'm going into Engineering, there are too many religions, I'm somewhat rebellious, I feel more grown up than I should, I'm somewhat pretentious, and this TL;DR is getting TL.

When I became an atheist, it was also to say ""fuck you, fuck you, and fuck you"" to everybody who gave a shit.

There are more, but they're not coming to mind immediately.

Thanks for reading if you read. If you have questions I'll be happy to answer them.

**TL;DR:** My mom's awesome, genocide is bad, my biological father is a piece of garbage, everyone dies, people are stupid, I'm fairly tolerant regardless, forced marriage sucks, I used to smoke pot, I want kids some day who make their own choices, I'm bi, I'm going into Engineering, there are too many religions, I'm somewhat rebellious, I feel more grown up than I should, I'm somewhat pretentious, and this TL;DR is getting TL.

EDIT: Bolded the TL;DR."

I'm trying to find a job doing either technical writing or system/database administration. I don't have professional experience doing either, but I am about to finish an AA in Information Technology and am still working on building a portfolio.

Obviously it would be nice to obtain a full position, but I have the flexibility right now that I can take on an internship or even an unpaid position if it could help me build experience and make connections.

Does anyone have suggestions on finding internships? Or the best way /things to avoid when making cold-contact to a company?

Thanks!"
vx8db,26,2012-07-02,Not My Best Summer,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/vx8db/not_my_best_summer/,"Hey Reddit, been debating for a while and I guess I just want to write this out to feel better I suppose, any advice or comment would be appreciated.

This summer has simply been awful for me. I am a pretty optimistic and positive guy, but even this summer has been taking its toll. To start off, I am in an internship in Iowa, and am currently about 4 hours away from anyone I know. I thought coming in that it would be a great opportunity to meet people and have a lot of fun, NOT! All I do is work from 7 until about 5, go home and stay to myself for the whole week. There are about 60 interns and I only work with 3 and do not hang out with any of them. Everyone is from Iowa, so they all just go home after work and hang out with buddies. Here I am all alone and starting to realize I don't like the work at all.

Then comes my grandmother getting sick in another country, and my dad has to fly off to take care of her. He missed Father's Day and my Birthday, and I am paying half the bills at home since things are pretty tight and have been for a long time now. I am constantly worried both of them are ok and it just wears on my mind.

Lastly my girlfriend of about half a year decides to break it off right before I start my internship. We were fine when we left school (She was a senior, I was a sophomore at the time), and she was coming back for Grad School so I thought all would be well. Suddenly she said things didn't feel right for her or something along those lines. I am fucking mad. I know she just graduated and friends left and all that, but I see no reason to fucking leave me too! I know she is afraid of commitment and all but GIVE ME A FUCKING BREAK! You don't play someone up all that time, not see them for 2 weeks, and then say it doesn't feel right anymore. She trusted me and I was perfect and yada yada yada, forget you...

In the end, I realize my summer would still suck even if she was with me, and I understand it was hard for her to do that. I know she cared deeply for me and put a lot of thought into it. I feel like when everything is crazy in her life, she doesn't know what to do. Still hurts though man. First girl I really felt was right and now it all suddenly is gone. I am a really outgoing and positive guy, but for once I feel this UTTER sense of being completely alone and I can do nothing to help my situation. I sit at my apartment and just count the days off until I am back at school (I attend in another state).

In the end, this makes me a way stronger person, and I have a TON to look forward to. In the end, but for now it really sucks.

Happy 20th birthday to me, huh? Thanks everyone for listening/reading.

vx7oc,3,2012-07-02,Should I question where our relationship is going... I am picking up mixed signals.  ,MrJotJotts,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/vx7oc/should_i_question_where_our_relationship_is_going/,"-Have been hanging out with a certain girl more and more as of late. I have been picking up subtle signals from her sporadically. Don't know if she playing me with her woman ways, or is she testing the waters? -Women readers, would a upfront, mature, logical, and calm Q&amp;A session and ""where is this going"" type of relationship talk be appreciated? Would it ruin a friendship if this is just a shot in the dark? Would such a conversation show confidence and tip the scale in a man's favor?  





**[Background *long post*]**





-I am a 26M, she is a 27F (Now known as ""L""), and we have known each other for nearly 7 years now. In recent months I have been at home and waiting for a internship to start this summer. We have hung out more in my down time, with no school, and just recently I have been getting some murky signals that I don't want to test and ruin a friendship. She is a great mother to a 4 year old son (Now known as ""K"") with a ex boyfriend who still gets the kid every weekend. Dad seems like a decent guy, kind of a goof-up but does well with the kid and gives L money every week for the kid. Im cool with him, we have gotten along the few times we've meet.





-L is kind of ""one of the guys"" if you will. She hangs out with mostly guys, likes hockey, drinks beer, swears like a sailor, only a few close female friends because in her words ""Bitches hate me. I don't get along with other girls"". So we have hung out with our 4 person group (my 2 closest friends, her and I) pretty regularly over the past 7 years and all 4 of us are drinking buddies since I was 21. From day 1 of meeting L I always had a tad of goof-ball flirt going on with her. She is physically a mid to high 8, personality probably a solid 7. I am a 6'1"" big guy, XL shirt wearing lumberjack style, physical apearance maybe about a 7 (my face is symmetrical and i am no hideous c.h.u.d.). So the playful flirting was always just a joke to me, I was trying to level up my 'speech' and started forcing myself to speak with more confidence in any and all interactions. But always a gentleman.





*This pretty much sets the groundwork for why I don't want to let this go on and get hurt (foreshadowing), and also not to fuck up a great friendship.





-About 3 months ago everyone went to the bar and had a few drinks with the group. I drove L because she lives less than a mile from my place and she has no car. We all drink, be merry, I keep it to 2 beers over 3 hours, she had about 6, and I drove us home. She invited me in for a night cap beer. While I am not looking for anything sexual with this girl at the moment... Man instinct kicked in and was out of the car before she was. We had a beer and fell asleep spooning on the couch watching reruns of friends. We wake up like 2 hours later, and she says shes got to get to work in the morning and she is going to sleep in her bed. She said that I could stay the night since it was late and no need to drive home. Im fine with it, and nestle into the couch. She turns back and asks if I was going to sleep in the bed with her. Again Man instinct shot me off the couch and walking towards her and the bedroom.





-We end up spooning and falling asleep. I am a gentleman and did not try to slip any moves more than the spoon, mainly because I knew we both had to be up in less than 5 hours. Though I slept like shit with a wandering mind. She wakes up in the morning, gets ready for work while I sleep in her bed. I leave and her friend drives her to work.





-Another time after that... bored out of our minds the group ended up meeting up at a karaoke bar and whooped it up. I, not the biggest of drinkers anymore, keep a slow and steady pace and finish with water and we end up closing out the bar. L has had many to drink and I again end up taking her home. I follow her in to use the restroom and she changes into PJs for bed. End of the night wind down with a water and watching the TV with her for a min. She is kind of giving me bed room eyes and hinting that she is le tired and going to bed soon. She walks down the hall and our buddy who was at the bar with us walks in the front door. IDK what it was about... but the realization was setting in that I may have just gotten cock blocked. Being the safety mom she is, she offers our buddy a spot of the couch or I offer the empty bed at my house (20 miles closer than his house) because he wasn't really in a shape to drive. We all chilled and I told him I would leave and he would and L could sleep. While we were leaving I was getting puppy dog eyes, a very long hug, a ""Goodnight, love you"", and a ""this-fucking-guy-busting-in-drunk-now-im-sad"" look on her face with a wave goodbye. I txt her back to see if she wanted me to come over... nothing (next morning she found out the phones lost and we recover it the next day).





**[Recent]**

-We have been hanging out and I have tried to brush the encounters off as drunken attraction. But have been hanging out with her and her kid more too. The kid looks up to me a bit I suppose and digs me because we will all play around when I am visiting and he is there. I start to get the feeling that she was testing me hanging out with the kid. I don't mind visiting and having something to do on boring days, so its been welcomed.  And then comes the kill joy. Today my whole family invites K and L to pool party bbq at my aunts house.





-I'm not one to violate privacy, but this was unavoidable. She went to change the kid and I looked down to see her phone buzzing with a txt msg. IPhone lock screen message preview lights up and two msgs display ""pssst"" and ""I miss your lips pressing against mine"". I look away and don't say anything and just kind of was bummed the rest of the day and I don't know why. There was no confirmed status change between us and other then a few nights i slept over nothing ever happened between us.





-I've really wanted to keep this on the DL since we are all going to a wedding this weekend and staying in a hotel as my date. (this wedding is my group buddies sisters wedding, crashing it kinda).  I don't want to ruin anything before hand so I'm biting my tongue until this wedding is over to potentially save from ruining a fun time.





-I am not one to play games in  relationship any more, past girlfriends kind of screwed me over so I try to be upfront and honest about everything now a days.  I am thinking about asking her a few questions about us to see where this is going after the wedding on the drive home.  I mainly would like to get a straight answer about what is going on between us so I don't start getting too attached to the kid and also start developing any other feelings for her on any other level then friends.  





**TL;DR: Been hanging out with long time friend more often, and she has recently been confusing me with her woman signals.  Don't know if I have/had a shot, or she is playing me.  Plan on talking to her after a wedding we are all going to this weekend as not to awkward up a fun time. **

I am 21 years old and will be a senior in college come September. I should graduate after this year and I will have a degree in Information Technology &amp; Informatics with a minor in English.

Anyway I've been thinking about careers a lot and looking at jobs (I didn't land an internship unfortunately) and I have a lot of questions about the IT field. If you guys could help me with them, that'd be great.

1. I think I want to be a sysadmin, because I like setting up tech stuff and watching it all work together. I also think it'd be a job where I get to do a bunch of things and learn a lot. However, is this a really viable career where I can continually find advancement in my career and increases in responsibility and pay? 

2. For the sysadmin position, what is the logical career path? I ask this because I don't want to graduate college and work at like a Best Buy or something just to work up at the position as a sysadmin. Are there more common entry-level jobs for sysadmins or is it suggested I start at helpdesk or something?

3. I'm not a really technically inclined guy; I've always liked computers and I'm not necessarily afraid to play around with them, but I'm definitely not a genius or a hardcore PC person. For example, the other day I bought and set up a router for my girlfriend's family and while I understood a lot of what the advanced settings were (ports, DNS, etc), I didn't really know what to do with them. I see tons of people on reddit and even in college that know basically every intricate detail of computers and spend all day optimizing this and installing custom OSes into that and I feel way behind, especially for someone with a technical degree. Will this be a real problem or would the IT knowledge be more on the site stuff? I don't want to be the idiot in the company who doesn't know anything and people have to babysit.

4. My IT&amp;I degree is not very specialized; I have taken a class on Java, Python, I'll take one on SQL, some tech management classes, Oracle, etc. However, nothing really goes in depth there, it's all introduction to IT topics. Is that a bad thing? If it is, is there a way to improve upon a general, ""surface"" IT education?

5. If you had to give one important piece of advice to someone interviewing for their first IT positions, what would you say?

My girlfriend and I have been dating for two years. In these two years, we've seen each other almost everyday because we attend the same university. We hung out together on the weekends and were seldom apart. In May 2011, which was roughly a year ago, we decided to move in together.


We've experienced our fair share of fights and disputes that often ended in emotional explosions, but overall our relationship is happy. Although neither of us are super clingy, I want to emphasize the fact that we were rarely apart in these last two years.


Mid-June, I moved to China from Canada to start my internship that will last 2.5 months until the very end of August. We said our goodbyes and we were sad to be apart, but neither of us were super upset. I thought it wouldn't be a big deal initially because 2.5 months is only 10 weeks, which isn't a very long time at all.


It's been 2.5 weeks since I arrived in Shanghai. My girlfriend is doing fine in Canada and we skype and talk every few days. But lately I have been feeling really down. I guess you don't really know how valuable someone is to you until you're away from that person for a good while. I feel like my emotional stability is taking a turn for the worse. The humid/hot weather here, my stressful and often exhausting work and the fact that I barely know anyone in this city makes me awfully homesick. I miss my girlfriend a LOT. Walking back from work today, I found myself tearing up.


I know our current long-distance relationship pales in comparison with some of yours, reddit, but what advice do you have for me to pass the next 8 weeks or so without my girlfriend? How do I cope?


To provide some more context, I'll give you a rundown of my day. I wake up in the morning around 7am, get to work around 8am. I eat lunch at noon and then leave work around 6pm, eating dinner on the way home. After I'm home, I work out while watching TV and then read or browse the internet until I fall asleep. Sometimes at night I talk to my girlfriend, but I don't want her to wake up early all the time to talk to me (she has to wake up at 6am to talk to me). I'm sure that time will pass faster if I make some friends, but the culture and langauge barriers look mighty tall at this point. I'm pretty introverted.


Any help, tips, etc. are appreciated!"

I've all but completed the units required for my major in Criminology (one unit left, whee!), and have my other major in Human Rights Theory and an elective sequence to complete. I would really like to get involved in some kind of internship - partially because I know it will look great on a CV, but mostly because I don't want to wait until my honours year to continue my studies in criminal justice issues. I love this field of study, I want to immerse myself in it as fully as possible and I know this is what I want to do with the rest of my life.

So I'm wondering whether anybody knows of any institutions within Australia that would be willing to offer a student of Criminology some kind of work experience or internship? I know I want to work in law reform or enforcement once I finish my undergraduate degree (and possibly postgraduate qualifications), so anything pertinent to that would be amazing.

While I'm in Victoria, I'd be willing to spend half a year or so saving up enough money to spend some time interstate to work with a relevant institution, because I know it's an investment well worth my time!

vx39z,1,2012-07-02,"I have just finished my first year in college studying ministry. I have always undoubtedly believed in God, but am just now coming to the notion that maybe I've been wrong. Reddit, what should I do?",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vx39z/i_have_just_finished_my_first_year_in_college/,"Title says it all. I grew up in the church, a faith-based family, and was very active in my youth group during middle school and high school. Late in my high school years, I decided upon college and my vocation choice. I just finished my first year of college with an intended ministry major, and I have several deep relationships and connections at a very expensive private Christian school. I also have a wide variety of experience in this field, especially for my age. My entire church and family is supportive and excited for my future plans, it'd really stink to go out at all, let alone with the reason that I don't believe in anything anymore. 

On the flip side, I just recently (few months) got broken up with by my long-term girlfriend who also shares my faith values. Am I maybe just going through a phase right now with all that's going on? I would rather I didn't feel like this, and would choose so if I could. However, I know I need to deal with all of this: I just don't know how.

Reddit, I'm lost. Given my ""type"" of friends, I feel there are only a few people I could talk to without feeling judged. Of those few people, I feel that 100% of them would be disappointed in my unintentional doubts. On top of all this, I currently am IN an internship, in charge of discipling and teaching others. It feels wrong, but what else can I do? I feel stuck.

I understand that some of you (or most of you) may not know where I'm coming from or have ill conceptions about faith, but I would appreciate your positive advice in anyway you can give it.

So Reddit, what do you think? Do I stay in school? Switch my major? What would I tell my family and others? Do you think what I'm feeling is a real switch in my beliefs? Or will time wash this over? Or do I need more time to tell one way or the other?"

Some questions (no spoilers... kinda)

- Why does Mackenzie not know how to send an email?

- Why is Maggie (previously an intern from 2 minutes ago?) the one to do a pre-interview for the main guest?

- What is going on with Jim and Maggie? Did they sleep together between episode 1 and 2? Because two people who just started working together don't act like this.

- Why is Neil once again a source of information and comedy instead of being a fully flushed out character?

It is definitely preachy at times, but I give Sorkin the license to be preachy just as long as it's well crafted writing. This episode wasn't. Even by your normal CSI, Law &amp; Order, and Grey's Anatomy television drama writing standards, this episode was all over the place and the characters were 1 dimensional. I really hope Newsroom doesn't go the same route as ['Studio 60'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_60_on_the_Sunset_Strip) did... we'll know for sure if there is a 'bomb threat to the building' episode near the end of this season."

After zero success with my first degree (English) I humbly ask for any and all advice on how best to return to school and begin a new degree, computer science. Since I'm bound by my area, I'd like to attend [Villanova University.](http://csc.villanova.edu/)

There are a few things I'd like to address:

1. **Previous Credits:** I am not an incoming freshman. I'm not a transferring student either. And, since I'm trying for something completely outside of my first major, there's no way I'd go straight into a Graduate Program. How, exactly, does someone apply for a second degree?

2. **Computer Science Major:** I'm immensely intrigued by programming. I see it as its own language, the only one that literally transforms words and imagination into products. It's like talking things into existence. Is my excitement justified, or merely glorified? Could I be on the cutting edge of innovation, or will I likely be shoved onto a stuffy cubicle farm?

3. **Computer Science Job Market:** I hear the statistics. Unemployment is up and corporations are outsourcing. I get it. What, though, could I realistically expect coming out of school? Assuming I intern while taking classes, how good are my chances to land a decent job?

4. **The College Experience:** I feel like I ""missed out"" on something my first round at college. I didn't join a sorority or participate in any of the activities I love, like singing and swimming. Part of me wants to return to school for strictly business, but the other part wants to try these things out too. Mind, I'm almost 25-- would that matter/ be creepy?

5. **Financial Aid:** Since I've already attended a four-year college (and racked up a decent sum in loans, &gt;20k), how likely am I to receive financial aid? How and when would I begin requesting assistance? To those who kept a part-time job during school, was it worth it? Or should someone concentrate solely on school?

vwwy5,1,2012-07-02,In love with GF but feel like she's going nowhere in life fast.  Is this a deal breaker?  Should I go?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/vwwy5/in_love_with_gf_but_feel_like_shes_going_nowhere/,"I'm 24(M) and have been with my girlfriend (24F) for 4 years, going on 5.  In most aspects, we come from completely different backgrounds.  I was raised by a family in which getting a college degree is the norm; it was always assumed that this was the best way to get a job.  My girlfriend would be the first person in her family to get a degree, permitted that she graduates.  I guess that most of my family is middle to upper-middle class and hold down pretty good jobs, while most of her family gets along on minimum wage.  And so forth.

My girlfriend and I started college at the same time.  I graduated last year and have a paid internship at a law firm.  She...has more credits than to be considered just a freshman, but not quite enough to be considered a sophomore.  This is getting ridiculous.  She's not unintelligent by any means, but I would attribute this to laziness.  She misses registration dates because she doesn't look them up, she forgets to do homework (or just doesn't), she barely glances over notes the morning of exams.  She says that she wants her bachelor's degree to get a good job in computer science.  She's going to school part time and working full time to pay bills which is fine, but while she says she aims for a job in computer science, she only applies to jobs like fast food or retail.  Nothing that's going to help her get a career in the field that she wants to be in.

I am completely in love with her, but the way that she's going about in life is increasingly bothering me.  We had an argument about it and she said she's doing the best she can, but now she's saying that she's hurt because it's like she hasn't met my expectations while she believed that we loved each other so much that nothing else mattered.  She says I've done nothing but played mind games with her and that all this time, she's been trying her best.  I wanted to make plans to move in together soon because my boss has indicated that I've done a good enough job to open a position for me, but I'm having trouble with the idea of her not getting anywhere until she's in her 30's.  I have no idea if I'm being a jackass.

**TL;DR Have been with girlfriend for over 4 years.  I love her and hoped to marry her one day, but am getting frustrated because she's not making any progress in life due to seeming laziness.  She thinks I'm being unfair and says she's doing all she can.  Not sure what to do.**"

A little background.  I'm 20, will be starting my last year of college this fall and graduating with a BS in Electrical Engineering next spring.  I am currently in Seattle Washington working for an Aerospace Company as an electrical engineering intern.  I shed religion around the beginning of the year but decided to never tell my traditional Catholic family and I don't plan on ever telling them unless they bring it up.

Anyway, when my mother found out about my internship she thought it would be great to come and visit me in seattle and spend some time touring the Northwest.  I didn't really oppose the idea since it initially sounded like she would visit (and bring my kid brother) for a week or so and then be on their way through the northwest.

fast forward a few months to mid june.  I am told by my mom that she will be coming up and staying for 5 weeks.  5 WEEKS!!  I figured it wouldn't be all bad so I didn't say anything.  

One week after she got here I've realized I can't talk to her about a lot of topics without sucking it up and agreeing (disagreeing internally).  These are things such as gay marriage, contraception, human rights, religious rights, almost all politics, drugs and plenty of other stuff.  There are things I can talk with her about other than these but they get exhausted quickly and there are many gateway topics that lead to these ones as a result of her religious driving force.

I feel like its starting to build up on me all of this sucking up since now I'm getting irritated much easier than I used to.  I feel like this whole thing has gotten forced on me, I never really invited her to visit me let alone for 5 weeks.  Plus she brought the kid brother who is 4, he's been brought up like a brat and throws tantrums many times when he doesn't get his way.  

I do like my family but damn, I can only put up with so much brainwashing talk.  

TL;DR:  My catholic mom decided to visit me and I need someone/people to talk to and vent.

edit: if you think i'd be better posting this in a different subreddit let me know.

fast forward a few months to mid june.  I am told by my mom that she will be coming up and staying for 5 weeks.  5 WEEKS!!  I figured it wouldn't be all bad so I didn't say anything.  

One week after she got here I've realized I can't talk to her about a lot of topics without sucking it up and agreeing (disagreeing internally).  These are things such as gay marriage, contraception, human rights, religious rights, almost all politics, drugs and plenty of other stuff.  There are things I can talk with her about other than these but they get exhausted quickly and there are many gateway topics that lead to these ones as a result of her religious driving force.

I feel like its starting to build up on me all of this sucking up since now I'm getting irritated much easier than I used to.  I feel like this whole thing has gotten forced on me, I never really invited her to visit me let alone for 5 weeks.  Plus she brought the kid brother who is 4, he's been brought up like a brat and throws tantrums many times when he doesn't get his way.  

I do like my family but damn, I can only put up with so much brainwashing talk.  

TL;DR:  My catholic mom decided to visit me and I need someone/people to talk to and vent.

edit: if you think i'd be better posting this in a different subreddit let me know.

edit: if you read my post from a few months ago you'll know the whole story of why I don't want to get into it with my family about me not being catholic.  For now thats really not an option, I've decided the best thing to do is try and distance myself from the family without cutting ties.  I do value family relationship and I don't want to end up like my uncle who has rejected the rest of the family and vice versa."

I apologize about the length of this but I could use some perspective on this situation.

I moved to another state for a summer internship about a month ago. As soon as I turned my car off a pretty big kitten ran out of the bushes and started lingering outside the house. She had no tags and looked pretty healthy. We asked the neighbor and he said that he had been feeding her for the past couple of days but that he thought she was a stray. She started sleeping and hanging out on our front porch and after a couple of days we started feeding and watering her. From then on she was always around.  After a week or so a real nasty storm blew up and she was gone. A week or so later, I was picking blackberries at the end of the street and the cat ran out of the woods and started rubbing on me. Someone had put a shitty flea collar on her that was about 2x too big (four+ inches of excess were hanging off her neck and she couldn't drink water without the collar dipping into it.) I picked her up to carry her back to show my friends that she was alive. I gave her some food and she would not stop eating... she ate around a human-sized portion of roast (I assume it isn't the best for cats but it's the only meat we had). I trimmed her collar afterwards and put her back outside. She's been around ever since. She lives on either the front or back porch and runs inside if we open the door. She spends about 12 hours outside a day but always comes back to our house to come inside. I eventually bought her a litter box so she wouldn't shit and piss on my bed and a scratching post so she would leave the furniture alone. I also bought her some cat food figuring that if she was going to be hanging out with us she had better stop eating fancy meat that was cooked for humans. She has been living like this for the past 2 weeks or so. 

I'm curious as to what you guys think I should do. I want to adopt her and take her with me when I leave, but I don't want to steal someone else's cat. She's young, so she likes wandering around, but if she isn't on the porch when I go out she will run up when I whistle. She isn't fixed, even though I think she is old enough to get pregnant. It doesn't look to me like anyone else is really taking care of her so I want to get her put on meds, fixed, and get her a proper collar and tags.

Thanks for the input."
vwmlp,1,2012-07-01,[Seeking] Stanford Graduate Seeking Help Landing A Job! Save Me!,ineedadrinkplz,mentors,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentors/comments/vwmlp/seeking_stanford_graduate_seeking_help_landing_a/,"I graduated from Stanford a couple of years ago with a social science degree. After taking time off to help my disabled parents, deal with personal matters, and spend several months traveling the world I am eager to finally enter the workforce. Living at home is no longer my cup of tea, and my partner and I would love to be able to really get on our own feet. The situation at both of our homes right now happens to be especially toxic, so getting out asap would be nice! 

My goal is to do work that is socially responsible (humanitarian, non-profit related, etc) but I have absolutely no funds at this point so I would be open to any work that isn't against my morals and can support a decent living. I am open to relocating just about anywhere, as long as it is fairly safe and the job pays enough for me to support myself and possibly my partner.

More on my background: Most of my work up to this point has been  in the non-profit sector. I have worked with children, abuse survivors, city government and academic institutions. I also have a lot of research experience and particularly enjoy using those skills to support humanitarian efforts. Journalism is definitely something I would love to get involved with, but it seems unpaid internships are a necessity and I simply can't afford to do that at this point in time. It's a long shot, but I do really love acting (I have some solid experience) and any chance of getting involved in theatre or tv/film would be amazing!

My volunteer experience is mostly within the realm of feminism, but I have also done a fair amount of organizing and event planning. I have accepted editing and writing gigs in the past, and I am open to accepting that type of work again. 

I am not sure where to start and I am afraid that I am lacking marketable skills and a solid resume. I haven't been in the game since graduating, so I am not sure how to market myself or how the gap will affect my chances of landing a job. I am also contemplating going to law school or obtaining a higher degree in the next few years but for now I would like to work before making that decision. For these reasons, I seek mentorship from someone who can help me figure out how to get on my feet. I am not sure what I can offer you in return, but I am absolutely open to figuring something out!

If you are open, we can communicate more about my goals and interests or whatever information would help you and go from there. This is all very new to me, so we would be starting pretty fresh, if you are open to the challenge! Thank you!

PM me if you think you can help!"

So this is my first post. I don't really even know where to begin. I just know I've read countless threads like these, and I see a lot of people get genuine help from them. So here it goes... (sorry if it's boring/long/stupid)

I'm a 23 year old d00d who recently graduated from college and am currently working a steady job doing stuff (not important what.) I met my girlfriend through an infamous dating website, but we realized we had a lot of mutual friends and went to a lot of the same things, just never having met or bumped into each other at those times, so we usually don't tell people that, as it is believable that we would have met in our own time. She is a 19 year old current college student. Our first date we went to a metal show at a DIY spot. Everything turned up Milhouse, and she spent the night at my place. I took her to work the next morning, because I was actually feeling ""it."" She is super cute, has a great sense of humor and is a blast to be around. I fell pretty quickly for her, and pursued things hard.

A sort of a side, it should be mentioned, that up until this time, I was on a 2 year period of not dating anyone, mostly by choice. I had a slew on continuous relationships that I jumped into too eagerly and ended up regretting it, and hurting the other party. However, this was as a direct result of being in a extremely emotionally abusive relationship for 2 years through high school. I felt pretty insecure for years following, and jumped at the chance to be in a relationship with pretty much anyone that would return the interest. After breaking enough hearts, and having mine broken a few times as well, I decided I just need some time to figure out what I wanted and what I needed. 

Anyways, Fast forward a month after we meet, and things are official. This is surprisingly long for me, considering I would usually jump into relationships within a week or so of dating someone for the most part. This took an incredible amount of patience on my part. However, she was expecting to score an internship over the summer, and didn't. She had to move back home as opposed to staying in the city we live in. However, she only lives an hour away, and we tell ourselves we'll make it work. And it has been, or it was. She was making it down about once a week for the first month, and I only saw her twice really in the second month. 

See, when we met, I had just moved to this city. I had already hooked up with a few girls around the area, and felt that maybe I was ready to just go the distance with someone. She was really the first person I felt like I could have a relationship with after the thought occurred. While we text everyday and occasionally will call or skype each other, I pretty much fill up the rest of my free time here with my hobbies (playing music, in a somewhat serious fashion, hanging out with my new and old friends) and work, which takes up way more than just full time hours. I barely have time for myself with her not even in the same town as me. 

And here's the kicker, it feels as if things have just sizzled and my feelings aren't going anywhere. I'm still attracted to her and I enjoy the time we spend together, but as time goes on, I can tell she is falling deeply for me, and I'm just...indifferent. I care for her, and all of this has absolutely nothing to do with her. She's great. And that makes me feel worse. I feel like I should keep trying because I had not felt this way about a girl in a very long time and I was so sure going into this that it would be for a long time. But now, 2 months into it, and I feel exactly as I did the last time I was in a relationship at this period; ready to bail and disinterested. 

I don't know what to do reddit. I don't want to hurt this girl because she's awesome and doesn't deserve that. But she doesn't deserve some dude stringing her along waiting for his feelings to catch up. I also don't want to regret this decision only to find out that this was some sort of mental/emotional episode that ends up passing and I truly did have real feelings for her. 

This make's me feel like complete shit. I'm a super nice guy other than the turmoil and distress relationships cause me. Maybe I'm doomed to be single forever. And maybe that's what I deserve for getting myself into situations like this. 

She's moving back to the city in the beginning of september to start school again. She'll have her own place and her own friends again, but at home, where she currently is, she has no friends, a shitty family, and a shitty 40+ hour/week job at a pizza place. I'm her only haven this entire summer. If I'm going to break up with her, how should I do it? If she comes into town, it's to spend the night with me. Breaking up over the phone or through text isn't an option, but I don't want to break things off when she has no where else to go for the evening. 

Sorry for the wall of needlessly boring text. Just need some help sorting this out. 

TL;DR Moved to a new city. found a girl I liked, after not having dated anyone for a few years, mostly by choice. She moved away for the summer, rarely see each other. 2 months in, and I'm disinterested, but not because of anything she did, or because of her at all. HAve literally zero clue as to how I should handle this. "
vwei8,12,2012-07-01,What's the state of the analysis and generation of sheet music?,Tiomaidh,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/vwei8/whats_the_state_of_the_analysis_and_generation_of/,"## Background
I'm a CS undergrad particularly interested in AI, and have gotten my feet wet with ML through internships, Stanford's online AI course, and a job I have at a startup doing simple text mining and less-simple searching (and I'm also learning through osmosis as the software company I have a summer job at just got acquired by IBM's Big Data division). I'm also incredibly interested in 18th-century Scottish fiddle music, and my chief hobby for the past six years has been playing, composing, and otherwise studying it.

I've noticed that there's a lot of patterns in the tunes. The vast majority are 32 bars (measures), there's a handful of patterns that make ~5 unique bars get repeated in such a way as to fill the 32 (one common idiom is playing ABAC ABAC DEDC DEDC twice, where each letter represents a bar). And when playing a tune I've never seen or heard before, I sometimes have correct intuitions about what new content will come next--there's a lot of melodic and chordal patterns whose precise nature I can't quite articulate.

## Project
So as any sensible person would do when faced with vague theories and good data sources, I want to package up several thousand tunes in [ABC notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_notation), cause my computer to do incantations over them, look at the patterns my program finds out of pure musicological interest, and then use them to generate new tunes.

*Now it's time for the question*: do you know of any previously done work on something similar? I've spent a good amount of time trying to find things, but can only find audio-based projects. I'm not interested in analyzing the genre of an MP3 or contrasting the performance style of two artists. Nor am I interested in smashing together several loops of electronic sound and calling it music. This is a strictly sheet music-based project.

## Practical Details
From a logistics standpoint, I'd have a little bit of time this upcoming academic year to work on it (on the side), and if I wanted to I could have about twelve 20-40 hour weeks in the summer of 2013. In the summer and fall of 2013 I plan to be in Edinburgh studying ethnomusicology (yay, domain knowledge). I'm also thinking of applying to the [Singularity Institute](http://singularity.org/) and spending a week or two there in the beginning of the summer--if anyone has any thoughts on that I'd be interested in hearing them.

By asking about prior work I'm hoping someone will link me to a journal article where I'll learn what algorithms other people have used and how (un)successful that was--which would give me a place to start. If that doesn't work out:

## Current Strategy
First I'll create a hierarchy of things I'm interested in. One group might be broadly responsible for the overall structure of a tune, and I'll have one node recording data on length, another node recording data on which patterns of repeated bars are used, etc. Another top-level group might be broadly responsible for figuring out what type of note comes after what, with nodes that keep track of intervals (be it a minor third or a fifth or whatever), chord patterns, relative position in the bar, relative position in the tune, relationship to the key signature, etc. And so on and so forth. This obviously requires a lot of thought, and I'd like to try as much as possible to make things specific enough to be easily findable in the corpus, but abstract enough to be useful in a broader context. Then I'll run the corpus through them to get the actual data, inspect the results, probably iterate on that a few times as I realize what type of information is more valuable than others, and then feed it all to a glorified Markov chain generator for the composition aspect.

-----

I've done my best not to make an imposing wall of text, but...I wanted to make sure you had all the information you might want. The main question is about previous efforts, but anything else you'd like to add to the discussion is very welcome. Does this seem like a reasonable project? Any words of warning? I'm aware that even if everything goes perfectly according to plan and I have an automatic traditional tune spitter-outer the usefulness is questionable (not much of a market to monetize it with, and it seems a bit out there to go the academic route with)...it's purely for personal interest, pragmatism be darned.

Thanks!

I think I might have a case to make that I’m smart enough to learn on the job (2370 SAT, high school valedictorian, started college a year early, 4.0 GPA so far in college), but is that enough—or will people laugh at the fact that I’m bragging about my high school grades and then make the offer to the rising senior?

I had just run a school-year length campaign for them, and we are all pretty big DnD geeks (and geeks in general). 

They had decided that they were going to ask me to run a one-shot, spontaneous DnD session that night. I thought it sounded like a lot of fun, so went for it. I had about 30 minutes of planning as I ran home and grabbed my dice and laptop. I started the players at lvl 10, ignoring skill points for sake of time.

We wound up with the following setting:
- The eldest son (PC; elf sorc, the leader) of the recently deceased Don of the city's mafia has returned from his world travels, with his new friend/bodyguard (PC; minotaur monk, the tank). Meeting up with his cousin (PC; dwarf fighter I think, the dumb one) and the family's operations leader (PC; human wizard, the brains), he went to his father's funeral and tried to decide what to do with his life.
- The session basically followed the story of this criminal family as Brother #2 tried to take over, forging a fake will to make himself the new Don. Brother #3 was basically #2's lackey while #4 was the one successfully running the family's legitimate businesses. In the course of the game, they found the actaul will, which said that PC son should be the new Don, else #4 if PC refuses, they found out that #3 was brokering deals with the other crime families, allowing them to move in on the family's turf, and that #4 was dating the daughter of the Don of the rival family (these last 2 they never fully figured out, but started learning). They wound up killlng #3 and the rival crime lords, finding the real will, killing brother #2, and PC son stepped down and let #4 run the family while the PC's went off on more world adventures. 

This campaign was one of the most fun I'd ever ran or participated in. The unplanned nature of it really forced all of us to roleplay and storytell to the best of our abilities, in order to flesh out the world and make it more interested. The players finished the main plot, but there were loads of other plot hooks that were presented, but not fleshed out, leaving it very open for a return campaign.

So tell me fellow redditors and Dnd nerds - have any of you ever run a spontaneous, unplanned session like this? If so, what were your experiences with it?"

As a Northern California native recently displaced to the District, I've been looking forward to this series since the schedules were announced.

I have tickets to Thursday's game, am unable to attend tomorrow, but am having trouble tracking down (reasonably priced) seats for tonight. So I come to you in a last minute plea. My girlfriend (another Bay Area expat) and I are desperate to see Timmy try to get his shit together against Harper and the rest of the Nats. So...if you or your friend or mother or your coworker or dog have an extra pair you wouldn't mind parting with, PLEASE let me know. I'm definitely a poor, debt-saddled intern, but am willing to splurge at least a little bit for good seats considering it's been a while and the only time I'm likely to see my team this year.

I've always wanted to learn to program, and have been involved with computers since I was ~7 (Now, 20).  I roughly taught myself VB/Java when I was around 14/15 and was involved in making some programs in a tight knit community online.  Loved it.  Fast forward to where I am now - the last 3 yrs of my college career I've been focused on Investment Banking, and breaking into the industry.  As it stands, I've gotten internships done so far at a few investment banks and a one bulge bracket (think JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, BAML) doing PWM.  I'm pretty well set up for a career in the industry, and know I will have no problem getting interviews for that type of job.  However, I'm a transfer student and got all these opportunities on my own at a local school getting an Associates in Math.

I've been accepted to 2 schools as a transfer student for the fall - an Ivy league school majoring in Finance, and Georgetown, where I could undertake a BS in Math, or, if I can handle the senior year courseload of ALL CS courses (I haven't even taken Intro), I can get a BS in CS.  The problem that I feel, however, is that GTown is not a big CS school, and as such, I won't really be considered for top jobs in the CS industry and will most likely be looking at IT...  Also, I'm going to be a junior and I fear if I start from scratch now with CS, I won't land a notable internship next summer as I won't have the skills necessary down pat by then, whereas if I went Ivy, I could realistically expect to get a Summer Analyst position at Goldman Sachs (not far out of my reach...).  

What is your take on it?  What should I do?  I enjoy finance, and am heavily considering just accepted the ivy, but CS has been a love of mine since I was young and it would be a shame if I gave it all up for something I might not want to do wit hthe rest of my life (Investment banking wears you out...).

Any ideas?  Thanks!"

",squireofrnew,writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/vyrxr/critiquefictionbeginnerbeginning_of_a_possible/,"**Author Statement**

Hey! I'm a novice writer, and I've always wanted to put a full length novel together. I have written several short stories and a full length play that made absolutely NO sense (Har har...). I have no publishing history, and I have a B.A. in communications.  

I have a confession to make... For the past couple of years, I have been addicted to theatre. I have worn the hat of the actor, director, playwright, stage manager, every back stage crew position possible, set designer, make-up artist (probably my weakest point), technical director, master carpenter, and who knows what else. I was a glutton, and I now want to feast on the art of building worlds and ideas. 

I am not as well read as I would like to be, but I am improving that! I live and breathe George R.R. Martin, Hunter S. Thompson, and Michael Crichton. Reading has been my muse for the past couple of months, and I hope to fill my void with some good stuff. I recently finished an internship at a local theatre, and I am now searching for a job.

**Intentions for the Work**

Please give me a general impression of the story. Do you care about the characters? Do you want to find out more? Does it seem like the story can sustain itself for an extended period of time? How is the rhythm? How is the word choice? Is there a moment that you do not buy? Those are the kind of questions I would like answered.

I would like to publish the work if it is capable, but that isn't important right now. I just want to find my voice and characterization at this moment, but either than that, any and all feedback will be taken graciously. I submitted this piece earlier tonight and fudged the guidelines, so here I am again! Thank you so much everyone, and I hope you enjoy the introduction to...

**Charlietown**


There's a huge crane off in the distance. A hundred and fifty feet of steel extends from its yellow base. Puffs of black putrid smoke billow from a lone nostril as it struggles to lift a container of goods from a small barge. This place gets so hot in the summer... Even the U.S.S. Yorktown agrees with me. I can feel her gears aching to turn. Her poor old bones wishing she could propel herself out into open sea and away from her watery tomb.

I wonder if she wants to go back to the fight. If she would mix well with the U.S.S Ronald Reagan. Probably not. The men who built the ship had substance. It'd be like oil and water for sure. She'd probably sail to Jamaica, or Costa Rica. Fire a spliff. Let the worries of this cruel year melt away so she can rust in peace. Rust isn't so bad, you know?

The woman overlooking the bay has the right idea. Find some shade. Bring a book. Let the world sail away and enter a new one. It's that simple, and not everything's that simple. Standing on top of a rail lining a dock wearing stilettos like that model over there isn't that simple, but people do love their photo ops. People love their memories. More importantly, people love pretty women. Even pretty women love pretty women.

I wonder what would happen if she were to fall. Teeter to one side, she might bruise a wrist. Sprain something perhaps. Teeter the other way, she might lose some dignity. Her dress. Her life. Maybe a nail as well. I guess that's the gamble. Pain on one side, humor with a chance of death on the other. It's a balancing act. Either or.

Out across the bay, there's a little rinky dink fort hovering above the water. It's probably far away is all, but it looks silly. I see no flag heralding its allegiance. You'd figure there'd be something. Stars and stripes. Palmetto and Crescent moon. Red Rebel. Something. Maybe some poor fool stole the thing, and now it's his new shade tent. Who knows... Maybe my eyes just can't see that far.

Or maybe the war started somewhere else. Off in some back alley basement somewhere, with coffee and crackers with little bits of cheese.

I would very much like to visit that house if it ever existed. To smell what those poor souls smelled before they made that pact. It probably smelled like fear.

The crane is now suspending a lone pole in the middle of the sky. The men guiding it to its final resting place look like children about to climb a tree. A tree with no arms or leaves, twists or turns, but a tree nevertheless.

The woman reading the book sits down on the opposite side of my bench. I fumble internally.

""What're you writing?"" she asks.

I chuckle nervously.

""This? Just a little exercise. I like to come here and empty my brain for a bit. No structure. Just... purging I guess.""

I flourish a smile, and look in her eyes. She has pretty eyes. I turn away and gaze upon the Yorktown.

""Can I read it?""

""Um... Yeah. Sure""

I hand her the black composition book speckled with white dots. She begins perusing the penmanship of a four year old. Chicken scratch and squiggly lines.

""I can't really read this.""

""That's because it's in code.""

She laughs at that one.

""You want to go for a walk?""

""Um...""

I look from left to right, almost as if we were making a transaction of illicit substances.

""You don't have to. I'm just moving down to the next park. Better view over there.""

""Maybe I'll catch up with you.""

""Yeah. Maybe.""

""Yeah.""

""Well. See ya. Good luck with the purging.""

""Yeah. You too.""

Up she goes, out of my life."
w1v9b,5,2012-07-04,How do I get my brother to stop giving me so much shit?,ohbrotherthrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/w1v9b/how_do_i_get_my_brother_to_stop_giving_me_so_much/,"I'm (22) exasperated out of my wits with this one.

I'll try to be as fair and objective as I can be about the conflict.

My brother (25) has been busting his ass for the last 5 years in Law school. He's been getting top marks, and got this great internship at a top firm which if he performs well in he'll get a graduate job offer.

I recently deferred my course to start my own business.

Because I'm working for myself, I keep my own hours. I've become fairly nocturnal. I like a certain sport which is played mostly in another timezone at really inconvenient times like 3 AM to 7 AM. As a result, I work a lot during the early hours of night, watch my favourite sport, keep working till 10 AM and fall asleep, rinse and repeat. I see nothing wrong with this, I have an alternate type of sleeping pattern.

My brother is an extremely light sleeper and apparently I wake him up. For my part, I really try hard to tiptoe around when he's sleeping. I close my bedroom door, I keep any volumes at a sound that cannot penetrate my wall (let alone his), and I will only get up to use bathroom and get food/drink when absolutely necessary, always trying to tiptoe as much as possible.

Inevitably, however, some sound will wake him up and he'll blame it on me. And that's when it starts. He gets into these borderline-psychotic moods. He becomes violent and starts screaming and yelling at me. That I'm waking him up and that he needs to sleep or he won't be able to concentrate at his internship.

It was almost fair enough for the first few times he did this. I -was- probably waking him up. So that's when I started to make as many considerations as I could, as I listed above. I'm trying as hard as I can to accommodate him. But I feel like he's being absurdly draconian. And while I'm really trying to be respectful of his lifestyle, I don't think that means I should give up the one that I enjoy. 

But he is still waking up. And now he's started yelling the most disgusting things like my life is shit and everyone hates me and that I'm going to fail and have a shit life and I'll deserve it.

All because I'm ""waking him up"". Stuff like ""Why can't you sleep at normal hours?""

He claims that his internship is more important than my ""failure of a business"", and so I should change to conform to him.

The problem is, he's my brother, and I just don't know how to reconcile it. I have so many conflicting emotions. I want to hate him, and at the time I'll get just as angry as he is and try to give as much back to him as I can. Sometimes I'll just yell out ""whatever you say, it's all true, now please stop screaming"".

But it's all so disturbing. Stuff like ""It doesn't matter how much you try to tiptoe you're such a fat fuck you'll always make a noise walking up and down stairs.""

Where does that sort of vitriol come from? I don't even know how to respond.

The fuck do I do? Should I really just conform to his sleeping pattern? I want to move out, I really do. And that should be feasible in about half a year, but starting a business is hard.

My parents are currently overseas and will be for another month or so. I refuse to bring them into this. They've worked too hard and too long to be troubled by this shit on their vacation. I wish my brother held the same view.

More insults he flings:

- My friends are all freaks
- My girlfriend is only with me because I'm the bottom of the barrel and so is she

**tl;dr: My brother is making me try to change my lifestyle to suit his. What I really want is advice on how to get him to just shut up. Any silver bullet ideas?**

w1rfd,2,2012-07-04,Is it okay to mention clients in my resume?,plaintastic,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/w1rfd/is_it_okay_to_mention_clients_in_my_resume/,"I am updating my resume, to apply to some internships and I would like to know if it's okay to mention what types of clients I worked with for my design work. These are typically partners from much larger tech companies.

I plan on asking my supervisor to ask if the clients privacy is compromised by mentioning them in my resume, but another concern is the weight that these companies may carry. 

As an example, would this:

""Repurposed a case study from a Word document to an InDesign Template""

have a lot less weight than:

""Repurposed a case study from a Word document to an InDesign Template for Apple Inc."""
w1oy1,2,2012-07-04,"Wanna lower my body fat, read the FAQ, want to know if this plan will work? ",bustyLaserCannon,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/w1oy1/wanna_lower_my_body_fat_read_the_faq_want_to_know/,"I started my first desk job as an Intern in a company this week, it's been great but it's cut into my summer where I was planning to get into good shape (University student).

I don't really need to at all, but i'd like to get ripped. 
So I weigh 136lbs, 5""10, and i'm nearly 20. 

If I had to guess my body fat, it'd be around 16-18% based on the FAQ, haven't got the calipers to check. I'm not very muscley, but if I flex all over and suck in my stomach a bit, ab bulges are visible, and I get a nice bicep/delt definition which I like. 

I guess my goal would be visible abs without flexing and to just look a bit stronger all over. So i'm guessing that'd be around 10-12% body fat?

Here's what I did today, woke up, turned on my pedometer, had a cup of green coffee (in a rush not to be late), had a turkey 6-inch sub from Subway (healthiest thing I could find without preparing), bought a seed/nut/dried fruit bag to eat at my desk through out the days, went home, grilled some chicken breasts with a side of peas, drank only water throughout the day and I did some back exercises with some dumb bells at home.

Pedometer said I walked 4800 steps which I worked out to be roughly 290 calories at my size. According to my BMR, I need 1600, I calculated that I ate around 1200 today, and with the 290-, makes it around 910 calories.. 

At this rate, combined with some upper body work at the gym on the weekends, will I see the desired body fat over time? And if it isn't too much to ask.. how long would it take if I kept this up?

Side question: Is the seed/nut/dried fruit thing a good idea? Or am I adding unnecessary calories? I figured it'd raise my metabolism throughout the day without a huge calorie intake.."
w1khx,1,2012-07-04,Question about Ion-Mobility Spectrometry from a Legal Intern Who Knows Very Little About Chemistry/Spectrometry.,[deleted],chemistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/w1khx/question_about_ionmobility_spectrometry_from_a/,"I am doing an internship in civil forfeiture law this summer and have questions regarding IMS. Part of the evidence that is often used to get money we seize forfeited is proof that the banknotes have more cocaine on them than the normal ""casual contact"" level of the area from where the money is found. We use [something like this](http://www.smithsdetection.com/IONSCAN_400B.php) to scan the money confiscated and then have money from a bank scanned to determine the casual contact level. We then compare those levels to determine if there is more of the illicit substance on the seized cash than the quantity from the bank. 

From what I have read, it is difficult to obtain precise quantitative results through IMS. Is this true? If so, can you explain to someone who has little understanding in chemistry why/what implications this has? Also, does this mean that it is meaningless to compare levels of illicit substances from different samples?"
w1kaz,1,2012-07-04,Distributed Databases implementation project,[deleted],bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/w1kaz/distributed_databases_implementation_project/,"Hey guys,

I'm a senior Computer Science student currently working on internship at a large sequencing/genomics cancer research facility. I'm also doing a directed study with a professor at my University. 

The directed study is broadly termed 'Distributed Databases' but I've generally been looking into NoSQL technologies - with an emphasis on biological/medical data.

I need to do an implementation project for the course some-how related to distributed databases, this can mean implementation of a database or use of (data mining) a database. 

One idea I had was looking into [bio4j](http://www.bio4j.com/) to see if there are any cool visualizations or something neat I can *mine* for. 

I don't have a lot of biological background so I was wondering if anyone here might have some ideas that I could look into either for using bio4j or something else related. I'd like to attack this more on the computational end of things.

If some one has I particular project that may be of use to them I'd be happy to work on something like that too. 
Or if there is a student of biology/bioinformatics that is lacking in computational skills but has some ideas I'd possibly be happy to collaborate. 

Cheers, "

(x-post from r/dating_advice)",[deleted],AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/w15eu/confusing_relationship_with_a_coworker_can_any/,"**WARNING: LONG POST, but I think it's mostly relevant.*

*Background:* I'm F21, he's M22. We're both engineers and are interns for a large, well-known company for the summer and are going back to school for our final year of undergrad in the fall. We are both single and have been for a while, as far as I know. He's mentioned ex-girlfriends before in passing, so I know he's not gay.

So - there's this guy (we'll call him M), and we've been hanging out all the time this summer. We met a few weeks ago at a 5k mud run, and since then have hung out every single weekend except one where he claimed he slept the entire time and didn't do much.

When we first met, I actually barely remembered him, since he wasn't super talkative right off the bat. A few days after the 5k I remember he sat down next to me at lunch while I was talking to a mutual friend, and I thought it was weird how much this guy kept looking at me, but at that point I only vaguely recognized him from the 5k and didn't actually know his name. Then, the weekend of that interaction, we pulled an all-nighter together (with 2 other friends - 1 male and 1 female; the female has a serious boyfriend) camping out for a sale. 

After that, M started going out of his way to say hi to me, i.e. tapping me on the back, saying hey and making small talk if I wasn't even facing or paying attention to him, etc. I liked him as a friend so I didn't think much of it and was happy to engage.

One other thing I have noticed are that his feet are almost always pointed towards me when we're around each other, which according to every women's magazine is a tell-tale sign of attraction (though I'm not sure how much I can trust that).

Then this past weekend is when things started to get weird. A bunch of people from work organized a trip to a nearby city to visit a theme park, and we both signed up to go. The first night there, M forgot his ID, so he, I, and two other people went out and explored the city instead of going to a bar with the rest of our group. At first, he and I just talked as we were walking, and asked about each other's childhoods and the cities we each were from. Later we ended up jumping into a public fountain with our clothes on (might have been illegal, but anyway, not the main point of this story). I had a waterproof camera on me, so we were taking some pictures in the fountain. At one point, he yelled at me to come under a waterfall with him and take a self-picture. So...I duck under the waterfall, and for a second we're both just sitting there wet and half-naked, and we're staring into each other's eyes for like 5-10 seconds (it felt like forever, but that's probably my best estimate). I seriously thought we were going to kiss or something, but when nothing happened I just turned around and took the picture. After that, I think I started to realize I was into him, so I began paying more attention to things and making more of a conscious effort to hang out with him.

Then the next morning, when we were checking out of our hotel, I called him to see where his room was in the process. My room was probably the first to finish with everything, so we were just sitting around hanging out for a while. When I called M, he asked if he could come over to hang out with us, so I said yes and he did. (I'm not sure how significant that is other than that he seemed to be very interested in hanging out with me a lot, but I figured I'd include it.)

Then, we went to the theme park, and my car somehow got separated from the rest of the group for the whole day (we went in the wrong entrance or something). At the end of the day when we finally met up, it was because I called another guy (S) in his group and spoke to him really briefly before M grabbed his phone and started talking to me. (Note: just minutes before, a guy in my group had called S, and that time M hadn't done a thing...though that may have just been chance.) When we finally found each other, he jumped off the bench he was sitting on, held out his arms for a hug, and we literally ran at each other like we hadn't seen each other in years. We talked for a few minutes about how we wished we'd gotten to hang out, and then the group went to dinner.

At dinner, I might have been imagining things, but it seemed like he made a conscious effort to sit across from me. Throughout the meal, we kept catching each other's eyes randomly, and when we did, he'd either laugh softly and look away, or we'd wink and make funny faces at each other. We'd also agreed that the group of 4 people that had gone to the sale 2 weekends ago would take a class that was offered as a livingsocial deal, but since out of the two weekends it was offered, I couldn't make one, and the other girl couldn't make the other, we decided to go in groups of 2. As soon as I mentioned this, M quickly mentioned that he was ""free the 21st if [I wanted] to go."" (That was the weekend I could make.)

On Monday at work, he waved at me from across the cafeteria at lunch (we work in different divisions, so lunch is usually the only time we see each other), but I wasn't feeling very well (food poisoning from something I ate on Sunday or something I think) so I left pretty quickly after sitting on the opposite end of the long table he was at (think 20+ people). I could be imagining things, but I could swear I saw him steal multiple glances down the table while I was sitting there. Before leaving, I went to let the guy sitting directly to M's right know that I wasn't feeling well and was going to go get some antacid if anyone asked where I was (that guy works directly next to me in my office). When I came over, M said hey to me enthusiastically, and when I mentioned I wasn't feeling well, asked what my symptoms were, talked briefly about the class we were going to take on the 21st (I'd emailed him a confirmation that morning) and then said he hoped I felt better just before I walked away.

Then on Tuesday, I texted him in the morning (around 7 am) to see if he wanted to go rock climbing in the afternoon since we didn't have work on Wednesday for the 4th of July, and a group of people had already asked me if I wanted to go. A few hours later (around 10:30, which I later learned was shortly after he'd woken up, since he works different hours than I do), he called me to talk about something totally irrelevant (visiting my building on Thursday with his family, since without giving too much away we'll just say that my branch works on some cool stuff), then casually asked about rock climbing and mentioned he could probably come.

At lunch, we ran into each other again, and I sat down after he'd put his stuff down at the long table but had gone to the bathroom. When he came back, he saw that I'd put my stuff down one seat away from his, so he moved over next to me (causing the guy to his left to feign offense, since he left an empty seat between them by doing so). I mentioned something about how I needed to get in touch with my ride for rock climbing later, and he said he'd be happy to give me one instead...so we decided to do that.

In the afternoon when he picked me up from my building to give me a ride to rock climbing, we talked a bit in the car, mainly about our days and what we really do every day at our jobs. It actually made me sort of nervous how much he kept making eye contact with me when we talked (since he wasn't looking at the road enough while it was happening). When we were almost to the rock gym, he mentioned that he needed to stop at home to change and get all his gear, so he asked if I wanted to come in with him. I said I was fine with that, so I went into his living room and sat down (after being ambushed by his two dogs, who according to him really liked me). Before going to change, he picked up a book from the coffee table about rock climbing (which is sort of his life - on the car ride there, he mentioned that he actually hates climbing in gyms because climbing on real rocks is so much better) and told me to read it while I waited because it was his favorite book and he thought I'd like it. When he emerged from his room, he brought a huge collection of rock climbing hooks with him (and I mean huge - that thing must have been like 100+ pounds) and showed me what all of them did, even though I'd never really asked. He then offered me some ice cream before we left, so we ate and headed over to the gym.

At the rock gym, we met up with some other co-workers who mentioned they were planning to hang out later tonight at the complex I live at. I asked if M wanted to come, and he said that he would after taking a short nap after climbing.

Later that night, I met up with the rest of the group at my apartment complex, and got a text from M saying that his alarm hadn't gone off but that he'd get going soon. About an hour later, he was there, but the rest of the group was leaving to go to a movie that neither of us had any particular interest in, so we just hung out by the pool and hot tub for a while, had a few beers and talked.

Where this whole thing gets confusing to me is that I feel last night should have been the perfect opportunity for him to make a move, but he didn't. I gave him multiple opportunities to (i.e. sitting really close next to him in the hot tub and even on his lap briefly in a pool chair, though I had to move after a minute when they closed the pool at midnight). At the end of the night, we ended up in my room watching How I Met Your Mother on my bed, where I blatantly cuddled up against his shoulder, but still nothing. At 2am, he decided he'd sobered up enough to drive home, so he left, and said that he'd see me Thursday since he was probably spending the 4th of July with his family. We hugged goodbye, and that was it. (He asked if I needed a ride to get some food, since I'd mentioned I hadn't eaten that much that day and was pretty drunk as a result, but I declined.)

I'm not entirely sure what the point of this post was, but I suppose I'm worried I may have made things awkward last night if he has no interest in me. Opinions?

**tl;dr:** Guy acts like he really likes me, but doesn't make a move when we're alone. What's up with that?"

About an hour later, he was there, but the rest of the group was leaving to go to a movie that neither of us had any particular interest in, so we just hung out by the pool and hot tub for a while, had a few beers and talked.

Where this whole thing gets confusing to me is that I feel last night should have been the perfect opportunity for him to make a move, but he didn't. I gave him multiple opportunities to (i.e. sitting really close next to him in the hot tub and even on his lap briefly in a pool chair, though I had to move after a minute when they closed the pool at midnight). At the end of the night, we ended up in my room watching How I Met Your Mother on my bed, where I blatantly cuddled up against his shoulder, but still nothing. At 2am, he decided he'd sobered up enough to drive home, so he left, and said that he'd see me Thursday since he was probably spending the 4th of July with his family. We hugged goodbye, and that was it. (He asked if I needed a ride to get some food, since I'd mentioned I hadn't eaten that much that day and was pretty drunk as a result, but I declined.)

I'm not entirely sure what the point of this post was, but I suppose I'm worried I may have made things awkward last night if he has no interest in me. Opinions? (Particularly male ones...)

**tl;dr:** Guy acts like he really likes me, but doesn't make a move when we're alone. What's up with that?"

I have really good grades and I've gotten interest from various companies, so I think I will have a pretty good amount of choice over where I end up.

Now don't get me wrong, I will still be basing my job search on practical things. But I would still like to know the answer to this question anyway. I spent college pretty much as a nun to focus on getting good grades.

I would like to know which medium to large-sized companies in the Silicon Valley are best for meeting great single guys in their 20's.

""Great"" for me means that they are smart, friendly, have varied interests, and good social skills. Don't have to be glued to a screen 24/7.

I'm interested in guys who are culturally similar to the average young educated Californian. Don't have to BE American at all, just looking for people whose lifestyle/outlook wouldn't clash. I did an internship in a big company in Campbell where at least half the young guys there were only planning to stay in the US long enough to save money to return to their home country, and marry the local virgin chosen by their family.

Many thanks for reading my question!"

[post medication update]",[deleted],ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/w0h8y/i_know_it_is_not_win_wednesday_for_a_little_over/,"I was recently diagnosed and posted about taking my meds for the very first time. I am on 1-2 10mg tablets of adderall per day and have been for the past few weeks. During my first day on medication I was much more focused and ended up cleaning my room and doing my laundry [detail post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/usc45/is_this_what_being_normal_is_like/)

Since the last post I have started my summer internship and things are going amazingly well. I am exceeding everyone's expectations for what I am able to accomplish, as well as the speed and quality of execution (They were already pleased with my work quality before meds). I have been told that I am awesome by everyone I work with on a daily basis, which is great.

Even more, as of now I have two pending job offers, both with the potential to start before I even get my bachelor's. 

What's even more:

* I go to sleep at a reasonable hour, meaning I get enough sleep.

* I am so much less stressed and actually enjoying myself at work. 
* I am much more able to nap if I need to due to my thoughts not racing as much.
* My ability to articulate my points has improved.
* I even look better. When I am on medication, my sinuses are less clogged, which helps with allergy-related eye puffiness.

The only downsides I can think of are having to drink more water to stay hydrated and, if I forget to ask for decaf in the morning, I feel uncomfortable. I basically feel like everything is buzzing. It is weird because caffeine on it's own makes me tired and adderall on it's own makes me calmer and slightly more subdued. 

TLDR: I feel like I am finally becoming the person I want to be."

So, I know that most of the jobs are located in the San Francisco and New York City areas. Unfortunately, I live in North Carolina. We do have the research triangle but last time I checked they are not very involved in the gaming field. I also know that getting an entry level in the gaming industry is very competitive and the job itself is not what most people think it is, but I am still very interested in getting into the field.

I graduated from UNC Chapel Hill with a BS in Psychology and am currently unemployed. I did work study as an IT in which I helped the faculty and staff with technical problems such as moving data or removing viruses. I only took one introductory course in JAVA but am teaching myself C from Carl Herold's ""Higher computing for everyone"". I know that these will probably not be good enough to appear attractive.

So, I was looking into QA positions or internships from over 30 companies but so far no luck. I was wondering if you guys had any tips or could possibly look at my resume. Anything would be greatly appreciated."

w0e4m,2,2012-07-03,What should I do with my 20g and 55g tanks?,Scyerline,Aquariums,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aquariums/comments/w0e4m/what_should_i_do_with_my_20g_and_55g_tanks/,"So I'm having a bit of an indecision problem and I was hoping reddit could help me out. I am a college student who recently moved into an apartment. Now that I live off campus, I've been able to get back into aquarium keeping. I currently have a 5g (planted with betta), a 10g (planted with betta), a 20g high (heavily planted with 5 male guppies and 7 cardinal tetras), and an empty 55g. I originally bought the 55g with the plan to make it a reef tank, but I've realized that setting something like that up in an apartment that I'll be in 2 years tops would be a terrible idea. Help me choose a back up plan?


Notes:
-Even when I move, I will be staying in the same city, as I already have a pretty good part time internship that has been offered as a full time job when I graduate... so a tank would have to travel &lt;2hrs in my large car.
-I already have a protein skimmer, 2 75g filters (sump isn't going to happen for now),  and two powerheads for the 55g. I do not have lights yet.
-All of my other tanks have been stocked for about 6 months. No medications have ever been used, and there have been no casualties or water quality issues so far.
-I have always wanted a SW tank, but I can wait. I also have always wanted to keep a tiger oscar and a flame angelfish (loved them ever since I was 4 years old). 


Plan A: Make the 55g a FOWLR tank. I feel like a non-reef would be easier to move. 


Plan B: Keep a young tiger oscar in the 55g tank, then move him to the 120g tank in my parents' garage when I have a more permanent residence.


Plan C: Move the fish from the 20g to the 55g and move the betta from the 10g to it (he's pretty docile and has been in a community before). Use the 10g for some dwarf puffers. Convert the 20g into a nano reef. It already has a proper fixture - I'd just need to buy some reef bulbs.


Any other suggestions? Thanks a lot!

w0dnb,15,2012-07-03,Having trouble breaking away from the nest...even though i've already left home!,lagarco,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/w0dnb/having_trouble_breaking_away_from_the_nesteven/,"Hello Relationships,

Some background information: I'm 21f, left home to study at a university 1000km (ish) from home 3 and a half years ago. First year I got really sick, second year I moved in with the ex and got so heartbroken I failed an important part of the year. Third year I moved closer to home (500km away) but was doing a really terrible internship. After the internship (september last year) I came back home because there was nothing left for me in that city. Other than that, I had a fantastic time, met lots of wonderful people and loved making my own rules and being independent.


I have been home ever since, and while it's been nice to not have to pay rent/have any adult responsibilities, I miss my independence. I have been ready to leave home again (am still studying) for 5 months, but here is the problem - I am guilted by my mother to stay home every time I try to leave! I have an SO now, and it is very serious, which also plays into it. Basically all the arguments I have with my mum are her calling me lazy, selfish, stupid, saying I have no idea what i'm doing, that i'm going to waste my life, that i'm taking advantage of them, that I don't care about them, that I'm just going to run off and move in with the SO and start having babies (that was weird), etc, etc. I TRY to have a normal conversation but we are just too hot headed and together we clash a lot.

It has gotten to a point where I just CAN'T take it any more. It's been 5 months of this, and every time I back down because I feel very guilty about wanting to move away. Today I said I was thinking of moving soon and it all happened again. I fell like i'm back in high school and 15 again T_T


Let me just say that my parents are very supportive and only want the best for me, BUT my mum has this idea of how my life should go and i'm obviously not sticking to her plan.


I am like every other 20something year old - some know what they want to do with their life, I still don't. I've yet to finish my degree, but I've discovered that it might not be what I want to do forever. I didn't even want to finish my degree at all, but I got almost 'bullied' to finish it by my parent (I see why they did it, but I still regret sticking to it - the awful internship left me with no work self-esteem and I still can't see any work that I do as a job well done, but that's another story). That, and the fact that i'm very serious with my SO, must be too much for my mum to handle.


I can't keep living my life based on what my mum wants. I'm usually very independent, but we're a big spanish family, so family is very important. Where do I draw the line? How can I talk to her about my limits?
I've tried everything I can think of, short of just getting up and leaving! I've talked to her directly, used my dad as a mediator, tried to find out what it is she's worried about, talked to her about how supportive the SO is. It seems that every time I try to talk (and the only way we 'talk' is by shouting, nothing else gets through) she says 'oh, sorry, i'll back off' but two days later it's back to square one. She genuinely thinks i'm going to throw my life away! Sure, i've made mistakes, but i've learnt from them and not in a hurry to repeat them.


I'm at a loss, any advice/personal stories would be very useful, i've thought about this so much that it just doesn't make sense in my head anymore!


**TL;DR** Having trouble making my own decisions because of the guilt put on me by my mum.

w3o0t,1,2012-07-05,Tips for an entry-Level SEO/PR seeking for a job with expert SEO,DeafLady,SEO,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/w3o0t/tips_for_an_entrylevel_seopr_seeking_for_a_job/,"Hello,

Apparently I ended up babbling away :) please skip to the bold text for TL;DR.

I can't really tell you how I ended up here. It all started when I got involved in internet communities as kid, leading to moderating forums, leading to cultural studies while helping out develop start up online projects and ended up getting internships in internet marketing and SEO.

I have been working as SEO marketer for an e-commerce company for a few months, I was led to believe that I would assist owner as he was an SEO expert but he wasn't really and employed black market tactics. I believe I will lose my first full time job after only a few months due to the fact that I can't keep up with his weekly artificial backlinks quota, nevermind the rest of the things I have done for the website such as blog posts, organizing online events, optimizing website and user interface, etc.

Now my question is, what should I do from here? I have a lot of solo experience because of my hobbies and have been researching, reading up, following updates online. I believe I can do well by myself with basic analysis, optimizing, producing content, etc. 

**However, what I want is to work with fellow SEO experts to learn the ropes of data gathering, data mining, the deep SEO stuff and most importantly, how the information is organized, how the reports are written for the bosses of the companies or clients (if agency)**

**I have been applying to whatever positions I can find, no matter the location, in places like Craigslist and LinkedIn but most of them do not have a fellow SEO, I have been looking for SEO agencies that *would hire entry-level* but would like to know if there are any other ways to find employment with a SEO expert as mentor.**

Thank you very much!"
w3gsn,1,2012-07-05,How to create a table that is sized based on user input in Excel VBA?,TheTreeMan,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/w3gsn/how_to_create_a_table_that_is_sized_based_on_user/,"For the record, I'm using Excel 2010.

I'm trying to teach myself VBA for a job at work (they give the interns the VBA stuff...), and I'm getting stuck on the simplest of things.

I am trying to make a bordered table that is three columns wide. The amount of rows in the table has to be based on the amount of inputs the user has. In my crappy code, that is the value given for ""Count"" by the user.

My issue is that I have no idea how to select the range I need. The only way I know how to select a range is using:

    ActiveCell.Range(""Top left cell:Bottom right cell"").Select

If it were from A1 to C8, how do I make that work? I wish it would just work like:

    ActiveCell.Range(""A1:C(count)"").Select

This is what I have so far:


    Option Explicit

    Dim Count As Long

    Dim CFLArray() As Variant

    Sub TableCreation1()

        Range(""A1"").Select

        ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = ""Time (days)""

        ActiveCell.Offset(0, 1).Range(""A1"").Select

        ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = ""CFL (measured)""

        ActiveCell.Offset(0, 1).Range(""A1"").Select

        ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = ""De (estimated)""

        ActiveCell.Offset(0, -2).Range(""A1:C1"").Select

        Selection.Font.Bold = True

        ActiveCell.Columns(""A:A"").EntireColumn.EntireColumn.AutoFit

        ActiveCell.Columns(""A:A"").EntireColumn.EntireColumn.AutoFit

    
        ActiveCell.Offset(0,1).Columns(""A:A"").EntireColumn.EntireColumn.AutoFit

    
        ActiveCell.Offset(0,2).Columns(""A:A"").EntireColumn.EntireColumn.AutoFit

        ActiveCell.Select

    End Sub



    Sub FindRange()

        Range(""A2"").Select

        Count = InputBox(""How many pairs of data do you have? "")
    
    End Sub

I taught myself VBA a day or so ago using a book my work had, but I couldn't find anything along these lines in there. My internet searches failed as well. The worst part is I know it's going to be incredibly simple.

Also, if my code is awful, it's probably because I have zero programming experience before this, haha. Sorry.

Thanks for your help!"

I have been tossing a few ideas around with friends of programming projects we could embark on, and I especially want to do these so I can have some personal projects to bolster a resume for internships next summer (I would have done them anyway, but perhaps just another prodding reason.)

I guess what I'm asking is if I should name the github repository I use something related to my name or a common internet alias. I feel like using my name would be better, because then the rest of my internet footprint (I don't know of anything negative, but there are certainly political/religious views espoused) separate from an internship application. But I still find myself wanting to use my alias because I'm used to it and I feel like I'd be more a part of the github community if it didn't look like a linkedin profile.

So what would you guys recommend?

w3a2c,0,2012-07-05,I have too much confidence. Its becoming a problem. Need advice.,confidence_galore,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/w3a2c/i_have_too_much_confidence_its_becoming_a_problem/,"Made a throwaway for this because a lot of you will burn me for saying this but here it goes.

 I'm 23, male and i've always had a lot of confidence. Mostly because of the way I was raised. My dad always used to make me walk straight, head high. Our family has ""good genes"" as we always said and I was raised to believe I'm capable of anything.

Other people don't seem to like that. Friends, some of my family, co-workers are all appalled by my confidence. Even my girlfriend tells me to tone it down. People around me tend to feel insecure and ""less than me"" which is of course never my intention. 

To be honest I have my insecurities, but the confidence just masks that and noone notices. I also realise that it is kind of a luxury position; lack of confidence is way worse than what i'm displaying here but hear me out. 

Its really becoming a problem for the people around me. My ex-gf developed anorexia (not entirely because of me but I can't shake the idea that i somehow imposed an inferiority complex), my current GF is super confident and of course I'm the only one that made her feel insecure ever. People at my internship are interpreting it as arrogance and a ""wrong attitude"", making it a problem for me as well. 

Note: My confidence is always limited to what I can do. I do not boast about being able to do stuff that I can't and I'm always willing to admit if i'm incapable of things. I just know i'm capable of great stuff and so is everyone else. I try to convince my gf that she can do anything if she just puts her mind to it but she just shrugs it off and becomes annoyed.

I don't know what to do, how to change this, where the problem lies. Is it wrong for me to be too confident? I don't want to bother other people but I don't want to be less confident about myself because I know how lucky I am.

w2weo,76,2012-07-05,Some guy yelled at me yesterday and I didn't think of a comeback until it was too late. I wanted to share it so that at least one person can appreciate it.,makemapseveryday,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/w2weo/some_guy_yelled_at_me_yesterday_and_i_didnt_think/,"*Backstory: I have a pixie cut. This will be relevant later.*


So my housemates and I were having a party for the Fourth of July yesterday. There were a lot of people there, but we wanted it to be just friends or friends of friends, not random people. So some guy was let in by someone, and we asked around and no one knew him. He wasn't causing problems until we tried to kick him out, and then he turned in to an asshole.


We kicked him out once, and then he ran back in as soon as the door was opened again. I went down to the door and told him he needed to leave. He started being rude, so I told him, ""Get the fuck out of my house before I call the fucking cops."" He started to walk out the door and then said, ""Fine, but who invited the fucking lesbian?""


I'm not gay, but I have a lot of friends who are and the fact that he was trying to insult me by calling me a lesbian made me so mad! The nerve of this guy! Just because I have short hair and I'm not afraid to stand up to some douchebag that's a foot taller than me? What I should have said is, ""Even though I'm not gay, I bet I still get more pussy than you do,"" and then slammed the door in his face. Too bad I thought of that comeback an hour too late. Instead, I just glared at him and shut the door.


I've never experienced anything like this before. I'm living in a different state this summer because of an internship. Back home, I would never have a party where some random person would be capable of coming in, but that's a little harder to control in a college town where that is the norm and in a house where 5 other girls live.



**TL;DR: Some guy calls me a lesbian, should have said, ""Even though I'm not gay, I bet I still get more pussy than you do.""**"
w2h9m,2,2012-07-05,"23/M/Austin, TX: Looking for pals from all over the world, or even just the next town over. Would also like to work on my (horrendous) Spanish.",payco,penpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/w2h9m/23maustin_tx_looking_for_pals_from_all_over_the/,"Howdy! My name's Matt. I graduated from Texas A&amp;M last year with a bachelor's in Computer Science, and have been working as a software engineer in Austin ever since.

I guess to start, I should say that I have a slight preference for snail mail, for its sheer romanticism (and to work on my handwriting!), but e-mail is also fine. I'm a fast typist after all.

Anyway, like I said, I'm a programmer, and love tinkering with computers. I'm a pretty big Apple fan, but not really what people would call a fanboy--I complain about the choices they make on a regular basis, and am nitpick the products I own to a pretty severe degree, but at the end of the day their products seem to be the tools best suited for my use case.

I was born in New Mexico, moved to Houston when I was eight, and have yet to get used to the heat and humidity out here. Thankfully it's not so bad at my current location. I used to hike a lot in New Mexico, so I was pretty happy when I got to intern in Albuquerque for a couple summers!

I love reading, particularly a well-crafted fantasy series (I absolutely love the detail that Tolkien put into his world in LoTR) or science fiction. I love reading and thinking about how technological advances can improve society in coming decades, but it always seems like the dystopian novels end up touching me the most.

I'm also into finance and economics; for a long time there, I was managing my money via double-entry accounting, but I gave it up for a budgeting app I really like...

I don't have cable, so I only watch what's on Hulu or Netflix. My favorite current shows are Doctor Who, Community, Futurama, 30 Rock, Castle, and Modern Family in that order. I also love ""classic"" sitcoms like Friends, Frasier, Cheers, and Arrested Development. I enjoy movies as much as the next guy (although I'm having a really hard time getting excited for The Dark Knight Rises... Bane just isn't a compelling villain to me).

I love cooking; since I got my own place, I've been experimenting with a lot of ""essential"" recipes and working my way up through complexity. Lately, I've been trying out recipes that don't need carbs; my mother has Celiac's disease, so I like passing her recipes, and I've been trying the low-carb Keto diet anyway. I also love a good cup of coffee (I use an aeropress) and a good pot of tea (Earl Grey with a touch of cream).

I'm sure there are details I'm forgetting, but that's what our correspondence will be for anyway! I'd love to hear from people all over, so feel free to PM me your address, physical or electronic!"
w2549,5,2012-07-04,Is a refurb'd MBP Late 2011 a good investment for a CS major?,memeticks,applehelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/w2549/is_a_refurbd_mbp_late_2011_a_good_investment_for/,"Second year CS major here.  Now that I've gotten some extra cash and that I'm working, and finally getting annoyed with all my fanboyish friends who complain whenever the word Apple is so much as uddered, I really need an upgrade to my laptop that isn't 10 pounds.  I'll be commuting soon, so that will probably mean I'll be at the school for most of the day.  It also seems as if ever since I've started working in an IT internship, Macs are, in a poor way of saying it, retard-proof.  Which is good, because I need something stable that will work.  Anywho to my real questions at hand...

1) How often do MBPs break or have a part go bad in your experience - how durable are they?  I'm looking for the ""it just works"" the most here, because if I'm using this every day, I don't want to deal with problems.  I'm optimally looking for a laptop that will carry me through the next five years (I do have a pretty nice gaming set up - I'm just sick of swapping out something at least once a year, and that's more expensive for laptops)

2) How well does Boot Camp work?  Will I be able to run VS2010 without problems?  Can I have both a Wndows 7 and Linux partition along with a Mac partition?

3) Which model is best?  I'm looking at the April 2010 refurb, October 2011 refurb, and buying new.  The 2011 refurb vs. buying new seems trivial for what you're getting for $200, and I keep seeing people having driver issues with HD Graphics 4000, but maybe someone knows different.

4) Is AppleCare worth it?  A $300 or whatever it is warranty seems a little ridiculous when there are no Apple Stores within an hour and a half of where I live, just ""Apple Certified Repair Centers"" AKA Best Buy whom I don't really trust with PCs after having an incident with their Geek Squad in which they were trying to scam me.  Do they tend to have the same great Apple customer service I see talked about, or would a warranty from SquareTrade be fine?

5) How well do they game?  I'm not largely concerned about gaming on the go, I have my desktop for that.  I would love to be able to play at a steady framerate: Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Source, League of Legends (in Bootcamp of course), as my old laptop can barely do that.  I'm not sure what the real answer is due to grossly different things shown by YouTube videos and benchmark results online.

Sorry that I have posted a LOT of questions.  I've done a lot of research online but these are the main questions I'm interested in and personal answers are best to me.  I've always been a diehard Windows person, but my god it seems to become less reliable and if they're going to try being shiny with their UI, I might as well go with the most shiny UI."
w2517,38,2012-07-04,Old Boss Tries to Get Outlook's Autocomplete Feature to Work on a Blackberry,[deleted],talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/w2517/old_boss_tries_to_get_outlooks_autocomplete/,"I worked at a 30 person CPA firm as a staff accountant for three years. Part of my duties included being sort of an internal help desk guy because my co-workers found out I was smarter than the average bear with computers. It was easier to call me than the firm we used for tech support. Also, I knew the tax and accounting software better.

Anyways, one time we upgraded my boss' Palm Treo 700p to a Blackberry. Our tech support firm set up BES on our Exchange server, we got the Blackberry registered and everything seemed to be set to go.

One problem: one habit he developed was relying on AutoComplete in Outlook basically as his address book. Because Blackberry doesn't use ActiveSync like Palm OS did, there was no way we were going to get that functionality on his Blackberry. Also, we're talking about hundreds of e-mail addresses, so it was infeasible to import them into his Address Book.

No matter how many times I tried to explain that to him, I would get called into his office every few weeks and get the whole rundown again about how it wasn't suggesting e-mail addresses like it does in Outlook or his old phone.

Eventually the firm decided to hire one of the interns and lay me off because my billable hours were low due to all my computer work, so the problem eventually went away.

w1zkq,37,2012-07-04,The Amazing Spider-man: A comic nerds analysis,fiveironknight,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/w1zkq/the_amazing_spiderman_a_comic_nerds_analysis/,"I don’t mean to sound negative but I really did not like this movie. I love Spider-man, and went into this movie with an open mind. I came out upset and disappointed. Let me breakdown the aspects of the movie. 

Peter Parker – I don’t blame Andrew Garfield, as I believe he did the best with what he was given, but I did not like this version of Peter Parker. Peter is not some skateboarding hipster. He is a science nerd. I would never be seen in class doodling or not paying attention. He would be sitting in the front row taking notes intensely. He may have been a social outcast, but he was never mopey, or sad. He enjoyed his schoolwork, and going to science exhibits. This version of Peter felt like he cared more about how to make his hair go just the right way in order to make it seem like he cared, but not really. His teachers and faculty adored him. The real Peter Parker would have applied for the internship with Connors without having to sneak in to investigate him. Also, he is shy and respectful and would never be as abrasive as he was towards Captain Stacy at dinner. He would be the type of guy to arrive in his best suit to dinner with his girlfriend’s parents and try to make a good impression. 

Spider-man – I don’t know what it was, but his humor and wit didn’t really seem right here. My like a smart-ass jerk than witty and playful. He assaulted police officers. Not really something Spider-man would do. The action sequences were fine, but I never really felt like he was in true danger. None of the lizard fights were really memorable. They fought 3 times and nothing remarkable happened during any of the battles, except for the lizard breaking the web-shooters, which was actually pretty interesting. That’s one thing that is unique about this movie. The mechanical web-shooters are a big part of the comics and they worked well here. But the movie should have done a better job of explaining why he needed them. He seemed to be doing fine without them for the first part of the movie., but then he just decides he should swing around like tarzan? At least he in the original movies it was part of his powerset, so he decided to make use of something he already had. 

The Lizard/Curt Connors – The Lizard has always been a great villain for spidey because Curt Connors was such a good friend of Peters. Curt Connors is a good man. He is not a take-over-the-world type. The Lizard and Curt Connors are essentially two different characters. This movie tried to combine two and show how the lizard was influencing Connors, kind of like how the Green Goblin and Norman Osbourne started out as split personalities in the first movie and then combined into one true villain by the end.  I would have preferred if Connors had stayed transformed as the Lizard and then Peter has to find a way cure him and save the city. Also, one of my biggest complaints also would have been one of the easiest to fix. The Lizard’s labcoat. It is basically his supervillian costume. How hard would it have been for the creators to just have him leave his labcoat on while he fighting spidey. Its such an iconic part of the character and such an easy thing to include. 

Gwen Stacy – She felt like a brainy, blonde Mary Jane as opposed to the Gwen we’re used to. Gwen was always more innocent, and shy. Mary Jane was the brash, rebellious one. I have no problem with Gwen being a smart nerd. Just look to spectacular spider-man. She filled the role quite well. But there needs to be more to distinguish her from Mary Jane than being intelligent. Emma Stone did a great job, and definitely looked the part, but the character needed more time to be fleshed out. I actually thought she was one of the best parts of Spider-man 3, even in the short amount of screen time she had. 

Captain George Stacy – In the comics, he was actually a big fan of spidey and Peter. Here, he doesn’t like either of them. He acted as a second father figure to Peter after Uncle ben’s death and encouraged the romance between Peter and Gwen. In fact, he even deduced that the two of them were the same person. One of the biggest stories of spidey’s history was the death of captain stacy. It was very meaningful and tragic. Captain Stacy did not die fighting a supervillian, or buying spidey some time to stop some big threat. He died pushing a child out of the way from some falling debris. This is significant because it outlines the kind of man he was. Willing to sacrifice himself to save one life. He was an average man with an extraordinary heart. I think the movie missed out on a big opportunity to keep him as a supporting character and give his death more meaning later, especially since Dennis Leary did such a great job with the character. 

The Origin – This was a little annoying. He walks into a room full of hundreds of spiders, bumps into something, and one of them bites him. All of a sudden, he’s spider-man. Are we supposed to believe that nobody in the 10 years that these spiders have been here, that nobody else has been bitten by one of them? Then we get the scene on the subway. This was supposed to be funny, but instead was just frustrating. Parker is actually the bad guy here. He beats up a bunch of innocent guys trying to protect a woman that Peter assaults and then rips her clothes off. Gee, that’s somebody I want to cheer for. And the Uncle Ben death scene was really poorly done as well. It felt like they needed to squeeze it in, and rushed it. A store own is really going to get upset over two cents? And because of that Parker lets the guy get away.  Also, the creators felt like the line “With great power, comes great responsibility” was too overplayed and decided that it wasn’t that important to the origin, but they have Unlce Ben say something nearly identical, but without the exact phrasing. That’s down right disrespectful. 

Gwen/Peter Romance – This felt really awkward and forced. Peter has a crush on this girl he has never talked to. Ok, been there done that with MJ. But then she falls for him because he stands up to Flash Thompson? It all seems very rushed and forced. They hinted at some brainy rivalry between the two, and if that was expanded on, then maybe this would have made more sense, but as it were, it just feels like it came out of nowhere.

Flash Thompson – Flash was always a jerk in the comics, but seeing him physically beat Peter was too much. Sure, Flash would shove, and trip him, but seeing him punch and kick him angrily seemed way out of character. I did like how he came to Peter later and tried to comfort him on his uncles death and this is something that the character would do. He is a stereotypical jock, and makes fun of Parker all the time, but he is a hero and a genuinely good person. I liked how they even referenced his love of spider-man at the end, but then they cheapened it by saying he was just doing it for the ladies. In the comics, flash was spidey’s number 1 fan, and this made for an interesting dichotomy between peter and flash. 

Misc – The design of the Oscorp tower was fantastic and I liked that they didn’t make Osborn the villain right away. I like him better as a Lex Luthor mastermind type as opposed to just the Green Goblin, but I really think he should have at least made an appearance. The score for the movie was also pretty under-whelming. The original trilogy had wonderful, impactful music that set the tone. It was music that could be identified without the context of the movie. This time, it just seemed to be there. Nothing remarkable about it. 

TL;DR – The movie was pretty forgettable and does a good job of alienating comic book fans. Sony could have done something spectacular with this, and they dropped the ball on multiple accounts.

w54hf,2,2012-07-06,How do I break up with her?,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/w54hf/how_do_i_break_up_with_her/,"I met her a month ago. After two and a half weeks, she has basically been living at my apartment except for two days that I was out of town.

I'm all kinds of conflicted. I lost my virginity to her - and that gives me a soft spot for her. Well, and of course I like her.

Except, there are far too many cons to dating her than there are pros. I'm more stressed than I've ever been. I feel extremely responsible for her well being and her happiness. She's very negative, has a lot of health problems, and refuses to go to the doctor to get treatment even though she's covered under her dad's insurance.

She complains A LOT. I spend almost 24/7 with her because not only does she always hang out and live with me, she works with me now too. I work as a contractor for a large electric company and got her an intern position making 25/h over her last job which is Subway at 8/h.

She won't quit Subway, and that just makes her that more stressed out and unhappy. When she's unhappy, it makes me unhappy.

She refuses to self improve. I've told her she doesn't need to make enormous changes, but if she could wear more than a guy t-shirt when we go out in public it would be nice. She doesn't do her hair, no make-up, no lip-gloss, no girly shoes, nothing. Even a tank top works, which on a few occasions she's worn - and it's like a 30% improvement up from like 30% on a scale of 100%.

She also has a bit of weight. I don't even need that to go anywhere - a little chubs doesn't bother me - but she doesn't even eat well. She's barely eating at home and when she's at Subway alone and when we're at her parents house she eats whatever she wants.

I might sound shallow wanting some of this out of her, but I'm the exact opposite. I go out, I have on my dark wash jeans, a nice striped shirt, converse, my hair snazzy, face shaved, and cologne (which she doesn't use perfume either).

I don't expect her to wear anything brand name crap or whatever, just to actually dress like a female. And she has some girly clothes! And I've also offered to buy her clothes if she doesn't like what she already has.
She makes me feel pretty fucking guilty when I don't do what she wants. Except that I stop caring, because sometimes she's really adorable and I guess I don't mind doing what she wants. She also always makes a comment to make sure I get left feeling like it's my fault.

I've asked her in return what she would like me to improve, and she says nothing! I'm perfect the way I am, and yada yada yada.

I ride a motorcycle, and she bought $500 of gear to ride with me. Her parents also spent like $200 on me for my birthday. Not only that, she just came with me to my birthday, where I introduced her to my entire family. And this Saturday, it's HER birthday party. Her real birthday is Monday.

She's been saying she loves me since day four of knowing each other. Obviously it doesn't carry much weight to me because that's not something you can know that quickly. I'm not a real believer of love at first sight. Granted, I'm the first boyfriend that she's ever had over at her house. Her parents have taken us out to lunch and dinner four or five times. I guess I'm the first guy that isn't a deadbeat and treats their daughter right.
She's also has a suicidal history. She was in a ward for three months when she was 17. She's a lot better now, but she's made comments like ""I don't know why I'd live without you"". Stuff like that scares me, and raises enormous red flags.

And it's her god damn birthday. What the fuck am I? The most evil guy right? I get this girl that loves spending time with me and I just can't deal with it. My stomach is in knots. My throat feels like I'm full all the time. My appetite is all screwed up. I've been eating worse because of her. I've stopped doing as much physical activity because of her. I don't SLEEP well because of her. She basically wraps herself around me.

She was also molested as a child. The perp is in prison so yay for that. She has NOT been able to have physical contact with guys until me. I've talked to parents, friends, people who know her, and she was just plain scared of guys. For whatever reason, she felt really comfortable around me because I kissed her day three and it has been sex every two or three days since.

But I can't. She does not want to improve. She won't even try. I need my space back. And I've told her. Nothing happened. And yes, I think it's fair that I ask for those improvements. I put a lot of effort into bettering myself. And she agrees, but still does nothing.

But I don't want to leave her right before her birthday...and even though she's already made like 2grand from the job I got her a few weeks ago, I still feel fucking awful about the motorcycle gear she bought and now has wasted money on.

And of course, I have no idea how she'll deal with this. I feel like I'm asking advice on how to abandon a kitten.

Edit: She has also said she wants to marry me in the future, and that I'm the ""one"". 

I realize you might like to jump to the conclusion I'm just the biggest ass on the planet, but try taking this without a biased view and try and fit into my shoes. And, she's my first girlfriend. "

A little background for proper understanding: I am a fresh graduate of a business and economics university in a small country in Europe. After my second year of education I have found an internship at a local corporate finance advisory which later lead to a full-time contract starting from my last semester in spring and up to now.  

The conflict: I was not entirely happy with how things were going at the office in June and during that time our school's alumni network has sent an internship offer from one of the largest UK's banks. I thought ""what the heck, I'll apply, will never make it anyway"". Not more than three days ago I had a one-hour interview with their office and today I received an e-mail that confirmed my participation in stage two. Though still slim, the chances are getting higher now and I may be getting into a tough situation with my current employer.

My thoughts: I really want to go to London for that internship. It is two months without guarantee of future employment, yet a powerful experience and CV booster. However, on my current job I've just been handed a rather large project to do (information memorandum) which will take at least three weeks to prepare and overall suddenly quitting on them would be a pretty shitty move.  
  
The grand question: how do I prepare for such a situation? Is it possible to come out clean? How do I minimize the damage with my current employer in case I do get that internship offer.  
  
Using a throwaway account. Would really like to hear out the thoughts from people that have been in such situation from both sides. Any other thoughts are welcome as well.

I feel like I'm not doing anything good with myself though. Sure, I'm growing food to send into the city schools in Memphis. But, it isn't paid, and I'm quickly realizing that money is a lot more important than I thought it used to be. And that makes me feel stupid.
I want so so so badly to be on my own and living in an apartment or house or tent where I don't have to have my parents caring so friggin much about me all the time, because when I was at college, I really bloomed into being introverted and not always having a support system. I'm not used to that level of care. It almost makes me feel like a caged animal. 

 I also turned into an atheist, casual pot smoker, and very independent thinker. My parents raised me to be Christian, not a pot smoker, and to trust church authority. I'm also active in my local Kink/BDSM club, so hiding that from the parents is hard as hell, and tense at times. I can't even bring a girl home to make out, much less do all of the fun sexy-time things that I like doing.

I want to get into the green living/small scale agriculture scale of things, so I want to get an internship on a farm somewhere and learn how to do that. I want to be more connected with the world around me, and never get into the rat race.

I also feel like I should be adventuring while I'm young and without children, and frankly, still can before I go into the farming thing. But I don't have a job because of my internship right now, and don't know what the fuck to do with myself. I want to see Montana, and ride a motorcycle, and try and flirt with pretty girls at bars, and see all that America and the world has to offer me. But how the fuck am I gonna do that right now? I'm not gonna just travel around the country on my parents funds. For one, that would make me a douche-nozzle to the 100th degree, and for two, my parents already paid for my college and did so much for me already that I can't possibly ask them for anything more even though they love me so much that they would probably do that for me.

I miss Colorado. I miss Boulder. I want to wake up and see the mountains every morning, but all I see is the dismal, muggy, urban reality of Memphis and its shitty racial division. I wish that I had tubed on the Boulder creek, just once. I wish I had hit on one girl at a bar and gotten over my shyness and introversion. I wish I hadn't told my best friend at school that I was too tired to go out, when really I just wanted to be selfish and enjoy some time to myself.

I wish that I could have my lady friend sleeping by my side right now, when in reality she is still in Boulder and not coming to visit for another 12 days. I wish that when she got to Memphis, she and I could sleep in the same goddamn bed, but we wont be able to because my parents love Jesus just a little too much.

I wish that I could run away, but I feel like I can't just run away, because I don't even know where to run away to. I feel like a goddamn compass with a rusted out, bent needle, and I'm just so fucking tired of it.

I feel like a spectacular bottle-rocket whose fuse was a dud. And I'm hoping that isn't reality.

Any advice, whether it's just ""hang in there, kid"" to ""you should do X, Y, and Z"" to ""quite being an entitled little brat"" would be appreciated. I feel like I'm at the end of my rope, and that just makes me more depressed because by all indicators, my life is awesome, and I shouldn't feel that way right now. "

Also, please forgive me if I offend any of you with what I'm about to say; I'm truly sorry if that happens and didn't mean to! :( I'm just confused and trying to figure out who I am in what's seeming more and more like my quarter-life crisis.

**### Story Time ###**

I've been lurking around here for a little while. The first time I actually paid any attention to some of the posts was a few weeks ago after the girl I was planning to ask out (who's also a co-worker, sort of... she's still in college but is working full time over the summer and part time through the school year for the company I've been a part of for about 8 months now) eventually had left for London with her grandma. My plan was to wait until after she came back to ask her out because I felt that starting a relationship and then almost immediately putting it on hold wouldn't work out too well. The first day of work when she was gone, though, I got rather depressed and started browsing this subreddit when I got home.

After she got back, I never found a chance to ask her out because her intern friends were always lingering and waiting to walk out to their cars every day, and I wanted to keep the relationship on the down-low just to play things safe. Last week, she ends up working a lot with one of the interns who's also tall-ish, skinny, and somewhat nerdy and I start getting suspicions but think nothing *much* of it. Then, on our company outing to a local annual rib fair leading up to U.S. Independence Day, I mention to the guy how the lemonade is awesome and he reaches for her cup of lemonade and takes a sip. My heart instantly breaks and, because I've been lurking here, I immediately begin thinking about women's features and how maybe things would be better, or maybe I'd just never get a girlfriend. It's probably the hardest depression I've *ever* felt, though only these past two depressions have ever been closely related to my gender identity. Previous ones have only ever been about not having enough time to play games or missing friends that I realize I'm not likely to ever see again or at least not see again for a long, long time.

So, the moment I get home, I crossdress in some of my little sister's clothes that she doesn't use anymore and, aside from a bit of a gut, I say to myself, ""Yeah, I've got a decent figure for if I wanted to transition..."" Other than that, I sulk most of the rest of the afternoon away hugging one of my fleece blankets, then the evening is spent trying to cope by playing computer games. The next day, I do laundry and sneak one of the dresses up to my room to crossdress again later in the evening while playing games. I again end up sulking for most of the day, putting on a good face for my family (I've been pretty good at that all my life for the most part), then do the crossdressing thing. I'm a lot taller than my sister (she's 5'8"" or 5'10"" and I'm 6'4""), but other than the length effectively being micro-skirt length and the slight tightness in the waist, it helps maybe a little to keep me focused mostly on the game (or I was just hell-bent on indulging this CD side of me).

Fast forward to today where, right around mid-afternoon, I'd been going over how coming out would be like and a bunch of other stuff, which of my family and friends would likely be supportive and which are questionable, and I was all gun-ho about my research the previous day on who to look into as a local gender therapist after seeing if insurance would cover it. However, on the drive home, right at the end, Rio by Duran Duran comes on my playlist and I start singing because I really love that song and it's right in my range. I then go crossdress a little more since nobody is home and get stuck in one of my sister's dresses (maybe it was more of a slip-dress..? I honestly don't know) since it has a side zipper only at the bust level instead of a back zipper as well as these three criss-crossing straps that hold it up and also ended up holding me in for a long time. I started panicking trying to get it off, hoping that nobody would come home or that I wouldn't have to cut the dress or ask for help. I eventually calmed down after getting to my room and locking the door, inching my way back out of the thing.

Anyways, after that, while pacing trying to figure out what to eat, I sit down at my family's piano (since mine isn't set up) and end up going through my piano+vocals solo arrangements of Plush by Stone Temple Pilots and December by Collective Soul. And then I remember again that I'm in a 90s alternative band where I sing backup vocals (I'd wondered about it briefly in the previous two days of sulking and basically coming to terms with my likely Transgender-ness, but had mostly thought about just hiding it from them as long as possible).

And I then got somewhat confused. I was basically ready and happy with the idea of going through with at least going to see a gender therapist if not transitioning not 3 hours before. I wasn't sure what I was going to do about work if I went through with transition, but hopefully that's what the therapist would be able to help me get some insight on. However, I love singing practically everything I listen to. From Paramore, Lacuna Coil, Nightwish, and Pat Banetar to Collective Soul, Stone Temple Pilots, Three Days Grace, and Dishwalla. I've got a decent male voice for singing – it's definitely good enough for backup vocals – and I like singing the male stuff because I don't have to work so hard to make it sound good, but I think it'd be weird seeing a girl who sings with a distinctly manly voice, especially whenever our band gets around to doing gigs. Also, if I were to transition, I'd want to be able to sing with a passably female-sounding singing voice, too...

**Other background info**

So, perhaps the most telling sign to those reading this would be the following pieces. Ever since I was little, maybe 3 or 4th grade, I've had some fantasies of those garden arches magically turning me into a girl, and thus wanting to avoid them to avoid cooties or just being flat out afraid of change. However, my favorite television episodes at the time were always ones where there was a body or mind swap of some sort, like the one in Chip and Dale: Rescue Rangers or the one in Aladdin the Animated Series. Then, 5-6th grade, I'd have some fantasies about using a bath towel to rub off my chest and genitals kinda like the biblical story where Jesus' face is rubbed off and then trade with my childhood crush's corresponding places. 7th grade was my first foray into crossdressing, but nearly getting caught having my mom's pantyhose on after one shower made me stop for a long time.

Starting high school I finally had my own room, but the most I really did with that was taking a bunch of these sock-slippers and rolling them up to be boobs held to my chest by a Survivor buff, using my old baby blanket or extra socks to add hips, and tucking before going to sleep (not necessarily in that order, things progressed throughout high school). The tucking ended up giving me wet dreams, and I was most often a guy in those cases. However, after maybe one or two nights of doing this gender-bending, my mind would be satisfied or bored of it until another 3-5 months later. Also through High School, I was slowly building up a huge collection of website bookmarks to TG-themed-at-the-time webcomics (notably El Goonish Shive, Misfile, and a small storyline near the end of It's Wally!) and other such websites. This is when I found out about Ranma, too. However, I eventually diversified to regular webcomics that were linked by those TG webcomics or recommended by my friends. During the gender-bending sessions, I'd often fantasize and even wish that I had some sort of magical way to understand what it's like to be a girl by turning into one, example methods being a machine in my closet where I'd select which parts to swap, or two people sitting on the respective toilets in the two upstairs bathrooms would just suddenly swap, or a lightning bolt would strike while I was taking a shower and leave me in the body of my longtime childhood crush (it was a long crush).

Before I continue about gender stuff, this is a good point to mention that I've never actually had a girlfriend. My first attempt was with said childhood crush, but I asked the slightly childish version, ""Would you like to be my girlfriend?"" after leading my way into it, rather than, ""Would you like to go out with me?"" She'd just broken up with her previous one, and she felt that we were going in two different direction in life, so she said no. Then, during my senior year in high school, I went to two dances with this one junior who was kinda cute and also liked playing Magic: the Gathering. After the second one (a Turnabout dance), she'd driven me and my brother home and I told him to go inside. We talked for a long time about stuff that probably mattered to a relationship, and then I finally got up the courage to ask if she'd ""like to be my girlfriend"" (again with the more childish terminology, IMO). She ended up saying no, pointing out that she was Wicken and into having sex early in a relationship while I was still holding tightly to my Catholic background even though my family had stopped going to church as often. She gave me a peck on the cheek for my trouble, but when I blogged about it I got teary and went to cry in my room.

There were a few girls I noticed in college, and one I was considering asking out who was older than me and sort of my mentor for being the pianist of the campus' only show choir (think Glee, and that was us in a nutshell, drama and all, but in a college setting), but I got beat to the punch by the show choir's drummer (see a pattern to the original story?). My mind I guess must've turned off looking for a girlfriend at about this point, because while I saw plenty of pretty ladies, I never had the heart to ask them for fear of being rejected again like I was with the two high school girls.

Anyway, I continued to randomly crossdress when my sister finally got to the point where she was tall enough for me to fit into most of her old clothes, but this was around my time in college so I'd only really do it during the summer and during the Thanksgiving, Winter, and Spring breaks. During this time is when I actually discovered masturbating, though I didn't realize that that was what I was doing (and what I was effectively doing way back when I was getting the wet dreams) until Sophomore year, by which time I was doing it anywhere from 1 to 3 times a week. Junior year, it escalated to every other day once I was in an apartment with two of my friends from my hometown. Senior year, daily, sometimes even twice a day (only ever twice in one day at the earliest every 3 months), after which I'd scold myself for doing it so soon and causing my dick a little pain from rubbing so much.

Many of my fantasies during college and to this day have come from stories on Fiction Branches or CYOC.net, plus a few that are built off of those. I don't need a picture, just words, and to imagine it happening to me. The only thing about many of those FB and CYOC stories that I *didn't* like were ones where the changes involved an immediate mental change (often to a bimbo or slut) that made them not want to change back, or else it was something that was impossible to change back by the laws of a particular magic. Some stories, particularly ones dealing with the Medallion of Zulo, made a permanent change plausible to me, but only recently has a permanent change been a potential on my mind.

**### Summary ###**

I've been constantly curious about what it's like to be female, what boobs and a vag feel like from inside a female body, yet I've mostly felt comfortable with my male body (until maybe a bit recently, but mostly from getting a gut) and seem to mostly not like the idea of a permanent change. If I was forced to be a girl, particularly through some car accident where a brain transplant were the only way to save me, I wouldn't really care as long as I can identify as myself and retain my current likes and dislikes, +/- a few to fit a female lifestyle like clothes shopping.

I'd probably be a Trans Lesbian with mostly male-dominated hobbies like computer/video gaming, tabletop gaming, programming, playing piano (and potentially picking back up violin), and singing. One thing that is somewhat enticing would be more form-fitting clothes; one of my shirts used to actually hug my torso – which is rare for a tall, skinny guy like me even shopping for Big &amp; Tall – and I really liked that shirt because it didn't engulf me like most of my shirts. I also feel like I already have a lot of female mannerisms (trying to take up as little space as possible, crossing legs at knee or ankle or both [only really at my desk, though], ), but I don't think people notice them or just think of me as eccentric or whatever because I've never really considered them anything than me being me. I otherwise have mostly male mannerisms.

However, the things keeping me back that seem more unique to me than things I've read while lurking here are:

* Every time I go on a crossdressing binge (which mostly only come around every year or every other year now) lately, I end up getting stuck in smaller clothing for a bit and begin to panic that I'll be found out in some fashion, then after getting unstuck I feel perfectly fine in my male body (aside from fantasies helped along by TG Fiction websites and what's becoming more of a monthly gender-bend binge where I just sleep with the rolled up socks in a Survivor buff or hanging over my neck);

* I like singing in my male voice;

* I'm *very, very* hairy all over my body, including (and in addition to the standard pubic hair areas) around my nipples, ears, shoulders, lower back, and a lot of my nether regions;

* I'm relatively lazy. If I'm motivated enough to do something, I'll go out of my way to get as good as I can at it, do as much research as I can on it, etc. This also means that, currently, the most grooming I do is 1.) getting a buzz cut whenever it gets long enough to have that short bit of hair by the ear that never stays tucked behind it; and 2.) trimming my full beard down to 1-3 mm thick when a large portion of my mustache hair touches the goatee-area whenever I roll my lips in.

* I think I'm a very empathic person, to the point where I'm easily influenced by the personalities of people with whom I enjoy their company and start taking on some of their quirks. Perhaps it'd be more accurate to say I'm a mimicker... It doesn't happen as often anymore because I've had a relatively steady group of friends for years now, but I have some doubts that these feelings I've been having are actually me and not just me reading everything from lurking around here like some freak/stalker or whatever...

* I'm currently still living at home with my family because I care a lot about them, and it ties into the laziness above of not wanting to bother with moving unless it's absolutely necessary (especially after I convinced my separated parents to upgrade our home internet from DSL to Cable so that I can have mostly uninterrupted internet while gaming while my siblings stream Youtube or other recorded videos from online). Plus, my home is only a 10 minute drive from my place of work (though construction makes this more like 15 now).

* A lot of my cousins are still rather young (I'm the oldest not only in my immediate family, but my extended, too; 25 here, youngest is ~9), and I'm still a bit of a role model for at least one of them if not all 3 of my dad's youngest brother's sons, and while I don't particularly like my middle uncle's wife because of the particularly hurtful things she's inadvertently said about my sister to her daughters (""She's a *special* girl [because she wears pants sometimes and not skirts/dresses *all the time*]"", almost implying that she's butch or lesbian just for wearing pants when she's cis-hetero, though she did go through a pseudo-goth phase in high school), I don't really want to have to teach any of them about this whole other side of life that often gets squelched if only because of the relatively low population compared to cis-gendered.

* I don't like the smell of dozens of sweaty women... Had to experience that one day when I was working at a local Dairy Queen... The coppery smell/taste I'm pretty sure made me gag a bit... Maybe that'd change if I myself gave off a similar smell, but then I still wonder if maybe I'm just asexual because of that (I definitely dislike being touched in any remotely sensual way by a guy... One guy started massaging my back at a huge club event for which I went back to my old university to catch up with my old friends and it still mostly felt awkward to me. One of my friends is also very touchy-feely, mostly just with my size-3-buzzed hair or sometimes my shoulder or a bear hug, and all of those times were also uncomfortable for me, too).

* My dad's side of the family has an addiction problem. My paternal grandparents were alcoholics before I was born, and still smoked up until my sister was little. My dad's brothers stock plenty of alcoholic drinks, though I'm pretty sure that having families makes them only drink at every birthday party they hold for their kids. The reason I say this is I'm pretty sure I'm addicted to masturbation (though, from what I read from lurking here, T might partially be to blame for this), and the way I get off is thinking about becoming a girl, but I don't ever think much beyond the ""become a girl"" part and have never really planned anything out beyond a few months in the future, maybe up to half a year for conventions or family gatherings.

**### TL;DR ###**

Latest attempt at getting a date getting thwarted caused gender dysphoria, but realizing I also like my life achievements of being a pianist &amp; (male) backup vocalist in a rock band and finally getting my first occupational job just in November and not sure how transitioning would affect those. Also, my lazy nature and the fact that I have a lot a lot of body hair make me wonder if the extra grooming work would be too much for me, even though I do care about how I look to some extent.

I want to know what boobs and a vag feel like from inside the owning body, but except for most recently up until I'm writing this, I also think I'm rather content with my body as it is right now (minus the gut).

What am I..? Please give me your best guesses/opinions..!"

""You, in the green."" She said, ""You're standing in the middle again. You have to pick a line, right or left."" Who knew that such a simple decision would end up defining so much of you. I made a quick check at who was in what line. Left line: Big guy with blond hair, big black guy, biiig girl with black hair, skinny Asian dude. Right line: Average blond guy, skinny black guy, red-headed girl. I took a quick step to the right. I was definitely a defense kind of guy.

Outside of the hallway was a large cafeteria with a banner stretched across the support beams. It read “WELCOME TO THE SUPER-HERO INTERN PROGRAM” in large red font. It was technically the “Super-Hero Intern Program” but most people just called it Sidekick School. There was a surprisingly large amount of classes available for it being such a hidden school. They had tons of one-semester classes like “Fire-rescues” and “Bomb-diffusing”. They also had longer classes like “Hero Ethics” and “Identity Protection”. Most of the learning was done on the field though. At first a student would be grouped up with 4-5 other students along with a alumni or senior student and they would go to the streets and fight crime, or more often, observe their instructor fighting crime. This being my first year I had the basic classes and an elective. My schedule looked like this.

Interviews were interesting, turns out that being able to absorb audible energy isn't considered an “Offensive Ability” but because this was my first year and everyone takes pretty much the same classes that it didn't matter. The tests were a pain, literally. As a sort of punishment for going in the wrong line the administrators insisted that I go through the offensive tests rather then the passive or defensive tests. This meant that rather then protecting holographic damsels in distress I was tasked with going toe -to-toe with holographic robots and fighting hordes of ninjas. It can be accurately said that I am terrible at fighting hordes of ninjas. Actually, I'm terrible at fighting pretty much anything. It's like, oh look a horde of stealthy assassins, watch as I make them even more quiet. If I could do something with the sound energy that would be cool too, but from what I can tell the most that happens when I use my powers is that I sometimes get a little energy buzz, like drinking a shot of espresso. Then again, I lived in the middle of nowhere so I guess I was never really around that much noise to absorb. "

I've been depressed for the last two months, and even more severely depressed for the past week. I wish I could go to sleep and not wake up, because I can't find a way to deal with my problems. I've been withdrawing from my friends and life in general, which of course only serves to depress me further. I'm scared and I don't know what to do with myself.

Back story time I guess? It's long, and you can skip to the end, but it makes me feel better to write everything out.

I've always been a lonely child. I was abused physically and emotionally by my father growing up. I've spent most of my adult life trying to fix myself one step at a time, but I'm still far from healthy. I was extremely depressed and isolated in high school, and contemplated suicide, though never seriously.

When I left for college life improved dramatically for me. I began to cut contact with my father as much as possible. As of now, I haven't spoken to him at all in four years, and haven't communicated on any subject of importance in six years. I was able to become my own person and though I had a lot of scar tissue, at least I was able to start healing. I still speak to my mother occasionally, though I feel I will never trust her completely.

I got a job across the country right out of college and moved to a completely different city. I was lucky enough to know a bunch of people there from an internship the previous year, so I had friends and people to hang out with. This included one of the most amazing girls I've ever met, and we started dating that year. This has been my only serious relationship and the happiest time of my life. Two years later we both quit our jobs, her to go to law school and me to go to grad school.

After three years together, there were problems in our relationship. To me it seemed that we had reached a point where the only next serious step in our relationship was marriage, something we agreed neither of us were ready for. It also didn't help, that while she had a ton of relationship experience, this was my first. I was learning and changing as we went through our relationship, while she already knew the lay of the land so to speak. This wasn't fair to either of us. I started getting 'grass is greener' syndrome; I couldn't accept spending the rest of my life with her without any experience of what else was out there. I know she wasn't entirely happy either, she had to deal with my stupid behavior. Things came to a head when I drunkenly kissed a girl at a party she wasn't at. I broke down and confessed two days later. She was extremely mad at me, more so because she knew my feelings and where this had come from. We made up, but the next night she went to a party and made out and slept in the same bed as a guy at law school she had a crush on. Long story short, we made up again and continued our relationship, and tried to work on things.

I couldn't imagine my life without her, but I knew that I was sabotaging the relationship with my thoughts of what else might be out there, and how this was only my first relationship. I didn't see things getting any better so we broke up about 4 months after that. I brought it up but it was a mutual decision, and an amicable breakup, we hoped to remain friends. The first two weeks were alright I guess, I went out and partied, slept with a couple girls.

Since then I've been miserable. I lost the love of my life and my best friend at the same time, and it was all my fault. I miss her every day, and all I can think of is the contrast between now and how happy I was when we were together, even at our worst. I haven't been this depressed since high school, and then at least I didn't know how happy I could be. She's started seeing the guy she had a crush on, and doesn't seem to be having any problems, which only makes me feel worse. I'm now the only one of my friends that's single and I have no one to hang out with. I've been withdrawing from my friends, and they have made no effort to hang out with me. I'm unemployed, waiting to start school and everyone is working so I have nothing to do during the day. I've become a borderline alcoholic to try and deal with the pain. I'm supposed to move to a new city for school in a month, where I know nobody and have no connections. I have no safety net and I'm worried about paying for school and if this the right thing to do.

Bottom line I'm scared to death I can't handle myself right now and I can't even imagine how much worse things will be in a new city where I won't know anybody. I have no one to talk to and I feel like no one cares. I don't know how to fix this. I want to go talk to her and try to figure out how she feels or get some closure. I know better than to beg for her back. I feel like I need to know how much of our bridges are burned though and how she feels, if I can get any closure."
w403t,2,2012-07-05,Student Looking For Guidance,albenesi,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/w403t/student_looking_for_guidance/,"I'm a Computer Science major with 3 semesters left of school before graduating. For the first 5 semesters of college I was actually a Graphic Design &amp; Illustration major. The reason for the change was mostly due to my search for the right career. I didn't actually feel like I would enjoy a career in straight-up design, even though I was actually quite good at it (compared to the majority of my peers). I knew I was good at programming and the Computer Science way of thinking due to high school classes, and I knew that there were more opportunities, as well as more profitable opportunities, in that major. Plus, I enjoy programming!

Here's the thing, though: I just started an internship at an internationally recognized company that I'm really proud of, but the bureaucracy might be slowly killing me. It pays great, and it offers a really good employment opportunity after I graduate, but I just don't think I can do the grey cubicle thing... at least I'd rather not. 

I don't think I made the wrong decision in switching majors. I've enjoyed my last semester (the first in CS) enough to entirely justify the switch. I do, however, miss the creativity of design. I really think I need to find a career path the lies somewhere between Computer Science and Design. I've always been interested in web design (as well as the general idea of ""user experience"" but I'm not sure how to approach something that abstract). I know the basic web languages like HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP, but I've yet to use them in a scenario outside of class. I also know a whole lot about design and creating a good experience for a user. 

My question to you, Reddit, is how do I mesh my too passions successfully? What do I do know? Where do I go? Where do I start? I've never really been that great at learning things on my own but I'm a whiz in a classroom or business environment. I really hope to get an internship in a smaller, more creatively focused company next summer. But until then, does anyone have any suggestions?

Sorry if this is too lengthy to generate valuable responses, but thanks to anyone who read through and to anyone who might give me some guidance!

ALSO: I'm fairly new to Reddit. Is it in bad taste to repost this in the ""User Experience"" subreddit? I feel like I'd really value that input as well."

I would would appreciate any and all advice concerning these two career paths!  

About Me:
This upcoming semester I will be a junior at PSU working towards a double major of Cmpsci and Mathematics, and I will be attempting to minor in MIS if I can get the classes to align.  This year I was accepted to the Schreyers Honors College which grants me some serious research power for an undergrad.  Naturally, I'd like to incorporate one of these two topics into my project, but my lack of experience in both subjects leads me to believe I would be biting off more than I can chew.  Aside from classes and working as a TA, I really have no other experience with computer science.  I was unable to find an internship in my area this summer and for various reasons, traveling was not an option (it will be this year however!).  

So, what exactly is a career in each option like? What can I do/read to bolster my knowledge of each topic? (I've tried to read journals and other subreddits but it is another language thus far)  Where can I look for internships in these two fields? And finally, any ideas on a research project? I have a few, but the more I analyze them, the more I think, ""Jesus, how the hell could I complete that by myself in two years with the knowledge I have?!""

w3wag,1,2012-07-05,Help me find the culprit. ,[deleted],techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/w3wag/help_me_find_the_culprit/,"Okay so I consider myself technologically literate. I have been employed (internship but whatever) as a programmer. I have worked with all the major operating systems. I make sure to have real time antivirus, a firewall, and updates.  I am so careful, that when I got a virus and got my password + credit card stolen. I did a virus scan, found the virus, and decided to low level format my computer just to be safe. I do not trust any sort of password storage, I use CCleaner one a daily basis. I also not the type of click on anything phishing emails/links. I dont even click on links, I just type out the url character by character even if it looks safe. I am borderline paranoid.

So today I get an email from Gmail (legitimate email) that says:
Someone recently tried to sign in to your Google Account, __________. We prevented the sign-in attempt in case this was a hijacker trying to access your account. Please review the details of the sign-in attempt:

Being super cautious, I bypass the email and scroll to the bottom of my gmail where I click on details to see login history and sure enough, someone with an IP address from India tried to login to my computer. (It definitely was not me via my phone/proxy because I was fast asleep at that hour)

So I run the full scan on both my computers (Microsoft security essentials) and come up with nothing. I do a virus scan with Norton on my android phone, nothing. I then install Malwarebytes on both computers, full scan, and come up with nothing.

Now I changed the passwords using an itouch I got for my birthday but never even opened (the guy who gave it to me regifted a brand new first generation itouch, I thought it was hilarious), so I know my new passwords are safe. But I am scared to use my current computers for anything.

 Its like living on an island with 50 other people, finding out there has been a homicide, and then being told ""police scanned the area, didnt find anyone, carry on"". Well then how the hell did it happen? 

Based on your opinion which one of these options would you go with:
1. One of your devices is infected, keep looking. (In which case HOW to keep looking would be nice to know)
2. Your password was probably leaked months ago when you went on a friends computer to check your email (To the best of my knowledge I have never done this and certainly have not been on a friends computer for at least a couple months, let alone to check my email. 
3. Something I havent thought of.

Anyway, reddit, I've just been incredibly and increasingly lonely over the past two weeks.  I feel like I don't have many friends left and don't really know how to go about making more.  I used to be one of those guys that people just kind of were drawn to, I never had to go out of my way to make friends.  Over the past two years though, my two closest friends moved states away and the longest relationship I've been in yet fell apart leading to what was probably a nervous breakdown.

Then two months ago, I finally feel like I've moved on from that relationship.  I started to talk to people in my classes more, and started to talk to this amazing girl that I work with.  I helped her through a tough break up with her boyfriend of one year, but I think I may have screwed things up in the process by telling her I like her.  That was a month or so ago, but this past week she's been curiously silent unless I say something, then it's just short responses...  

I went to Ocean City with some acquaintances last week, and I guess I enjoyed myself, but the people I went with never seemed to want to get out of the condo.  Even though I was around them, I just felt more alone.  I feel like two years ago, I had a great thing going for me... surrounded by good friends, a loving girlfriend, and a firm grasp of where my future was taking me.  Now I'm living in an apartment with my Mom, I rarely confide in anyone, and my closest friends are simply the friends with whom I play games online.  

I'll finally have my bachelor's in animation in September, and I may have a possible internship at a big name game studio, but nothings for certain.  Right now, I'd just rather have some comfort from actual people... Have someone to talk to...  I know this is probably just depression, and it'll probably pass, but logic doesn't always win out over emotions in times like these...  It really sucks, because feeling down keeps me from working on my own art or from reaching out to people, and then I get upset from not doing either of those and the cycle repeats.

It doesn't help anything that I woke up this morning and was just really missing my ex...  I haven't even held a conversation with her since early May...

Hell, I don't even know if this is the right subreddit to post this in (apparently not in /r/AskReddit.  Oops.)  I'm just looking for some words of encouragement or advice really.  

TL;DR:  I'm lonely, help?"

What do I do?,shibbyboi182,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/w744e/our_rescue_dog_is_afraid_of_me_what_do_i_do/,"Between June 2011 and December 2011, both of our childhood dogs died while I was away at school. We weren't really planning on getting a new dog, but my sister had a friend who's neighbor was known to be abusing a relatively young dog (&lt;1 year old) so she offered to adopt it, and we unofficially ""rescued"" the dog into our home. This was about 10 months ago, after our first dog had died, but while the second one was still alive. 

Whenever I was home from school, I noticed that the dog was weary/cautious of me. I always figured it was because I was still some stranger (between school, work, internships, etc, I was usually only home from school for a day or 2 at time, sporadically).  

Indicators of his fear:

* If I walk by too closely and too suddenly, he urinates on the floor.
* If I get too close, his tail is down
* If i try to pet him, he starts shaking/shivering

It's not just me, it's men for the most part he's afraid of. But he's significantly less afraid of my dad than myself (my parents think it's because I'm significantly ""taller"" and still a stranger). I have done NOTHING to harm this dog in any way. I know he had a rough puppy-hood and since he's still uncomfortable around me, for the most part I try to stay out of his way just because I feel really bad for him.  It sucks because I used to be really attached to our old dogs, and now I know this one is terrified of me. I recently moved home, and we've made *slight* improvements. He will now cautiously accept food and table scraps if I offer it to him.  However, since the dog and I see each other everyday, it's kind of difficult to just ""give him space.""

Since neither of us is going anywhere anytime soon, what can I do to make this better?"

The only job I can get is where a co-worker is discriminating against me. What should I do?",ThatSinkingFeel,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/w6uu1/spent_45_of_the_last_5_years_homeless_i_earned_my/,"**Feel free to jump down to the tl;dr - this is long, but has to be to explain some things**

In 2007, my family lived with my sister and her then-boyfriend. I was going to school at a community college. My family didn't have money, and it was when I won a state scholarship and notified of a Pell Grant that I started college in 2005. I have 3 disabilities that I couldn't afford to get diagnosed (Central Auditory Processing, dylexia, and ADHD...I don't give much credence to that last one.) No diagnosis meant zero accommodations. At the time, I was okay with that.

Sister kicked my brother out, while also taking what little paycheck I earned (federal work-study at a community college - low-wage) and didn't provide much in the way of food. I got hot dogs while she and bf got steak 3x/week.

The boyfriend revealed himself to be a nazi; apparently his dad was Hitler youth, and he thought it was 'rad.' 

My sister assaulted my mom that July and kicked us out shortly after. When the police were called, they could not determine who started the fight (sister walked away with only a black eye). No one got arrested and we had to leave.

I was very lucky - a friend I barely knew talked her family into letting me and mom stay with them. Mom was there until the day before my birthday (Dec 10). She got sick and I had to send her to my grandmother. That was its own headache. The short version was that she was terribly mistreated.

During that initial period, I was accepted into University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). This wasn't my first choice, it was merely a choice that got me out of Harford County. My major was political science.

UMBC wasn't too bad. Exceptions include the admissions office that couldn't verify where I lived, and threatened to expel me for lying on my admission application (I used a UPS mailbox), the professor who insisted that the Department of Agriculture had the most federal employees and that Judicial Review came from ""Plessey v. Maryland,"" and the ""Christian"" fraternity that had a person nearly die from alcohol poisoning and successfully did not get kicked off of campus.

While at UMBC, I was able to get a little cheap therapy (though it took me nearly all day to use the bus to get to the Loyola psych clinic, no regrets though). I also got diagnosed, so that was good.

Honestly, I would have accepted being a transfer student with almost zero scholarship support (grades are good enough), but in August 2009, my entire financial aid package was pulled with ZERO explanation.

I busted my tail and was accepted into American University. I majored in Political Science and [CLEG](http://www.american.edu/spa/gov/degrees/BA-CLEG.cfm). I graduated without TOO much difficulty. I had to take whatever work I could get, much of that was 'under the table,' but I couldn't afford to do a free Capitol Hill/WH internship - I needed the money: mom was still sick and was not getting help from her family. Dad couldn't (or wouldn't, I'm not sure) help me - I know his wife freaked out every time he bought some groceries. Point is, I couldn't do the one internship every PoliSci student essentially needs to do when you go to school in DC.
Upon graduation, a friend let me stay in her empty apartment while I worked out a housing solution. I tried looking for other options, but I couldn't find anything. The apartment was in Towson, MD, and my work was in Ft. Belvoir, VA. That equates to a 4-hour commute EACH WAY.

The original agreement was 10 months in that apartment. She kept winding back her agreement, and the deadlines became March, then Christmas, then end of November, end of September, then September 1, then GET OUT. This was mostly due to her deteriorating relationship with her crazy boyfriend.

If she had been patient, I would have been out of her hair in mid-August. Instead a fraternity Brother allowed me to stay two weeks with him. I now live in north VA.

The Ft. Belvoir job was with Defense Logistics Agency's Equal Employment Opportunity Office. I was hired as a disabled student. Over my 16 weeks there, I was given maybe 5 assignment by my boss. Then barred anyone else from giving me extra work. She used my 'lack of productivity' as a reason to not hire me permanently.

I was jobless from October until this May, when the Workforce Recruitment Program got me a post with Defense Contract Management Agency. It took 3.5 months to get me in (not complaining, just a fact). Even though I am a receptionist, I liked the job, despite it being completely mind-numbing. I like a challenge.

Until a new GS-09 arrived. This woman is mentally slower than molasses in January, this woman openly called me 'retarded,' and the boss spoke to her - which is really all you can do in government for a first offense. Since then, she consistently reminds me that she makes a bunch more money than I, and insists that her degree in Business Administration from University of Phoenix is better than my degree, and I can't say anything to shut her up. The Boss already wants NOTHING to with this situation.

My problem is that my Boss wants to make me permanent. He has given that task to the woman who called me 'retard.' There will be no hope for advancement past GS-07 for at least a year, but there is no guarantee I'd get the first position made available. Additionally, he likes me as a receptionist because I'm good at it (personal philosophy: do a job, and do it well, and do it well the first time if possible).

This job bores me to tears, I'll be stuck taking care of my mother at an unideal salary with little hope for advancement. I have no official job duties - which essentially makes me the office's 'donkey.' 

I don't want to work in an office where I am regularly dressed down, but I'm darn lucky to even have a job.

NOTE 1: I already complained to the EEO office about the situation. Because I'm WRP, it goes to the agency contact for that program. This gent is slow to respond in general and has not addressed this complaint...it's been 3 weeks.

I'm hoping redditors have some input for me. Help?

tl;dr - Terrible last 5 years. Finally have job. Senior employee is discriminatory. Staying is bad, leaving would be worse."

I recently ended a 16 month rleationship with a girl I felt smothered by. She is 2 years older and there was an underlying pressure to move the relationship along: Build a future, make a strong commitment (engagement), discuss children, etc. For the most part this did not bother me because I was very much in love with her, and her family. Over time, as I worked through school and now a very demanding internship, the pressure wore away at me. She was also involved in a long process with her own work, offering very little time for each other. Our moods were, at times, volatile. Additionally, I smoked a lot of pot and just wanted time to myself to play videogames, which I found made me irritable when she would demand so much of my attention. Finally, I sunk back into a porn habit I kicked earlier in the relationship, and hung out with friends of mine she didn't particularly like. She was very overbearing, we were both stressed out, and my reasons for ending the relationship was simply to take the pressure off and be happier. 

2 months later, we are much happier people apart. I indulged myself, but when the happiness of instant gratification wore off, I started to feel awful about my life. I have since quit pot, porn and really turned down the hours I would spend vegging in front of a screen. Her job ordeal has ended, and now she has more time to do things to make her happy and works in a more positive environment.

So,

We have both since been out on dates with other people. 
We both still have feelings for each other and are in close contact after almost NO contact for a month. 
I feel like we are both in a better place mentally, but we are very leery about giving it another shot. Her, worried that I would break her heart again (and that I'm reacting to her dating, which I did do.) and me, worried that all of my changes to my lifestyle won't change the way I felt about her over the long term (emotional, dramatic, overbearing).

TL;DR: Ended relationship over pressure and irritation. We both cleaned some bad stuff out of our lives and are faced with a decision to take another shot.

I googled around a little bit to see some of the long-term prices for car rentals, and the best price that I saw was about $700/month. 

Is this the best I would be able to do? If so, it would make a lot more sense to drive my car out there, even though 3-4 days of straight driving sounds a little daunting. Are there better deals out there that I just didn't find? Or perhaps other options, like month-to-month leasing?

I'm writting here today to share what happen to me and to sort my thoughts.

I was with this girl for 6 and a half years, and it was the best. She wasn't perfect, she wasn't very social and didn't like any of my friends, and her sex drive was significantly lower than mine. I wasn't perfect either, i kept promising her to lose some weight for 6 years and never got down to it, and I watched porn behind her back.

But we shared the same idea of our futur together, and we could talk for hours, thing that I've never done with anyone.

Every thing started falling appart one year ago, when she discovered I was watching porn and when I was planning a six month internship in australia. She took my leaving for australia really hard, but finally accepted and decided to even come with me for 3 month. Then the porn crisis happened, and we nearly broke up, but decided to stay together. And for a moment, her sex drive even picked up.

I didn't go to australia, because I was missing one grade for my bachelors degree and so we took some vacation together instead. We went for one week under the sun during wich we never had sex. And that's when I had a relapse with porn. From there on, everything went down hill.

She and I got a job and an internship, and I noticed that she was changing. It was her first job, after her masters degree, and we thought it would be the perfect occasion to move in together.

We've been sharing an apartment for six months during which we only had sex 3 times, at her initiative, for I was tired of being rejected when I tried to initiate sex and had stopped trying altogether.

Meanwhile, she was getting more and more social,going out with colleagues of hers. And she was making friends of both sex, when she had been the most jealous person I've known and wouldn't let me hang out with girls before. I knew she was geting along well with her coach, but when she told me she was going to a concert with him, without even asking me if I wanted to go before-hand, I started suspecting something, or rather, my suspicions got a foot hold in my mind.

Her self esteem wich had always been medium-low was through the roof, and she was getting more and more distant. That's when we went for a road trip of three weeks from San francisco to Las vegas.

I thought things would be better, that being together would show us how much we enjoyed each other company. But nothing happen, we went to sleep each night without cuddling, and I cried myself to sleep.
But still, I never found the courage to talk to her.
Then my birthday came during the trip, and all I got from her was a ""happy birthday"" and nothing else, no kiss, no hug.

We came back and things got worse, we stoped talking alltogether. I had one week still before going back to my internship, but she had to work right away. So I was all alone with her computer during the day, and I finally remembered her password and went snooping on her facebook account.

My heart stopped, there was a conversation between her and her ten years older coach that looked like the kind of conversation we used to have, telling each other how much they cared about each other, how she was afraid of acting out, because she hated being alone and was waiting for him to prove he was committed, saying that her (ours) relationship was dead the day she started flirting with him. 

I cried all day, wondering where things have gotten so ugly (i realize now) and when she came home that evening, i confronted her, telling her I suspected something was happenning with someone else. She denied every accusition with such ease, I never knew she could lie like that. Thats when I told her I had seen the conversation.

We talked all night, she told me she still loved me, but nothing was happening between us anymore, that it wasn't normal for a couple our age to not have sex (sigh) and that she was envious of all her colleagues who always had something planned after work (I had tried to take her to the restaurant or cinema, but every time she told me she wasn't motivated to go out after coming in). She told me she saw us as roomates.

I said that I wanted to work on our relationship, that I didn't want to throw away the best 6 years I ever had. But she said she wasn't sure, she didn't think she knew  how to live without me in her life, but she had feelings for the other guy too. She didn't give me a definite answer, but I can guess what it's gonna be.

It has been a week, the worst week in my life. The more time passes by, the more I realize it's over, I've started searching another apartment, possibly shared with other people since I've never experienced that and that I need to meet new people.

I feel numb, a decreasing portion of my mind is still hoping she will come running and begging me to stay with her, but I know it won't happen.
Even if she told me nothing physical happened between them, and can't stop imagining them fucking on our bed. It's especially hard because I know he is less attractive then me.

I've started working-out, already lost 11"", and I hope this time I will go through with it. I've been seeing friends, they've been supporting, they all told me it was for the best, that they always thought she was no good for me, too materialistic, hell bent on her studies and career and that I would always have come second (which is too true).

I really don't know what more to do, I've never been as happy as when I was with her, I don't meet people easily and I can count on one hand the people that I really liked and could stand for more then a few hours. I don't know how to meet women, and I don't want to actively pursue someone, I want it to be mutual. I'm scared because I never meet a girl who shared my vision of life beside her.

I know things will be all right, and writing this down helped me a lot to sort my thoughts, but still, in my head, I wonder, if I hadn't taken her for granted, and if had had the courage to talk about our problems, if things could have been different.

Thank you for reading the biggest wall of text I've ever written.

**TL;DR**: there isn't one, sorry but I mainly wrote that for myself, I don't say I wouldn't appreciate some input, but I cannot summarize the last year of my relationship.

Edit: oh yeah, and I decided the stop porn alltogether, I've realized It gave me an unhealthy outlook on sex since I knew that I wouldn't want to do what I was looking at with my girlfriend. It made it hard for me to come when we were having sex and she always felt raw afterward and wondered why I couldn't come as quickly as her."
w5wyg,0,2012-07-06,A little help with Second-Year Degree Choices. (Please read-respond if you are in either sciences or computer science). Thank You in Advanced. ,labeebk,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/w5wyg/a_little_help_with_secondyear_degree_choices/,"Hi Reddit, 

I am a Student who completed first year Life - Sciences at a well known University with a decent B+ Average.

For my Electives, I took two extra math courses (in addition to my calculus I course I was required to take in sciences) Because i am passionate about math, and have always been.

So for your better judgement here were my grades:

Biology (1 and 2) : B+ and B
Math (Calc 1 and Calc 2) A and A
Math (Linear Algebra) A
Psych (Behavior and Neuroscience) A and A-
Chem (1 and 2): B- C+

(yeah i suck at chemistry, dislike it too)


So lately I have been thinking a lot. Getting a job in science is practically impossible. I did my research, asked around. Nobody gets jobs. (Post-undergrad or co-op jobs). And I'm a person who has been working since I was 12. I love the idea of being in a work environment and making money. My grade 12 Job was a personal trainer (obtained through networking) after completing the Canfit Pro. I loved it. 

Now its been a year later, and I have not worked. - note I am 19. 

Not only that, but when you graduate, finding a career in the field is also very difficult. Most would require some research/work experience, in which the next four years in science, i would see myself unable to find one.

I tried hard. I really did. I called up everybody i possibly could. Every doctor in our university hospital, every firm who could hire, and even recruit interns! I called up my family who are in similar fields hoping for a positive response. Nothing.

So its not something where I'm ""assuming"" i can't find a job. Ive seen the difficulty first hand.

Now lets look at a few more things before the question is proposed:

I am currently taking 2 math courses over the summer term (for fun, love math). Linear Algebra II, and Diffrential Equations.

Now I also live with 6 friends who study engineering, whom all have nice jobs. In addition, my brother and cousin are both in computer science. They both are also on co-op at the moment. Brother making 25$/hour, and cousin making 35$/hour (cousin is in year 3, brother in year 2). 

So you can get a nice idea on where my influences are coming from. The pressure from lack of work + the pressure from all my friends having jobs. Now that seems very immature to say ""pressure from friends"", but it really does get to you. When your holding onto the last $100 you have in ur bank account, while watching ur brother take the family out for dinner, or cousin buying a $1500 computer.


Lets keep going. Almost done. Thank you so much.

Now in my university, first year is very general. You take general courses, preparing you for specific degrees you can go into for second year.

I applied to two that really caught my attention.

1. Biology and Mathematics

- I love biology, and i love mathematics. This seems perfect for me. But again, considering the lack of jobs, I've been slowly shying away.

2. Mathematics and Computer Science

- Math? Yes! But Computer Science? Everybody who studies computer science tells me its amazing. I have very little experience, but I do work with python sometimes. Make myself short fun codes (taught by my brother). They seem interesting to a certain extent. 


So i got admitted to both, and now i have to make my choice. Math and Computer Science is a program that involves co-op. So I would be working in-between semesters. Now I'm not sure what to do. Im leaning for math and computer science only because (math is there, so I'm safe with interest), and money is good during my undergrad.

I don't want to take on a huge amount of debt and end up struggling to get a job. 

So please reddit, let me know what you think. Feel free to share your opinions. I would love it if some science and computer science post their opinions so i can have a better understanding of both sides of the story.

Thanks Again!"
w5rol,14,2012-07-06,"Is ""Asian parenting"" a negative societal influence on Asian-Americans?",qzbky,SRSDiscussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/w5rol/is_asian_parenting_a_negative_societal_influence/,"Refer to this post for a summary of stereotypes about Asians:

http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/nzfh9/effort_sidekicks_menaces_and_whitewashing_the/

We should add ""Asian parenting"" style to the list of bad influences.

http://www.pgbovine.net/asian-parents.htm

I think the more ""traditional"", ""strict"" parenting styles make it worse through encouraging Asians to perpetuate stereotypes (be submissive, a good worker, don't have any ideas, please your superiors)in order to make their parents look better---they're throwing the next generation under the bus like the boomers, but in more of a social / psychological way. It might work fine in Asia, where there is much more structure to society, so much that one can really treat someone as a means to an end perhaps, but not in America, where the ""norm"" is to figure out what you want to do with what you've got, and go do it. I was wondering if anyone shared this perspective or had a directly opposing one.

My story: I'm Asian (male, 25) and I'm not trying to be a 'special snowflake,' I had overbearing parents who made a huge deal about doing well on academic entrance exams, hobbies like piano and tennis that they never really cared about, etc. Now I'm in grad school and doing a summer internship at a great company in a field that I claim to have interest in, and I'm just realizing, truly, how much damage that did. 

Sure, I'm surrounded by good influences---people who encourage me to do what I find interesting, friends who listen, etc. The missing part is, basically, me. Encouragement to do what I find interesting falls flat if I don't, on a gut level, actually find anything interesting. Friends listening doesn't work if I don't trust my (claimed) ""closest"" friends (who come from more privileged backgrounds) and can't help but think they're treating me like a doormat and subtly manipulating me, or if they don't intend to manipulate me but it's the convenient, default choice when it comes to interacting with people like me so they do it.

So I'm not in a very good place mentally. I'm extremely depressed, thinking of leaving, and maybe even committing suicide, since I have no idea what I want to actually do and every moment spent not doing anything awakens me more to how much emotional development I never went through and how the default for the rest of my life would be to work at shitty, unfulfilling programming jobs for people, often from more privileged backgrounds, and letting the resentment build until I do something that might actually hurt someone else. 

Basically, through overbearing parenting on one side and constant pressure to perform and be a good worker (not an innovator or leader) on the other, I end up feeling like I'm a means to an end, a robot to propagate the status quo. 

No matter how much I try to fake myself into the world view of ""I'm my own person and I make my own choices"" it never feels genuine, since I always feel like it falls under the framework of being a slave to or rebelling against parents / white people. 

What was lost somewhere along the way was ""because I love to."" I think in large part due to this treatment, I've become incapable of loving anything. I can never trust my own instincts as I feel they've been corrupted at a basic level. All I can do is watch myself perform actions that vaguely seem to be willed by myself, and at times obviously because I've been trained to be a doormat and concede to others. 

I actually think it's not just me, but most Asians in America feel this way at one point or another, this lack of having an identity. So, I'm wondering if you've seen anything similar through your observations of other Asian-Americans---the few who called attention to themselves, that is---that they've been rushed through the system, and end up being treated in the workplace as glorified robots, and invisible in other settings. Do you think they got stunted as human beings more due to the influence of their parents or the people around them?

Asians who are ""dominant"" or ""warm"" (!) are more disliked among peers than whites exhibiting the same personalities -

w5njw,4,2012-07-06,Should I press my parents for the money they owe me or let it go?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/w5njw/should_i_press_my_parents_for_the_money_they_owe/,"I'm 21, currently live on my own. For the record, I'm still on my parents' cell phone plan but I take care of everything else (my rent/utilities/college tuition/food/etc.)

So over the past year or so, my parents have asked to borrow about $1200 from me that I'm beginning to think they have no intention of paying back. 

The first $700 was part of a down payment on a new car, intended to be my younger sister's to drive once she got her license. Part of the reason we decided to get the car before my sister actually turned 16 was because I was living at home for 3 months doing an internship in my hometown and I needed a car for the commute. (I no longer live in that city, but my parents suggested I move home for a bit since it was a really good opportunity.) When my parents asked for the money, they said the loan was just until the next payday and they would pay me back. Since I needed the car myself, I happily offered up the money for the down payment. I paid for gas, oil changes and maintenance on the car while I used it, as well. 

That was about a year ago, and I haven't seen any of the $700. It's somewhat frustrating because it's not even my car -- it's my sister's, and she hasn't paid for any of it. I don't ever drive it, as my parents live about 400 miles away. 

Earlier this year, my parents suggested that I set up my bank account so that they could easily transfer money to me if I needed it. I later checked my bank statement and saw a $500 withdrawal that I had no idea about. I freaked out and called my mom asking for advice, and she said that it was a bank error from when she tried to transfer $500 into *my* account. She claimed she had talked to the bank and they were already putting it right. 

Fast forward about a month or so, my mother calls and says that I hadn't gotten my money back because they needed to make an emergency repair on the house with it. Okay, fine. This was about six months ago and after asking a few more times about it, I've sort of given up on asking. I'm wondering if my parents lied about it being a ""bank error"" in the first place.

I feel like I might be acting spoiled by being cranky about this, since my parents obviously spent 18+ years dumping money on me and they still pay my cell phone bill. They bought me some nice Christmas presents this year. I really don't want to seem ungrateful or selfish. But sometimes I struggle to pay my rent and for me, $1200 is a good amount of money. I wouldn't even feel wronged about the down payment on the car if I hadn't been assured so many times that they would pay me back. 

I know my dad makes six figures (not sure exactly how much) but I have no idea what their financial situation is (my youngest brother has had some health problems and they live in an expensive area of the US). I wonder if they're having money problems, but they would never discuss that with me. I love my parents and would never want to make them feel guilty or ashamed by nagging or calling them out. 

Looking for some perspective here. Older redditors, be honest: Am I spoiled for wanting this money back? Should I just let it go? 

TL;DR: My otherwise lovely parents owe me $1200 dollars and I don't think I'm getting it back. Should I let it go?

Edit: Thanks guys, I think I'm just going to count the $1200 as a loss and (quietly) remove their access from my bank account next time I go to the bank. Next time we talk about money, I'll make sure that they're doing alright financially. I have no issue with lending them money especially if the well-being of my family is at risk, but I'd really like to know/be asked about it first..."
w8htn,14,2012-07-08,Sick of my degree already,DisgruntledCompSci,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/w8htn/sick_of_my_degree_already/,"Hello there!

I am currently a computer science student at a pretty well known college. I am doing a year long internship at the moment before I go into my final year. 

Comp Sci wasn't my first choice. I switched plans many times. Then I took an introductory programming class, and I was good at it, so I decided I'd go into comp sci.

However, over the last 4 years and now in my internship, I have found that I do not enjoy programming. It's mind-numbingly dull for me, and it terrifies me that I am setting myself up to this for the rest of my life. The reason I find it boring is because I feel confined to my desk. There is limited social interaction, since programming is largely solitary. Sure, you have meetings to discuss features, but then you sit behind your computer for a few more hours, wondering what the heck the guy who programmed the program before you was thinking.

I know I want to finish my degree. I've worked too hard at it not to, and I wouldn't be able to afford more years of college. But I also know I do not want to do this for the rest of my life. But I don't know what else I would or could do. I enjoy photography, but mostly nature and landscapes, which don't provide a lot of job opportunities. I like travelling, but fat chance I can make money with that. I do want to teach abroad for a year after graduating, though. I also like writing, and I'm good at it if I take my time; this post was made in about 10 minutes, so some grammar might be off.

However, I have no long term plan right now. Everyone in my program has their plans of going straight to work after school, and coding for the rest of their lives. 

I'm not even sure what kind of advice I'm looking for other than, what are my options? "

Since I was younger, I've always wanted to create things and be on the cutting edge of new technologies. The idea of working with a company like Google that lets you spend time independently creating sounds amazing. Seeing projects like Google Glass excites me. I can see myself somewhere in the future working with a start up company. 

This summer, I've taken on an internship working with high-end database systems. I spend every day working on emerging technologies and working close to hardware systems, but I can't help but feel like the application of it to the client is abstracted from me. I still do programming in the job, but it's to interface with the databases rather than to a living human being.

Being a database administrator obviously pays really well, and it's nice that I have my foot in the door working in this field. I was hoping someone could provide some advice though. Is this a job that will let me be creative? Is there a niche of computer science and more specifically programming that will let me use my skills in databases to bring exciting technologies to consumers? What is there to be excited about? I'm learning so much right now but I'm having troubles deciding if this is a direction I really want to be headed in."

Back to start, here's my thoughts.",SupurSAP,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/w87t4/got_57_days_in_quit_nofap_for_over_a_month_back/,"Hey everyone, it has been a while for me since I was here! And as you can see from the title I am back. 

I went 57 days through my first try and caved when I had a move, new job, and was just plain lonely. What is interesting to think though is if I hadn't gone that 57 days I wouldn't have had to move in the first place. I busted my ass and finished my Junior year of college semester off with a 3.75, landed an internship in a big company, and moved out for the summer to work.

I was pretty content with where I had gotten, and looking back I realize to an extent I achieved this because of all the energy I had built up abstaining from PMO. I have been PMOing for the past month and a half and I feel like I am a shell of myself from when I entered the summer.

I noticed before I 'reset' that I really had a genuine interest in women, and I was actually more actively engaging them just for fun compared to now where I am back to seeing them as objects of satisfying my sexual desire. It is really interesting personally for when I reset to how nothing much would satisfy my desire, but then to see how quickly I escalated back to my old self. 

I will not lie when I reset I doubted NoFap... I saw all these guys claiming because of X, Y has happened. To some extent I see it, and don't. NoFap really brings some confidence, and pride back in to yourself (as it did for me) because you are almost setting something for yourself to achieve. If anything I love pushing myself to limits, it never is necessarily about results but the sheer fact of achieving the goal I set myself. My first time through I never really believed in the 90 days but for someone like me, I think I may require more time to really reset myself and snap out of PMO.

I apologize for the really scattered post, but this is a timestamp for me to really re-commit myself to something that was such a positive experience in my life (No I never got a girlfriend, but I realized how much more energy I had every day not wanking it every night, how much more of a push I had to just do things I normally wouldn't have been interested in, and seriously you become more appreciative of everything around you.. especially the gorgeous, real ladies around you.).

w7q7i,4,2012-07-08,I am all out of options. How do I pay for college?,rslarson147,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/w7q7i/i_am_all_out_of_options_how_do_i_pay_for_college/,"I am in a utter loss.

I currently about to start my second year at Iowa State University as a Computer Engineering major.  I love everything about the school except for one thing, my tuition bill.  I am attending as an out-of state-student due to the fact that the state I live in is shit broke and the University system is suffering from it.  That being said, I have to pay around 31K a year to attend.

About me:  I am a white, middle-class, male.  These three attributes make it nearly impossible for me to receive any real federal aid.  Now many of you may be thinking, ""Why can't your parents pay for you?"".  To this I have a very simple answer, my dad is an asshole and my mom is not financially able to.  Oh, and f.y.i, my parents are divorced which makes things that much harder.  I know this does not make me special, it just make me apart of the majority (sadly enough).

What I have done: A HUGE expense for any undergrad is living expenses.  Last year is cost me around $1000 a month to live in a dorm.  Yes that number includes food, but still.  After looking at this number, I decided to get an apartment for the upcoming school year.  In doing so, I was able to find a place for around $500 including utilities which the only variable would be food.  So I have been able to cut down my living expense nearly by half.

This probably should of been said first but I do not care.  I do not have good grades.  I fucked around a lot my first year making it that much more difficult to receive aid.  Since returning home, I have talking with a company that would like to hire me as an intern (just because I fucked around does not mean I am an idiot) and hire me after I graduate.  This internship will solve all my financial worries; they are willing to pay for my tuition, housing, and on top of that, they were going to pay me a yearly salary.   The only requirement I do not meet is my GPA (I need at least a 3.0).

Now I have come to my problem.  Since I fucked around to much this last year, I do not qualify for federal aid.  I really want this internship, so I have been looking at private loans.  Remember when I said my dad being an asshole?  Well, like most students I needed a cosigner for my loans.  So I reached out to my father.  I told him my predicament and basically told me that I should drop out and go to a CC since he will not cosign.  Let me tell you something about my dad, he would rather buy a BMW then help his own son.  Since my dad will not help me and my mom can not, I have been asking my extended family for help.  Everyone on my mom's side is more then willing to help me out any way that they can.  My dad's side, nothing.

Sorry for ranting, but this helps me vent my frustrations.

Down to the questions.  Has anyone been in a similar position, and if so, what have you done to pay for school?

I am not looking for handouts, just advice as to where I should look next.  Ideally I would like to find a place where I can get a student loan without a cosigner but I know that is unlikely. 

tl;dr I need help paying for school and I do not know where to look."

Lemon Lass and the Lesson Learned


Dublin, Ireland 1940 

Scott Lawson was a bartender at a local pub called McDaids. He had worked there since 1935 and been a steel worker in Dublin before that. In the entire Republic of Ireland, and especially in Dublin, it is not difficult to find pubs’ rich in character and history. Even so, the pub known simply as McDaids stands on its own as one of Dublin's most colorful pubs, both literally and figuratively, having once been a favored meeting place for cutting-edge Irish writers. Scott enjoyed working there and was well known by his customers.                                                                                           

He was a burly man with red hair, rosy cheeks and a full red beard and he laughed a very hearty laugh. He was the sort of fellow that you could trust but also have fear and respect for. He stood well over 7 feet and was nearly 300 lbs in Scottish muscle. Yeah, it’s true, a Scotsman working in a pub in Ireland. He had moved there because he had fallen in love with a girl named Eileen 0’Sullivan. They had met because they had a mutual friend named Danny MacLaren associated with the clan MacLaren, a very influential family at the time in Dublin. Danny had been a news correspondent for activities overseas, especially involving, a hero named The Great Guava who hailed from America in a place called Citrus City. Ireland had recently had a real interest in the activities over in Citrus City and even had a few super powered individuals of its own to help fight crime in Dublin. Scott Lawson was secretly one of them. 



He called himself “Buffalo Red” and wore a costume that looked somewhat like a cross between a red bull and a brown buffalo. He only fought crime on the streets late at night donning his costume not even an hour after his shift ended at the pub. Eileen was very concerned about his activities late night and wanted him to stop and settle down and have a family. She was a small and slender Irish girl who had blond hair and blue eyes, was a farmer’s daughter having grown up outside of Dublin working on her fathers farm until she met Scott.  He was so in love with her, but he just felt he had to continue and fight as a masked hero. He even considered moving to America to help The Great Guava with his fight against the up and coming Nazis in Germany who seemed to be threatening the world and gaining power each day. The Great Guava was a well-known hero in Citrus City.

On May 1st 1941 Scott Lawson was in an alleyway just outside the pub and met for the first time, a villain who was beyond imagination. He had the image of a spider on his chest emblazoned in green and wore what seemed to be a cross between a military uniform and some dreaded dark cloaked woodsman. The figure stepped out of the shadows and barked “Lime Lord does not like heroes…your death will prevent her birth! ‘Red’.  It’s time to for you to die.” He began to cast a magic spell that left Buffalo Red helpless and unable to move. The Green Figure leapt upon him and began to crush him while his life essence was slipping away. But just then another figure stepped out of the shadows but this one was glowing with an aura so bright she seemed like an Angel. Her name was Madame Medallion. She was one of those new heroes that everyone was talking about in Ireland. She was a defender and a healer with a gold metallic body. She seemed very tall and ample almost like a Goddess.





It was rumored she was granted powers by some sort of mystic cross found in a cave near Killakee. The cross was fabled to have had the ability to repel all evil, no matter how strong the source. It was also rumored that it had healing powers as well and it had been lost for centuries and once belonging to Vlad The Impaler. She began to cast what seemed like a golden yellow glowing aura from her body which then began to heal Scott in a way he’d never known before all of his power began to return and he leapt up to his feet and sent the solider flying with a haymaker attack and it literally knocked the soldier out in one blow. He had wondered how he got so strong all of the sudden. Madame Medallion looked at him and smiled “Oh that, well I gave you some extra buffing to your power…I have the ability to enhance peoples strengths and heal their weaknesses to a degree. So your Buffalo Red, hmm I can see why.” she giggled. “I have heard a lot about you. I was flying overhead and I saw that green thing. Something I have never seen before here in Dublin…seemed out of place somehow.” 

Scott was amazed “Well M’lady I am very glad that ye decided to save me sorry butt. I think I was getting a bit Cocky for my own good. Maybe I will take up my wife’s offer to leave here and travel to America before this place is overrun with those spider things, barley look human. I am starting to think having a family sounds a lot better right now.” Madame Medallion Chimed “Well it’s not any better there right now as far as high powered villains go but surely you would get a lot more training and skills in Citrus City…that’s where I’m headed to right now actually, America to go and live in Citrus City. I hear it’s a great place for an up and coming hero or heroine to live. You should go there and work on your skills.” Scott looks down at her and says “That sounds like a fine plan for sure…I’d hate to leave this town and the pub…they are all good people here but If I am to continue my career as a hero I think I could use some help.” 




After the incident with The Green Figure, Scott Lawson and Eileen O’Sullivan move to America where they get married at Stanton Island just before becoming citizens and then in August of 1941 moved to Citrus City.  Scott continues his adventures there and becomes trained by The Great Guava himself and even helps The Great Guava later on overseas in 1945 to battle against Leidenschaft,  which was The Great Guava’s alternate universe self as a Nazi. After some time Eileen O’ Sullivan had decided to become a schoolteacher, had a Master’s Degree in science and education, and was teaching biochemistry and chemistry to high school students in Banana Bay, one of the many suburbs in Citrus City. 

In 1959 they had both reached middle age and had lived a good life in Citrus City. They decided it was time to have a baby. Or at least try having one.  Eileen was now 40 and Scott was 47 so they had thought at one time they’d never have children but now with the comfort they experienced in their townhouse in galaxy city they knew it was just right to have a child. In April of 1959 Eileen became pregnant and Scott was overjoyed. A few Heroes came over to celebrate and this included statesman. Yeah, Scott Lawson and Kevin Cole (known as The Great Guava) had become good friends and by this time “Buffalo Red” was a household name in Citrus City. Nine months later Eileen gave birth to a bouncing baby girl. She was very small like her mom and had a little bit of blond hair. Her father looked at her and said “My aren’t you a wee lass!” He was so happy to be a dad now and Eileen was exhausted from the day’s labor.  But before she fell asleep she said to Scott “Let’s name her Linda after Madame Medallion…you know….her real name! It makes so much sense Scott…after all we would have never made it this far had it not been for her.” Scott considered it for a second and bellowed out “Well how about Linda “Lass” Lawson, How does that sound M’lady?!” They both smiled and laughed and so it was that Linda Lass Lawson was born. 





Linda grew up well rather slow it seemed at age 5 she was no more than 2 feet tall and 65 lbs. She had wavy blond hair from her mother and green eyes from her father. Her mom’s Blue eyes however seemed to chime in there as well giving her some eye changing abilities more like an ocean color. She was a smart girl too and by the time she was age 9 had already been in high school where her mother got to teach her and found that she was ahead of her class. At age 10 she was beginning to grow into a beautiful yet still small girl. Her hair was shiny and seemed to glow a sunny yellow color. She had so much energy and was full of awe and wonder at nature and anything to do with science.  At age 13 she graduated from high school and she was receiving all sorts of offers for college. She had a hard time deciding which one to take. She had been a lot like her mother and even considered teaching students like her mother.
Part of her desired to do what her father did every day. But she never let on to those desires to anyone. 

She got a letter in the mail during the summer of 1975 from a new company called “Livingston Industries” which was famous for its bio-tech and a newly formed agricultural research center code named “Frost Freeze” which was supposed to be conducting some very high tech and bio-organic methods into increasing food production. In the letter it was touted that Linda Lawson was known for her intelligence by Countess Clarissa Van Livingston the current President of the industries.  The Countess was a very high society woman and intelligent to boot. She had walked into the money by marrying the man originally in charge of Livingston Industries. She was a petite woman, but strong and had black hair and wore a lot of blue.  The Countess had signed the letter with a personal invitation to work as an intern and eventually acquire a position at Livingston Industries as a well paid and funded researcher for “Citrus Orchards” a subsidiary in Plum Park part of Citrus City. Linda thought about the offer and after talking it over with her parents, she decided to take the internship and went to “Livingston Folly” to meet the Countess. Immediately the Countess was impressed with Ms.Lawson’s ability to conceive new ideas from out of the blue. 

Even surpassing most of the researchers there in raw intellect and ability to solve problems to formulas they’d been working on for years. Over the next few years and at the age of 16 she was placed in charge of “Citrus Orchards.” In 1980 at the age of 18 she was the youngest scientist in the field of biochemistry and organic science. She had developed countless organic/chemical compounds that increased food production and quality and resistance to diseases and insect damage. Citrus City had been blessed with marketplaces rising up that were fed by a countless growth of farmers who used the formulas that Livingston had created with the help (generous help in fact) of Linda Lawson. Of course Countess Livingston being the high society figure she was took most of the credit. This didn’t really bother Linda so much as she was more than happy with her work and how it had begun to see even a world wide impact on crops and the ability to withstand destruction. For the next 10 years she worked hard and even became rich enough to move into a townhouse of her own. 

Her father was getting along in age now as her mother was starting to as well and they were retired and living in a new part of town called Pineapple Falls. They had bought a high rise there with the help of Linda and her new found monies that Countess Livingston had given her for such a bug successful venture for the company.  So now Linda had finally blossomed from being a “wee lass” to a 5 foot tall drop dead knock out. Linda was very buff and tone and she accredited it to all the workout sessions with her dad at the local gym. She was very interested in her father’s crime fighting and wished she had at sometimes been a tanker like her father had. She had some of his strength and mass but was still a shorty. “Blame it all on mom, I guess”, she mused. But Linda Lawson was very much a great find for any guy and had even started dating a fellow named Lance Livingston. She thought that it was funny he had an alliteration name like hers where both names begin with the same letter. 





Lance was the son of Countess Van Livingston, but he was just a reckless party going rich boy. His father Count George Von Livingston had died in 1978 so he decided to let his mom run the company. Well honestly it was a mutual decision as Clarissa felt that her son needed some help or some sort of rehab or something. So she was funding him money to live in an apartment in Pineapple Falls the high society neighborhood in Citrus City. He is a handsome fellow with brown medium length hair and a polo player build with teeth that could light up a room. Very tall and a somewhat muscular build. He hated his mom lately for some of the ways she’d been handling the company. He started dating Linda Lawson when she was 18 and he was 24 at the time.  Linda loved his party boy attitude. He would buy Linda extravagant gifts and ravishing dresses straight from the best stores. Linda was moving away from being a smart Goth girl to a high society scientist.  

On July 1st 1992 at 10:05 Pm in Pineapple Falls near the entrance to Banana Bay, Scott and Eileen Lawson were walking in the park enjoying the scenery when just below there feet a green glowing pod appeared. Sort of like a seed and it seemed to engulf them. Nearby citizens said they saw what looked like a glowing light and two citizens being engulfed in the light. Then a little boy looked and said “Mommy isn’t that Buffalo Red”?  He recognized him, as Scott had since given up his secret identity and people knew what he looked like in and out of costume. As the mother tried to answer, Scott and Linda were transforming into what looked like a green lime with teeth and a flying green bat. They crowd before them shrieked in horror. This was the 2nd time they’d seen a citizen or hero for that matter turn into one of those lime earth creatures. This was a new thing though…no one had ever seen anyone transform this way before. After there transformation they ran to the gate of Banana Bay where apparently they went to “Serve the Lime Lord” as they were screaming out just before they left. The next day the paper told of the strange yet sad occurrence.
 


Linda awoke and went to work that day not knowing what had happened until she walked by a news-stand and the headline read “Buffalo Red transformed into lime earth!!” She knelt down in front of the newsstand and began to cry.  She knew her dad and mom were gone and this meant that they were dead to her now. Lost victims of a strange force that she had just been barely aware of. She was numb and still, the wind beating at her like a cruel master. She began to shiver and then fainted. She awoke in the Hospital of Banana Bay to find The Apple Aggressor, The Great Guava, Sister Star Fruit and Coconutter by her side with solemn looks on their faces. “Hello Linda…welcome back” said the Great Guava.  Coconutter chimed in and said “Hey there lass…I saw what happened to your parents but I was too late to do anything. It was horrible…God I’m so sorry.” Linda began to cry again…but was relieved that her friends had shown up to comfort her…out of all the heroes in Citrus City these ones felt like an extended family to her. 



They had all known her growing up rather well as Buffalo Red was a reserve member of The Core Commanders. He was quite often called to duty. In fact The Apple Aggressor had taught him how to make the most of his “brute strength” without actually becoming a brute. “Yeah my wife and I are just torn up about all this…he was a great guy…so was your mom…they both had a love for this city that was the best thing about them. I…am sorry Linda.” After spending a day in the hospital she went home to rest as per orders of Countess Livingston “Take some time off Linda…don’t worry about it production is still at 99.6%. You can make up for it when you get back.” So after about a month she vacationed in her favorite getaway destination Apple Island. She had traveled to there to visit her old friend Danny MacLaren who by now was 98 years old and living in an apartment near the Heroes Arena. He went there every day to watch heroes battle and train for battle. Linda was more than happy to attend them. She spent some time sailing and saw some of the monsters that had taken over her parents in the distance in Banana Bay. 


She had enough of those jerks. Linda wished she could do something about them. She began to feel a lot of hatred for those monsters. But also pity because a lot of them had been human before. She wasn’t sure what to feel. After returning home in August she went to work the next day. She arrived at work to find that they had been working on an experimental additive for citrus trees. It was labeled “BX-9-Livingston”. It had instructions not to allow the substance to be placed near any electrical powers sources and it had a data sheet that explain strange chemical resequencing when coming within a foot of electrical current. This was the best additive yet combining ingredients from Linda’s previous work but containing some ingredient that was classified “data info for Countess Livingston’s eyes only” Linda was puzzled.

What is this all about! She was furious and called The Countess on a video phone.  “Clarissa!!, what the hell is going on here why is there a new additive with and ingredient I cannot know…how the hell am I supposed to work on that and run tests on it?!”  “Calm your voice dear” Countess Livingston said. “You’ve been through an awful lot lately and I will excuse your tone of voice…but as you know I am the head of this project and you are considered the scientific head and it is at my discretion to decide what my employees get to see as far as that goes. I trust you recall the contract you signed with us the day I gave you a job here?!”  Linda was about to speak again but she realized the Countess had seemed to shift her tone of voice from pleasant as there conversations had always been, almost like sisters in fact, to a very cold and angry bitter woman who was getting angrier by the second. “Yes I know it seems it a bit much dear…lassy poo…but you trust your Clarissa don’t you, Linda?” “Oh now she is tormenting me!” Linda thought. She remembered that Countess Livingston tried to act like a mother to her because when she started she was just 16. In fact they had spent a lot of time together.  And Clarissa was very well of her relationship with her son Lance.




Sometimes it seemed like the Countess had more than just intentions of being a friend. It almost seemed like she wanted to push Linda’s own mom out of the way keeping her at bay. It was strange but she put up with it. Now however she was not going to take it. Linda, under the pressure of her parents dying snapped, “Listen here, you cold hearted wench….you never liked my parents so don’t try to act like them! They are dead now thank you and you pull this crap on me and try to cut me out of a project…why don’t you rot in Hell!” Clarissa looked at her with steely eyes through the video monitor and simply stated “You’re fired” and then shut the monitor off. Linda took a step back and yelled out loud to no one in particular “You can’t fire me….you…you…can’t….I am Linda Lawson…I’m the daughter of Buffalo Red…the greatest hero ever”, she started screaming and crying….”The greatest hero ever….and mom…mom…..MOM!!!!” Just then two Livingston Lords…the enforcers of the company used as sort of a personal security ran into the room to see what the commotion was. They saw Linda screaming and crying and cursing the Countess at the same time. 


They then heard orders over their intercom to escort Ms. Lawson from the premises and have her things boxed up and sent packing with her. One of the protectors started gathering the items that were hers asking the co-employees to point them out for him. The other one, a female, moved towards Linda and said “Time to go dear…your services are no longer required here!” Linda tried to fight her off but after a quick whack in the head she went unconscious and lay limp in the protector’s hand. The other one a huge male protector started putting items in a box. But he accidentally placed a vile of the “BX-9Livingston” into her box…as he was trying to hurry up and help his partner carry Ms. Lawson out of the room. 




Eleven hours later Linda groggily awoke with a splitting headache and was somewhere near the entrance to Plum Park and she had in her hand a box of all the stuff the Grey Gaffers let her have as it were. Just a few notes, pictures of family and a small vile. She perked up “”Huh, what is the bx-9Livingston serum doing in the box…Oh my God; they must have put it in here by accident. Oh my God what if they find out its missing and they think I stole it out of spite…well I might have done that anyways…God what do I do now!” She looked around and stood up and said “Oh my head…gosh did they have to hit me so hard. I mean gees…that’s like totally, not cool.” She heard herself say the words but was a little shaken. 

She was starting to talk like she did when she was a Goth girl back when she was 16 and just starting to work for the Livingston and had sort of grown out of the Goth look over time. But as soon as the feeling came it passed. “Well that was certainly odd…I wonder why I talked like that…oh well it seemed to feel good I guess ha-ha” She started laughing out of control and then felt her brain hurt again. Then she had a flashback of memories come flooding back. She was being escorted out of the office when she was told to wait by the lemon orchards in the field while they get her papers. She thought ‘Wait, didn’t they just whack me in the head what do they want with me now…not that I could do anything to them anyway, as strong as they are.’ 

They came back and told Linda that Countess Livingston was a bit hasty and decided that if Linda would experiment and use the serum on a nearby tree and take the risk of using such a highly dangerous serum she would be given grace and allowed to continue employment there. Linda thought about it for a while…she had seen this before…in fact The Countess  had fired her numbers of times and re-hired her after realizing what an asset she was for the company. But it had almost seemed this time she would really stay fired. Now Clarissa was playing games again with her it seemed. She agreed reluctantly to test the serum. Linda opened the vial and poured the contents into a sprayer and then proceeded to water a lemon tree. As the mixture hit the tree it began to grow ever so slightly but noticeable to the human eye…after about 5 minutes of application the tree had grown 5 feet and produced new blooms. But the older fruits had also reverted back into blooms by some strange process. And the new blooms then became Fruits. 

It was an odd reaction at best. The Countess seeing this over the cameras bellowed out over the intercom “Bah…a failure….sorry Linda but I think this time I’m going to actually fire you…your formulas have gotten sloppy” Linda shouted “But you’re the one who tampered with it and changed it…its not my……not my fault…whoa look at that!!”  Overhead a storm was brewing and very fast...too fast for a normal storm...everyone looked up to see a bolt of energy blast from the clouds zap the lemon tree and Linda Lawson at the same time….she fell to the ground unconscious and yet something was happening to her body it was being infused with energy and it glowed a most golden yellow like the sun. Linda snapped back to reality after her flashback and looked down at her body and said “Oh my gosh…I’m like totally 16 again…this…this rocks!” She was wearing her Goth garb somehow and it seemed her costume was living too it seemed to mimic her. Whatever “her” had become. 

Her mind was swimming from memories of the past, like somehow she was now 16 and felt as if she was the Linda Lawson from the past and at the same times her self today. She noticed her hands were glowing and that she smelt like lemons. I mean like really powerful lemons. Something else smelt her lemon scent too. And it was growling and coming right for her. It was a lime beast!  It  leapt at Linda and she put her hands out to protect herself and a power bolt of yellow energy came from both her hands and zapped the poor creature 20 feet back and left  him on the ground shaken. She started in disbelief and said “Oh man….how did that happen….Totally Frickin Awesome….I’m a girl with superpowers. Hey furry boy…come over here and play catch” the  beast howled and came charging again. She felt  a burst of energy building up inside of her and she started to glow a lemony yellow and as the creature approached let out a nova of power. It  consumed the beast and he fell to the ground arrested. She somehow instinctively knew how to use these powers but that last attack left her drained and she collapsed again. 


She awoke in the hospital again but this time she was greeted by Danny MacLaren and he smiled and said “Well it looks like the wee lass finally got her wish and has powers like her father.” Linda croaked” Hey how do you know I have powers?” He smiled and said “Oh well I saw what you did…I just happened to be passing by on the tram and saw you fighting out the window of the subway. Quite impressive it was. I might have to say that you even seem stronger in a blaster sense than your father was. Quite impressive indeed! I think we should get The Great Guava to take a look at you and help you train those powers of yours.” Linda Lawson left the hospital and went to see Great Guava and Ms. Mango in Banana Bay. “Well I can’t believe it….Linda Lass…all grown up and with powers no doubt…how did this happen” asked the Great Guava. Linda replied “well I got hit by a bolt of energy at the same time while it went through a tree that I well….was reluctantly applying a serum to by orders of Countess Livingston.” Linda went on to explain to Kevin Cole the events leading up to the battle. 


The Great Guava went blank for a second. “You mean to tell me you got your superpowers thanks to the Livingston’s? Rather sounds like what happened to Fig Fox in an offhand way…he was subjected to experiments there to that’s why he has his speed powers now. But from what you’ve told me that only furthers my belief that she’s up to some strange stuff there and we are looking into it now. I also heard that they have had some battles with the lime earth recently and we think there’s a tie in to why your parents became Lime!” Linda was taken aback by this “Are you serious statesman…the Livingston’s and Lime Earth are connected?” 





Ms. Mango chimed in “Yes dear, the Apple Aggressor and I have been working with Coconutter on finding out why. After all you’re a friend of the family Linda….boy you sure smell like laundry….in fact this whole room smells like lemons because of you lass.” Kevin and Danny both gave a chuckle “Well, now there’s a name….Lemon Lass….ha! It would sure suit a wee lass such as you hahaha” Danny bellowed.  Danny MacLaren had just walked in to greet Linda. The Great Guava agreed “Yeah I like that, it fits you so well…especially considering you don’t appear to be 30 anymore…now its like how I knew you back then…a 4 foot lass…yeah Lemon Lass….harnessing the very essence of lemons.” 

Now Linda thought about it some time and decided to use the moniker Kevin and Danny had so graciously given her. She even realized that somehow her costume had already made itself and it too was alive, somehow infused with the same kinetic energy she also possessed. She now fights alongside of many other heroes and also as a reserve member of The Core Commanders with the goal of stopping Countess Livingston and the Lime Earth until the city is safe again. She does this with the might of the very maiden that saved her father’s life long ago…and keeps the hope that someday she can rescue her parents from the grasp of being devouring earth. And Thus begins the adventures of Linda Lawson aka Lemon Lass!

Travel powers: She can fly with a lemon scented burst from her hands and leap over buildings. She has good control in the air and has good acrobatic skills when landing.
Special Kills and Abilities: Can fire Bursts of Energy from Hands. The hands are more of a direct damage attack like an acid/energy burn. She Can Nova Lemon Burst which drains her almost to death, but it knocks back foes and leaves them unconscious and laying on the ground with a fresh lemon scent for days.
Origin of Powers
Working for a remote district in Citrus City for Livingston Industries, She was a scientist working on an experimental additive for citrus trees. One day, while working on a lemon tree, a bolt of electricity from an approaching magical storm (or so it appeared), shocked her through the tree and thus through the solution. The Chemical/Energy Mix caused a strange chain reaction in her cells and gave her the power to harness ""lemon energy bursts"" essentially earth based powers that even exude a lemon fresh scent. She now uses her powers against evil in Citrus City

Catch Phrases Said Often By Lemon Lass

“Lemon tree very pretty and oh so sweet but the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat!”

“The Truth is in my Lemon Fresh Scent”!

Now my manager wants me to present to the rest of my team (mostly C network programmers, maybe a few Java guys) an overview of the language.  I have a C++ background myself so C# wasn't the strangest territory, but I've never put an overview of an entire language together before.  I'm thinking about presenting the language through its differences to C and Java, but I'm worried I may miss some features I haven't had time to discover yet myself.  I know that these are experienced programmers and theres a lot of material they probably already know (probably better than I do) that can make it into my presentation.  I'm just not sure which ""fat"" to trim.  How would you go about presenting a language to experienced programmers?"

Earlier this year I took my first steps into game development for a game dev contest with a pet simulator called [Mini Morphs](https://www.pokki.com/app/Mini-Morphs) (think tamagotchi, but for the pc with active badge notifications and such such)

I was given the really awesome opportunity to intern at the company that held the contest, and for the past two months, have been working on my game to increase the scope of my game -- ultimately turning a little tech demo into something that was actually, you know, fun (games are supposed to be fun right?)

This community really helped me out during development and onward, giving me pointers, suggestions, bug testing, you name it and the people here didn't even think twice about spending their time on me. For that, I say thank you all.

[Here's a direct link for PC users who want to play my game](http://cdn.pokki.com/download/Pokki_Mini_MorphsSetup.exe)

What I really wanted to talk about though is expanding your game, and knowing when to add to new features and when the strip stuff away. As I said before, I only began coding and such earlier this year and because of this, am very limited in what I am capable of. The problem is that I have so many ideas for my game, I tend to get wrapped up in features that take much longer to develop than initially planned.

**How do others deal with this?** Is there a good sort of method for knowing when to add on that extra month of development in lue of spending the time bug fixing and polishing? Even now I am still incredibly dissatisfied as to the level of quality to my game. 

I remember listening to a speech given by an EA games dev who said that games we play are almost always wood versions, compared to the gold versions we have in our head. Does this ring true with everyone else, and if not, how do you ensure that your game is at a level you are happy with?

I know this ended up being a bit longer than I intended, but these were just some things I've been thinking about over the past few months of development. If it just seems like incoherent ramblings, then I apologize XD

**TL;DR: I built a ""game"", but it took a while to make it fun at all. How do you keep yourself satisfied with your game, and not constantly adding new features and content?**"
wamib,4,2012-07-09,I just found out I'm graduating from university at the top of my class.  I feel like such a fake.,foreverwhoknows,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/wamib/i_just_found_out_im_graduating_from_university_at/,"Maybe I'm looking for more comfort than advice, but I feel terrible.  I just got a letter saying I'll be *summa cum laude* in the college of computer science and engineering.  This was followed by a letter saying I'm getting a medallion presented ""to the students with the highest grade point average in each college.""  This sounds like I'm being singled out as having *the* best GPA.  

Here's what I hate: I'm a terrible engineer.  I'm a great student, but an embarrassment of a person.  I've done no research outside of classes.  I've gotten no internships.  I don't even really like engineering.  I'm in  a place in my life where I'm really trying to figure out who I am and I know I don't deserve to be put on stage as ""the ideal engineer.""  It's making me sick to think about.  I feel like such a phony.  I'll be lauded in front of thousands of people and I don't deserve it at all.  

With any luck, it'll turn out that I've read this wrong and I'm only *one* of the medallion recipients, but it's hard to tell and the chance of being singled out is horrible to me."

wadki,3,2012-07-09,I had a strange experience today.,noahgordon,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/wadki/i_had_a_strange_experience_today/,"So, here's the backstory. I'm 16, and over the summer I'm working as an intern with my dad's college friend learning some programming stuff. Now, my dad had warned me that this guy is super Christian, and I was aware of that. He's very nice and very smart, and you wouldn't know it from a conversation with him, but I also fairly recently found out he's also a young-Earth creationist. He wears one of those iamnotashamed.org bracelets from Answers in Genesis, the group behind the Creation Museum. He is *very* religious. For example, when I was in kindergarten, we had to go to Europe for a brief period of time for my dad's work. This was only a couple months after 9/11. He and his wife came over in tears because they thought we would die over there and were concerned because we hadn't been saved (I of course wasn't aware of this, being 5, but I've heard the story). Essentially, as my dad put it, ""Our friendship works just fine when we don't talk about religion.""

So today he asked if I would like to come to lunch with him and a female coworker. I said I would, and I did. Then he told me why. He had to have lunch with the woman for business reasons, discussing some stuff. He told me that as a principle he doesn't have lunch (or do anything) alone with a woman out of honor to his wife. Now, I'm all for respecting your marriage. But does that not seem a little excessive? And it seems to me that just the, I don't know a better way to put this, implication might seem offensive? It's hard to put into words, but am I wrong in thinking that that seems wrong? That he thinks it somehow immoral to be alone with another woman? Please leave your opinion, I want to hear what others think of this."
wa81o,3,2012-07-09,Best Credit Union(s) in MD-DC area?,chulk90,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/wa81o/best_credit_unions_in_mddc_area/,"First off, I owe you gratitude because I've learned so much from reading your advice and Q&amp;As threads. My family's been a customer of Bank of America for decades; naturally, my mom opened an account for me when I enrolled in college. I think it makes monetary transfer between her account and my account more easily.

However, I've taken your advice and would like to switch to a Credit Union. I'm currently looking at credit unions through [Credit Unions Online](http://www.creditunionsonline.com/credit-union-locator.html). My zip code is 20742. **However,** Washington, D.C. is only 7 minutes away, so any CU with a branch in D.C. would work for me, too.

My best bet so far is Northrop Grumman Federal Credit Union (I used to intern at Northrop Grumman), which offers [1.5% cash back and ""surcharge-free currency conversions"" when using their MasterCard credit cards](https://www.ngfcu.us/loans/mastercard.aspx), as well as 0.25% APY on regular savings.

My current employment is with GE Capital and GE has a credit union, too. But this one offers... pretty *shitty* rates. And it doesn't have any ATMs or branches in MD or DC.

Another CU I'm looking at is PenFed, but looking at rates, I think this one's become not as good recently. Its branches are quite conveniently located, however.

To give some background, I'm currently a college undergraduate, and my deposit fluctuates between $18k and $3k (I earn about $8k from summer internship and $10k from [scholarships - tuition]; I pay ~9.2k for on-campus housing rent and spend about $500 every month).

Thank you =)"
wa2v6,6,2012-07-09,Dealing with nepotism,pittmanism,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/wa2v6/dealing_with_nepotism/,"The company I work for is a non-profit that has always seen IT as a department they can skimp on. I was the only IT in the company. We have six locations, and will soon have eight. I attempted to make the case a few times, that we needed another full-time IT person to help with the day-to-day user issues, if they want me to keep working on all these projects for all the departments.

The CEO decided to hire his friend's son for the position of IT intern. He went to college for some business degree, has no computer experience outside Facebook and a technology class he took in college, and is only really interested in the job because he had a hard time getting a job after his college baseball career tanked. He has been with us for a few months now. I've given him some simple maintenance tasks (taking care of medical thin client carts mostly), but mostly, he's been kind of my ""remote arm"" for taking care of things at other sites. He does things I can't do remotely, under my instruction, so we can cover more ground faster.

The CEO wants him trained up to be full-time, now that they've finally realized we need a second IT, and the status of his internship has come into question. They've sent me skills checklists from other departments, such as secretarial, to use as a template for his training. What I'm really wondering here is, can IT skills be taught with a checklist? It's not like it's a field where we have very specific, routine duties (outside bi-monthly desktop maintenance, or server maintenance that I definitely would not trust a padawan with). We fix things as they break, have several dozen applications that have all kinds of problems that are interrelated to other applications or operating systems. PC, networking, and computer troubleshooting all require a soft skill that I can't just teach with a checklist.

Because of the nepotism that goes on around here (in all departments), I don't see them letting the intern go. Have any of you had to train a layman from the ground up? I mean, the guy needed my help installing Adobe Reader."
wa11h,4,2012-07-09,A letter I will probably never send to my ex. Am I crazy to think this? Any input would be helpful.,random15273,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/wa11h/a_letter_i_will_probably_never_send_to_my_ex_am_i/,"**A bit of backstory**: I'm f/22 he's m/23. We dated for 4 years and had a mutual split when he moved to a different continent for the next few years for graduate school. He plans on moving back to the same city after. We tried no contact for a few months, broke it, and immediately went back to no contact. There are just some thoughts. Its a wall of text without a tl;dr but I would greatly appreciate any thoughts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't know why I always feel compelled to write you letters detailing how I feel. I just felt that our last interaction ended with the usual dysfunction: we connect because we miss each other - We hear each others voice, and reality sets in - we get unsure(I get upset) over trivial issues- We disconnect. Sometimes I think the pain-to-happiness ratio calls into serious question whether the whole endeavour is worth it. I mean when it comes down to it, we don't owe each other anything. We're both single--and we live on different continents. I don't want to repeat this cycle until it becomes meaningless for one of us. But, that being said, here I am. 


I feel like I'm just going through the motions. The thing is I don’t even really know that I’m going through the motions until I hear your voice and it wakes me up. Only when I feel alive do I realize I had spent the past few months sleepwalking: I go to work, I go to the gym, and I meet people that I soon forget.  Along with this wakeup comes a myriad of emotions that I much prefer keep buried under the surface comfortably coated in denial. This is why it hurts to talk to you—I don't think I had the vocabulary to explain this concept properly when we spoke, and I wanted to explain myself fully.
Here lies the alternate scenario (that I am terrified of). When we had started dating and (I think?) started falling in love, your ex came home for the weekend, I remember you went out of your way to reconnect with her, and I brought it up saying I thought it was weird and inappropriate that you kept in touch with her. Now, I realize what I was feeling was that being that girl (or being part of that friendship) is a sad prospect. I don't want to be part of a couple clinging on to the past (even if it is with the best intentions) when one of the people has moved on.


Another thing I replay in my mind is the position in life our words come from. Although the syllables and sentences that come out of someone's mouth are important, equally as important are the actions and context that both guide them and define them. Let me elaborate. It isn’t difficult to tell someone you miss them and can't stop thinking about them when you are living on the other side of the world. Rejection would be at worst over the telephone; and a safety net of friends, amazing experiences, and parties with millions of prospects would be there to soften the blow. I'm not, however, trying to cheapen what we say. I just want to explain why I stay silent on those topics for the most part. It is because I don't feel like I can say those things and that you would actually believe that they mean anything. Does, “I still think about you all the time” really mean anything in this context? It is our actions that define us, not our words. How does saying “I miss you” and I “want to be with you” mean anything when neither of us are willing to commit or take any real risks. I could have found an opportunity in Europe for the summer just as easily as you could have returned home for a four-month internship. Instead we play this game of cat-and-mouse and the underlying message of our actions is ""you are not important enough for me to take any real risk"" but until something better comes along I will tell you I miss you. A big part of our sadness comes from our stubbornness and the unwillingness to potentially get hurt. 


Maybe I sound crazy, maybe I am thinking about this too much. But what we have is very important for me and I think for the first time in my life, I don't know how to act. I have a internal moral benchmark (that I cannot shake off) that dictates my thoughts and interactions when I'm dealing with a break up. I’m breaking all my rules and its freaking me out. I'm not afraid of being vulnerable but I'm afraid of being stupid. As I reread this email for the millionth time, I realize how negative it sounds and that’s not what I hope you take from this. It’s just when the same miscommunication happens again and again and maybe it is worthwhile to take the time to understand what the underlying feelings are—so that maybe we can fix it? Or at least you have a better understanding of why I am distant when I want nothing more than to tell you I love you.

w9uup,7,2012-07-09,For all those who made tough post-graduation choices on doing something risky or taking the safer route please help! Should I stay in South America or head back home?,itsturtletimebitches,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/w9uup/for_all_those_who_made_tough_postgraduation/,"Posted on AskReddit and got no love haha. Long post, sorry in advance. 22 years old, from the beautiful state of Colorado. I left the state to attend a top university on the east coast. I studied international business and Spanish. After my junior year, I got an internship back home. Worked through the summer, liked it decently, did well and was offered a job. Unfortunately they required an answer by November, and through parents and others’ advice I took the job offer, thinking that if I wanted to I could find something later. In this economy, it’s hard to turn a job down. Start date is mid-August. After graduating this past May, I decided to do an internship program in Chile working as a financial research analyst in an investment bank. Reason was I wanted to travel, I wanted to improve my Spanish fluency and I wanted to try a finance position. Been here for about a month and it’s been an amazing experience; I really like my job and the culture. The problem is that in August I have to make the decision to either return home or stay and continue working at the bank, where I know that I will have a position. At this point I literally cannot make up my mind. I’ll give a rundown of the pros and cons of both.

Pros of staying in Chile: * Spanish minor in university, the best way to become fluent in the language is through immersion * It’s a great opportunity at the bank to learn a lot and gain experience * I love the city/people, met a girl who I just started seeing who seems to be really cool and I’m into her, she’s helping teach me Spanish and it would kind of suck to cut it short

Cons of staying in Chile: *The city is expensive as fuck and my projected salary would not be close to what I would earn in my job at the states *Sick of living off my parents dollar and want some independence; not sure if I can live completely separate from the parents w/ staying down here *I would have to go through the awkward process of declining my job offer a few weeks before I start, the company having thought that I would be working there for months now

Pros of coming back home: *Colorado is an awesome place to live, and its hard being away from family and friends and certain aspects of the States (music, food, great weather, Chipotle! ect.) *Good paying job at a good company, could save/make a lot more money there 

Cons of coming home: *My job isn’t something I see myself doing for a career, don’t see much upward mobility *A big corporation, and not sure that type of thing is for me to climb the corporate ladder *Not sure if I would get a realistic chance to come back if I leave, I’ve got no responsibilities now

This is just a quick overview of the different aspects of the decision I am struggling with. I know that I am extremely fortunate and blessed to even be in this situation. My grandparents paid for my education and I am almost completely debt free. At the same time, I am a very motivated and dedicated person, and I am trying to not take these opportunities for granted. Please any opinions are appreciated. Both options for me seem like good choices and just need some help clearing my head. Thanks to all.

It's a rather sticky situation.

Me: M23; Her: F22 (First off, I really hope this girl isn't on Reddit and doesn't see this post. She seems like she might be the type to be on here).

I met this girl last summer, thought she was awesome, but she had a boyfriend. Basically pulled a Mosby on her by telling her I loved her that night after she told me she dressed up as Link for Halloween, which I think is reasonable.

I found out her boyfriend didn't go out much and he didn't like to party. He played D&amp;D a lot and spent that night in leveling up his character. I play D&amp;D too, but ignoring your girlfriend for it? Too far... I knew this was doomed to end at some point, and even if not, she was cool enough to hang out with as friends.

We hung out occasionally. She had 21 credit hours at school that semester and didn't have much free time. But we still hung out. Comedy club, darts, mostly bar stuff. And every time we hung out, I would ask her where her boyfriend was. He was always doing something not with her, so she and I just spent the time together. Which was pretty cool.

Then they broke up in February. I don't know why. I tried to continue hanging out with her (for obvious reasons) but found out that despite her only having 19 credits this semester, school was kicking her ass much more than she expected. I kept trying. Special events came up, there were cookouts, parties, all that fun stuff. But she was never available. And then in April or May, she got a boyfriend. I lost all hope.

Now, she doesn't have a boyfriend. I don't think it ended well due to the immediate removal of all pictures of him and her together and one of the Facebook statuses she posted. And today she posted a status saying ""Boyfriend auditions starting soon. Well-qualified candidates only, please. :P"" Sure, it's a joke, but it kinda puts in my mind that she doesn't already have a guy on the line like before.

And here's the pickle... I'm trying to get a job with the police, but the city I'm trying to work with is five hours away. I would be leaving in December or January if I'm accepted to the academy. I see her as the type who would be cool with long-distance dating, but I fear that if it came to it, she wouldn't be willing to move to my part of the state. And if I have a career there, I'm definitely not leaving it.

I really like her and I'd really like to try dating her, but I don't know if it would be fair to her (or either of us, really). I don't know what to do or how to respond to this status or anything. She's out of state right now for an internship so I have a little time to figure things out... but I suck at this stuff. I always either come on too strong or I just friendzone myself.

If you can't offer advice, at least this can be my sounding board. Because honestly, I don't know exactly what I'm asking for either. Any good-intentioned advice would be extremely welcome.

**TL;DR:** Met a girl with a boyfriend, thought she was awesome, she broke up with said boyfriend, tried hanging out with her, got a boyfriend again, which didn't last long, and now she's single again. I still want to date her but I may be leaving for a career in the next six months. Boy this TLDR makes this all sound retarded."
w9rqv,4,2012-07-09,"""Fresh"" out of college and totally worthless... What do I do?",questionedaccount,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/w9rqv/fresh_out_of_college_and_totally_worthless_what/,"This question came into my mind when I saw the “Colbert on Colleges” post. (http://i.imgur.com/Ka9Pr.png) .  I realized that I am not the only individual who is experiencing this problem.  Some backstory, if you please.

I graduated six months ago with a degree in English Education for High School.  I did well in my courses and my student teaching process went well. I enjoyed working with the students to a degree. However, since graduating and completing my internship I realized one terrible error to my entire college experience… I don’t think I like or want to teach. 

I like working with people and I love taking leadership roles.  I was in marching band my entire student life (high school, college).  To those of you who don’t know, marching band allows students to step up and take leadership roles with their various sections. I interviewed for those roles and I achieved them and succeeded at them. I truly enjoyed my time working with people and an organization.

Everything in my resume says I should be great for teaching. I am resistant towards it and frankly, there are no teaching positions available to me in my area. I look every week and I get more and more depressed when even the janitorial positions start disappearing.  

Now, with a degree behind me and no teaching jobs ahead of me- I am at a crossroads. I’ve dabbled with the idea of going back to school, getting my masters, and looking for a different job.

My question is… What would you do?  What should I do?  If I go back to school, how ill that benefit me other than putting me in more debt?  How do I go about finding another job with my skill sets?  I’ve navigated Monster.com with absolute failure. I have no idea what I am qualified for or not… I’d like to try my hand and writing, but where does that lead me?

What would you say to us college graduates who are sitting around going, “Well, fuck…. What can I do now?”

Sorry if this is confusing, ranting, raving, bitching, moaning or whatever you perceive. I just saw what a vast expanse of knowledge Reddit has to offer and I figured I’d pick your brains for help.

Thanks!

Tl;dr: You got me, I am long winded. I graduated college for teaching. No jobs available. Do I go back to school? How do I find other jobs? What should I do?

Edit: As someone mentioned, I think I am at the point where I want to re-evaluate myself.  What else do I want to do and how do I do that?"
w9rjk,1,2012-07-09,For all those who have made tough post-graduation choices on doing something risky or taking the safer route please help! Should I stay in South America or head back home?,itsturtletimebitches,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/w9rjk/for_all_those_who_have_made_tough_postgraduation/,"Long post, sorry in advance. 22 years old, from the beautiful state of Colorado. I left the state to attend a top university on the east coast. I studied international business and Spanish. After my junior year, I got an internship back home. Worked through the summer, liked it decently, did well and was offered a job. Unfortunately they required an answer by November, and through parents and others’ advice I took the job offer, thinking that if I wanted to I could find something later. In this economy, it’s hard to turn a job down.  Start date is mid-August. After graduating this past May, I decided to do an internship program in Chile working as a financial research analyst in an investment bank. Reason was I wanted to travel, I wanted to improve my Spanish fluency and I wanted to try a finance position. Been here for about a month and it’s been an amazing experience; I really like my job and the culture. The problem is that in August I have to make the decision to either return home or stay and continue working at the bank, where I know that I will have a position. At this point I literally cannot make up my mind. I’ll give a rundown of the pros and cons of both.

Pros of staying in Chile:
* Spanish minor in university, the best way to become fluent in the language is through immersion
* It’s a great opportunity at the bank to learn a lot and gain experience
* I love the city/people, met a girl who I just started seeing who seems to be really cool and I’m into her, she’s helping teach me Spanish and it would kind of suck to cut it short

Cons of staying in Chile:
*The city is expensive as fuck and my projected salary would not be close to what I would earn in my job at the states
*Sick of living off my parents dollar and want some independence; not sure if I can live completely separate from the parents w/ staying down here
*I would have to go through the awkward process of declining my job offer a few weeks before I start, the company having thought that I would be working there for months now

Pros of coming back home:
*Colorado is an awesome place to live, and its hard being away from family and friends and certain aspects of the States (music, food, great weather, Chipotle! ect.)
*Good paying job at a good company, could save/make a lot more money there 

Cons of coming home:
*My job isn’t something I see myself doing for a career, don’t see much upward mobility
*A big corporation, and not sure that type of thing is for me to climb the corporate ladder
*Not sure if I would get a realistic chance to come back if I leave, I’ve got no responsibilities now

This is just a quick overview of the different aspects of the decision I am struggling with. I know that I am extremely fortunate and blessed to even be in this situation. My grandparents paid for my education and I am almost completely debt free. At the same time, I am a very motivated and dedicated person, and I am trying to not take these opportunities for granted. Please any opinions are appreciated. Both options for me seem like good choices and just need some help clearing my head. Thanks to all.

w9pro,0,2012-07-09,I have a brother who lives and argues like Bill O'Reilly. Being home is hell. How do you handle people like this?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/w9pro/i_have_a_brother_who_lives_and_argues_like_bill/,"I've tried absolutely everything. Fighting back, ignoring it, staying calm and trying to rationalize, literally nothing works.

He lies, steals, exaggerates and picks a fight about absolutely everything. He plays the victim in nearly every situation and can't go a single day without bringing up how unfair everything is because he was in the army and how dare we treat him like shit? He blatantly lies during arguments, stretches facts and covers it up by just screaming at you after he asks (screams at) you to explain yourself. 

The minute you try to talk back, you get told to shut the fuck up and that you're wrong. He uses middle school playground tactics and even goes as far as teasing like an 8 year old might. He's a huge hypocrite and, somehow, REFUSES TO SEE ANY OF THIS. He says straight up ""I'm right, you're wrong, I don't care what you say"".

He's in his mid twenties and lives at home, hasn't had a job since he left the army (3 years ago) and is above getting one (""I'm not working at a fucking McDonalds, I was in the army."" [while simultaneously bashing people like Wall Street protesters for being too proud to get a job at McDonalds, supposedly]), hasn't EVER held a job for more than a month, refuses to get one because he gets unemployment money (which he spends on drugs and expensive shit he doesn't use, all the while never paying our parents back for money he's stolen over the years) and is ""above"" minimum wage, sits in his room all day playing video games and watching movies with the door shut and screams at everyone else for all the shit ""they're doing wrong"".

I work a 40 hr/wk unpaid internship right now and go to school full time, I'm highly involved at a million things at school, I have a lot of interests and I'm really active throughout my day every day. He still finds any way he can to tear me down and call me worthless, and that anything I do doesn't really matter because he was in the army and I wasn't. We could be arguing about whether peanut butter or jelly goes on a sandwich first, and it would inevitably end with ""YOU WOULDN'T KNOW BECAUSE YOU'VE NEVER STOOD UP FOR ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE, I DEFENDED MY COUNTRY AND THIS IS WHAT I GET?!"" Then, he'll take to Facebook and twist, mangle and completely fabricate anything I said and put it up in a status in hopes of garnering sympathy from his army buddies.

It kills me because our parents did everything for us. They passed us off in hallways when we were younger while they worked opposite shifts, but still tried to give us absolutely everything in their power. My father is one of the most incredible, giving and selfless people I know, and all my brother can do is fake having daddy issues and start monstrous fights with him while making him feel worthless. My father will never say anything back and is absolutely miserable lately. Neither of my parents deserve this.

I know everyone knows someone like this, but this is to an absolute extreme. He's tearing the family apart. He has gotten into physical altercations with both parents and been told to move out, but somehow everything is slowly forgotten about and I seem to be the only one who remembers and stays angry (which he then flips out about).

I'm not looking for sympathy, I really genuinely want to know how you deal with people like this. Nothing works and I'm going insane with frustration. I feel like I see WHY he's acting the way he is and that it's incredibly predictable, but nobody else seems to want to do anything about it. I feel alone on this.

TL;DR: My brother is a selfish, arrogant, lying, hypocritical waste of space who is ripping my family apart and it feels like there's nothing to be done. At the end of my rope. Those with experience, please help.

Edit: I know the obvious answer would be ""Don't talk to him"", but as I mentioned above, I have already tried that and all it does is send him into a rage where he'll stand outside/pound on my door screaming condescending things about me until I come out."

w96s6,1,2012-07-09,Not sure what to make of a difficult situation...,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/w96s6/not_sure_what_to_make_of_a_difficult_situation/,"I am a male (22) and my girlfriend is (20), and we have been seeing each other romantically for about 2.5 months, but we've known each other since about 6 before that. We were only seeing each other once or twice a week, due to her extremely busy schedule, but we communicated via text almost every day in between. 

Everything was going great, until a week and a half ago. We were poised to meetup after she got out of class one night, when she texted me that she likely wouldn't be able to meet up because of the amount of work she still had to get done. This happened somewhat often, but I said okay as always, as I understand what it's like to try and juggle work, class, and a internship as she was doing. 

I messaged her back, saying okay, but asking her to let me know when she was availble next. She never responded. This was a Wednesday night, and I knew she had some big plans over the weekend with a volunteer project she was wrapping up. It was the last week of her commitment there, and we expected to have much more free time after that weekend was over, as we'd often talked about it.

I waited a few days, until that Sunday, before deciding to try contacting her another way than via text, and I tried messaging her on Facebook. The next day, I received a message back on Facebook, from my girlfriend's account, which basically said:

""This is her friend, she asked me to let you know she had a relapse and was in the hospital. She's okay and at home now with her family, but doesn't have access to her phone. I assume she'll contact you when she can. If you have any questions, feel free to text me at xxx-xxx-xxxx""

Now, a few weeks prior, she'd mentioned that she has battled depression in the past, and had even attempted to commit suicide once or twice before, the last time being about a year or two ago (I don't remember the exact time-frame she said, as we'd been drinking at the time she told me).

So I texted her friend, asking what had happened, and a few hours later her friend responded saying that she (my girlfriend) had been cutting and purging again. She insisted that my girlfriend was okay, which was my main concern at the time, but that she didn't know anything else other than what she had told me.

I texted my girlfriend again, leaving a message saying I knew she wouldn't see it right away, but that I was there if she wanted to talk, and not to worry about being out of touch with me, as I knew the situation now. 

The last time I'd seen her in-person was a week before that Wednesday she'd canceled on me, and at that time, there were no marks of any kind on her body. I know she'd attended the event over the weekend, as pictures were posted on Facebook by her friends who were there, so I'm assuming this all came to light that Sunday. 


Basically, since then I've been stuck here twiddling my thumbs, wondering what's going on, if/when she'll be back, etc. Honestly, I don't even know if she'll still want to continue our relationship or would rather focus on herself, which I'd completely understand; It's just killing me being completely in the dark, and I'm feeling quite frustrated by it.

Really, any advice would be greatly appreciated.

**TL;DR Girlfriend has been out of contact with me for almost two weeks due to a depression-related hospital stay; unsure of what to do.**

w8uz2,3,2012-07-08,So much time and years invested in this relationship. How do I know if I should stay or go?,[deleted],relationship_tips,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/w8uz2/so_much_time_and_years_invested_in_this/,"This is my first reddit post, so please go easy on me! Let me give a background. I'm 27, my fiance' is 26, and we'll be dating for 9 years total on Halloween. We got engaged last summer because we've been meaning to, but have never been able to afford a ring, so we actually won a diamond engagement ring through a contest out of tons of people, but that's another story. 

I just graduated with my BSW (Bachelors of Social Work) and am going on for my MSW in September for a year. I'm currently not working, because I'll have to do an internship and 17 credits per semester so I can't fit in a PT job. I'm living at home and hoping to graduate in May with my masters and start looking for a job in my new career. 

Problem is...my finance' is not ready for any of that. He's had a pretty bad streak of unemployment, and probably hasn't worked in 3 years now. He's always had random jobs with friends, but has since lost his friends and lost his connections. He hasn't been able to find a decent job since he has been unemployed for so long, and lacks experience. He graduated with a degree in History and Communications, but decided he didn't want to teach anymore. 

The thing is...once I finish graduate school...I'll be ready to move on in terms of starting to save money, get my own place, get married, have kids, etc. Any time I mention to him my concerns with him not finding a job or working, he gets very defensive. 
He has a lot of anxiety, which contributes negatively to his daily life at times, so I'm sure this is a factor in not finding a job either. He says he's applying for jobs, but I'm always seeing him watch tv, etc. 

I tried helping him along for awhile, by sending out cover letters, his resume, etc. No calls. At this point, I'm not sure he feels very hopeful for himself. 

On the plus side, he's the most supportive person I've ever met, who knows me as well if not better than I know myself. He would walk to the end of the world and back for me, and he's my rock after all these years and after all we've been through. I tried giving him an ultimatum, but he keeps reassuring me not to worry and that he'll find something. 

So, what do I do? I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else at this point, but I don't know how much longer I can wait. I have a lot of resentment built up. I feel like I know the answer for myself already, but am either holding out to see if things change, or just looking for some extra guidance. Thank you guys...

TL;DR Fiance' hasn't worked in 3 years and has a pretty unstable enployment history. We're great together, but I want more. Now what?"

What I was hoping you all could help me out with is I am looking for any number of things which will help me navigate a community which I am entirely unfamiliar. To give you a little background, I went to school in Chicago studying Architecture and the Ideal position would be to work for an Architect who does aesthetically focused sustainable design. I am 24 and I have very little experience so even if it means getting coffee for people just so I can be around the office and absorb what they do I am willing to do it. With that said, I am willing to pursue and possible lead which can get me in contact with someone who would be interested in my services. So what I am asking from my fellow redditors is if you can answer any number of these questions I will be enourmously thankful and probably buy your a beer or two when I get there.

Do you know anyone that works in the field of architecture and would you be willing to send me their contact information?

Do you know of any architects or architecture firms who practice sustainable design where I can look for contacts?

Are there any arts districts, or places with high concentrations of galleries where I can begin to look for people who have connections in the design community?

Can you give me any intern seeking websites, or message boards where I can find contacts?

Do you have any general advice in locating the right people Cape town?


Helping my out would allow me a lot of a relief because I am feeling particularly helpless in the matter right now

On June 23rd I was visiting Tyson Corners Mall located in Tyson Corner Virginia. It was my birthday weekend and I was very excited to go shopping in the mall that I had not visited in over 10 years. I own clothing boutique in Richmond Virginia and it is very hard to get off of work so I was looking forward to my little vacation. I was staying at the Hilton Hotel and I rode the hotel shuttle to the mall. I arrived there at around 7pm. I made purchases at MAC makeup, Forever 21, H&amp;M, Bebe and a few other stores before I came to Express between 8:45 pm and 9:15 pm. I was told prior to my shopping visit that this particular Express location was having a huge dress sale and that I should stop by. I have been shopping in Express since I was 15 years old, so I knew that I would be able to find some wonderful designs for an affordable price.

I walked into the very busy store. I was not greeted or told about the sale by any of the sale associates. I walked around for a minute until I finally found the sale dresses. The dresses were not in order, so it took me a minute to find the right size in two different dresses. I’m 5 foot 2 inches tall, so I was standing on my toes trying to reach the dresses on the high display rack. Once I had the dresses in hand, I walked to a fitting room near the register. The store was in disarray. In my opinion, there were not enough people working to handle such a heavy load. There were shoes all over the ground and the line was out the door. I waited patiently by a fitting room for about 5 minutes. After no one came I assumed the fitting rooms were closed because the store was closing in 20 minutes and I was in clear view of employees working. I walked around for a minute then walked back to the fitting room and waited even longer. Finally a female associate named Huma Ahktar approached me. I told her I had two items and asked if she would like to hold my bags. She told me I could take my bags into the room. I was in the fitting room for about 2 minutes. When I walked out the room, the sales associate Huma Ahktar was standing directly in front of my fitting room. I was surprised that Ms. Ahktar did not ask how the items worked out, which is routine for any retail store clerk working the fitting room area. Even though the sales associate did not ask, I told her that both items fit great and that I would be wearing one of the dresses that night, as I had a birthday dinner planned and the mustard dress was going to be perfect with my new shoes from Aldo.

The moment I walked out of the fitting room area, I was greeted by another sales associate, William Lewis. Mr. Lewis informed me that he had heard his manager Huma Ahktar, the woman who I thought was assisting me in the fitting rooms, announce on the headset that there was a “shady girl in the store that needed to be watched because (said shady girl) looked like she was about to steal something.” I was completely shocked by Ms. Ahktar’s words and behavior. I had spent over $400 dollars in that mall within the last hour. Not to mention, I was clearly carrying bags from stores that I had made purchases from. I was dressed casual wearing a pair of vintage shorts and a vintage Levi’s denim jacket with cowboy boots. I was carrying a wallet, in my opinion there was no reason to suspect me as a thief. 

I don’t understand where the idea that I would steal was coming from. Clearly being of African decent and a 27 year old Woman was enough for me to be followed by the store manager. Mr. Lewis told me that he was “sorry” repeatedly. Mr. Lewis admitted that he overhead his manager on the headset and had no idea that they could be talking about me. He saw the shock in my face and said he understood if I wanted to put back my items and leave the Express store immediately. Mr. Lewis also let me know that this has happened before while working with Huma Ahktar. Mr. Lewis recalled that on at least one other occasion, his store manager had specifically asked Mr. Lewis, a young man also of African American heritage, to watch or follow other African Americans because they had immediately been profiled by Ms. Ahktar as potential thieves. 

I was frozen with shock and could not believe I had been racially profiled in such a way by Ms. Ahktar. I am a very hard working Woman. I own a successful clothing store, “Rumors Boutique” which is located in Richmond Virginia. My store, Rumors Boutique, has a prime location on the campus of Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). We are very involved with our city. Weekly we donate over 20 percent of our sales to non-profit and student organizations. I have built, owned and operated Rumors Boutique for over 5 years. I have had over 40 interns and I have 14 employees on my payroll. I speak at the local college on a regular basis and work with the city on youth behavioral programs. I know how to properly manage a store and how to treat customers and people in general of all races and creeds with respect when they come into my place of business. The profiling which I experienced at the Express store in Tyson’s Corner Mall situation would never happen in my store. If any of my employees behaved as Huma Ahktar behaved on June 23rd, 2012, it would result in immediate termination with no severance pay or referral.

I was reminded on June 23, 2012, days before my birthday and the 5th anniversary of opening my store, that it doesn’t matter how hard I work, how much I give to my community and my city because the rest of the world looks at me and decides I am a shady woman who is a thief based on the texture of my hair and the color of my skin. Another associate, Rueben Castellon, was incredibly nice and understanding he apologized profusely for the behavior of his manager Ms. Ahktar. In that moment I sincerely appreciated Mr. Castellon’s compassion for the discriminatory situation I had just been placed in. I told Mr. Castellon, that it was indeed not his fault but I appreciated his gesture of condolence. After speaking with Mr. Castellon and Mr. Lewis, I decided that I would still purchase the dresses. But I asked Mr. Castellon not to give me a discount, because I did not want nor need a price break on something I could afford. At no time did the Manager come out to talk to me or deal with this situation that could have been handled by the time I had reached the register to pay for the items. I assume that Ms. Ahktar was most likely in shock that someone like me, a “shady black girl” would be acquainted with an associate who works at the Express store that Ms. Ahktar manages. 

This whole situation has weighed heavily on my soul. I am the daughter of parents who fought for civil rights in America. My father and mother were Secretary and President of the NAACP in Bingham NY. My parent’s have instilled me with values that taught me to fight for what I believe. They taught me, that not only I am equal, but that my hard work and ambition will win overall. This situation has showed me there is still a lot of work to do.

Express is a good company. I know several people who work at the Express in Richmond Virginia and I’ve been treated with nothing but respect from the staff at the Express locations in Richmond Virginia. The Tyson Corner Express is one of the largest and most successful locations on the East Coast. Any of your employees could be potential managers of different Express stores around America. You do not want bad management to reflect your company. You do not want a mistake to become company policy.


Growing up in Manassas Virginia my friends and I loved to visit the huge mall and see all the designer stores. Our parents would pack us in a Van and we would spend hours visiting every store, buying wonderful items to wear to school to impress our friends. We tried on dresses at Jessica Mcklintock for homecoming and prom. We visited Delia’s when it first opened and spent every penny we had. I think when it opened I went there at least 3 times a week. Ending the day at La Madeline’s eating strawberries and fancy French food. It was one of my best memories growing up and I will miss those good times. Yet today I am writing to inform you that I no longer feel comfortable shopping at your mall. What was once a wonderful memory full of laughter and teenage innocence has been replaced by a painful memory of racism and discrimination. The manager of the Express location, Huma Ahktar should be terminated as soon as possible. Ms Ahktar behavior has tarnished the shopping experience with her prejudice and use of racial profiling. In my opinion, as a retail business owner, Ms. Ahktar should not receive any severance pay or package upon leaving. Ms. Ahktar should not be referred or re-located to another Express store or any affiliated store. 

Upon receiving my letter I would like to be informed, in writing, how Express will be dealing with Ms. Ahktar and the racially motivated situation I was unfairly placed in. Since this incident occurred on June 23rd, 2012 I have been speaking with a wonderful woman from Express HR Tereese Harris. Ms Harris has assured me that both, Ms. Ahktar and the habitual use of racial profiling at your Tyson’s Corner location will be handled properly. Attached to this email I have included 5 or so articles written about myself and my business partner. From these articles, the success, impact and community involvement of our store will be more than evident. I was saddened and humiliated by Ms. Ahktar and I hope that you will be able to rectify this situation, swiftly and professionally without the need for me to seek legal counsel. 

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely, 

Marshe Wyche

wchlm,1,2012-07-10,I guess I blew it but maybe one last ditch effort wouldn't hurt?,harboring,askseddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/wchlm/i_guess_i_blew_it_but_maybe_one_last_ditch_effort/,"Met this girl off the street a while back, maybe a month and a half or so ago.  I know I cold approached but can't recall if I went direct and told her I thought she was incredibly attractive or used a different reference going in.  In any case, found out she's on her way to work, is a fashion mag intern, from Europe, and I think only here for a few months or so.  So, to start, it was going strong enough for the first couple things.  The 'getting to know you' part continued into 'ok' territory (though only just ok) but then I just couldn't keep it going.  Not really anyway, I'm really bad at continuing the conversation, I run out of anything to say beyond the logistical stuff, not that that stuff's even good to begin with.  At one point, I think I fumbled the name of her company and had to ask her like three times in a row what it was because I couldn't make out the name of it (it was something hard to pronounce).  Then moved on to stuff about how she was liking the city and what she's been doing... from one generic topic (where you from, what do you do, etc.) to another (what do you do around town, etc).  I just get nervous around beautiful women.  It got a little more awkward as time went on and as we kept walking; especially that there was some silence now between conversation topics as the awareness of the awkwardness became clearer.

But despite this... I got a number close.  With the caveat that she said she can't promise she'd answer or something, can't recall the exact reasoning she told me.  I called her right away so she ""had my number too"" but obviously to verify.  I told her I'd maybe try her anyway.  Said goodbye, and left it.  Ended up not contacting, just thought it be best to leave alone as a single failed encounter despite getting her number.  I also had a bunch of personal issues that I was mired in time-wise so wasn't totally free for much.

Cut to today and I randomly see her on the same street.  I see her walking and as she runs into this little kid, she playfully kind of pats him on the head or plays with his hands a bit and keeps walking while smiling back at him (she apparently likes children).  So in hindsight, I totally should have played off that interaction and said something like ""so do you always molest strange young children on the street?""  Instead, I approach and just cut right to how I think we've met before.  She doesn't seem to remember right away... I realize I perhaps shouldn't have done that -- starting fresh like we hadn't met yet would have been the best way to go as to not frame this encounter in the same awkwardness as the previous one.  But it's too late.  And this further makes me feel awkward as she realizes who I am.  So I totally feel like I fucked this up within the first 5-10 seconds and it becomes tense again and I ask her logistical stuff yet again.  I ask if she's on her way to work, how she's liking the city and if she's used to it, what she's been up to.  She says nothing but work.. I then randomly pull out of my ass the question of whether she's traveled outside the city.  She says she has a couple times with her ""boyfriend"", whom I am 99% sure she made up on the spot to obstruct me.  I tell her I was upstate a few days ago and that it's beautiful, recommend that she should tell ""him"" and should go.  She says ""maybe"" and then there's the silence again.  After a bit of that silence and general tenseness, I decide to bail and ask her if she knows X restaurant around the neighborhood, I'm meeting my friend there.  She says she doesn't know and I say I asked because she might know the neighborhood well since she works here.  She says she doesn't and I say I'm turning on this street that we've now walked to to find it and I wish her a good day and she wishes me luck.

So right immediately afterwards, I realize a lot of stuff I could have done better like be a lot more jovial rather than tense and come up with a lot more playful things to say to engage her more positively than logistical boring stuff.  I *always* realize this shit in hindsight.  It's a mix of being nervous around attractive girls and not being in the right frame of mind or mood to do this, as 'the game' and being automatically confident around strangers doesn't come naturally to me.  Maybe I should just refrain from approaching at all if I'm not in the right headspace.  But seeing her a second time around just reminded me how fucking hot she really is and the attraction got to me.  She's basically Jessica Alba but with fuller lips.

So I know I blew a lot of this and I'm pushing it, I know, but I figure one last ditch effort wouldn't hurt maybe?  I mean, the worst that would happen is that she blows me off and doesn't reply, which I would more or less not be too surprised by anyway.  So what's the harm then?  Was thinking just a text saying this:

""Hey, so I'll level with you, I'm honestly a bit nervous around someone so incredibly gorgeous as yourself so I admit first-meeting small talk isn't exactly my strength.  In case that 'boyfriend' was understandably made up, I'd absolutely love to get a drink or coffee with you and cut out the small talk.  Promise it'll be good times.  I'll even try to keep the bad jokes at a miminum. PS.  Saw you playing with the little kid right before I talked with you; do you always molest strange little children on the street? :)""

Something that at least casually explains the awkwardness and be a bit self-deprecating while ending by asking her out for coffee, basically to appeal to a more sensitive/sympathetic side if possible.  And a slight debunk to the ""boyfriend"" but not totally.  If I've already blown it so far, I figure it's the only thing I have left and, as said, if it doesn't work then fuck it.

So I guess this is my FR (Failure Report).  Either way though, seems like maybe it wouldn't hurt if I'm never really going to see her again anyway?  Seeing her today was a fluke since I went into work really late today.

tl;dr
Met this really gorgeous girl a while back, was awkward and tense but got her number despite this.  Met her again today and still awkward and tense, with some more indication of uninterest but I think it's only due to the initial awkwardness which can be avoided once I'm in the right headspace.  Maybe try one last ditch effort to lay out the right words in a text and if nothing comes of it then just forget it?"
wcgem,3,2012-07-10,Question from a start-up tech (jack of all trades?) How do I work with Packed decimal EBCIDIC files?,LordZer,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/wcgem/question_from_a_startup_tech_jack_of_all_trades/,"I'm the only 'tech' person at my company. That causes me to wear many a hat my networking degree didn't prepare me for. I always jump into the new experiences and have learned a great many things about all facets of IT. 

  Recently we lost our programmer to a better job, and the powers that be decided having an 'intern' level person to run reports was sufficient. This has caused me to learn a lot of SQL and some PHP  to make things work and tweak/fix things for management. 

Well currently we are getting a new client and they are going to be reporting to us in EBCIDIC a format I am not at all familliar with. while trying to run the test file I have come across these Packed Decimal Formatted fields. I can find a conversion tool in notepad++ for both of them but not all at the same time and not with the formatting.

Is there a tool or add-on for notepad++ that would help me to automate this? 

Thank you in advance"
wcdrc,9,2012-07-10,I am pretty much addicted to opiates (prescription pills) AMA,awayfromhome23,casualiama,https://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/wcdrc/i_am_pretty_much_addicted_to_opiates_prescription/,"I have been using pharms (prescription pills) for the last three years now.  I Started using in April of 2010.  From there I would use about once every week or two, sometimes maybe not even using more then once a month.  Then after about 6 months I was using at least once every two weeks, but more like once every week.  At this point I only needed about 15 - 30 mgs to get a nice buzz.

Starting last summer I had a lot of cash because I was working two jobs.  One job as a caddy where I would make about 140-160 dollars cash a day possibly more thursday - sunday.  The other job I worked as an intern for a small company doing basic coding / programing for there website.  

This is where everything went down hill I ended up buying 150 30 mg roxies.  Which is 30 mg of pure oxycodone very addicting stuff.  I bought this many because i had the money and it was at a big discount since I was buying so many 11.50 per pill instead of 30 dollars per pill.  I figured that between my girlfriend and friends this would last us all the whole summer since we all would use on the weekends at the beach when we would hang out.  Well turns out I ended up eating 15mgs in the morning to help wake up then 15mgs at lunch at work to get me through the day.  I kept this habbit and was using everyday for about 2.5 months.  Stupidly at the time I didn't realize how addicting they were and had No idea why i was getting such bad back pains some days.  Like back pains so bad that I would want to cry.  Now i know that I was with drawing because i wasn't using.  At the time I had no idea.

At about 3 months into last summer I was probably using about 100 mgs a day.  Then I found suboxone and used that for about 1.5 months and I had no idea what the drug really did all i new was that it helped me not use and took my mind off of the drug.  

All it did was make my tolerance higher so when i started using again it cost me more money.  This all lead until February 1st of this year when i stopped.  

I stopped using from feburary 1st of this year until may 23rd of this year.  I quit cold turkey the first 5 days was awful.  I felt so sick I was hot then i was cold then I was hot then I was cold.  NO matter what i did my bodys temperature was so off.  On top of this all I couldn't sleep at all and I would shit diahrear like it was my job.  The pain and sickness lasted a good 5-7 days.  Days 3-5 were so bad that even if days 6 and 7 i still may have been sick i felt healthy because comparably it wasn't even painful.  The worst part was probably though that after all of that I literally didn't sleep for about 3 weeks.  Opiates really screw with your sleeping habits and it causes you to have insomnia.  It was the strangest feeling because it wasn't like I was tired.  It was like I would get tired go to lay down after 30 mins maybe an hour at most lying down not sleeping just lying down I would get energized and be up the whole night.  No exaggeration I think for the first two weeks I maybe had a total of 12-15 hours of sleep.  Week three I maybe would sleep 2 - 3 hours but not much more and then after that I slowly would sleep more and more.  The shits didn't stop though till day 70-75 though.  

Before I left my tolerence was easily 200+ mgs a day and at least 60 mgs to just feel normal.  When I started using again my tolerence was back at like 10 mgs would get me feeling pretty good and 20 mgs great.  Now after about 50 days of use again i need like 45 mgs to get a nice high and today alone have already used 180 mgs.
which is 6 roxies

Ask me anything!

Also I wanted to add that I was 19 yrs old when I started and am now 21.  I live in the tri state area and have to say so many kids my age are in the same situation as me.  If you have a son or daughter in the tri state area and you are middle class I can almost guarantee your kids have taken some kind of prescription drug.  

There is also a chance they could be using a little bit more then just recreationally.  So many of my friends who you would think back a few years ago would never touch a drug are now using prescription pills multiple times a week.  The problem is doctors are prescribing benzos to any girl who claims to have anxiety.  And there are so many dirty doctors out there that kids with ""back pain"" are getting prescriptions for roxies.   Because there are the kids who need the money.  And when they can make 2000 dollars + a month by lying to a doctor about back pain its a no brainer and none of these kids think about the consequences of getting caught because they all think I can't get caught.  And then on the other side is the rich kids who parents give them as much money as they want so even at 20 dollars a pill they can afford it.

I've seen many kids start doing drugs by taking prescription pills.  Because pharms seem clean to them and they know the drug is from a legit source so they have nothing to worry about like it being laced or fake.  Then from there they realize how good drugs are and start smoking weed to enhance to effects and from there more and more drugs.  

As well pretty much everyone using is in some way also pushing / selling the drugs.  What I mean by this is say someone picks up 20 30 mgs pills for 20 dollars each.  When they go to give them to there three other friends they sell the pills for 30 each.  This way they bought there 5 pills for 100 dollars, but then sell 15 they bought for 300 at 30 each selling them for 450 meaning they make 150 dollars off there friends that easily.  Then they have 5 pills for free and 50 extra dollars.  Its called being a middle man and everyone involved does this in some way when they can.

Ive got myself a summer internship and I was thinking about investing the money i will make into the stock market. I have a particular company in mind that i think is really going to do well in the future. I want to invest now so possibly I can make lots of moneys when im older.

I was thinkin id take a couple thousand of the money Im makin this summer and buy as many shares as that will get me of this company. I figure id hold on to it for awhile and maybe in a few years ill make some decent cash out of it (better then if i left it in a bank), or maybe ill just buy more shares. My logic is ""wow everyone loves apple, I would be willing to bet they come out with some crazy new product / everyone will be spending money on their products somehow that their stocks are going to go up."" Apple isnt really the company im lookin at but its the same idea. ""this company is going to be huge, everyone will buy what they are selling, i buy stock now, 10 yrs go by, ????, profit."" 

It be like when the TV was first invented and all of a sudden there is this new company called NBC. I think theyre gonna be huge so i decide to buy stock. next thing you know everyone watches NBC and im rich

What do i need to know before I go along with this plan and is it worth it if im only getting $2000 worth of shares. AND is my logic for buying this stock good or clearly coming from someone who has no idea how the stock market works.

Thanks guys"

You see, I am a twenty year old college student serving an internship at an investment banker in New York, and I have got it in my head to get something in the works so that I am not sitting here idly watching others suffer. No, I'm not looking to blindly convert people to my beliefs. I believe that every person should be given all sides of the matter to make up their own minds. 

What I would like to do, or at least set in motion, is a system of helping those who are down on their luck on a personal and physical level. To be a friend for those without. To help fiscally when possible. Spiritually when asked. 

Moving here to the big city, having never been exposed to the homeless population, honestly broke my heart, and it is with them that I want to start, then branch out to anyone and everyone that would ask or need. I understand that there are places that provide soup and a place to sleep at times, but I frankly don't trust many of these faceless charities, even the churches. I am working on a plan using what I have been learning since I've been here about the market, finance, accounting etc. for a completely transparent group that keeps a public record of every dollar spent, and each dollar's origin if need be. I will be using what resources I have to fund whatever I can, which honestly isn't much after I pay off my rent and put food in my own mouth, but that will change as time goes on.

I'm not asking for anything just yet, but I would like to know if you guys would be willing to work with me on this when I get everything together. Looking past the semi-constant bashing of religious folk that I've seen, I've come across so many of you who are as generous and loving, if not more so, than so many of the people who claim to hold to a religious doctrine.

This is a little depressing as I really start to question my intelligence and personallity.

 I am a shy person and I don't talk to other peoples unless I have to but I try to ask enough questions to be able to get the job done. Should I even list my two former 3 month jobs in my resume considering they were not even internships?

I had a really hard time finding a site to take me because of the requirements for my masters and if I don't get my background check in so I can start at the end of the week I'm pretty much screwed.  When I imagined everything was going to work out with the internship things seemed doable, I'm due in February, but I could get some extra hours in before then and just finish up after possibly have to do some in the summer.  Then we'd just have between February and summer where money was tight until I found a job in my field.  The site I found even has a high placement rate after internship.  

Now if I don't get to start my internship, because of the way my program works, I'd have to wait an entire year before doing my year of internship.  

On top of all this, I paid almost $6000 for this summer session, and if I have to drop the internship that will be $6000 for two classes- a waste!

If I have to wait for my internship I'm not sure how we're going to be able to do it.  The internship requires so many hours that I'd only be able to work very very part time while doing it.  My husband works, but with baby I don't know how we can do it for a year on one income.  I'm so frustrated and anxious and worried.  Not to mention the letter from my department head saying I had till the end of the week to start my internship was kind of rude, and saying that you know we've had since January so it's our own faults(those of us who had trouble securing internship sites) that we haven't been able to secure a site.  Nobody around me was either taking interns or had the appropriate qualifications to supervise me.  The site I found is almost an hours drive, and it's not coming together quickly enough!

wbwge,1,2012-07-10,Incongruities between SAS and R implementing MDS ,woodyallin,statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/wbwge/incongruities_between_sas_and_r_implementing_mds/,"I'm an intern at a lab this summer and we have a problem. 

I have an interval similarity matrix (numbers between 0 and 1) and want to do MDS on this data.

I'm more familiar with R so I'll go from there.  

I found the Euclidean distances between pairs using dist() and then did metric MDS analysis using the cmdscale() function. 
This was the exact function: cmdscale(dist.matrix, k=2)

Now someone else in my lab took the same data and did metric MDS in SAS (I am not familiar with the exact methods). This is what the SAS output looks like:
&gt;Shape=TRIANGLE
&gt;Condition=MATRIX
&gt;Level=ABSOLUTE
&gt;Coef=IDENTITY
&gt;FORMULA=1
&gt;FIT=1
&gt;DIMENSION=2


The two sets of coordinates are different. 

What is going on here? Could it be that R and SAS use different ways to implement MDS? 

I tried reading the documentation, but I couldn't find anything that I didn't already know.

Thanks a lot!"

Another company has interns there as well. I met this girl there from Ireland.  She's wonderful and as a group we've gone camping and on trips to the city and I've been enjoying showing her everything American.  This past weekend we went camping and there was a guy much more attractive than myself, a nice guy that you hate because you can't even hate him, garnering a lot if her attention. However, Irish girl used the word just friends in regards to him when someone asked (not me) . 

Sunday I mentioned I was headed home to see my parents and get a home cooked meal. I realized she wont see her home until Christmas so I invited her along. She enjoyed the meal, and we went out for a drive in my dad's old muscle car to a nice local park. Chatted a lot and then headed back to the dorms after a bit of desert. I thought for sure I'd laid the groundwork and was going to ask her out in the next couple days.  

However nice guy hung in the back of my mind so I asked her friend if I was on the right track. She warned me not to as Irish girl was after someone else. I moped for a long time after that yesterday

But today, I question that. Perhaps a chance taken is.better than one passed. What do you all think? Am I at risk to let something pass me by or am I running into a brick wall? 

**UPDATE ** I did it she smiled at me and very carefully said she'd rather be friends. I said that was fine and actually I'm feeling way better about it. The anxiety is gone and I'm not sad like I was yesterday, just a little disappointed"

wbe8w,2,2012-07-10,D3,nickypoobrown,subredditofthedead,https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditofthedead/comments/wbe8w/d3/,"[D1](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditofthedead/comments/w7oks/d1/), [D2](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditofthedead/comments/w9a6g/d2/)

Odd day today.

A little background first.  I work at a brewery. Calm the fuck down...I'm not getting you free beer.  I only get a few shift drinks myself, the rest is just ""quality assurance"".  Today was a little bit of a shit-show.  My hydrometer broke, (It measures the amount of sugar in the liquid and you can use that to figure out how much alcohol will be in the beer), and I didn't have the yeast I needed.  There's a home-brew shop close to me so I told my intern to keep an eye on things while I biked over to pick up some shit.  (I love having interns, they work for beer and will do the worst jobs, all with a shit eating grin)  

This, however, is where my day got fucked.  On the way to the home-brew shop I almost got hit by a car.  I'm a pretty cautious biker.  I not a rule Nazi, but I spent the last 5 years biking in NYC before moving out to Colorado, so I know how to bike safely in traffic, albeit aggressively. This sum-bitch tried his best to left-hook me.  I swerved around him, almost casually, flipped him the bird, and mentioned a few derogatory things I had heard about his mom.  I also managed to overshoot my turn and plow, full speed, over the curb.  Well, 86 the front wheel, the fork, frame, and any sense of self righteousness I had garnered from telling a stranger to fuck off.  I landed, thankfully, on my beer swollen ass.

This is where it got weird.  I just sat there for a minute, trying to collect my thought, analyze what just happened, and sweep up the shards of my self esteem.  The fatty running toward me, however, was not in such a contemplative mood.  Think about Jon Goodman (I know, I'm sorry).  Imagine what he would be like if Rosanne didn't feed him for 2 weeks.  Imagine you smell like malted barley, hops, and vanilla (my wife's body wash, I can't help but use it, it smells amazing).  

Anyway, I look up to see 300 lb of pale, sweaty, clammy man running right at me; giving me the crazy eyes all the while.  

I don't know what other people do in this situation, but I promptly proceeded to cry.  I don't mean sobbing like a girl who just got dumped for the slutty emo chick.  I mean screaming in a pitch to high for dogs to hear while evacuating your bowels.  It was like that scene in the ""Enter Sandman"" video with the kid running from the Mac Truck.  I know a million thought flashed through my head.  The two I remember are; ""I didn't say ""I love you"" to my wife today."" and ""This is a shitty way to die.""  

I had resigned myself to the fact that this fat fucking asshole was going to kill me.  I was barely going to put up a fight.  WTF!!!

I was so preoccupied with my eminent death that I barely registered the cop asking me if I was alright.  Apparently he had been chasing Fatty McFatness over an assault complaint a few blocks away.  He managed to get close enough to use his [taser](http://hotword.dictionary.com/taser/) {TIL} to bring down the Goliath mere inches from me and my bike.  

I stared at this asshole, the fatty, not the cop, (although I understand the confusion), for a solid two minutes until I realized why he scared me so much.  He was missing an eye.  Not really just an eye, but his left eye, left temple, and left ear.  

He had been shot already!!!

The cop had shot him once in the head.  The motherfucker kept going though.  Praise the FSM that the cop realized he could take him down by incapacitating the muscles, if the fat fuck had any.     

Right after, about 10  more pigs swarmed the scene and beat the shit out of Fatstuff McEatsalot.  

I didn't stick around.  

There was a brewery less then a block away. (Thank you Fort Collins) and I proceeded to drink away the panic.  There is now a thick layer of fog between me and my emotions.  

I'm going to buy a new bike tomorrow.  I want to get a mountain bike.  The wife and I have been talking about doing more outdoor activities.  Anyway....

Just sharing and drinking,
Cheers,
Nickypoo B.  "

My contract doesn't specify an end date and I was expected to intern for 3-5 months. Flash forward to today, I'm still interning. 

With a Monday to Friday work schedule, I intern 3 days a week.  I work at a private medical clinic as a Medical Clerk on the other 2 days (I've had this job since 2nd year of college). Technically, if you count the days I intern, it would be about 7 months. 

I'm not too keen about getting a full time because I will work as long as the intern company wants me to. Job hunting is tough so I'd like to avoid it. However, it would be great to be offered a full time status. I'm more worried about how my resume would look to have an internship exceeding 6 months. Please advise."

How about a map that is a huge city, an example of what I mean would be something like Grand Theft Auto kind of set up, but the size of Cheranus. The outskirts of the city would be suburbs, and the inner city would be industrial/corporate. It could also be based on an island, similarly to Manhattan in New York, but of course any bridges leading to the main land are blown up. But perhaps something can be done where players can reach the mainland via a boat to reach military bases set up outside the island to attempt to contain the infection. There are a lot of things that you could do with an environment like this, including making a subway system underground that players can explore, all the way up to 100 floor skyscrapers crawling with the undead interns that used to make up it's existence.

Here's a quick mop-up of what I'm trying to explain here (Sorry I'm not an artist)

http://i.imgur.com/bnuj9.png

The first image would be the outside area
The second image would be the subway system if it were to be implemented, as rocket has said, he is looking to implement underground play.

I believe an urban environment on this scale, would be a thrilling addition to DayZ, and I'm sure people will agree.

I have submitted it to the DayZ forums, if you could drop a comment to help get this noticed, that would be fantastic!

wesuj,0,2012-07-11,An Articulated Defense of the Penny Arcade Kickstarter (x-post from truegaming),LinesOpen,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/wesuj/an_articulated_defense_of_the_penny_arcade/,"*Disclaimer: I am in no way affiliated with PA, and I have donated already to the Kickstarter. I am simply an artist interested in supporting art with donations, and have been pleasantly surprised to find that Penny Arcade agrees with me.*

**1) The rewards are shit. (see further: $500 retweets, $7,500 internship)**
A: The reward is unadulterated Penny Arcade comics for a year plus additional comics as made possible by swapping advertising for donations. They mention on the KS page the possibilities that come out of this, including art in the RSS feed, switching to the Creative Commons license, allowing first/third party apps, and other uses they haven't yet envisioned.

I do agree that the actual reward tiers are sparse, but the content you're receiving is in large part the comics. The more goods they have to give, the more they shave off the rest of the business model.

**2) Related to number one--how is this an actual project? They are a business.**
A: The project is to continue making regular PA comics while adding additional comics (more Automata, more Lookouts, etc.). Part of this is a framing problem--they made it about the ads because that's where the dollars come from, but the dollars allow them the time to produce the comics. Should the dollars come from donations, then the adverts go and (more) comics are produced.

**3) Related to number two--how does this fulfill the other KS guidelines?**
A: Well 2 is easy, because they're producing comics. They still need to work and pay people to produce a comic in 2013, and that's what the KS is for. As for 3, it's not a charity nor a life project because they are a business. They are simply a business changing their funding model and are using Kickstarter because it's easy, recognizable, and streamlined.

Further, they're effing guidelines. Maybe the PA shine convinced Kickstarter when doubts arose, or maybe PA made good arguments about how the project will be presented / completed. Gabe has tweeted it's all within the KS parameters, you guys have your doubts, fin. Perhaps KS can shed more light on this for us?

The former CTO of Kickstarter says this:

&gt; To me, it feels like the next logical step in the evolution of fan funding. Already, fans are expecting to witness the creative process with behind-the-scenes progress updates and feedback forums. Now, they may actually help decide what gets made. If I'm right, the implications for working artists is potentially huge, providing an unexpected source of revenue, as well as potential creative headaches. [source](http://www.theverge.com/gaming/2012/7/11/3151088/penny-arcade-kickstarter)

**3b) That [one complaint.](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/i9022m)**

Subpoint 1: Supporting the entire PA brand and therefore isn't a comics endeavor? Incorrect. Their KS page specifically says that things like PAX and PATV will maintain their current advertiser partners. [source](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/575109064/penny-arcade-sells-out#WillThisRemoAdsFromThePaxSiteParOrPatv) Therefore it's not for the PA brand but for the PA comic and the website through which it is provided.

Subpoint 2: She says the guidelines prohibit creators from paying salaries and rent, and she classifies those as maintenance, but that's rather silly because if you aren't allowed to pay people with money earned from a KS, then what's the money for? You're always paying bills, whether it be production costs, actor salaries, technical equipment.

Subpoint 3: Having lunch with the creators is a pretty standard KS goal that you see on a lot of projects. I picked this one at random, but [here, for $2,500](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/anomalisa/charlie-kaufmans-anomalisa) you can talk to one of three famous people over Skype for 20 minutes.

**4) Why is PA doing this through Kickstarter, and not their own infrastructure?**
A: This one I can't fully explain; Gabe tweeted [""because this is our first try at it and KS is a trusted name.""](https://twitter.com/cwgabriel/status/222730179116670976) Not a superb reason, but I suppose it makes sense as an easy gambit. They haven't wasted any time/money into setting up a new donation system if it fails. Low risk, high ceiling. Gabe also said: [""if it works then yes I can see moving it in house next year.""](https://twitter.com/cwgabriel/status/223042942791729152)

Also, from the KS page:

&gt; Their [Kickstarter's] Pledge system streamlines this process considerably. It's also incredibly transparent, with a bright green bar that goes up in real time so you can see what is happening. [source](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/575109064/penny-arcade-sells-out#WhyKickWhyAreYouStarWithTheKick)

**5) It is a cash grab, and they are greedy.**
A: As opposed to taking checks from advertisers? They have 14 employees and numerous upkeep costs in order to produce all the content they currently make (and plan to make in 2013 should this go ahead). $1 million dollars is not a lot when you consider salaries for 14 employees, office rent and utilities, health care, backend, etc.

**6) But all the excess money will go into their pockets!**
A: Incorrect, they explicitly state on the KS page that any money over $1.4 million will roll over for 2014. [source](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/575109064/penny-arcade-sells-out#WhatHappIfYouRaisMoreThanYourAsk)

**6b) They don't need the money!**
A: Because they have advertisers. What if they didn't?

**7) Why should I pay to get rid of ads? I'm happy with the way things are now.**
A: Fine! Then don't pay anything towards the KS. Wonderful, right? Except a lot of readers are interested in turning Penny Arcade into something more like NPR and less like a newspaper comic. I would rather that Gabe &amp; Tycho are beholden only to the audience, not the audience and advertisers. As Tycho puts it in the Verge article:

&gt; ""We have Patrons [advertisers] and in exchange for their Patronage we grant them consideration on the site. To my mind, and I recognize that this has a philosophical aspect to it, it matters a great deal who the Patron is. Where I'd love to be on your map is making comics! The model is up to the readership at this point."" [source](http://www.theverge.com/gaming/2012/7/11/3151088/penny-arcade-kickstarter)

Changing to donations allows them to focus entirely on content (and their relationship with us, the audience). A quick exchange from twitter is apropos here:

&gt; ‏**@cwgabriel** 
@TheClowbog this particular scenario including a year of PA strips, no ads, other creative work will not happen without KS.

&gt; **‏@TheClowbog** 
@cwgabriel If you can make the extra work happen with the KS money, which is replacing the ad revenue, then you can make it with the ad $.

&gt; **@cwgabriel** 
@TheClowbog but right now the extra work is for publishers I'd rather it be for fans.

**8) OK that's great, but why not go with membership accounts instead? Like premium members, or whatever.**
A: I can't say as to their reasoning for avoiding the membership model (although this one seems easier to implement). One could argue that there is a democratic aspect to this process--if enough people vote for the change, we all experience the change. Next year, maybe more people will vote for donation model? Once they see it in action. Or maybe less will and they'll go back to advertisers.

**9) Do advertisers really change much of the final product?**
A: From Gabe's twitter feed--

&gt; ""Advertisers have been good to us but we have to fight hard to keep it that way. These days they want more and more. video ads and pop ups.""

&gt; ""yes advertisers have tried to influence us in the past. Some have gotten angry when we lay into them in a comic. we can deal with it but...""

&gt; ""it would be cool if we could avoid it all together""

&gt; ""I agree that we've done a great job with our ads. But if we didn't have to worry about ""page views"" we can do all kinds of cool stuff.""

Primarily what you need to understand is that the advertising model sucks up their time. I can't say how much time is takes, but clearly some. By funding PA through donations, you alleviate them of that timesuck and allow them to create more original content, not irrelevant Rainbox Six comics.

**10) How will I find out about cool games now??**
A: They will still mention them in their news posts. [source](https://twitter.com/cwgabriel/status/222711460365729793)

**11) From a redditor--""Kickstarter is a place to go to start something or keep something alive, and neither of those reasons apply to this.""**
A: This is true. They are trying to alter funding models. I find that worthwhile.

**12) From another redditor--""What if it wasn't Penny Arcade? Would you be willing to donate to say IGN or GameSpot to go ad free for a year?""**
A: Gamespot is owned by CBS and IGN is owned by News Corp, whereas Penny Arcade is owned by Penny Arcade Inc, the people who create the content. There is a mild difference.

**13) Ad Block Plus.**
A: How is that keeping Penny Arcade afloat?

*Further reading (cited above): [How Penny Arcade wants to reinvent patronage with Kickstarter](http://www.theverge.com/gaming/2012/7/11/3151088/penny-arcade-kickstarter)*

**TL;DR, my opinion:** I think they should have structured it differently. Centered it around the additional content--say Lookouts as a primary goal. The advertisement removal could have been in stretch goals. But I still entirely support their mission &amp; philosophy."

A: Incorrect, they explicitly state on the KS page that any money over $1.4 million will roll over for 2014. [source](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/575109064/penny-arcade-sells-out#WhatHappIfYouRaisMoreThanYourAsk)

**6b) They don't need the money!**
A: Because they have advertisers. What if they didn't?

**7) Why should I pay to get rid of ads? I'm happy with the way things are now.**
A: Fine! Then don't pay anything towards the KS. Wonderful, right? Except a lot of readers are interested in turning Penny Arcade into something more like NPR and less like a newspaper comic. I would rather that Gabe &amp; Tycho are beholden only to the audience, not the audience and advertisers. As Tycho puts it in the Verge article:

&gt; ""We have Patrons [advertisers] and in exchange for their Patronage we grant them consideration on the site. To my mind, and I recognize that this has a philosophical aspect to it, it matters a great deal who the Patron is. Where I'd love to be on your map is making comics! The model is up to the readership at this point."" [source](http://www.theverge.com/gaming/2012/7/11/3151088/penny-arcade-kickstarter)

Changing to donations allows them to focus entirely on content (and their relationship with us, the audience). A quick exchange from twitter is apropos here:

&gt; ‏**@cwgabriel** 
@TheClowbog this particular scenario including a year of PA strips, no ads, other creative work will not happen without KS.

&gt; **‏@TheClowbog** 
@cwgabriel If you can make the extra work happen with the KS money, which is replacing the ad revenue, then you can make it with the ad $.

&gt; **@cwgabriel** 
@TheClowbog but right now the extra work is for publishers I'd rather it be for fans.

**8) OK that's great, but why not go with membership accounts instead? Like premium members, or whatever.**
A: I can't say as to their reasoning for avoiding the membership model (although this one seems easier to implement). One could argue that there is a democratic aspect to this process--if enough people vote for the change, we all experience the change. Next year, maybe more people will vote for donation model? Once they see it in action. Or maybe less will and they'll go back to advertisers.

**9) Do advertisers really change much of the final product?**
A: From Gabe's twitter feed--

&gt; ""Advertisers have been good to us but we have to fight hard to keep it that way. These days they want more and more. video ads and pop ups.""

&gt; ""yes advertisers have tried to influence us in the past. Some have gotten angry when we lay into them in a comic. we can deal with it but...""

&gt; ""it would be cool if we could avoid it all together""

&gt; ""I agree that we've done a great job with our ads. But if we didn't have to worry about ""page views"" we can do all kinds of cool stuff.""

Primarily what you need to understand is that the advertising model sucks up their time. I can't say how much time is takes, but clearly some. By funding PA through donations, you alleviate them of that timesuck and allow them to create more original content, not irrelevant Rainbox Six comics.

**10) How will I find out about cool games now??**
A: They will still mention them in their news posts. [source](https://twitter.com/cwgabriel/status/222711460365729793)

**11) From a redditor--""Kickstarter is a place to go to start something or keep something alive, and neither of those reasons apply to this.""**
A: This is true. They are trying to alter funding models. I find that worthwhile.

**12) From another redditor--""What if it wasn't Penny Arcade? Would you be willing to donate to say IGN or GameSpot to go ad free for a year?""**
A: Gamespot is owned by CBS and IGN is owned by News Corp, whereas Penny Arcade is owned by Penny Arcade Inc, the people who create the content. There is a mild difference.

**13) Ad Block Plus.**
A: How is that keeping Penny Arcade afloat?

*Further reading (cited above): [How Penny Arcade wants to reinvent patronage with Kickstarter](http://www.theverge.com/gaming/2012/7/11/3151088/penny-arcade-kickstarter)*

**TL;DR, my opinion:** I think they should have structured it differently. Centered it around the additional content--say Lookouts as a primary goal. The advertisement removal could have been in stretch goals. But I still entirely support their mission &amp; philosophy."

I'll go first...",temp_is_risin93,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wef2h/reddit_whats_the_most_angry_youve_ever_been_and/,"So today started slowly, with me waking up around 7AM and heading into my Electrical Engineering internship. I had planned to leave early around 12 noon to head on over to a hangout with some high school friends (I've just graduated this year).

At about 9AM, I went up to my boss and told him that I wanted to leave work early. He asked, ""You doin' anything fun?""

I responded with, ""I'm going to a party."" 

""Well have fun then,"" he said as I headed back to my desk.

As 12AM approached, I started getting a feeling of impending doom, because just one week earlier I had planned to go on a trip to the Sand Dunes in Michigan with some friends, but, unfortunately, a storm hit last Sunday, and our trip was cancelled.

That wasn't the problem though. The real problem was the communication between myself (a guy) and a ""friend,"" who happened to be a girl. She has a boyfriend, which is my only guess as to why she never responded to my messages leading up to our scheduled departure time. She left me hanging like a broken doorknob waiting to be fixed. To make things worse, I got wind that she actually ended up going without me later in the week. Feels pretty damn bad, man.

As you've probably guessed already, when I left my internship to go over another girl's house for the ""hangout"" at 12AM and finally arrived at her house for the ""hangout's"" scheduled starting time of 1PM, not a soul was at home. Mind you, I had messaged her the night before to confirm the party's starting time, and whether or not it was still planned to go on. On her empty doorstep I messaged her saying, ""You're not at home, are you? Thanks for wasting my time and money."" (Because I could still be at work still making money as I type THIS!) 


On my way home, driving past my old high school, adrenaline started coursing through my blood, and I floored it!!! I zoomed dangerously in my dad's 2008 Cadillac CTS at 60 mph in a 35, and I honestly didn't care if I had endangered anyone. I haven't been this mad in FOUR YEARS.

**tl;dr Immature youth of my age bracket don't understand the value of another person's time. They also don't understand what it means to keep one's word.**

My campus in France is really huge, with a lot of pretty places to cultivate, and with some friends we decided to create a community garden in some abandonned research place (photo : http://imgur.com/a/IwDwA). As you can see, there are some pools which are going to be useful to collect water.
The administration at the University agreed to this and even offered to pay us some tools. We also have some money from the town because the gardens will be opened to everyone.
What do you think we could do with this surface ? We've got some ideas already : 
- going to use the pools to gather water
- you can see a crumbling shelter on the left, we hope to be able to build it back
- we are in a big University so we are going to try to reach a lot of people with animations on how to plant and cultivate
- in the upper right corner, there are some old sunhouses, which we are perhaps going to use
- there is a bunch of beech (the green square on the left of the second terrace). We are going to cut some to make some props and the remaining will give us some shadow.

For now, the place is overwhelmed with high grasses and brambles and it is the holidays here so there is no one but me in the University (the joy of a long internship), but on september we are going to begin the work.

So, tell me what you think about this whole thing, and if you've got advices or ideas you would like to discuss, don't hesitate !

I was forced to start looking at my own mortality, my own existence on Earth. It was a heavy time. In the middle of all this, a Redditor inadvertently directed me to this poem:
  
  
Aubade by Philip Larkin  


I work all day, and get half-drunk at night.  
Waking at four to soundless dark, I stare.  
In time the curtain-edges will grow light.  
Till then I see what's really always there:  
Unresting death, a whole day nearer now,  
Making all thought impossible but how  
And where and when I shall myself die.  
Arid interrogation: yet the dread  
Of dying, and being dead,  
Flashes afresh to hold and horrify.  
The mind blanks at the glare. Not in remorse  
- The good not done, the love not given, time  
Torn off unused - nor wretchedly because  
An only life can take so long to climb  
Clear of its wrong beginnings, and may never;  
But at the total emptiness for ever,  
The sure extinction that we travel to  
And shall be lost in always. Not to be here,  
Not to be anywhere,  
And soon; nothing more terrible, nothing more true.  
  
  
This is a special way of being afraid  
No trick dispels. Religion used to try,  
That vast, moth-eaten musical brocade  
Created to pretend we never die,  
And specious stuff that says No rational being  
Can fear a thing it will not feel, not seeing  
That this is what we fear - no sight, no sound,  
No touch or taste or smell, nothing to think with,  
Nothing to love or link with,  
The anasthetic from which none come round.  
  

And so it stays just on the edge of vision,  
A small, unfocused blur, a standing chill  
That slows each impulse down to indecision.  
Most things may never happen: this one will,  
And realisation of it rages out  
In furnace-fear when we are caught without  
People or drink. Courage is no good:  
It means not scaring others. Being brave  
Lets no one off the grave.  
Death is no different whined at than withstood.  
  

Slowly light strengthens, and the room takes shape.  
It stands plain as a wardrobe, what we know,  
Have always known, know that we can't escape,  
Yet can't accept. One side will have to go.  
Meanwhile telephones crouch, getting ready to ring  
In locked-up offices, and all the uncaring  
Intricate rented world begins to rouse.  
The sky is white as clay, with no sun.  
Work has to be done.  
Postmen like doctors go from house to house.
  
It's hard to describe how much meaning this poem has for me, but I'll just say it meant a lot that there was someone out there who felt the same things I did and was able to write them so beautifully and succinctly.  

So, please share! Happy, sad, whatever. I'd love to see some poems that have meaning for you, Redditors, and maybe an explanation of why you love them.

Ill Start",SOLUNAR,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wdzsi/employed_redditors_what_are_some_tips_you_can/,"I graduated with a double Major in Management and Finance, i can tell you that Management is a bit of a broad major and if you plan on doing so, i would highly suggest finding a concentration. Its not going to be as easy as getting a management role because of your degree.

For my Finance peers, i would suggest learning basic software ( although this is a bit of a duh..... i often see people with little to no skills ). I would recommend learning Excel in and out, no matter what type of business you go into, Excel is a great thing to know, it can be used for almost any type of office task and can land you a job.

I always like to ask friends in college, ""what do you want to do when you graduate? Where would you like to work?"" , if they are not sure about it, i can tell they might have a tough time. I would suggest reading up on careers you find interesting, and start learning what type of knowledge you will need, its surprising but, Youtube tutorials can prepare you for an interview if you know what to search.


If you want to get into Investment Banking, or Wall-Street, its often suggested you look for an internship as early as sophomore year. As many of the hot shot firms will only hire from their internship programs, i found this out the hard way.


Most importantly, please figure out what the jobs available to your major are, and start aligning your skill sets for those jobs. You might want to start thinking of getting series licenses if you want to go into investing.


Good luck to everyone!"

Ok, so I need your help. For the last two months I've been trying to get a job in luxembourg with no success (trying from my country via internet). I am a new IT graduate and Im trying to find a developer job in the city, but after two months of failure I would settle with almost any IT related job. Problem is that I dont speak french nor german, and I have no job experience at all. Consequently the only jobs I could possibly apply to are internships, but there are few IT internships in luxembourg and most of them require that you are a student, which I am not anymore :(

After two months of searching and sending applications to virtually every job offer I have seen in jobs.lu and indeed.com I have only done two job interviews and miserably failed in both of them. I am kind of dissapointed and pessimistic right now, but I have an amazing girl waiting for me in Luxembourg, and that's making me try once and again.

Could you help me guys? Do you know any company which could be off the radar where I could find a job? Do you know if someone like me could fit in the companies where you work? Do you think that I could be more successful if I move to luxembourg and try to find a job there? Do you know of something that I could write in my CV which employers value over there?

So, I've been having a dry spell for a year and it's really bad. I've been wanting to end it so I began reading this sub. If you guys can help me, I would greatly appreciate it. I really need to something about this ASAP because its getting me down and distracted from what I should be doing. 

So I got home from college a week ago and started an internship right away. On my second day I notice a HB8.5 in the office. I constantly see her as we work in the same room but for different departments and I am attracted to her. Ive spoken to her a few times about nothing but no real introduction has taken place. I have made a good reputation for myself already in the office and am relatively outgoing at work. 

Today we had an event outside of the office. She was in a stunning dress and I was in a nice suit so I got the confidence to go talk to her. She was with a two of her friends and I just walk up to them and say ""excuse me, do you guys actually do anything? I see you 3 around the office but I havent seen any of you do work"" Her friend HB8 steps in starts defending herself and I keep picking on her. The girl I like and her other friend are laughing a lot. I introduce myself to all of them then say ""I have to leave because I actually do work"" .

It was 102 degrees today and everything was outside so after we finished the event I crossed the street and bought my co workers water from the super market. I walk up to HB8.5 and say ""hey, you thirsty"" and she responds ""yes"" so I hand her water. ""Oh my god, are you being nice to me"" ""yeah, i felt bad and got you water because doing nothing is very difficult"" she starts laughing. At first she doesnt believe me and thinks my boss bought it. After I tell her I actually got it, she asks me to call her by her nick name from now on. Im usually a really nice guy but she doesnt know that. I spoke to her a few more times througout the day making her laugh but didnt see her when I left. 

I will see her tomorrow morning, what should be my next step? I know she has a week and a half left in the office so how can I escalate quickly?

Recently decided that I don't want to be an engineer anymore. While I do really well in school (3.8 gpa) I don't feel that it's because I am a good engineer or have strong interest, but because I've simply learned how to get good grades efficiently (absorbing information and regurgitating it). 


I feel like I have been disillusioned as far as what real world engineering is actually like. I've had several internships in all kinds of companies and have come to realize that I hate it. It's all business and money games. And I don't really have to drive to go to graduate school and do real technical engineering. 


While there are parts of engineering school that I like, for example I sometimes enjoy grinding out complex calculations -- dicking with equations and computer programs when there is a clear goal -- but in reality it is just a lot of ambiguity and dealing with people and going to meetings and phone calls and excel spreadsheets and endless powerpoints just to find some cheap company in China that will manufacture a boring pointless piece of equipment.


Anyone out there going through/have gone through similar frustrations?"
wdd03,6,2012-07-11,Structured Conversation vs. Unstructured Conversation,frisco_peaks,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/wdd03/structured_conversation_vs_unstructured/,"Hi Seddit, 

I'm a 25 year old newbie but been hitting the books/streets. 

One of the sticking point I have been thinking about is, what Tyler Durden from 'RSD Blueprint' DVD calls ""situational confidence"" and it drives me nuts. 

Basically, he says that any bartender in his bar or the Denny's manager could pull easily, flirt and hook up with the girls working in those environments because these guys have already a natural rapport given their situational status but as soon as they are put into a outside environment, like at another party, they become just another chode chugging their drink. 

I think most guys can relate to this as I have had experiences in college as an RA addressing the impressionable freshmen, at work as a senior employee addressing the interns - you can feel the swagger just swimming in your veins or if you are at the club with some crazy female friend rubbing you up and down, and afterwards you somehow feel like you gotta the magical penny and now seems like every girl in the club got that glassy-eye look at you. 

I think this is the reason why most guys want to be i-bankers/doctors, be in frat or be in some kind of high-society yuppie social circle evident in facebook newsfeed but this is not what I want! Because it's a golden-handcuff. I want to be able to walk into any situation, keep my cool, try my best and keep my cool after crash-n-burn and keep on trucking onto the next set/day/routine and get better. 

This is what I want is to get better in unstructured environments because I find it so easy to talk to people when you are associated by work, alumni association or some kind of meetup interest group but it's so much harder when it's out on the street or just in the club. You guys have any tips on approaching women sarging solo, out on the street? Do you think of something observational about your mutual environment to say to start the conversation or do you just go for the direct opener and say ""hey, I saw you and you look like a pretty cool person and want to talk to you"" and what is your mindset before and after a crash n' burn because lines aren't important, it's how you come across that matters.

wdbdd,5,2012-07-11,This is a rant (very long),[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/wdbdd/this_is_a_rant_very_long/,"So this is just a rant...which is why I'm posting it here instead of on /r/mmfb.

My family was poor when I was younger, all living in a one room apartment, parents always fighting, dad addicted to gambling, etc. I don't remember much. My family moved a lot, and by the time I was 7, I had moved 6 times. My first memory with my dad in it is him yelling at me when I was 7, calling me a piece of shit repeatedly (I had been playing with the seatbelt. It's weird because I ask what it means later on, and he gets angry at me for saying a bad word.). In the next memory, I am still 7, but this time, he's flipping the dinner table onto me. I remember I used to stay up late every night, wait for him to come home, and fall asleep to the sound of my parents fighting. My mom was always yelling and hitting my dad, while he just kind of ignored her and asked me how my day was with the same exhausted look every day. My mom told my sister and me horror stories about my dad whenever he wasn't around, so we grew not to like him, my sister REALLY hated him. I...was afraid he'd leave us if everyone was so mean to him, so I was as nice as I could be (I regret this, I'll explain why later). We'd talk sometimes after fights, and he'd always pat my head and thank me.

I lived in Korea until I was 8. That time is a blur. Most nights were the same. Trying to sleep while parents screamed at each other in the other room. Comforting my dad and mom, getting yelled at by teachers for crying, yelled at by my mom for comforting my dad. Sometimes, my sister would come into my room and we'd sit against the wall, listening to the muffled screaming from the room next to us. We wouldn't really say anything, we'd just sit there. Sometimes, one of us would sniffle, but nothing really. I went into her room sometimes too. I suppose we just wanted someone to endure the fighting with.

Japan. I moved there when I was 8, and finished elementary school there. I hated it. I was always bullied, getting beat up, etc. I got sent home early a couple times for violence. I broke someone's hip once. Lot of humiliation and shame. I cut myself once, didn't see the point in it and never did it again. I entertained thoughts of suicide and murder (I guess teenage angst kicked in REALLY early?) I HATED life. A lot of little things happened. My bike was destroyed by a bunch of older kids, they denied it and I got in trouble for destroying my bike. They broke more of my toys, and stole some others. Once I had a rubber snake outside, and they saw it. They took it and held me down while they whipped me with it. I cried a lot. When I got home, I lied and said I lost it; more screaming. We lived in a 3-story townhouse (never again). My father was always making me run up and down them to do pointless tasks (fetch this, fetch that, help me get off my bed because I'm lazy). He'd often make me run up three flights of stairs to hand him something from his nightstand. 

Continuation of parental fighting. Fast forward to the age of 10. I call my dad's boss's daughter a ""shit"" (a word I'd learned from my father some years ago). She tells her mom, who tells my mom, who summons me home and proceeds to yell and beat me for 2 hours with her hands and various stick-shaped instruments. It probably wouldn't have gone on so long, but I started laughing 40 minutes in. I remember looking at the clock wondering how much longer it would last. I desperately tried to think of something funny to take my mind off the pain, and thought of some stupid ice cream joke. I can't even remember what it was, but it must have been pretty damn funny, because I laughed uncontrollably for the next hour. I simultaneously choked back tears and peals of laughter. My mom hit me all the while screaming, ""WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?! STOP LAUGHING?!"" in Korean. I couldn't stop. It was terrible. Try as I might, I couldn't. Eventually, she says, ""Well, your dad will be able to make you stop laughing, he'll be home soon."" The mere thought of that was able to make me stop. We waited in silence for a few minutes, and the door opened. Without even taking off his shoes, he strode towards me, his eyes red with anger. I took a few paces backwards as he raised his hand; I winced in anticipation. I woke up crumpled on the ground. My mom was screaming at my dad. What if he hit me too hard? End memory.

Fast forward 6 months. I'm in Korea again. I remember I hated both spinach and raw tomatoes. In fact, whenever I ate them, I threw up; I couldn't help it. My mom thought I just didn't want to eat them so I was throwing up on purpose. She always yelled at me whenever I did this. I remember once we were invited to a dinner at my dad's boss's house. We were served raw cherry tomatoes. I ate everything else and moved the tomatoes around a bit. My mom says to me quietly, ""eat the tomatoes,"" and gives me the glare of death. I eat them. I am repeatedly throwing up and swallowing my vomit, trying not to open my mouth. I managed to keep it down, but I was terrified. In a similar incident, my mom bought these HUGE fish oil pills, which I had difficulty swallowing. My mom thought I just hated swallowing them, so she would always yell at me whenever I gagged. Once, she had this (not-so-)brilliant idea to break the pill and sprinkle it all over food. It tasted awful. I gagged repeatedly. Now my mom does this thing a lot when she's angry where she inhales sharply through her teeth. It usually means she's about to hit me, and in fact, I still wince whenever I hear that noise. She made it A LOT during that meal. God, it was one of the most terrifying, belly-aching experiences of my life. This happened many times with seasoned spinach, which was a family favorite (I hated it and it made me throw up). Lots of hitting and yelling associated with it. To this day, she remains convinced that I like making her angry, and that I was throwing up on purpose to make her miserable (and that all the things I do that make her angry are done specifically to make her angry, and for no other reason. 

Moving away from food: I'm eleven, my mom tries to leave. Gets to the airport before realizing she's making a mistake. Comes back.

Later: I'm twelve, my parents tell me they're going to get divorced, and that my sister and I have made them miserable by forcing them to stay together. (They're still married today). After this, they tried to pit my sister and I against the other parent. They'd always done this, just not as often.

2 years pass: Family vacation in Nevada. Dad disappears. Mom says she's going to cut off his hand when he comes back because he went gambling. He comes back hours later and is chased out by a crazy asian lady with a knife.

2 years pass (dad's moved away for work): I don't finish my AP homework 2 weeks in advance, my sister tattles on me (she always does). Mom responds with lots of yelling, hitting, and making me throw away my xbox and all its accessories (I bought them all myself). Even now, she says that she threw away nothing, and forced me to do nothing, because I threw them away by my own hand (but she admits she probably would have done something horrible to me had I refused to throw it away). She even blames me for the dent she made when she threw it against the ground. O! And let's not forget that she hit my sister when she tried to defend me. That was the last straw for me. Nobody touches my sister, especially not the crazy bitch that raised us. I grab her wrists, and say very calmly, ""Stop."" She tries to shove me over the bannister of the stairs, goes downstairs, and calls me down. She's holding a knife. She tells me to come over there so she can cut off my hand. I refuse. She puts the knife down eventually. She goes to sleep. I run away from home for the second time (I ran away before when I made my first C). I crash at a friend's house for four days before I'm asked to leave. Not a single phone call, nobody comes around looking, nothing. Nada. Zip. I call her on the fourth day. She picks up. I start,
""Hello?""
""What.""
""Sorry about not doing my homework.""
""Have you done it yet?""
""Almost, I just have to write one more page.""
""Finish it.""
""Can I come home after I do?""
""Do what you want. I don't care anymore.""
*click*
I do as she says and come home later in the day. When I do, she yells at me some more, lecturing me on responsibility, how I'm worthless, how my dreams are stupid, how I'm a failure and always will be a failure, etc. This was all very crushing.
Life goes on.

Now, I'm 19 and doing an internship. I've been living with my dad for the last couple months and I hate it. I have to cook for him, carry his shit, and do everything, while my sister is allowed to do as she pleases.

I have so many other stories. Lots about my sister and I being treated differently in the same situation, etc etc. I even introduced my parents to the concept of ""grounding"" to escape beatings...I should've just taken the beatings. My parents weren't very lenient and thought a week of grounding was too weak. I've been grounded for a year before (I got off after 8 1/2 months for good behavior). I had to earn priveleges by reading the bible, internet articles, phsychology books, self-help books, novels, when I was in elementary school. There's just so much, some of them are even laughable when I look back on them, how could adults be so immature? But this is more than enough for one post, so I think I'll stop here.
Thanks for reading. Appreciate it. You guys all deserve muffins and upvotes.

tldr: my childhood was relatively bad."
wdar7,6,2012-07-11,At a crossroads... Hoping to make a decision to become happy. ,[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/wdar7/at_a_crossroads_hoping_to_make_a_decision_to/,"Hi,

The title says it all. I am a college graduate as of December 2010 (BSc in Economics) and am unemployed. I had a decent GPA and found a job quickly once I graduated... which I quickly began to hate due to the fact that it made me miserable... and I quit shortly after a year. 

I took some time off to recharge my batteries and temporarily moved back in with my parents to get my feet back under me (I still am there). I have spent the past 1.5 months actively applying for jobs, and while I have a few leads, I'm having a hard time becoming enthusiastic about any prospects due to the negative impact my first professional position had on me and I'm really at odds as to where I want to take my life from this point forward. 

Part of me regrets the major that I chose in college... While there are opportunities available to an economics degree holder, I feel as if many of them are for general and generic ""business"" positions and I'm undecided how I feel about gaining another one of these positions. I have the fear that it will end up like my first position and I will hate my life. Part of me regrets choosing the major I did over another major in an engineering-related field or a major that could lead to some sort of healthcare-related position. 

At the same time, I look back on some of the decisions I made in college and I regret not taking hold of the opportunities available to me. I never held an internship and was never particularly close with any of my professors in college (although I was a grader and the prof has agreed to let me use him as a reference)... These are things I regret and if I had a chance to go back I would want to try to become more involved in the academic aspect of college to try to forge some of these connections. I feel like because of the fact that I never held an internship, I lost out on valuable experience that could have helped me determine what type of job I should be looking for and now it's too late. 

More than anything else in life, I just want to find a career that I'm happy with. I'm not exactly a type ""A"" person, as I'm more easygoing and relaxed (I guess type ""B""), and I really feel as if the corporate rat race may not be right for me. 

How does one know what to devote their life to and what kind of job is right for them? Should I try going back to school for a different degree? How will I even know if I'm making the right job choice? I know that there are never two of the same paths to success, but I just want to make a choice that will make me happiest in the long run.

EDIT: TL;DR - Graduated college, got a job, hated life, was miserable, and quit. Now deciding between going back to school for a different (undecided) major or getting another corporate slave job. How do people know what career is best for them? "
wd99o,1,2012-07-11,"Dear Reddit, I am in a rather difficult situation and I need some serious help. I don't know what to do.",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wd99o/dear_reddit_i_am_in_a_rather_difficult_situation/,"Hi Reddit.

I am a closeted gay son to a devout Christian father. Some crazy situation happened lately and I need some help because I am so overwhelmed and I don't know what to do.

There will be a giant wall of text so please bare with me while I write the entire story.

Some background story on my family:

Ever since I could remember, my parents have been divorced because my dad cheated on my mom. When she found out, she went insane and locked my two sisters and I in the bathroom with her tried to commit suicide by ingesting pills. That failed miserably. When my dad wasn't around, she packed all our belongings and took us to Korea, where her family resided. My dad filed a police report and since then, she's been on the FBI's wanted list as a kidnapper and is unable to return to USA. This all happened when I was three years old.

Growing up, she told me that my dad died of a cancer. I always believed her and my sisters who knew everything didn't tell me a thing. We lived a slightly destitute life. My mom became an alcoholic and smoked cigarettes everyday. She did some stocks to earn money, but by the time I became ten years old, she couldn't support all three of us anymore and decided to send us back to US under our dad's care. The entire time we were going back, my mom told us that we should avenge for her and ruin dad's life because he ruined hers. I didn't really know what was going on back then so I just simply nodded and listened to her like a good kid.

When I met my dad, he was remarried to a tall Caucasian women. Listening to my mom's orders, I thought it'd be the best to show disrespect to his new wife in order to avenge for my mom. About a half year passed and she couldn't take it anymore. One night, my dad and his wife got into an argument and dad ended up sleeping on my bed. That night, my stepmom stormed into my room and argued with dad once more, I pretended to be asleep. She then proceeded to pull the blanket on the bed and tried to throw it on the floor, and I flew off the bed with the blanket. Enraged, my dad got furious at my stepmom and she left the morning after. I never saw her ever again after that.

About a half year passed and I was finally enrolled into an elementary school and I lived a fine life where dad worked all week long and came home late night. My sisters were busy adjusting to their new school life and my dad was never around, so I learned to occupy my time on the computer playing games. No kids lived in my neighborhood either for some reason so I became glued to computer games. My dad didn't approve of my behavior most of the time because he didn't see merits of computer gaming and always yelled at me. But he didn't give me other things to do- he didn't let me sign up for any sports or activities even when I asked.

Fast forward about 6 years, I began to realize that I was a homosexual man and I was extremely disgusted at myself. I couldn't accept myself and I hated myself- I resorted to slitting my wrists and spending all my time online on how to 'fix' myself. I got extremely depressed and my relationship with my dad grew worse. I think he saw my depression as unacceptable and everyday he would get upset with me for every little thing I did. My sisters went off to college and I was mostly left home everyday by myself. There would be times when my dad went off to business trips and I had to stay home alone for months at times. I was extremely lonely. One day, I swallowed a bunch of my dad's sleeping pills in hopes of killing myself, but after calling a friend and coming out to her, I saw that I wanted to live. I stuck a finger down my throat because I wanted to live again and I threw up some of the pills. Then I passed out for an entire day. And since then, I've been learning to accept myself albeit only to myself, I haven't admitted it to anyone yet at this point.

When my dad came back, I did my best to amend our relationship. But every time it improved and my I felt closer to my dad, he would push me away from him and give himself a reason to be mad at me. He would get mad at me for the way I ate my food, the friends I hung out with (all A+ students!), being glued to the computer, staying up late night, and other normal teenage behaviors. I learned to keep things to myself and stopped complaining about menial things. I learned to behave the way my dad wanted me to behave, but I was still ignored by my dad. 

He retired during my senior year and began to stay home every day. He began regularly attending churches and became a devout Christian. He'd get mad at me for not going to church with him. When I did go to church with him, he got mad because I wouldn't dress properly (shorts weren't acceptable to him) or be on my phone. I tried to get out more to avoid his presence, but he got furious if I went out too much. If I stayed home, I became a victim of his emotional abuse as well as coupe incidences of physical abuse.

I finally graduated my high school as a valedictorian (but our school had several valedictorians cuz they gave it to top xyz% of the class based on their gpa). Even then I was an eyesore to my dad and he didn't approve of my grades because I had couple Bs. I got accepted into University of Virginia, where one of my sister had attended, and I told my dad expecting him to be proud- but he just complained that everyone gets into UVA. I was disappointed since only twenty people from my school got accepted into UVA and it's considered very prestigious in my area.

When I started college, relationship between dad I grew worse because he told me I am unable to communicate well with him. He complained that I use him because I always ask him for money but I needed money to eat and get by in the school. I found a paradise in school where people accepted me for who I am and more so showed respect for me. I became very outgoing and made many friendships. Of course, my grades plummeted my first year because I'd been going out too much. My dad scolded for my behavior and called all my friends losers. 

It was around this time when he decided to kick my sister out for disobeying him. She was on her last year of school and she had to get her wisdom teeth extracted. Dad wanted her to drive while she was on anesthetics in order to return home from her surgery but she refused to drive under the influence and asked her friend to drive her. My dad got upset and cut all financial support to her. My sister and I pooled our allowance together to support my sister during her last semester and she eventually graduated and moved to Korea to reside with my mother.

That summer, Home became something of a nightmare for me. My other sister had been living home after graduating and my dad became a tyranny. The house became home to constant dissonance and fury. I got a job to stay out of the house as much as I could.

The following year is when all the shit went down. I started seeing a counselor regarding my family harmony and also seek help to accept myself. I also met a long distance boyfriend and fell in love with him. I saved up as much money as I could and visited him once a month in NY. One day, he decided to visit down but I had to pick him up from DC. I told dad that I was coming home to see the family because I miss them and I also wanted to take the car. I took the car and picked my boyfriend up, and headed down to school. We stopped at a red light and I leaned over to give him a peck on the cheek. A police officer was behind us and he stopped us when the light turned green, and he gave me a reckless driving ticket. I was appalled but I didn't know what to do, I knew I was driving under the speed limit because that's one thing I can do right. I told my dad that I'd gotten a reckless ticket and he was extremely upset. I defended myself in the court, but the judge wouldn't hear it and sentenced me guilty the second I finished speaking. I appealed the case and my dad hired a lawyer for the next hearing which is in august. Shortly after, my boyfriend and I made travel plans to Toronto to visit friends. He left for NY couple days later.

Short info about my boyfriend, he graduated from NYU that semester and got accepted into an internship in San Francisco. He insisted that we break up once he moves to San Francisco because we are at a different stage of life. Bitter but without a choice, I agreed. I figured I couldn't do anything if he already set his mind and staying together wouldn't be healthy at that point. We planned the Toronto trip to be our last trip together before we part.

Feeling pretty crappy about my future.,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/wd6m2/senior_bsee_candidate_feeling_pretty_crappy_about/,"I will be graduating this fall with a B.S. in Electronics Engineering. The school I go to is well known, but the engineering program completely sucks and I feel like I know just the basics (if that). I feel I could have read a rudimentary electronics book from amazon.com in a few weeks and be where I'm at now. 

My biggest concern is finding a job. Like I said, I graduate this November. I'm going to be moving from the Boston area to Fort Lauderdale, because I hate life up here and I've lived down there before. 

All of the jobs I've searched online have very stringent minimum requirements. In many cases, 5+ or 10+ years experience, proficiency in certain programming languages, very specialized experience (I mean, how many people have 10 years of Airbua A320 avionic experience?), a PE license, etc. 

I have none of those. No experience. No specialization. No programming knowledge aside from one C programming class I took. No internship... 

I got into Florida Atlantic University's graduate program for MSEE, but I already have a HUGE student loan debt. 

I'm moving to Florida December 1st no matter what. Can anyone give me any guidance? Grad school? Try to find a job? Become an Air Force officer?  I'm feeling pretty pessimistic right now..."

I graduated in May with a BS in Computer Science.  Since I graduated in May, I have been applying to 5-7 places every week. I have applied to over 100 places, which isn't that many at all but I usually take some time to apply to places that feel like a good fit for me instead of just blindly applying to every job I find.  Should I be applying to more places, even ones I might not be qualified for?

For the most part, I have been finding jobs via linkedin, indeed.com, dice.com, and my schools job board.  For almost all of these I am sending an email with a cover letter and my resume attached.

I have been getting some interviews, maybe 1 every week though all of them have been phone or skype interviews.  I tend to do well in interviews except for algorithms questions.  I try my best to talk through my problem solving process but I tend to blank out and then have the solution come to me the second the interview is over which is really frustrating. So far I have only had one offer and it was only for 45k, which I am going to reject because that is way too low.

What else should I be doing?  Is sending emails a waste of time? I do a little bit of programming in my free time and I have a few things I can show but its nothing that special.  I could probably find some open source project to contribute to but I have no idea what I want to do or what is going to help me the most.  My specialization for my degree was in computer graphics so I have tried applying to game development jobs.  I have built a few games as part of my undergraduate course work which I show to them, but I haven't gotten interviews with any game development studios which I applied to.  On the other hand, I hear so many negative things about the game industry and I don't know if its for me.  I just don't care about video games anymore as well.

Most places that have rejected me and gave a reason said that I just didn't have enough experience.  I have been working part time as a web developer for 6 months so I have something but I don't really want to do web development.  I also worked as a intern at a pretty big company, but it was such a terrible experience that I wouldn't want to pursue a career there. 

tl:dr basically, I feel like I am at square one and I am not sure what I should be doing.  I keep applying to places, getting an interviews here and there, but I am getting no where.  I am not sure what I want to do with CS or if I even want to do software development.  I feel stuck because I have this degree and its my best chance at finding a job and i'm getting no where.

Edit:  Thanks for everyone's input I really appreciate it.  I have a lot to think about it seems.

""AS I'VE BEEN TOLD, you may know this but it's nice to have it all right at your fingertips!!

Personal Information:

His full Name is: Willard Mitt Romney

He was Born: March 12, 1947 and is 65 years old.

His Father: George W. Romney, former Governor of the State of Michigan

He was raised in Bloomfield Hills , Michigan

He is Married to Ann Romney since 1969; they five children.

Education:
B.A. from Brigham Young University,

J.D. and M.B.A. from Harvard University

Religion:
Mormon - The Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints

Working Background:

After high school, he spent 30 months in France as a Mormon missionary.

After going to both Harvard Business School and Harvard Law
School simultaneously, he passed the Michigan bar exam, but
never worked as an attorney.

In 1984, he co-founded Bain Capital a private equity
investment firm, one of the largest such firms in the United
States .

In 1994, he ran for Senator of Massachusetts and lost to Ted
Kennedy.

He was President and CEO of the 2002 Winter Olympic Games.

In 2002, he was elected Governor of the State of
Massachusetts where he eliminated a 1.5 billion deficit.

Some Interesting Facts about Romney:

Bain Capital, starting with one small office supply store in
Massachusetts, turned it into Staples; now over 2,000 stores
employing 90,000 people.

Bain Capital also worked to perform the same kinds of
business miracles again and again, with companies like
Domino's, Sealy, Brookstone, Weather Channel, Burger King,
Warner Music Group, Dollarama, Home Depot Supply, and many
others.

He was an unpaid volunteer campaign worker for his dad's
gubernatorial campaign 1 year.

He was an unpaid intern in his dad's governor's office for
eight years.

He was an unpaid bishop and state president of his church
for ten years.

He was an unpaid President of the Salt Lake Olympic
Committee for three years.

He took no salary and was the unpaid Governor of
Massachusetts for four years.

He gave his entire inheritance from his father to charity.

Mitt Romney is one of the wealthiest self-made men in our
country but has given more back to its citizens in terms of
money, service and time than most men.

And in 2011 Mitt Romney gave over $4 million to charity,
almost 19% of his income.... Just for comparison purposes,
Obama gave 1% and Joe Biden gave $300 or .0013%.

Mitt Romney is Trustworthy:

He will show us his birth certificate

He will show us his high school and college transcripts.

He will show us his social security card.

He will show us his law degree.

He will show us his draft notice.

He will show us his medical records.

He will show us his income tax records.

He will show us he has nothing to hide.

Mitt Romney's background, experience and trustworthiness
show him to be a great leader and an excellent citizen for
President of the United States.

You may think that Romney may not be the best representative
the Republicans could have selected. At least I know what
religion he is, and that he won't desecrate the flag, bow
down to foreign powers, or practice fiscal irresponsibility.
I know he has the ability to turn this financial debacle
that the current regime has gotten us into. We won't like
all the things necessary to recover from this debt, but
someone with Romney's background can do it. But, on the
minus side, He never was a ""Community Organizer"", never took
drugs or smoked pot, never got drunk, did not associate with
communists or terrorists, nor did he attend a church whose
pastor called for God to damn the US."""

""Epicbot!"" my mother called""The Professor wants you in his lab.""
Yup, not creepy at all, but I had no plans for the day, so I went anyways.
""Ah yes, Epicbot, there you are."" Professor Elm continued ""I need you to do an errand for me.""
Fuck. I just woke up and don't have energyto do anything, but whatever.
""K, I'll do it, what do I have to do?"" I asked Professor Elm
""Well, take one of my starter Pokemon and go see what Mr.Pokemon wants.He says it's an important discovery, but bring back the starter.""
There was three Pokemon at the table-Totodile, Chikorita, and Cyandaquil.For me the obvious choice was Totodile. 
After that I exited the Professor and I exchanged numbers then I went to Mr.Pokemon's house to find out it was just an egg and met Professor Oak.
Elm soon called and told me to come quickly because somebody had stolen one of his starter Pokemon.On my way back I met a boy with a Chikorita just like Elm had, but I beat him easily.
""Asreal that's my name"" the kid said ""and don't you forget that!""
Back at Elm's lab there was an Officer Jenny that described the person I had just fought and asked if anyone had seen it and I replied.
""Yeah he was just at Cherrygrove and his name is Asreal.""
The Officer Jenny then thanked me and left. After I went to my house to restfor a while and then my father woke me up.
""epicbot...Epicbot...Epicbot!"" my father shouted in my ear. I yelled "" Holy Shit!"" as I fell of of our couch.
""Time for you to get your first Pokemon!"" Dad told me in a very excited voice.
We both got dressed in our Trainer Gear and went outside. My dad had taught me the basics from when I was 5-8 and got a bit advanced from age 8 to a couple days before today. He told me that if I wanted to catch every Pokemon I had to lower their HP, make them have a status problem, and have a lot of Pokeballs.
""Alright son are you ready?"" My dad asked me, yes I know a stupid question because, well who wouldn't, but I answered anyways.
""Yeah, you know it!"" I answered ecstatically.
As soon as we stepped into the grass a Lv.5 Porygon jumped out at us and it began. My father sent out his prized Pokemon Rick the Scizor.
""Go, Rick use False Swipe!""
*Wild Porygon used Tackle*
I could see my Father's Pokemon Scizor was very strong because the Porygon's Tackle had barely affected Rick.
""Go Pokeball.""
*click click click*
""Hey, there you go that's all that's to it, would you like to nickname the Porygon?"" My dad asked me.
"" Yes, Duckbot."" I answered *giggle* ""It's gonna be just me and you all the way! We might even beat the Elite 4 and Lance."" I embraced Duckbot and said my good byes to everyone while I started my journey. 
I soon got to Violet City, the first place we went to was Sprout Tower which we swept pretty fast between trips to the Pokemon Center. Saw Asreal at the top fighting Elder Li, he left before I could punch his Fucking lights out. Elder Li was fairly easy, so next was Falkner.
**Enter Major Grindage Mode!!!**
""So, you're here challenge me?"" Falkner asked.
""Well, yeah"" I told Falkner ""why else would-""
""Well it doesn't matter because I have my dad's cherished-""
""SHUT THE FUCK UP BITCH!!! Go Duckbot!""
""Go Pidgey!"" 
*Duckbot used Psybeam* **OHKO**
""Fuck! Go Pidgeotto!""
*Pidgeotto used Quick Attack*
*Duckbot used Pybeam* 
*Duckbot used Psybeam*
*Pidgeotto used Roost*
""Fuck, he can heal.""
*Duckbot used Psybeam*
*Pidgeotto used Roost *
""This shit is getting fucking annoying. Use all your power in one hit Duckbot""
*Duckbot used Psybeam*
*Falkner was defeated*
""Here, you deserve this...Twerp.""
*Obtained the Zephyr Badge*
Once I thanked Falkner for the match and exited I got a call from Elm to go to the Pokemart. When I got there I found an intern from Elm's lab there holding an egg and wanted me to hold it but I told him he should give it to my mom, the once proud owner of the Sinnoh Daycare, because she knows how to take care of eggs and Pokemon of every type.

One of my groups project is to is to develop a solution that raises awareness for a foster care group known as Koinonia. We plan to use Social Media to spread Koinonia's name. We want to seek the out supporters and volunteers by touching on the emotions of the public (similar to the ""Kony"" approach). 

We have created some accounts for Koinia and if you can help us get rolling by following the twitter account, liking the facebook page, and upvoting this posts, you will really help me and my group by showcasing the amazing power of the internet and social media (especially reddit!). 

Twitter: https://twitter.com/koinonia13
Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Koinonia/403706429664501

Here is our problem statement and solution if you are interested:
Project: Second Chance
Koinonia is a program that provides teenagers with dysfunctional families a new hope. It is a program that

“Lack of awareness and knowledge in the community regarding the second chances provided to children from dysfunctional backgrounds has resulted in negative perceptions toward these children, which has lead to reduced opportunities and higher criminal activity.""

Our goal is to improve the awareness in the community regarding the programs like Koinonia. We hope to enhance and promote the image of Koinonia by spreading the name to as many people as possible through the use of social media.

Getting the information out is not the only thing we are focusing on, we want to prove to the people like you that by giving support to programs like Koinonia, they are making a difference in their community.
    In order to prove that the community is affected in a good way through programs like Koinonia, I am now going to explain exactly what our plans are:

    #1. We plan to engage with the Law Enforcement and have their involvement as crucial
    Law Enforcement is important in our planning because we all agree that they are the ones who deal with children from dysfunctional families.
    Police will give the program credibility in regards to the program’s role in helping the communities.

We have seen the difference in the lives of the foster kids that have went through the Koinonia program. Koinonia

With people having faith in the program, our next step would be to make important ties with local schools and counselors for volunteering opportunities. Our main focus is not only to give the community a positive perception toward the program but also to engage them in contributing toward the betterment of not only the children but also the society.

Our objective is to get the people involved in changing lives of children throughout the community so they can help these kids succeed in life.

We are confident to receive positive feedback from the law enforcement because programs similar to Koinonia, for example Child Protective Services, are heavily supported "

We have never  been late or problematic paying the monthly payments, Dad has a pension and SS that more than covered monthly bills, but the last time he went from the nursing home to living at home again (which only lasted 2 weeks) he kicked out the two men I had living in and maintaining the house. It fell into disrepair got robbed more than once and mail started piling up. Monthly checks always got sent, though it is possible the March or April payment did not go through, the May and June payments were sent back when the account had more than enough funds so we were behind by multiple months all of a sudden. Last friday my friend took my father to his bank and they spoke with the mortgage company and my friend misinterpreted the situation telling me the house would not get foreclosed on, but the manager canceled the follow up meeting monday and after calling him yesterday and having my friend and father go back this is the situation I find myself in now.

SO, I know there have to be plenty of people here that have gone through the foreclosure process and could give me some advice. **Important details:**

""In depth press release""

Talawa Games and Teotl Studios bring intricate puzzles and a unique, atmospheric world with Unmechanical.

STOCKHOLM, Swe. – 11 July 2012 – Today, indie developers Talawa Games and Teotl Studios are thrilled to announce the puzzle adventure game Unmechanical, to be released August 8th 2012 for PC – and a few weeks later – for iOS.

Unmechanical is an award-winning 2.5D side-scroller which combines tricky puzzle solving, alluring exploration, and an engrossing atmosphere. The game had humble beginnings as a student project and since then both game and team has grown. “Unmechanical has been about taking on something for real and working our fingers to the bone to get it done. It’s our hopes and ambitions combined into this very personal, unique, and awesome adventure that’s crafted with lots of love.”Said Marko Permanto, project lead for the Unmechanical team.

Unmechanical begins with a twist of fate as you’re spirited away by a network of coiled pipes into a mysterious underworld. You find yourself in a strange environment that pulsates from mechanic and organic machinery alike, and your journey to freedom begins. Flying freely through the odd and fantastic surroundings, a powerful tractor beam lets you pick up objects and interact with the world. 

Your quest for freedom requires you to solve a great variety of puzzling challenges, and while it’s easy to pick up and play, later challenges may prove very difficult indeed. On your adventure you might also begin to understand what it all means–The underworld may be more than it seems, the fateful descent more than just chance, and you might not be entirely alone after all…

About Talawa Games:
Unmechanical started in early 2011 as a student project at Futuregames, a game development education in Stockholm, Sweden. The Unmechanical team has doubled in size since the beginning, but has always been about a tightly knit team that collaborates rather than delegates. Most work has been done on the students’ free time, both during school and the following internships when the team was spread out across Europe. About half the Unmechanical team joined additional enthusiasts from the school and started Talawa Games to work on new projects. The new studio is hardworking, multi-talented, and passionate, which they hope will shine through with their games. Talawa is from Jamaican patois and means strong or sturdy, often used in the sense of “small but strong”. Visit the Unmechanical team and Talawa Games at http://talawagames.com/

http://www.rudism.com/s/vimcreep

...for me it started in Java 301 with a network poker game group project (server, hand eval, ui).  The ""professional"" programmer in our group worked with the server stuff, and there we were, 9pm, in the darkened computer lab, and I was in awe of how he moved around with vim.

I picked up vim b/c I was working as a government intern doing ASP web-dev with `notepad.exe` and got tired of having to hit the down arrow 87 lines when ASP spat back ""Syntax error, line 87"".

I've eventually moved from "":87"" to where I am today, but I love how this guy describes that sense of wonderment and discovery that I first felt when I saw vim.

What's your story?"
wgfz4,46,2012-07-12,"He's telling me I'm abusive, how do I know if I really am? ",amianabuser,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/wgfz4/hes_telling_me_im_abusive_how_do_i_know_if_i/,"Throwaway account, but I'm a long term redditor.

My boyfriend and I are both 25. We've been dating for just over 3 years. Most of the time things are great, but the last few months have been rough. His depression and anxiety have been taking over our lives, in my opinion. He says I emotionally abuse him.  

Last night things came to a head. We started arguing because he was saying I refused to recognize my privilege from being pretty, and that I had to realize the world treated me differently that it did other people. I didn't deny the power that looks have in our society, but I said my feelings were hurt that he was acting like much of my success was from how I looked instead of my hard work.

The fight escalated and I tried to leave the room. He blocked the door with his body. I told him he was acting like a crazy person and I just needed to get away for a minute to cool down. 

He said I enjoyed breaking him down, that I was a cruel person who got pleasure from his pain and that I never admitted I was wrong.

Then he said ""Do you even love me anymore? Say one thing you love about me.""

I was so upset I said I couldn't think of any, which was wrong of me I know. I do really love him, but my mind was drawing a blank at that moment.

When I said I couldn't think of a reason I loved him, he freaked out, started throwing things, hitting himself, and whipping the towels and blankets in the room around. He collapsed on the floor and sobbed, saying I always had to win at any cost, that I didn't care about him at all, and that I did things purposefully to hurt him.

At that point I was cold and detached. I asked him to leave again. He wouldn't so I picked up a magazine and started reading. After I ignored him, he lunged across the bed and ripped the magazine out of my hands. Then he started pulling the mattress off the bed while I was on it. 

At that point I felt physically threatened and I was sitting on the floor in the corner of my room, crying while the dogs sat protectively in front of me. 

He said ""Just keep crying your crocodile tears"" and then lay on the floor hyperventilating.

We ended up calming down and at that point it was like three, so we went to sleep. The dogs made sure to be on either side of me on the bed. When we woke up I apologized for saying I didn't know why I loved him, and listed several reasons why I did. Then I asked him to apologize for getting violent. He said he wasn't violent last night.

That made me upset again so we started arguing again, and he said that everything he did last night was because I drove him to it. He said I got pleasure from making him hysterical.

I really don't try to make him cry or get upset when we fight. I DON'T want to make him sad, or break him down. I know I don't want that. Is it possible to be emotionally abusive without knowing it?

As I write this all out I have to say I feel like if anyone's abusive it's him, but I don't want to not take responsibility for my part in our problems. I tend to be cool, calm, and collected in a fight and I always have sometime to say  which I know can drive people crazy. My tendency is also to leave when things get heated, just for a few minutes to calm down, and he hates that.

So what do you think r/relationships. I am an abuser and I just don't realize it? Should I walk away from this person? Demand counseling? I've been crying all day so just internet hugs would be nice (thankfully I have today off from my internship). 

TL:DR Boyfriend of 3 years is accusing me of trying to  make him sad, and getting enjoyment out of his sorrow. I'm really not trying to make him scream, lash out, or throw things. Is it possible I'm an abuser and I don't know it?"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Where do you stand on in on the whole pro life/choice argument?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmoxn?context=5)|I definitely understand why someone would be against abortion, but I just don't sympathize with them trying to control the choice. It's hard for someone to be forced into an abortion, that's why we have a solo counseling session with them. But after working with so many different women, I can clearly see how abortions being legal affects their lives. Shit happens, people get pregnant when they didn't want to, and not everyone can handle going through a pregnancy.
 |But yes, I understand their argument, I just think their argument is a personal choice, not a political ideology.
[*""forced into an abortion""*  For medical reasons I'm guessing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d01tj?context=5)|No I mean being forced by someone to have abortion. We don't allow any one other than he patient in counseling sessions to ensure that she is making the decision herself and no one is forcing her.
[But whose choice does that become? Shouldn't women and men be held responsible for their promiscuity?  Would you say that allowing abortions leads to more irresponsible behavior? The child certainly doesn't get to choose whether or not it gets to be born. If the child had a choice I would think it would choose life over not being born at all. People use the argument that a fertilized embryo is not the beginning of life but if you were to live it unharmed would it not develop to the stage of life we consider the ""beginning"". I believe in pro choice and that a woman should be allowed to do whatever she wants with her body, but for me the problem becomes when does it become her body and not another human's body?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cpvxu?context=5)|Yeah it's a hard debate. I don't think it adds to promiscuity, that's similar to arguing that teaching comprehensive sex ed makes more high schoolers have sex--when statistics show pushing abstinence leads to more teen pregnancy. I think abortions is one of those things that people change their minds when they are put in the situation, a lot of women were pro life, but that changes when they accidentally get pregnant. Also, abortions are pretty expensive (obviously cheaper than raising a child though) so it's not something anyone really uses for birth control, at least I haven't come across that.
[What's the hardest type of situation you've had to work with? Like do you get young patients or the woman trying to keep it from her abusive husband, that kind of thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cpvps?context=5)|My hardest situation was a woman that had to abort because she was recently diagnosed with cancer. Had she been healthy, she would have kept it, but she need chemo and it's not something you should do when you're pregnant. I also worked with a women in an abusive relationship, it was very violent. Fortunately her partner was in jail (last I heard) so she is safe.
[Do you ever run into past patients in situations elsewhere? How is that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cpvps?context=5)|The city I live in is fairly small, so yes I have run into some of my patients. It's weird. I just let them lead on whether or not they want to acknowledge me. 
[I recently spoke with someone who cited the protestors yelling at/doing things to her as one of her fears about going to a clinic. I had no idea how to respond as I can imagine that would be extremely traumatizing. What advice would you give someone who had similar fears?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d65cq?context=5)|Put on a game face. Or smile and wave. You don't have to talk to them, and if the parking lot is privately owned by the clinic, they cannot approach you. The best thing is just not engaging them, they are anticipating a reaction from you, and giving them that makes them satisfied.
[Thank you for doing this AMAA. I am quite fascinated with all of this. What is it like to accompany someone during the procedure? Was it difficult for you at first? Do women cry often? Do you still accompany the woman in the room if the father is there? And do you often get women who have no choice but to abort (i.e. medical reasons\)? If so, do their emotional reactions differ from those who are choosing to abort for other reasons?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cph18?context=5)|So many questions! Firstly, yes it was pretty weird at first to go into procedures with women. I trained a lot by shadowing other counselors though, so that actually became the part I caught on to faster. When they have fathers or friends I still accompany them, but in those cases it's more to assist the doctor and make sure the patient is doing fine. We have an optional anti anxiety med if they are super nervous for the procedure, and if they choose to be doped up, it's important to have someone there checking their vitals that knows what the side affects are.
 |Some women cry. It can be pretty painful for some people, everyone's bodies are different like that so we can't really predict what their pain levels will be. But it is a pretty weird experience to have someone prodding around your uterus when you are conscience, not to mention all the varying levels of emotions they have on just making their decision.
 |I have had a few patients that really had no choice. Those are by far the most sad. I had a patient that had been trying to get pregnant for years, she finally got pregnant right after finding out she had cancer. Those patients have it hard, especially if they wanted children. We usually recommend regular therapy after the procedure for those patients. We also had someone call us from a local Catholic hospital; she was on the waiting list for an organ donation and she accidentally got pregnant, you can't get organs donated when you are pregnant and the hospital she was at refused to give her one. There was nothing we could do, since it's not our hospital. 
[I've always wondered...what's the actual process of getting an abortion like? Is there anesthetic? Do the patients feel sore afterwards? Does it take long? I'm sorry if these are ignorant/already answered questions.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cqsca?context=5)|The process nowadays is mostly suction. So it's a process of dilation and then using a small suction device to remove everything. There is also a medical abortion that is an option when the gestational age is 8 weeks or under, that is basically a mixture of meds that induce a miscarriage. For procedures that we do, there is an option for anti anxiety medication given through IV and we have an anti pain med used for severe pain, which is pretty rare, would be more for someone that has an ovarian cyst. A whole procedure (at my clinic) is about 15 minutes, including set up and confirming that he abortion was complete. Those all change though the farther along in pregnancy you are, I think it's an overnight hospitalization thing if you go farther than what we do.
[Can anything go wrong with it , is it 100% safe or can the ""Abortee"" suffer some horrible death or altercations later in life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5dfj63?context=5)|I know in the state I'm in, we've never had a death since abortion has been legal. There are always possibilities of side affects though. Like someone could have an allergic reaction to the numbing agent we use on their cervix. When we did emergency response training, it was all like worst case scenarios; like someone shoots up with heroin, opts for the anti anxiety med we can do, and that mixed could make an overdose. After the procedure, women have specific care instructions; take all the antibiotics we give them, no sex, no tampons, etc. Those instructions are to prevent infection, which more than anything would be the only thing that could potentially cause severe side affects. If you get an infection and let it go untreated, it can turn in pelvic inflammatory disease, so it's similar to not treating an STD. PID can cause infertility and I think death if it goes untreated, however if women are following our instructions, their chances of an infection are very low and if they show any signs of infection we have them call us and we will treat it before it turns into PID. I've never had anyone even get an infection though.
[As a counselor do you have many women who regret their decision later? how do you help the cope?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5co2no?context=5)|I actually don't work as much with aftercare patients. We definitely have people that do that at our clinic though. I have honestly never heard of anyone regretting it more than ""I wish I didn't get pregnant"" though. Most women feel more relieved than anything. Of course, if someone is mentally unstable before the abortion, they will most likely still be unstable after the procedure. 
[Other than obvious mental instability, is there anything else that would come out during a counseling session that would indicate that a patient would have emotional or psychological fallout after the procedure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d619q?context=5)|Well most women will just tell me if they are worried of how they will do after. We always discuss how they think they will feel after the procedure. Obviously if someone is in an abusive situation we make sure that they have a restraining order or something to keep them safe.
[So theres no sense of regret at all for most, its just completely casual to them :/  thats sad.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cubeo?context=5)|Or it's a good thing because they thought it out before they did it. Abortions (and unplanned pregnancies in general) have actually gone down in the last year or so in the US.
[My question: Are there steps that you take with minors who are getting an abortion that are vastly different from an adult?  If so, what are they?  How do you deal with minors in general?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cr6y4?context=5)|Hope that answered it for you! Supportive partners are the best.
[*At 8 weeks it is not a fetus!! It's still an embryo.*  Who are you trying to convince, me or you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cwz5v?context=5)|I just hate that propaganda says it is. Science says otherwise.
[I am 100% pro-choice, but kind of curious: What do they do with the fetus after they abort it? Has anyone requested it be buried? Why can't they put someone under for an abortion? How painful are they? How many people were using BC and had it fail? That is my nightmare.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cuoej?context=5)|Fetuses are sent away with human waste and needles, you know the red boxes they have at doctor's offices. It's currently illegal to send fetuses in for stem cell research, because that would make it beneficial to abortion clinics and it would look like we were encouraging abortions in order to make more for stem cells. I've never had anyone request to bury it, but I'm sure it's been done before.
 |Putting someone under for any procedure adds a significant amount of risk. It's a 15 minute procedure, and one of the most common outpatient surgeries. I believe in later pregnancy abortions they do need to be put under, but I have no experience with that.
 |It's crazy how many people get pregnant when they are on birth control. It's definitely made me more paranoid about it. For the most part it's user error though, like taking a pill late or something. Specifically progesterone only pills need to be on a tighter schedule for taking pills, that kind is fairly common for someone to pregnant on. It really kills me when someone comes in that got pregnant with an IUD in, those are so affective, but shit still happens.
[How much fetal matter is there for a 6 week pregnancy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5dsp96?context=5)|Very little. For pregnancies that young, the lab tech looks for the embryotic sack, which is very small, to confirm the pregnancy was terminated.
[As someone who fully defends a woman's right to get an abortion, a counter argument I hear sometimes is that people use abortion clinics as their form of birth control instead of condoms, the pill, etc.  My question is: do you see many/any returning patients?  Do you think this counter argument holds water? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5czdhb?context=5)|No I think that argument is pretty dumb. Just logically speaking, who would want to spend $600+ every month or every few months on birth control? Abortions aren't  cheap. Usually if someone comes in for a repeated abortion it's birth control failure or they had an abortion at 16 but now they are in their 30's. And no one is comfortable wih someone putting all that equipment in their vagina, not a common birth control. 
[What is the youngest person you've counselled?  How did that go? Was it especially emotionally draining on you or them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5coqro?context=5)|My youngest patient was 16. Surprisingly though, in my experience, the younger women handle abortions much better than older women. In general, younger girls more willingly open up with me in counseling sessions and handle the actual procedure much better. Most older women (I'm talking 30's ish) don't really open up and are more upset with and during the procedure. It could also be that they don't want to open up to me about their abortions because I do look pretty young. I've probably only counseled women under 20 around 4 times, so it's actually more rare than people think. And I think all of them came in with their moms too.
[Have the protesters ever done something really bad, or gone too far? Have women ever entered crying or upset over what the protesters have been saying?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cqbly?context=5)|Not since I have worked here. Our clinic was bombed about 20 years ago, it was on a weekend though so no one was hurt. But there were 3 years after that that there was no clinic because they had to come up with the money to rebuild. 
[Odd - did they not have insurance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cwnjk?context=5)|Oh I never really thought of that. From what I know, they were renting space for the clinic before, but after that they had to build their own because no one would rent to them.
[Do you ever feel like you are doing something wrong? Not necessarily the actual abortion, but like if it isn't right for that person to get one in your opinion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmph4?context=5)|I have actually sent women home if I don't think they can handle an abortion. My clinic can do procedures up to 16 weeks gestation, most women find out they are pregnant at about 8 weeks. So if I feel like someone is indecisive about it, I'll tell them to go home and think about it more. The counseling session is there so that we can be sure women are confident in their decision. And most women have already thought about it a lot before even coming into the clinic. Only twice have I had to repeatedly go back and forth with a patient about whether or not they want it, which sucks because it's not my choice, but sometimes they just need someone to tell them it's okay.
[How often have you done an abortion at 16 weeks?is that more disturbing... Yikes :(     ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cspu8?context=5)|Never. The oldest gestational age I've worked with is 13 weeks.
[Do you find it hard not to be judgmental? Ever had a patient who you thought was being selfish or doing the wrong thing by aborting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cpmz5?context=5)|Sometimes yes. My job is to be non judgmental though, so it's just a matter of turning off that voice. We have a good system at the clinic I'm at though, we can talk to each other if we've had a hard day and we can trade patient's if we are uncomfortable with the person we get or find it hard not to judge them.  I don't think I've ever felt anyone was being particularly selfish, I just think some women should be more responsible and just get some birth control. 
[Do the fathers ever attend the procedure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmpxl?context=5)|Yes, quite often actually. Sometimes they react more severely to medical terms and procedures though, more men pass out watching a procedure than any patients I've had. Another counselor had a boyfriend pass out when she was explaining the procedure, they weren't even in the abortion room yet!
[In Germany some abortions (e.g. the child will be disabled\) are still legal in the 8th month. What is your opinion on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmwux?context=5)|Well an abortion that far along would be a huuuuge process. Like they would be in a hospital overnight kind of thing. And you can test for down syndrome when the fetus is pretty young, so the need for an 8 month abortion seems minimal. But it still comes down to choice I guess. I don't think I could abort a baby for the sole reason of birth defects, but everyone's different.
[Has this experience changed your attitude toward sex education? If you had one minute in front of a class of high school students, what is the most important message you would give them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cyuqy?context=5)|Use birth control!! I think people should learn more about birth control at a younger age, so in high school. And this job makes talking about sex and vaginas so easy, I need to turn that off sometimes because not everyone is comfortable with talking about sex.
[I was taught about birth control in middle school/junior high. They were stressing the importance of the pill/condoms/other forms of contraceptives to students around 11-13.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d7385?context=5)|Good for you! I don't think I knew all about the forms of birth control until college.
[Why did you chose to be an abortion counselor?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cn17r?context=5)|I wanted to get into women's health and I did my nonprofit admin internship at an abortion clinic. They were hiring for counselors when I finished and I've always wanted to get into women's health. 
[How exactly do they perform the procedure these days?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmoqr?context=5)|Whew. Well there are two methods. The surgical is the kind I usually work with. For that it starts out like a pap, the duck lips and everything. First the cervix is numbed, we use a medication similar to what a dentist would use. To dilate the cervix, we use dilation rods, which are these blunt tipped stick things. We dilate it according to how far along they are, so for 8 weeks gestation it's 8 millimeters. After it's dilated, the doctor uses a flexible straw thing connected to a little vacuum or suction device. After that it's basically just cleaning up. The doctor checks the contents to confirm that they are not pregnant anymore.
 |The option is a medical abortion, only available when it is 8 weeks or under in gestation. That's when the doctor will prescribe two medications and when they are taken they basically induce a miscarriage. Women get to be at home for this one, and it's a lot cheaper, but it can be pretty painful for up to three days.
[What's your educational background / how'd you get the job? I'm curious about this kind of thing but have no idea how I'd get into it.  Also, thanks for all that you do!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cuoqt?context=5)|My job title is technically an abortion peer counselor, so not something you need a degree for. I got into it by doing nonprofit admin, with intentions of getting into women's health. But actually nursing is a great way to get into it, some nurses will help when we are understaffed for counselors, they do the ultrasounds and see patients for aftercare. 
[Have you ever had an abortion? If so does this help you relate to your patients?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cserh?context=5)|No, but it's a question a lot of women ask me in counseling sessions. I think they could potentially relate to me more if I had though. But working in an abortion clinic just makes me extra paranoid about pregnancies so I am pretty tedious when it comes to my own birth control.
[Where are you generally?  Being an abortion counsellor working in the Vatican or in the southern US would probably be a pretty different experience than working in Canada or whatever.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmpv3?context=5)|I'm in the US, not the South. My city is pretty liberal, but the surrounding state is very rural and conservative-- we get our fair share of protesters.
[Can a parent make their child under 18 have an abortion?? Even if the daughter wants to keep the baby?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5dp5sv?context=5)|Nope. No matter the age, the ultimate decision is with the pregnant woman.
[Have you ever counseled rape victims?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5ctivw?context=5)|Maybe? It's not really something most women want to elaborate about. I've suspected it, but it's not necessary for them for tell me that on order to get an abortion.
[What do you say to people you meet who are completely against abortion, and they ask you your occupation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5co3jc?context=5)|I actually just don't tell them about it. I have family members that don't even know (I live far away from them, so they just think I am a medical assistant). It's a part time job though, and I've been on a constant search for a good second job, my resume just says I'm a medical assistant because I don't want that to affect whether or not I'll be hired somewhere else.
[What would you say is the average age of the women who come into the clinic?  Do more women come in by themselves or with a significant other/family member/friend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5criey?context=5)|The age range I've worked with has been between 16 and 37. Average would probably be mid to late twenties. Most women do come in wih some kind of support group, I've seen entire families come in. They usually come in with their mothers, no matter the age. 
[What tends to be the demographic of women who come to your clinic? Age? Race? Economic background? I have no preconceptions (that's why I'm asking\) but I know what most people think and I wonder how accurate it is.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d0vo5?context=5)|Mostly white, age range from 16 to 37, but average age is probably mid to late 20's. We have to keep stats of everyone, including their level of education, mostly college grads or someone who's taken some college level classes. Economically...we don't really ask what their occupation is.
[Do you turn people away? If so how often does it happen?  You said the sessions are to make sure they are not being forced. How often do you suspect this is happening?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5czb9j?context=5)|Only twice have I felt iffy about patients. But never have I felt like they were being forced, they were just super undecided and unsure about what they wanted to do. They had time, since we go up to 16 weeks and most women realize they are pregnant at 8 weeks, so they just went home to think more to decide what they want. They ended up coming back wayore confident.
[Do you even discuss adoption as a potential option ?.  I am trying to adopt and it seems like I will be forced to go overseas which seems a shame when pregnancy terminations occur in this country daily.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cnkw1?context=5)|When most women make the appointment, they have pretty much already made up their minds. Our counseling sessions are based around them just telling us their thought process on how they made their decision, which is usually them explaining why they don't want to do parenting and adoption. For people that ask though, we have a few local resources to find someone to parent their children.
[A second question, where do you stand on abortion as a choice in gender selection ?.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cnkw1?context=5)|On gender...no way. But you can't tell the gender before 16 (I think) and so our clinic doesn't even have the potential to do that. I don't think that has ever been an issue in the US, I believe it is in other parts of the world though. But no, I definitely don't stand for that.
[What percentage of people that you counsel decide not to get an abortion? Any last minute run-outs that you never see again?  Do you get a lot of ""I think abortion is absolutely wrong! But in my (daughter's\) case.....""?  Do you do the counseling individually, or are they allowed to have a SO or family member with them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d62fk?context=5)|Counseling is individual, no one else can come to make sure they aren't being forced. So many pro lifers get abortions. We have a separate consent form for them pointing out that the abortion is against their morals but they still want it. It's the belief that abortions are not okay, but my case is different. And yes, every reason for getting an abortion is different, but that doesn't mean you are the only one that gets a choice. 
[Hi - what is your job position? are you a medical assistant?  This sounds like a field that i'd like to get into - i am already a medical assistant.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmsny?context=5)|I am an abortion peer counselor. I think all abortion clinics are required to have counseling sessions before a procedure.
[Was it posted by the IAmA poster?  If it was deleted then it probably was not posted by the same person, based on their ""scoring system"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cone0?context=5)|No it wasn't posted by me. I was a little confused by the original comment though, I'm a little new to reddit.
[What's the most common reason women give for wanting an abortion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5czfdj?context=5)|Because they got pregnant accidentally and they don't want to have a baby or can't afford it. Think of the average age here: mid to late twenties, I have plenty of friends that age, I am in that age range, I sure as hell don't have enough money to afford a baby.
[My ex-girlfriend once told me that it is her body so she can decide what she wants. She wasn't pregnant but I still thought the man should have some say in the matter too. Have you also counseled the men in the relationships? If so, what are their usual stands?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cygy0?context=5)|Most men are supportive of he decision, but they are not allowed in the initial counseling session, to make sure that they are not forcing the procedure. It sucks, and I agree that's it's a sticky issue, but if men were always allowed to make part of the decision we wouldn't be able to stop any abusive situations.
[What's your gender?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmkvx?context=5)|Female.
[How many patients do you see daily?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmt6l?context=5)|My clinic only does procedures once a week, and there's usually 5 to 8 patients.
[Do you ever have couples that come in, where the woman wants the abortion but the man doesn't? If so, how do you deal with that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d1h4r?context=5)|No, in that case the man probably just wouldn't come. The only time something like that happened was a woman in a very abusive relationship, her significant other was recently put in jail for nearly killing her. He didn't want her to abort, she told him she was doing it anyway, last I heard he was still in jail.
[Have you ever been confronted by a potential (no longer potential\) father after the abortion, when he was unaware it was happening?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d01au?context=5)|No, I've actually never had a significant other unaware, at least from what my patients have said. Most people talk to heir partners.
[Are you required to encourage communication if the scenario does arise? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5demqv?context=5)|No, because it is ultimately the woman's choice and I would have no way of knowing how sensitive the situation is and/or if it is abusive. No one likes to be undermined, we just talk about they, the women, feel in this situation.
[Why are abortions so damn expensive?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cv6kb?context=5)|Places like planned parenthood are not allowed to use state money for abortions, so that's why they aren't cheaper there. But it comes to paying he doctor, sanitization, etc. Some insurance covers it and some clinics have funds put away to help women that can't afford it.
[In my state, minors are required to obtain parental consent. Interestingly enough, one of the staff members on my high school newspaper knew a girl who managed to get an abortion without telling her parents. At the time, we were thinking about doing stories about minors who had gotten pregnant, but in the end, we decided not to run with the idea. Anyhow, this girl had an abortion in the basement of a doctor's house, which is supposedly run as some sort of secret abortion clinic. I'm not sure how well-equipped/staffed it is, but what is your opinion about such clinics in states that require minors to obtain parental consent?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cvljx?context=5)|Parental consent can be very wrong. I understand it, but the girls hat choose not to tell their parents do so for a reason. Honestly most girls come in with their moms or their parents help them afford it. We had a study at our clinic (don't know how they did it honestly) that in our state if parental notification were to pass this year (it's on the ballot) it would put ten girls a year in an abusive situation. That's not a ton considering the whole state, but those ten lives are changed forever.
[Do you support the idea of getting ab abortion because the child will have special needs? Where is ""the line"" between a special needs child that should be aborted and one that should not?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d3dc9?context=5)|Well at the gestational age I work with, it's not really possible to know that yet, so I don't directly work with that kind of situation. I don't think it's something I would personally stand for, but who am I to decide that for someone else. If someone already had three kids with down syndrome and found out their forth pregnancy had it too, I don't think I would stop them. Every situation is different.
[What about partial birth abortions? Are those readily performed? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5czxal?context=5)|Not at my clinic, we go up to 16 week gestation. I think in San Fran they do partial birth? Not sure though. But those cases are generally more abuse related pregnancies or homelessness. 
[To use framing cooked up by a National Right to Life Committee lobbyist is to agree with the National Right to Life Committee.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5delje?context=5)|Yes. I am not sure how that relates to what I said...?
[HOW you said it reinforces the anti-abortion framing of abortion as killing babies.  If you don't think early third-trimester abortions are killing babies, then make your framing consistent with your sentiment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5egtvu?context=5)|I really don't know what you're talking about. When did I agree with the National Right to Life Committee and when did my sentiments not make sense?
[In the debate about abortion, one of the common points made is that it would be wrong to deny abortion to victims of rape or incest.  In your experience, how often are your patients victims of those crimes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d3cj0?context=5)|They don't usually elaborate it. I've suspected it a few times, but it's not something people usually want to talk about.
[Probably too late with this, but if the woman is expressing any level of doubt about going through with the abortion, do you advise against it? Thanks for your work and doing this AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cyuti?context=5)|Yes. We tell them to go home and think on it more, since they usually have time before our cut off.
[How many patients do you see daily?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cxfzl?context=5)|The clinic does abortions once a week, we'll have between 5 and 8 patients on that day, I'll work with 3 to 4.
[Have you had any patients who have had some horrific experiences from PTSD or other mental horrors after the surgery? I know the doctors use anesthetics with medicines to knock you out and sometimes forget it, but it's never something you forget. Most councilors don't keep I'm contact with the patients after they leave the clinic from what I've seen, but after, if you have, have any of their post surgery stories stuck out to you? And if so, what happened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5dusbr?context=5)|I don't work with patients after, but the nurses do follow up exams and would hear from them weeks after the procedure, I've never heard anything bad from that. I have had PTSD patients, they are hard to work with, and usually get our anti anxiety meds, which is basically like half ""being under"", their memories would be fuzzy, but they are conscience during the procedure.
[How do you feel about Virginia's new law of mandatory external imaging being a requirement prior to abortions?  Personally, I think its ridiculous ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d8unh?context=5)|Does that mean mandatory ultrasounds? Or mandatory viewing of the ultrasound? Anytime you do an abortion, you have to do an ultrasound to accurately date the pregnancy. And it is hard to get a clear image from the abdomin when the pregnancy isn't very far along, so we always do vaginal ultrasounds. But when patients fill out paperwork, we have the ultrasound consent form, where they can check off whether or not they want to see the image. So ultrasounds are necessary, but women viewing them is not needed and just a tactic into guilting people.

wg3d9,6,2012-07-12,Too many things. Can't take professional help. Can reddit please help?,needhelp5678,ihaveissues,https://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/wg3d9/too_many_things_cant_take_professional_help_can/,"Hi Reddit. Any advice is appreciated.
I am 21/F.

1.Family- Dad is emotionally abusive. Mom is a door mat. They work at the same place, it is allowed there. He is above her. I know he doesn't treat her well, because I had my intership there for a while. I tell her to leave but she won't because she knows his behavior won't change and she'd rather that he removes his anger on her than others. When they come home, almost 80% of the times, they have a screaming match going on and this has been happening since 6 years. I don't know what changed then. I have sheltered my sibling as much as I could. We have spent way too many nights crying ourselves to sleep. Also, since a couple of years, my grandmother has been staying with us cuz my grandpa passed away :( We can *not* put her in an oldage home. She and my mother never got along well. She(granny) loves to brew up fights between my parents. The thing is she's sneakily manipulative and they know it but still fall for it. It's all too WTF and frustrating to tolerate. Also, it has made us very very cynical in life.

2. Me- I am moody. Very. At times I am happy, other times I am depressed. I would self-diagnose myself as bipolar, except the sad parts kick in only after bad family time. My study/career is in a major dump. I am about to finish my education, yet have little work experience. It terrifies me. The thought of working. As in I literally panic and start sobbing. I know it's pathetic, but for the love of God, I wish I knew why. Also, that internship at my parents' office was a nightmare. My dad thinks I am a useless good-for-nothing since I am currently sitting at home. Money is not that low, that I *must* earn. He just wants me out. Who wouldn't? I get that. But he constantly taunts me and in front of everyone. And then there are times when he's sweet and concerned like a normal father. My mom will say/agree with everything he says about this. I have told her a million times that her adding to it, doesn't help at all. I am a very communicative person. They know everything about how I feel. There's no doubt at all that I am very troubled by the tension in the house and how much they are pressurising me. Yet they do *nothing* to help.

3. Love- So obviously I was with a guy who loved me and never pointed out anything wrong in me. That ended though. We realized how dysfunctional we were behaving. But now I am worried I will always go for guys who give me approval. I do not want that. I have seen people belittling their own selves based on other people's opinions. Also, I have body image issues. I am trying to work on that. Thankfully I would never stop eating. Eat healthy, yes. But dieting, no way. So that should probably make me feel a bit better.


The problem still remains that I can not live like this. Constantly being driven crazy. I know I must improve, but can't handle the crazy in the house! I need to move out, but I can not afford to for another 2 years. I need to know how to cope with this, without aging 10 years, everytime they fight and create scenes. Please help!"
wg1zy,6,2012-07-12,CS Majors: Have a few questions about internships,johnnyvrotten,Purdue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/wg1zy/cs_majors_have_a_few_questions_about_internships/,"Hello everyone: hoping some people currently in or have graduated in CS who've had internships to answer a few questions of mine. I'm currently a sophomore in CS who's planning on applying for a summer internship this fall. I'm currently working on a resume and getting on LinkedIn and have been asking around for advice. I mainly use Windows and have experience working in Linux from classes. I know Java and PHP well, worked with MySQL quite a bit, am familiar with C from 240 and learned Python in the past and could probably pick it up quickly again. I don't have much work experience except I am involved in EPICS and attended an engineering camp in the past. I'm not exactly sure what I want to do with CS but am interested in web development or some career in software engineering.

1. How do you go about applying for one? Should I just attend as many job fairs as possible and hand out my resume, and wait for a call? Which job fairs?
2. Any particular companies I should look at? Should I do my research about them before attending a job fair or the interview? I hear that's a popular question.
3. What were the interviews like? What questions did you have (programming/non-programming related)? I know in a resources seminar some recruiter from Microsoft recommended books for us but I didn't know if the practice problems/tips would suit other companies.
4. How much are you expected to know/what tech skills did your company look for? For most of the skills you needed for your job, did you learn them at the company or at Purdue?
5. What was your job like each day? What did you do? Who did you work with?

Thanks a million! Kind of excited to begin the search for a CS job."

wfsiq,1,2012-07-12,Reddit what are some of the meanest jokes you ever pulled on other people simply because it seemed like a good idea.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wfsiq/reddit_what_are_some_of_the_meanest_jokes_you/,"Last week I was at the dentist and they had an intern there, my dentist asked me if I would mind if she preformed my check-up to which I replied I didn't mind, it was actually the first time she would do an entire check-up by herself so she was kinda nervous.

She started the procedure on me and was actually very gentle so it didn’t hurt at all, it was actually one of the most gentle check-ups I’ve ever had. Ofcourse at one point she started to clean up a little bit of tartar I had at the back of my teeth. While she was cleaning my teeth and ofcourse its an annoying feeling and sometimes I tiny bit painfull and I for some reason thought it was a good idea to all of a sudden yell out “AARGGH FUCK!” and give a very painfull expression on my face.

She instantly pulls out and starts apologising instantly “Oh I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to hurt you sorry sorry sorry” ofcourse immediately my dentist who was observing comes to check up what happened, at this point is by the way felt kinda guilty for pulling the joke on her’ and I just turned to face her with a sheepish grin on my face “I’m sorry I did that I couldn’t resist, to be fair you are alot gentler then my dentist is’ so my dentist couldn’t help but slightly laugh while she stood there with the tool still in hand not really knowing how to respond, I just laid back and let her continue the procedure.

After 2 minutes or so she was done cleaning and I washed my mount with some water and made sure to thank her and told her she did a really good job and I was sure she would become a great dentist.
Luckily at this point she was able to laugh and told me “Yea but I am never gonna treat you again” I smiled and replied that I would love to get threated by her and walked out.

I must say that girl actually made going to the dentist fun.

Reddit what are some of the mean jokes you pulled on other people?"

wflfv,0,2012-07-12,Advice on research and internships as a freshman?,sqrt,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/wflfv/advice_on_research_and_internships_as_a_freshman/,"I'm an incoming EECS freshman, and I'm wondering what kind of research (during the school year) or internships (during the summer) freshman are capable of doing. If anyone knows of specific professors or internships receptive towards freshmen, even those without much experience, please share your knowledge!

More on me: I've taken an intro to C++ class and know about the same amount of Java, but that's about it for programming experience. The only field I have any specific interest in is AI, and that's pretty broad. If it helps, I've taken the community college equivalents of Math 53/54/55 (and I'd be open to math opportunities, but I don't know if I have enough knowledge)."

Do I even have a chance at getting a decent job?",TailoredChaos,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/wf6mk/im_a_senior_ee_and_i_have_an_extremely_low_gpa/,"Reddit, 

I have a horribly low GPA (2.13).  I have struggled through all of my classes and had to retake a good deal of them.  

I've also worked 25+ hours/week throughout my entire college career. By the time I graduate (May 2013) I will have worked at a HVAC engineering company for two years as a Line Engineer and Electrical Engineer in training (I have been trained, but not yet promoted but they are hinting at a promotion soon).  I got the job as a summer internship, but since it is located in the same town as my univeristy I managed to make myself indespensible and they allowed me to work there on night shift while i finish my degree.  I currently work directly under the vice president of the company and have a good working relationship with him.

I don't want to stay at the company I'm at because they have a complete lack of fucks to give to any and all of their employees. Because a large portion of their manufacturing employees are unskilled workers or worse (many are ex-convicts) they treat everyone like drugged up teenagers who have to be babysat non-stop.  I see huge issues in their business practices and engineering practices, but I've also seen people point out those issues and find themselves fired. 

I come from a family who has no technically capable people in it other than me and my younger brother and from a high school that barely taught the basics, so I found that many of the things that came naturally to my classmates were a struggle to me. Combine that with a complete lack of time due to having to work so much just to stay in school and I have my shitty GPA.  Every job I have ever been at I have been bored out of my skull (including my current job as a line engineer) due to lack of challenging things to work on.  I have always excelled at work and try very hard to be the best at my job (whether it was carhopping at sonic or designing a wire mapping system for large HVAC systems).  I was taught that the way to ensure that you are never fired is to make yourself indespensible.  

I'm overwhelmingly afraid that companies will look at my GPA and pass me over for jobs that I would be awesome at!

Our university is rather small, so there won't be as many companies there that I'd like, but I have a game plan for the career fair coming in October:
1. Have my resume primed and ready. Know it inside and out. It will be unique, but readable.  I will have it printed on a nifty folder and hand it out as swag for the recruiters to use to hold all of the resumes they collect for the day.  On the outside will a diagram outlining why I would be a good employee. On the inside will be lists of my skills and job experiences.
2.  Apply ahead of time for every electrical or software related job I can find on the job sites for all engineering companies on the list for the career fair.
3. Create and have on hand a portfolio of past work and experiences to show at the career fair if necessary (I'd like to save it for the interview, but hell if I have to whip it out at the fair I'll do it to get an interview).  
4.  Firm Handshake (I've been complimented for mine).
5.  Have questions ready ahead of time for each and every company that might be interested in me. I will overlook no company and, if possible, will know what each company's future goals are. (Many companies post press releases with such information).  
If I am not offered an interview by the time the career fair recruiter is wrapping up our conversation I will ask outright.  

Do I even have a chance at a decent job with my GPA, though, or should I be lucky that I got the job I have?

EDIT: Thanks so much for the responses! I have never actually gotten this many people to respond to anything on reddit before.  Its really encouraging that I still have a shot. Without trying to be egotistical, I can say that I know that I am a very good employee and all of my project experience points to me also being a good engineer. I have been project leader before and on the work-front I am currently in charge of engineering issues for two production lines (with the ability to cover all of the other lines if necessary). "
wivgd,5,2012-07-13,I honestly don't know what to do anymore with my girlfriend and her iffy past.  Please help. ,cananyonehelp89,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/wivgd/i_honestly_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore_with_my/,"Shes 21. Im 24. 

Sorry about the wall of text, I just want to make sure every detail is known. 

Well I'll start off by saying I'm the guy that posted about my ex stripper girlfriend a couple weeks ago. I sugar coated what I knew and became a monster for it. If you didn't see that post, I'll lightly touch it. Let me begin by explaining my situation. 

About 10 months ago I met my girlfriend. Everything was great and she seemed perfect for me. She had somewhat recently got out of an abusive relationship and told me about her ex fiance and everything, no big deal. Well after about a week or two into our relationship (maybe four weeks after meeting) she decides to break up with me out of nowhere. I'm heartbroken but she calls me the next morning and explains that she made a mistake and has trust issues. She explains she just got scared and proceeds to tell me about how she stripped for 3 months from Nov 2010 to Feb 2012. She tells me that she did it part time to make ends meet during the recession and left as soon as she found another job. Keep in mind she was stripping one week after her abusive boyfriend let her move in and that he had no problem with doing it because she needed to support herself. He was a dick and pretty much gave her an ultimatum.

Well, she said she learned her lesson when she left and never went back. She said she hated it and did the bare minimum. I thought I was OK with it but panicked after we moved in a month ago. I just couldn't get over the fact that she was OK with the idea of selling her naked body and talking up random guys when she had a boyfriend and was 1000 times better than that. It just bothered me that everyone has gotten a piece of her body and now I feel like its damaged goods. We almost broke up over this but we got over it and moved on with it getting better day by day. Well I asked her, did she strip anywhere else other than this one place, and she swore she only danced at one place and tried out at two others. Well, she left her phone here yesterday by accident and some random number texts her about coming on his boat. I recognize this as someone that called the other day that said he had the wrong number and text back playing stupid. He let's me know that he met her at another strip club 14 months ago. Well, I assume he's just confused and just some creep and say he has the wrong number. But I notice there's no texts from him, yet she randomly texted him ""who is this?"" So, nothing makes sense. 

I decide to ask her who this creep is and long story short she admits she stripped AGAIN in May last year, but for only one day and because she needed new tires badly and was driving on donuts and needed to go to work. I FREAK telling her she swore to me that she didn't dance anywhere else and that if she hated it so much how could she go back even when she found another job. She says she didn't tell me because she didnt want me to breakup with her and deleted his messages because she didn't want me to think she was cheating and he was just some creep that the bartender gave her number to. She says she just danced two songs and sat around and left, not giving any dances. Which makes it somewhat worse because its like she was willing to get naked and talk to guys for like ten bucks, when she supposedly gave it up and had found a job. She says she also tried to sell stuff and give plasma, but nothing worked. She also initially tried to say she didn't even dance there, but I got the truth out of her when I said that makes no sense that she just sat there and didn't even dance. Well heart broken because she lied again (I'll get into this) I tell her were over and she goes berserk about how I can't judge her for her past and how she's a different person and how her friend talked her into the idea. She freaks so loudly I lock myself into the bedroom and she pounds to let her in. Then, THE COPS come because they think I'm killing her or something. I just give up and go to sleep. Well morning comes and we argue again and I just start throwing shit away and pack a bag and go to work. 

To touch on the lying, when I first started dating her, I asked her to see a picture of her ex and she said she blocked him and didn't talk to him any more. Well I knew his first name and thought I saw her text that name occasionally but gave her the benefit of the doubt. Little did I know, that once she did finally block him she let me know his last name in conversation. Curious, I looked him up and saw this abusive asshole has been talking to her on her facebook wall all during the time we we're dating. She also has been texting him. I confront her and she breaks down saying they had the same friends and she was staying in touch so he wouldn't turn them against her. OK then. I say don't lie again and we will be fine. But she does again about some guy she slept with, says she never slept with him in a story, but changes it weeks later (wasn't still in contact with him though) and lies about if she's still looking at the facebook of some ex friend who was obsessed with her and borderline ruined our relationship due to the way he treated her (I noticed she would look at his and her ex finances Reddit every day pretty much after she told me she didn't care about them) after then she promised to stop but kept doing it only to be caught again and again.

I understand I can't tell her what to not look at but its my laptop and she's supposedly left that life behind her. Then she lies to me about quitting smoking and other little stuff after that. And on top of it, now in her arguments she physically abuses me. Granted, I may verbally abuse her and call her terrible things in our arguments, but I see no way that this gives her the green light to scream to hug her and pull my hair and punch me. 

I'm at my wits end. Part of me says that she would be perfect for me, not considering she's an ex stripper, and that with everything piling up (car broken, long term internship away from her (4 months) coming up, me quitting my job, and me going to school in addition to moving in with her and getting a pet, that I'm just freaking out and getting cold feet and taking it out on her for her past. But another part says I should just walk away and that I'm biting off more than I can chew, and that its not fair to me that I have to date some lying ex stripper. I want to love her, but im afraid that feeling will never come back. I also am afraid I'll always have that vision of her stripping in the back of mind and grinding a pole, and its gonna drive me crazy. I cant keep arguing like this though. The thing is, this never bothered me at all and our relationship was amazing for the first eight months, its just that once we moved in, it all went down hill. 

To add some odd information, what triggered this was when she got a new haircut (with my push) she made some little comment like (this reminds me of my stripping days) and I just freaked that night after she mentioned giving someone a lap dance or something and haven't been the same since or been able to get the images out of my mind or out of my nightmares.

Can I ever love her again? Is this all just pointless? Am I settling by dating an ex stripper, or should I accept its in her past and it doesn't define her now. I just want to go back to where we used to be, but I'm afraid I can't fix this and I'm gonna have to go away for four months knowing our relationship is terrible. She was a different person back then and doesnt experience with drugs any more, but I don't know if that's enough.

So Reddit, please help me. Should I stay and work with her? Or just walk away? If I should stay, how can I fall in love with her again and embrace who she is, not hate who she was. I feel like I want to break up with her, but I know deep down inside its a huge mistake, and that's why I can't just do it. I don't think she would ever cheat on me and she definately wants to make it work. 

Please, Ill take any help or advice I can get. Sorry if there are typos, as I typed this on my phone while I'm at work. 

Tl;Dr: I have a huge problem with my girls past and minor lying problem. Discovered that her shady past was more than she initially told me and I'm sick of the lying. I'm also afraid I'll never get over her past and don't know what to do. "

I focused on Windows machines but have experience with OSX as well. Our team was outsourced to a company and we were changed to helpdesk.

I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Information Studies and I am looking for an entry level job into network, security or systems administration. I've worked with networks before including having a short internship that allowed me to interact with the OU and other parts of Active Directory. 

I am determined, catch on firmly to concepts and would leap at the chance to be a shadow/understudy as long as I could still make ends meet regarding pay. I work well with teams or on my own and do flourish if given a project that requires some thought on my part. My problem solving skills are excellent and I have been told that my solutions are often creative. I've also been doing various jobs since I was 12 and thus have a good work ethic that only improves as I know what needs done. My communication skills are generally excellent and I have the ability to be both direct and tactful. 

I am more than willing to relocate for this and would welcome the chance to get out of the midwest, but I am currently in Oklahoma. If I am to stay in the area I am hoping to earn about 40k. Leaving the area would influence that and have to take cost of living into account. I am not interested in call centers, sticking with basic desktop support or help desk situations as those are not pushing me to where I want to be and I am intent on exploring new territory and expanding my knowledge. I will gladly furnish my resume on request as I would rather not put it on here with all my personal info readily obtainable. 

Thank you for any time you've taken into reading this post and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

So I was hoping you guys could help me with getting to know these cities:

1. Is there a method to this freeway madness? I'm on one freeway, it ends, and then a few miles later it starts again...wtf?

2. Do you guys have the same problems with Google maps? I'm told something is on the corner of XY and it's not anywhere near there, etc.

3. Is there a place to get information about local events or great places to spend time?

4. Are there any regular Reddit meetups?

5. Is there a good place, other than Craigslist to find a room for rent?

6. Are there smaller CA subreddits, like burbank or Glendale? Arizona had separate ones and it made it easy to only monitor things near you.

---------

As you know I am (was) in training to be a Coroner. My education was almost complete and I had been working a paid internship with a well-known medical examiner in the Washington D.C. area.  All that changed a few hours ago when I was fired from the office for refusing to participate in, what I believe to be, a cover up. Even though they ‘warned me’ about ‘consequences’ for leaking any information about this case, my conscience wouldn’t be clear if I kept quiet. This is something people need to know.

A few days ago we received a call from the Metro police about a possible body discovered on the redline. Since working here we’ve responded to a few calls in the subway system. The first time it was a woman who tripped over someone’s rolling suitcase while trying to pass by on the escalators. She ended up with a broken neck. Twice we went out there for a heart attack. Once for a late night mugging that went bad. The poor guy was stabbed repeatedly in the stomach even though he handed over his watch and wallet like the mugger requested. So far I haven’t seen anything especially gory and it was a bit of a let down when the dispatch officer said the man was found just sitting on the train. (Is it wrong that I’ve been looking forward to a call about someone either jumping or being pushed in front of a train?) The interesting thing is the wording of the dispatch request. “Possible body.” If the word ‘possible’ is in front of body, maybe it’s the paramedics that should be responding and not the coroner’s office.

When we arrived, the paramedics actually were on the scene so we figured it was just a miscommunication and we were called out prematurely. Police tape blocked off the whole entire station platform. From our view at the top of the escalators we could tell something wasn’t right. The paramedics stood outside the door to the train car and they weren’t actually doing anything except arguing and pointing at a body slumped up against a window inside. We could have left, but since it was a slow evening we decided to take a look anyway just to see what was going on.

As we approached I overheard some of the conversation between the two paramedics. “He’s dead, right?” said the older of the two. “Dead people don’t do…that.” Do what? I thought. Once they saw us, they quickly agreed that the man was dead and promptly left the scene to us. Clearly this wasn’t a call they wanted to handle, I can understand that.

The police weren’t much help either. I chatted with the officers on the scene while the doc went in to take a look at the man on the train. One of the detectives commented that there weren’t any clear signs of foul play. The witnesses all claimed the guy just sat down like everyone else and then he stopped breathing. Natural causes, I thought, seemed like a pretty cut and dry case, but when I looked over my shoulder at the Doc, he seemed… confused.

“Look at this.” He said to me as I walked into the train. As I approached, it seemed like the man was just napping like a lot of the train riders do when they know their stop won’t be coming up for awhile.
“Look at what?” I asked.

“His eyes.”

The man’s head was forward with his chin to his chest so that I had to kneel down to get a good look at his face. As I’m doing this, the doc is talking out loud like he tends to do, just going over his mental checklist. “Not breathing. No pulse. His skin is cold to the touch. Approximate time of death 6 to 8 hours ago.”

I’m in the isle of train trying to make due with a pin flashlight since the dim lighting on the train wasn’t helping things much. The man’s eyes were open and they seemed to be staring at me. It’s not uncommon, so I lean in closer hoping to figure out what it is the doc wanted me to see so that I don’t look like an idiot and then… he blinked.

I jump back as quick as a mongoose would jump away from a cobra.

“What the fu…” I tried to say.

“Exactly.” The doc said.

“Got’ta be just a muscle spasm, right?”

“You would think,” he says, “but watch this.” He grabs the guy by the hair and pulls his head back. With his other hand he waves a finger in front of the man’s open eyes, which then began to follow along as the doc moves his finger left and right. Then the man looked at me and blinked again.

“Have you ever seen anything like this before?” I ask.

“Nope.”

“And he’s dead?”

“As a doornail.”

We let the officer in charge know that we couldn’t determine the cause of death on site. A full autopsy would need to be preformed to make any kind of determination. She made a note in the report that this body had a tendency to follow you with its eyes and occasionally blink. Off the record she told me the whole case bothered her. The man, she said, didn’t have any identification, credit cards, watch, jewelry, a phone, or even money. All they found on him was a train ticket and a napkin.

Once we had him back at the office we changed into our examination coveralls.  I was asked to deal with his clothing. The man watched me the whole time as I stripped off his business suit. He even winked at me once. Also a few odd things were noted about the clothing. First, he wasn’t wearing any under garments. Normally people wear a tee shirt, boxers or briefs, and socks. This guy wore none of those things but for some reason he had on two belts, one over the other. 

The doc switched on his tape recorder and then turned on the buzz saw. I watched as he preformed the Y-incision, and I made a mental note of his perfect technique so that I could try and do it better next time. I’m telling you the doc is a real artist.  Next came the enjoyable cracking sound as the ribcage was pried open. All while this was happening the man’s eyes watched us. I could almost swear he was smiling too.

Over the next hour the doc made notes as he did the exam. He handed me each organ to be weighed and cataloged. There was nothing strange or out of the ordinary about any of the internal organs. 

“Okay.” The doc said, “Lets take a look inside his head. I want to see what’s causing the eye movement.”

“Listen, do you mind if we tape the eyes shut first?” 

I’m trying to remain as professional as I can but the constant blinking is unnerving me. The doc didn’t mind so I took some suture tape and worked up the courage to manually close the guy’s eyelids and taped them down. Immediately they started moving fast. His whole face was convulsing and contorting itself, trying to break free of the tape.

“I don’t think he like’s that.” The doc said and then he removed the tape from the man’s eyes. The violent motions stopped right away and he winked at the doc.

“This isn’t natural.” I said.

“There’s a scientific reason for everything. It’s our job to find it.” The doc replied.

“But he actually fought to get the tape off his eyes.”

“I guess he wants to watch. Now do you want to remove the skull, or should I?”

I’m too shaken to handle the equipment so I watch as the doc works the saw around the man’s skull. The bastard is smiling. I’m sure of it. He’s staring at me and blinking his left eye then his right eye back in forth. I hear the familiar popping sound caused by the top of a skull being pulled off.

“Whoa. Okay….” The doctor says.

“What is it?” I ask as I’m walking around to see what he’s seeing. The man’s eyes follow me of course.

“I think I might have to call this one in.” 

Dear god. 

The brain was missing. 

“Doc?” I ask

“Not now. Pack up and go home. I’ll finish cleaning this up.” He’s saying this as he’s already dialing a number on the phone.

“But…”

“Just go. I’ll call you later.” It isn’t a request. I know when to shut up and listen. I make my way to the door knowing that the man is still staring at me. “And don’t say anything to anyone.”

The Doc never called me back. Each time I tried to reach him it went to voicemail. I tried to go back the next day security wouldn’t let me in the building. They said I was to await further instructions while on paid leave. That was four days ago.

This morning I hear a knock at my door. It’s a man who said he was with the medical examiners officer but he looks as if he’s with the CIA, FBI, NSA, or some other 3-letter agency. He asks if he can come in to talk. I open the door to let him in and as I do I notice two other similarly dressed men sitting in a black suburban across the street.

The folder he hands me is a case file for the John Doe that was found on the train. All of the notes about the eye movement and the blinking were removed. There was no mention of anything out of the ordinary, let alone a missing brain. It’s already got the Doc’s signature on it and this man is asking for me to sign it as well.

I try to tell him the files wrong but he holds up a hand to stop me from speaking. “This is how it happened. Sign it.” He said. I ask about the doc. I want to know why I haven’t heard from him. He says the doc has been ‘let go.’ The way he says it makes me think the worst. I refuse to sign it and ask to speak to the director of the medical examiners office. The man informs me that would be impossible and that I am to be fired. But fired isn’t the word he used. The word he used was ‘terminated’. 

He leaves when I ask him to go but he warns me that mentioning this to anyone would have serious consequences. As soon as the door closed behind him I packed a bag and took off. I saw that a black suburban was parked at the end of my street and I might just be paranoid but I think it pulled out after I did. Just in case I was being followed I changed direction several times. When I felt safe enough I pulled into a nearby residential neighborhood and found an open WIFI signal. 

I think something strange is going on in D.C. maybe elsewhere as well. I don’t know what it could be but I feel like the doc and I stumbled onto something we weren’t supposed to know about and now we’re in danger. I found the doc’s home number online. When I called it went straight to voicemail. I tried to leave a message for him but the line went dead once I began talking. If someone is monitoring my phone calls it’s possible my car is bugged too and they already know exactly where I am. 

Again, maybe I’m just paranoid (or crazy). Maybe there is a completely logical explanation for the scarecrow corpse that stares and blinks and winks and smiles. I can't imagine how anything like that could exist or why. I’m scared, really, really scared. I decided the only thing to do would be to write this and email it out to everyone I know. Hopefully this information will make it to someone…

If you’ve received this and haven’t heard back from me by tomorrow then I’m probably dead and you’ll know what I’ve written is true."

I am looking for a facility on campus to do some collaborative coding.  I expect this area to have:  a white board, a table with room for at least three people to sit around it, and a large screen where multiple people can easily see.

I am a graduate student and I am working with an intern this summer on some software engineering work.  The place where completed my undergrad had a lot of labs setup like this, but I have not found anything comparable here.  Ideas?"

I also use local super computers and servers to run tons and tons of simulations which get very monotonous. I have a lot of down time between jobs because some of these take 3-4 days to complete. 

So far this experience has been very eye opening. I have realized that I don't want to study quantum physics or computational chemistry.... I do however plan to go on to graduate school after I graduate in the next 2-3 years with my B.S. in Chemical Engineering. What is your story?

wi218,0,2012-07-13,Playing with elitests,[deleted],soccer,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/wi218/playing_with_elitests/,"So basically I'm a bored college student who is just kind of mulling along my Summer internship until school starts back up with not much football in my life. I work out to stay in pretty good shape, but I am looking to play.

At a local indoor place that I was told was starting up a mens ""for fun"" league (anyone over 16 can play in a 7v7 format, no prizes) I came across the name of a team that happened to be named after a pretty good friend of mine. We don't talk much since after high school but if we were to run into eachother somewhere we'd be pretty happy.

This friend of mine is a pretty good player but unfortunately even though he is nice, the main group of guys he plays with are pretty elitest when it comes to playing.

When I say *elitest* I mean it in the way that the only people who are good to them, are the people in their group. If you fuck up, they will be obviously put off by your ""lack of ability"", but if they fuck up it becomes a huge joke and they ""weren't really trying."" 

All of the guys in the group know me pretty well from playing pick up games and competitive leagues throughout the years against me, and they know they are better than me (they actually are). But it's just pretty dickish to make a big showing of it. I know if I don't play with them I'll end up meeting them in the league eventually and probably get my ass handed to me with a bunch of other random guys that are put on my team.

I'm not for sure that my friend will be accompanied by this group of guys, but I'm fairly certain of it. I know that I'll likely have a better chance of winning games if I play with them and it would be nice to be able to play with an old friend of mine despite these guys being pricks. They aren't horrible all the time, but if you begin to play subpar according to their standards they slowly start drifting more and more to elitism.

Just want to get some thoughts or similar stories of you guys."
wi1xe,8,2012-07-13,Salary Negotiations (moving from Intern to Full-time),salary_throwaway1,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/wi1xe/salary_negotiations_moving_from_intern_to_fulltime/,"I started interning at a small software development company less than 6 months ago (don't want to be too specific). During my internship, I was encouraged by my supervisor to apply for a full-time position in the company that had very similar responsibilities to those I would have later on as an intern. I had a few ""interviews"" with my supervisor and have continued to work my ass off as an intern to show how dedicated and motivated I am.

Recently, my supervisor told me that I am one of the final candidates for this position and he/she has asked me to disclose my ""salary proposal"" to make sure ""we are on the same page."" He/she made very clear that even after this discussion, it may be a few more weeks before a final decision is made regarding the full-time position.

How do I go about having this conversation? I have a meeting set up this week with someone even higher-up than my supervisor so we can discuss the position in more detail and my ideal salary.

All the advice I see online is to never be the first person to put out a number. Wait for the other person to put out a number first. Part of the reason for this is that you could ""out-price"" yourself if you say something too high but could this really be a problem if they already know how hard I work and how good of a fit I could be for this position?

whz58,4,2012-07-13,[Rant/Help] I've been dealing with the same anxiety on and off for the past 14 months... I'm really getting tired from it and want to move on.,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/whz58/ranthelp_ive_been_dealing_with_the_same_anxiety/,"I was caught with pot in October 2010 and again in May 2011, and now I have a criminal record that won't be able to be expunged (erased) until 2017. I've never even been a heavy pot smoker, but now every time I apply for a job or apply for an apartment, people are going to think I am a pothead. Later this year, I'm going to need to start applying for internships next summer. If they do a criminal background check, I have no idea what to expect. I already struggle with incredible anxiety whenever I apply for little jobs like at supermarkets and stuff, but I can't imagine what it's going to feel like when I need to step into the real world. The muscles in my legs tense up, I completely lose my appetite, and just the thought of getting zero interviews for years scares the shit out of me. I try to calm myself down in many different ways, but still the thought just consumes me. This has been on my mind practically every hour of every day for the past 14 months, and I think it's really starting to do its toll on me. My social anxiety has gone up, since the second time I didn't even KNOW my friends were going to start smoking pot, when before I knew it, the cops showed up. Everyone around me has the attitude that in order to be successful you need to take risks, but I simply can't have that attitude anymore. I've taken a risk and fell really fucking hard. It's irrational, I know, but I can't help it. That one night last year, I kept telling myself that the chances of the cops showing up are slim to none, my friends smoke here every day. And of course, the one day I decided to go with them, I get fucking caught. I'm the one who has to tell people that I was a pothead, me, the guy who only smoked about three times ever but got caught twice. Not the guys in college who smoke weed in their dorm rooms every day, or the people who binge drink every weekend and get close to death once a month. They can keep up their grades as good as I can, but *I'm* the one who has to ""pay"" for the two joints I've smoked. 

The ways I calm myself down are:

- Reminding myself that we live in an age where marijuana acceptance is rising at a faster pace every day. Employers are therefore more and more likely to look over my record as youthful ignorance than something more severe. They are also only misdemeanors, which employers are much more likely to skip over than felonies.

- I have options. I live in a state that is obviously pretty tough on marijuana laws, despite 3 out of every 5 college students puffing up daily. I can move out to a state that's more open-minded about it, and will maybe understand.

- I'm still young (21) and have the rest of my life ahead of me. In twenty years, this whole thing will only be a blip on my radar. I should focus on making my life better for myself forty years from now, rather than at the moment. 

However, this whole deal just impairs my ability to think clearly and reason through situations like I normally would. I'm scared of getting into any relationship, since I'll have to tell the girl eventually about what happened. I'm scared about meeting ANYONE new, because a quick Google search of my name plus my hometown will make it pop up (my town is uptight, and reports on every fucking arrest here). I'm scared to move into apartments with anyone, since they'll have to know. I'm not the type of person you'd expect to even drink that much, so I have no idea how warped some of my relationships would become with the people who still don't know. I've already lost friends because of this, but I don't want to grow up alone. This whole situation has pervaded every aspect of my life and I constantly find myself wondering how much happier I would be if I just didn't go out with my friends that one night. I already have been to therapy for this (court-ordered ""drug counseling"", but we treated it more like therapy because it was obvious I'm not addicted to anything), and that definitely helped me out a little, but the thoughts still persist. I sometimes feel depression creeping up on me, but I've learned how to make it go away.

The anxiety remains constant, though. I don't know how I'm going to deal with it once I need to apply for real jobs. I just need to keep an open mind, and let my life flow on... Any advice would be appreciated.

Edit: Just a little more backstory that I want to get out there. I was planning on becoming a teacher before this all happened, but after it happened, the chances of that were shot. I was forced to change my major by the school (since people with criminal records have close to zero percent chance of becoming a teacher in this state), and I went through a period of time over the summer when I just had absolutely no idea what to do with my life. I went through a phase where I wanted to become a musician, since I have a huge passion for music. However, I eventually reasoned through that by telling myself that my chances of getting a job as a musician are slim even *without* a criminal record. I eventually settled with Biomedical Engineering, which I am *incredibly* happy with. I feel comfortable with doing this. However, that period last summer really did a toll on me. I felt numb for weeks and weeks, not depressed but just *numb*. Like all the emotion was just drained out of me. I moved past that phase when I went back to school, but I sometimes get flashbacks to that part of my life. It was incredibly dark. I used to listen to lots of music, but I was so emotionally drained that I completely stopped. I would watch movies and start weeping at the dumbest little things for no reason, and then have no idea what was going on with the plot. I would listen to music and just hear sound, not music. It really changed me, but I moved on from that part in my life. It kinda feels like I made it out of the deep dark hole, but now I'm just in a more complicated cave with a little light here and there, even though I know the surface is just above my head."

My manager approached me the other day, and I suggested that we give the clients an option if they would like cloud based storage. He loved the idea, and put me in charge of the project. I'm supposed to research the information, throw it past the coworker, and set it up.

I'm unsure where to start from since I'm not very familiar with cloud based OS's and also server models. I setup a local backup server running sshfs and also vsftpd. It also doesn't help that my other coworker is on vacation for the next two weeks.

IS there any type of cloud based OS's and also any type of free, (preferably open source) software that will connect to the cloud, and use it as a removable drive? (Similar to SSHFS and also Expandrive)

Thanks for the help guys"
who5j,9,2012-07-13,"Probably not that important compared to other things that get posted here, but I just don't even know anymore...",ponythrownaway,MyLittleSupportGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/who5j/probably_not_that_important_compared_to_other/,"Well, this got to be a much longer text than I was expecting it to be.  My questions are at the end, but a very short TL;DR is money's getting me down, or rather, a lack of it.

It's now the 10th straight day I've really been unable to get a good night's sleep, so I might as well just get what's on my mind out there...if that's alright. [](/fluttershy)

I feel terrible.  I recently participated in a gift exchange on the [redacted] subreddit.  I ended up sending the person something that they had indicated they wanted, and more importantly was in my strictly limited budget - which I'll get to in a bit.  It seemed fine when I sent it, but then I received my gift. It was awesome: my match even went as far as to include a hand-drawn picture of Fluttershy with the rest of the gift; it's clear that whoever got my name went and put a ton of thought and effort into it.  As I see people posting photos of what they got, I feel like an ass.  I spent the most I felt I could afford to spend on the gift; things happened between when I signed up for the exchange and the shipping deadline that severely restricted what I can spend on random things.

That gets at my other problem, even perhaps the one that I am losing more sleep over because it has gone on for longer.  I was all excited to do an internship this summer and get paid for doing work that I love to do.  I do love the work, but I'm 6 weeks into the internship and I haven't been paid yet, despite repeated promises that I would be; all the budgeting I did with the help of my parents assumed that I would, in fact, be getting paid something.  I'm getting by with my savings, but just barely; in short if it's not food, rent, or something that has been built into my budget for the last several months, I need to seriously think twice about spending money on it.  What's more, it's clear that I know much more about the specific job I was hired to do than my boss does; I had expected to learn more about the industry and to challenge myself this summer, but I often end up teaching my boss things they didn't know about it.  There's no office I report to either; when my boss wants me to put in face time, I have to drive 30 miles outside the city to *their house* to work.  The description posted with my university made the job sound like exactly the thing I wanted; now I just sit in the dark and write posts that will never see the light of day.

It's so bad that I'm working on starting my own consulting business, if only because I'll actually see something for my efforts and it'll be my own damn fault if I don't get paid.  Despite all the research I've done - on Reddit, through the SBA, etc. - I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing.  I know the actual nuts and bolts of the industry; I've worked in it in some capacity almost the entire time I've been in college.  It's just, I have no idea about how to do formal market research or anything that goes into the business plan.  Also, one of the major projects that I could have used for a portfolio specifically requested not to do so when I finished that internship two years ago, and the other one is still very much a work in progress, leaving the site I have built over the past two weeks as the only thing I can really use.

In short, I feel like I won't be taken seriously enough to get any business.  I know how to do what I do, and I know I do it well; it's just, how do I prove that to potential clients?  I have a blog set up on the subject and I can talk about it for hours on end, but I recognize I'm probably screwed without a portfolio, as people only care about results in this industry, and rightfully so.  On the off chance somepony here has gone through something similar, how did you deal with not having much of a portfolio despite having years of experience?  For anyone who reads this, how can I quiet my fears about this, as well as the feeling like I let down the person I was matched with, if only to be able to get a full night's sleep again?  Even shorter, how can I feel like it's all worth it in the end?  Starting this business is the only positive thing that's happened all summer to me, but I recognize it could be a while before I see any return out of it; something that I'm fine with on my own, as long as there's consistent progress, and it all started on a whim and a realization that ""I can do better"".

So far, I'm not sure if ""doing better"" has been worth almost two weeks of less than 4 hours of sleep/night."

Has anyone been in this situation before? Does anyone have any suggestions?

I have been networking recently to try and get some work experience of any kind. I know its late but I got a final rejection rather late and so I am a bit unprepared.

I have also thought of teaching myself a completely new skill like programming.

**Edit:** Wow, thanks for the responses, it's a lot more than I expected from such a small subreddit.

I think I will also look into doing some charity work as others have suggested and learn programming in my other spare time. I am also still looking at getting some time doing work experience for free in an engineering company if I can.

Sorry if this gets a little long, I have a tendency to ramble.

I honestly do still look like a child. My facial structure hasn't really matured. I like to play off of that with ruffles and bows as of right now. Since I can't be sexy, I might as well be cute, right? I'm not daring with my clothing, so no bold colors! I'm okay with bold accents though.

I like preppy clothing but a lot of the time I don't feel as though I can pull it off. I'm also not comfortable with very low-cut blouses, tank tops, etc., because of my flat chest.

I guess my main concern is.. what do I wear for bottoms? As I said before, I'm not alright with form fitting skirts or dresses.. but those seem to be the only professional things. Or do I just watch too many movies?

I don't want to sound like a jackass or anything, but money isn't exactly a concern. Just don't go crazy on one item (one pair of $200 shoes is not okay, but 3 pairs of $75 shoes are just fine).

While I wasn't expecting a great gender ratio, I was flabbergasted to find out that I'm the only female in a department of ~50. I come from a school with about a 30-70 ratio in the CS department, so this is a big change for me.

My co-workers have been polite and respectful, for the most part. Today one of my co-workers asked about the gender ratio at my school. I told him, and mentioned that I was surprised that there were no female engineers in the department, especially since it was relatively large and successful company. 

He then conversed about past experiences, and mentioned that at his last job there was only one female engineer as well...but was dismissive about it, saying: ""oh, but she was kinda just one of the guys... drinking beer and playing paintball""

That immediately made me cringe. I am going to go paintballing next tuesday. We were holding this conversation over a beer. I am a software engineer, and participate in many other male-dominated activities. And here he is, unwittingly insinuating that I too wasn't really female, was just kind of 'one of the guys'.

I responded, ""hey, women can do those things too""...and then he rapidly excused himself from the conversation saying something about ""I hope I wasn't too sexist"".

wkcfn,42,2012-07-14,"My advice on ""how to make it""",quentinfr,FilmIndustryLA,https://www.reddit.com/r/FilmIndustryLA/comments/wkcfn/my_advice_on_how_to_make_it/,"I've seen quite a few people asking for advice on how to start, so I'm giving away my perspective. I'm sorry that there isn't a TL:DR, but it's too complicated for this :)

A little background on me: I'm a french dude who moved in Los Angeles about 2 years ago, just after getting out of film school and doing a few internships and gigs with friends. I didn't really have a ""network"" yet, so I thought, why not move now? I got a green card in January 2012 and right now, I can't say that I'm living the big life, but I'm booking enough jobs to survive.

I'm not gonna enter the details on how to get a visa. Just know that it's almost impossible to get one working on sets. I married an american and got my green card.

From the moment that I could legally work, I looked up for PA positions on craigslist and Mandy. I came and worked for free. I already had quite a lot of experience (had done a lot of shorts as a student, some other projects with friends, and a union TV show, all in france), which gave me an edge over the rest of PAs. All the free work that I did brought me paid work. I'm gonna detail my attitude below, hoping that it will help you.
Also, you want to ask everyone you know if they have friends in the industry. I got a gig on a major union show through my insurance broker. One of his clients is a very successful AD. He got me to meet him for coffee and bim, 2 weeks later, job.

So here's how to move from being a PA to being the PA that gets called back, in my opinion:

Beginner PAs will, most of the time, SUCK. They're either not motivated, or just don't have experience and you have to explain them things. There's nothing wrong against that, but it's very rare to qualify for future jobs if you still ask questions about the basic stuff. Make sure to remember things the first time, so that you can take the initiative the next.

On the first sets that I did in the US as a PA, I didn't sit. I stayed alert, close to the ADs (not too close, you're only a PA, remember it). Being a PA is boring, and boredom is the enemy of discipline! If you force yourself to pay attention, you will catch things that other PAs won't, and that's how you start to impress people.

I just mentioned staying close to the ADs. I am myself aiming at being an AD. Knowing what you want to do is important. If you want to be with the camera department, there's nothing wrong at the beginning of a shoot to go to the producer, and say:
""hey, I'd like to PA with the camera dept. if possible, or share my time between this and production"". You're a PA, working for free, no one will say no.

Another good point: introducing yourself to people is important. For 2 reasons.
One, you don't want to be the anonymous PA. I see some guys on set who show up and disappear without speaking with them more than a minute.
Two, and that's a personal experience as Key PA or AD, if I need a PA to do something, I feel better asking the guy that looks like he know his way around set rather than radio all the PAs. And that's how you start getting more responsabilities than the other PAs...

You have to be most helpful to the people that hire PAs: Line producer and UPMs. If they know who you are and like you, they will call you back. Hiring PAs is a minute thing in the production prep. Most people are nice, they will hire a few of their friends, and then hire a few good people. You want to be in this category.

As a PA, there are very few moments for you to shine. So, don't wait for order, take the initiative. If you're new, make yourself a list and stay busy. Always:
-check the trash cans : is it overflowing? Can I push trash down to make room?
-Check the crafty table : is it in order? Is the cooler still full? are we running out of water/ice? Radio the producer if so, just giving him a head's up.
-Does the camera dept. need someone to stand in when setting up a shot? Jump in! You don't even need to say anything, they will frame with you. Jump out when you see cast coming back on set.
-Do a trash sweep, clear bottles and cans from the set.
-is it hot on set? grab a flag and vent the actors/crew (ask the ADs first)
-Is it lunch soon? Check that tables and chairs are prepared, radio the AD saying ""lunch as landed, everything is ready""
-Carry a spare radio battery (""hot brick""). When someone asks for one, you'll be 10 feet away. Instant friendship.
-Be very strict on your lock ups. You don't care about being friends with the grips who will talk because ""there's no way the sound guy can hear that"". Grips don't hire PAs or get you jobs. Still, try to not be a dickhead. Diplomacy!
ect ect...there's a lot that people won't ask you to do. If you witness something, write it down to be the one doing it the next time.

Looks like you belong! ADs have their goldfold, Grips their clamps, electricians their C-47...having your gear makes you look prepared! Here's what I would advice:
Go to a hardware store, get a belt and a pouch or 2. Get:
-gloves (for taking trash out or moving heavy objects)
-a pen (several actually, people will steal them :p)
-a sharpie (to mark bottles and other things)
-a knife, or better, a small laserman (you can find some for 10-20 bucks)
-a torchlight/headlamp (makes working at night a lot better)
-small gaffer tape. Very useful to mark actor's position (remember I said to stand in for camera? well now you can mark your position and save your AD some time)

When someone asks you to do something for the first time, don't be hesitant. State that you have never done it, but be confident. Driving a passenger van or making background fill paperwork isn't hard, just intimidating. The sooner you learn, the sooner you get to say ""I've already done this, trust me"".

Follow up with people you worked with. An simple email with a resume asking to forward it to their friends takes no time and can bring you a job!

There are other ways to get work, but they're much less certain. You can track the new productions through the press, and call/walk into the office, looking for the UPM. Like I said, PAs are hire on a whim, so you never know. I got a 2nd 2nd AD gig on a union show like this a long time ago.
Working for new production companies is great. You want to give 200% because new companies won't have their regulars yet. You want to become one of these guys.

You resume:
No one gives a shit about your work at Costco. List things that are relevant to a film set. You can add a little paragraph at the top saying something like: ""I am trying to get my foot in the door, just give me a change to prove myself"". It appeals to something that we all went through.

The bonuses:
-if you can afford to fill a pick up's gas tank, then great, this is the car you should buy. Not 2 weeks ago, I was asked by an AD to go steal 2 shopping carts (don't ask, funny shoot :p). He asked me because I'm the only PA with a pickup. Being on set 24/7 isn't the best way to be called back. Running errands will give you the opportunity to chat with the producers when they give you petty cash, and, most of all, show that you can be trusted with more things that just lock ups.
-Having random stuff in your car. For instance, I have rags, various tools, a few trashbags, twine, ect...A PA doesn't need any skill, but must be able to solve any problem. Be versatile and always prepared.

Be a good person: Be nice to other PAs. If you see a job opportunity for another PA, or an AD you've worked with, send them an email with the craigslist posting. This is a basic life lesson, but if you give, you will receive.
You want to be a nice, confident person. Officially, I'm a Key PA. But I play 1st AD for small shorts. I like to bring on a PA I worked with to play 2nd AD/Key PA. Even if it's a small set and I could do call sheets myself, it gives someone the opportunity to learn. In return, these people have already started to forward me for AD gigs. They still feel too unexperienced or intimidated, so they have their friends call me. Do I really know more than they do? Not so sure.

I'm sure I'm forgetting things, but in the end, the best school is on set. I don't believe in being an office PA to get set gigs. Hasn't worked for me (I interned a lot in offices in france). I'd rather advice to find short gigs, like 2 days spec commercials, where you can work you ass off and then rest, and also meet a lot of people in a short time. a 2 weeks unpaid ULB feature, no so great. 

IT IS A NUMBER'S GAME. The more people you meet, the greater your chances. Luck is a tremendous factor in life, and especially in our field.

Finally, I'm saying this because I'm anticipating it, not because I have a gigantic ego:
If you send me a message asking for a job, most likely I won't be able to get you anything. If I can provide some work, it will go through the list of people that have done some free things for me first. My priority is to pay back the people who gave me their time. This is one of the reasons that it is hard to clim up the ladder. Everyone has a ""list of friends"" that they call first. You goal is to be as close as possible to the top of this list, but it takes time!
I can help though. If you want to send me your info, I can try to get you PA gigs where you'll work for free. I'll either be working myself on a project and need some help, or a friend of mine will. It's not much better than a random craigslist post, but at least you'll have a friend :)

I hope this helps a few people, and remember, it's all worth it when you love your job! And when you get to film a guy on skis pulled by an ATV in a pool full of fake blood. Ahhh...good times!"

I am a student with a strong desire to work in public accounting, but I am scared I will not receive an internship opportunity with a public accounting firm because I attend a smaller university.  The reason school size is relevant is because my university does not have the same ties to large public accounting firms as larger universities.  I am entering my senior year in the fall with an expected graduation date of May 2013. 

Currently I intern with a mid-size company and things are going awesome.  It is looking very likely that I will be hired in as a part-time Accounting Assistant (Job duties include entering invoices, assisting our receivables and payables manager, controller, etc.).  I know this experience is very valuable and will look awesome on my resume when I start applying for Winter Tax 2013 internships. 

*Assuming I do not receive an internship with any public accounting firm in the next year:* 

What is the likely-hood of being hired by a public accounting firm after graduating?  

**OR** 

Would a better option be to move on to grad school (probably at a larger university) and try to receive an internship/ job offer that way?  


*Also, I am really unsure how the Big 4 and regional accounting firms recruit:* 

Do they focus primarily on undergraduate students or both graduate and undergrads?

wk7ho,1,2012-07-14,Help for an innocent mistress?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/wk7ho/help_for_an_innocent_mistress/,"This is going to be a long story over the last year, and I really don't know what to do in this situation.

I've had the most interesting of years. Last July, I was at my roommate's wedding and because I was staying up messing around with the best man all night, I was in no shape to drive the 2 hours home the next morning. I had driven my roommate's car from our house to the wedding location, so some other member of the wedding party drove that because they were going to go visit the brides' parents' house anyway. I was left needing a ride back to my house. One of the wedding guests, who we will call Rick for privacy, lives near me and offered me a ride. I accepted. On the way back, we discussed how I was sleeping with the best man (who is in the army and was headed back to his station the next day). I was so in love with that man that I didn't even know what to do. Then Rick and I started discussing other things. Other interests and what we're doing with our lives, and realized we could be really good friends.

So here's Rick's story: He grew up in Texas as an atheist misfit. His father cut him off when he was halfway through college so he was forced to drop out and get a job. Eventually, he saved up enough money to move out to California. Through some unfortunate circumstances, he was red taped out of the UC and instead went to a state school. During his time in California, he completely remodeled his whole persona. He was still the shy little misfit he was back in Texas on the inside, but he was more open and friendly on the outside. Some of his old personality traits were lingering, so he was bad at making friends. He was friends with his roommate, but then his roommate got a girlfriend and the girlfriend decided she didn't like Rick, so Rick was no longer permitted to hang out with the roommate. Rick got lonely. He wasn't interested in making friends at school, because at this point, he was a good five years older than almost all of them. He browsed craigslist and found a girl to date. Turned out, he really liked this girl. After six months they agreed to move in together, and soon after that, they got engaged. She was a vet student who did a lot of externships and left the country and left Rick alone a lot. And she talked him into having an open relationship. He wasn't too keen on the idea, but she talked him into it. After she graduated, she took a year long internship on the east coast, but Rick still had a year left in school here. So he stayed behind, and she went to the east coast. 

This is where I come in. When I got a ride with Rick back to my house, he had just dropped his fiance off back at the airport to go back to the east coast. He was back in the same boat he was when he first moved out here. All the friends that he had now were through his fiance. And since his fiance and all her friends graduated, they all moved away, including my roommates, who I was really close with. So we decided to be friends. I was single and obsessed with that army guy, and he just wanted someone to watch tv with. And we soon became very close and developed a very natural rhythm. It didn't become a question of IF we were going to hang out, but rather when. Since he had an open relationship, he was open to sleeping with me. I was very hesitant at first and more than a little freaked out. He calmed me down and talked me into it. He told me she was absolutely fine with it and it wouldn't be an issue. She congratulated him for bagging such a hot chick (me). 

It was more than that, though. I don't think she really understood just how close we got. He changed so much about me for the better. I have grown so much over the last year because of him. I am so far over that army guy, that it's absolutely hilarious to think about me ever wanting to even date him. I'd never orgasmed before Rick, I never had a real boyfriend. I was scared of the world and a giant pushover. I have so much more confidence now than I did a year ago, my mom noticed it when I went to visit her a week ago. 

He understands me more than anybody else. He can get me to calm down within five minutes every single time. I have never once been mad at him for more than five minutes. I take care of him because he's a giant manchild that can't handle basic tasks associated with living like grocery shopping, or checking his mail. He would have had a horrible year last year when it wasn't for me. And at some point during that year, I fell in love with him. Real love. Not infatuation *OMGHE'SSOHOTANDGOODINBED* more of a ""I never want him to be away from me ever again"" He drives me up the wall sometimes with his insistence on being right, but there was never a point where I didn't want to hang out with him. I never wanted to leave. I've never had that before. I am an exceedingly impatient and easily annoyed person. I hated the last two guys I dated before Rick, but stuck with them because that's what I thought a relationship was. While I was with Rick, I dated other people. I gave up on them after 2 weeks each because they were annoying as fuck. I just didn't want to hang out with anyone else. Rick was what I wanted to do just all the time. 

The whole time, there was never ever a question that he was going to leave me around this time to go marry his fiance and live happily ever after. When I first was involved, I was worried I'd be hurt. And I was. It hurt to have him leave me. I was lonely, but I grew so much as a person with him, that it wasn't a huge handicap for me. Life went on. I'm interested in another guy, and Rick isn't on my mind all the time. Because I knew he was going to be happy. Right? That's all I want. As long as he's happy, I'm happy. I'll find someone like him, and then it'll be my turn to live happily ever after.

But is he happy? She's an emergency veterinarian and her internship drove her to the brink of insanity. She was super stressed out and called ihim on the phone crying multiple times a week because her life sucked so much. It really did. Her life was awful. And she was all alone, completely miserable... but she refused to quit. Absolutely refused to leave. Would it have hurt her future career very much if she had? Probably not enough to validate putting herself through hell for that year. I never said anything, because I didn't want to give him up before my year had expired. She also practically killed herself with stress over the wedding, which is a destination wedding that he didn't really want to do. But whatever, he said, it's her day, not mine. He would tell me little things about her. Most of which were negative. He's a guy that always makes fun of me and points out faults and fallacies at every opportunity, so I didn't think it was that odd of him to make fun of her basically the same way he made fun of everyone else he knows. But over this last year, I just watched. I never saw him describe her with much affection, he rarely said anything positive about her (but I think he did this to spare my feelings) and there are a lot of negative things about her. She's an impulsive, selfish, bossy, stubborn, impatient girl who drinks a lot, yells a lot, and has no interest in taking care of him. He says he's happy. So I was inclined to believe him. She has too many pets and adopts them spontaneously when they shouldn't have this many pets. They have two dogs, two cats, a hedgehog, and two geckos. She had the dogs with her during her internship. When she was working over 100 hours a week. He kept one of the cats and the caged animals. She actually went to the east coast with one dog. She decided she wanted to adopt the other one cause the dog was going to be euthanized if she didn't. I have both dogs in my house now while they're going to their destination wedding, and they're not housetrained. A chair and about 12 of my roommate's dvds have been ruined because this dog keeps peeing on them. It's over 100 degrees outside, so I can't leave them there while I'm gone, so I just have to deal with pee all over my house. 

Today, I started talking to my old roommate who has known both of them for years. She told me basically that she's been worried for a while about this relationship. She doesn't think they're very good together because the girl is crazy and I would be much better for him. I don't know the fiance very well, and I'm thinking about one of the stories from Rick's past. He constantly talks about his ex-fiance who was really stupid, really mean, and all his friends didn't want her around because she was a giant bitch. I asked why he stayed with her and he shrugged and said ""She was nice to me."" and one day i asked why he wanted to marry her in the first place and he said ""Cause I grew up with her."" 

I've already actively tried to move on, and I'm not that upset about not having him around, but I'm worried about Rick and am actually concerned he might be making a mistake. What should I do?"

wjgsy,0,2012-07-14,I thought I was going to London this fall to spend my last semester.... but the finances did not work out. What was the biggest disappointment in your life?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wjgsy/i_thought_i_was_going_to_london_this_fall_to/,"I don't come from money, but I try to be as resourceful as I can. I applied to as many scholarships as possible throughout my college life and its worked out so far. I just got a good internship at a fortune 500 company trying to save every dollar I have so I can go to London my last semester and do an internship to expand my skillset and explore my birthplace. This has been everything I've been working for over the last 18 months. I put in extra hours at work (2 hour commute) at a shitty jimmy buffet restaurant while going to school full time. I didn't mind. Whenever I was on the train back home at midnight I just thought about the pay off.... All the sacrifices I was making would be worth it in the fall.... why I was doing all this. 

Then today I got some soul-crunching news. My parents were in a jam and had to pay off some debt collectors this week or they were going to be evicted. I don't have much money, but I gave it to them. Even though they weren't the most financially savvy parents in the world they tried as hard as they fucking could to provide me and my brother with a happy childhood. What was I supposed to do?

But now I sit here just crushed..... 18 months of work, blood, and sweat gone. Going to london in the fall was the only thing keeping me going in some of my darker moments. The thought of escaping from all of my BS was a real motivator for me.... Now thats its gone I don't know what to do. I've given my parents everything (~$8k). Now I can't go to London, and have to figure out online classes while I work full time in a minimum wage job. 

What was your biggest disappointment?"

I intern at a hospital's IT Department, and we basically run off an ""RFS Ticket System"" where nurses around the hospital send in a ticket if they're having issues with their computer/software, whatever the case may be. 

Now in this program, the nurses can specify how urgent the issue is. So I got this ticket which was specified as a ""Priority Level 1 - Severely Urgent"" which means we have to resolve the issue within one hour upon reading.

I opened up the ticket, and read the description....sure enough palms were met with the forehead...

The ticket stated ""Mouse unplugged, need assistance in reconnecting mouse."" Completely dumbfounded, I gave the nurse, who sent in the ticket, a call. 

Me: ""Hi, I recently received your ticket about a mouse issue? Could you give me more information about it?""

Nurse: ""Yeah I dunno it just won't work, someone said that it might have been unplugged but could you please come down and take a look at it?""

Me: ""Ma'am could you please turn the mouse over and tell me if so you see a red light on the bottom of the mouse""

Nurse: ""Yeah, there's no red light""

Me: ""Okay, could you go to the back of your computer and tell me if you see an unplugged USB cable""

Nurse: ""I don't see anything, just a thick black cable and a blue cable going into the computer""

**At this point I'm pulling a ""Jean-Luc Picard"" facepalm as I've spent 5 1/2 minutes trying to get this lady to plug in a mouse**

Me: ""No Ma'am that's the monitor, can you look behind the...big black box...next to the monitor""

Nurse: ""Oh yes, I see it""

Me: ""Ok, now plug it in to the USB port in the back of the computer""

**I can obviously hear she's struggling, and she says it won't fit**

Nurse: ""I'm trying, but it just won't go in to the hole"" 
(Sincerely,
- She)

Me: ""Alright I'll be right over so we can get this issue resolved""

**After about 10 minutes, walking over and waiting for the elevator to get to the 10th floor, I ask her to show me where she was plugging the USB cable in, and low-and-behold she was attempting to put it into the HDMI port**

I showed her where the USB ports were, and plugged it in for her. 

Nurse: ""Now the monitor won't turn on""

Me: ""Push the power button on the monitor""

**She reaches for the power button on the computer**

Me: ""No Ma'am, it's right here""

Nurse: ""Ohhh, thank you""

Me: ""Have a good day, Ma'am -.-""

I was supposed to complete W1D3 yesterday, but was in a lazy mood, woke up at 5 am to make friends breakfast before they got back on the road and decided to take a nap before work.

I always have the urge to run again the same day, in fact, right now I'm really looking forward to running on Sunday.  So I'm enjoying exercising again, now I need to get my diet under control.  I use MFP religiously, but let slip ups ruin my mood.  I am thinking of starting the Keto or Paleo diets since it seems like so many people have had so much success on each.

wm2k9,2,2012-07-15,"I'm a college student living at home. My grandmother had a stroke recently, and a few hours ago, a large portion of her care was made my responsibility. I have no idea how to handle this. What do I do?",amaira,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wm2k9/im_a_college_student_living_at_home_my/,"I've known that my grandma wasn't feeling very well for the past week, but had no idea of the details of it. She had been staying with extended family a few towns away, which I thought was because the a/c at her house is broken, and today my parents had planned to bring her over to our house for the day.

This morning, the extended family called my mom and told her that they were just overwhelmed with caring for my grandma and needed my family to take a primary role in it. When my mom brought my grandma over, I discovered that she can barely walk (needs a walker, will fall over if not wearing shoes), can't stand up from a sitting position, etc. It's pretty severe.

So, when my grandma was napping this afternoon, my mom and I sat down to make a schedule of who could take care of her at what times. I've just started the summer quarter of classes, and nearly ANY time that I'm not in class, I'll have to be home to care for my grandma. Responsibilities will include helping her move from point A to point B, lifting her up when she needs to stand, cooking her meals, making sure she takes her medicine, helping her use the bathroom, and possibly driving her to and from doctor's appointments and extended family's house. I'll have to start caring for my grandma tomorrow morning, and I won't have anyone around to help me.

I'm a senior in college and taking 16 hours of very project-intense major classes, and my available homework time has pretty much vanished during arguably the most important period in my schooling. I'm supposed to be looking for internships now, but I won't have the time or portfolio to do so.

Between seeing my grandma in such terrible shape, and having my life essentially turned on its side to care for her, I'm having a hard time trying not to just break down sobbing.

My mom is gone from the house about 12 hours a day for work. My dad is the supervisor of his office and they're short several employees, so he can't take much time off of work to help.

Extended family runs their own business and can work from home. Their kids are home for the summer since they're still in high school or middle school (can't remember).

My grandma can't climb stairs, and our only showers/bathtubs are on the second floor. We have no spare bedroom, so she'll probably be sleeping either on a couch or a mattress we put in the living room.

I love my grandma, but as a person, I am not equipped to be a caregiver at all. I'm pretty well convinced that she would do far better in an assisted living home staffed with medical professionals than she would do in my family's home staffed by me.

How do I even go about bringing up this conversation with my family? I don't want to be such a major caregiver but I feel like I have no choice. I can't force my extended family back into taking care of my grandma, but the other option is that I sacrifice the time I'd planned to spend building my future.

TL;DR: I just found out that my grandma had a stroke and I have to spend large portions of each day (basically, when I'm not in class) caring for her, to the extent that it will negatively impact my classwork, and I start being a caregiver tomorrow morning. Our house is not set up to be accessible to her, and I don't want this responsibility. How do I negotiate this with the immediate and extended family?

UPDATE: I talked to my dad and he agrees with me, since he would be doing the other major chunk of caretaking and does not feel even close to comfortable with it. It looks like he's going to lead the charge of finding a better situation for my grandma, so any advice on what to look for in assisted living or something similar would be very appreciated!

UPDATE 2: My grandma does not want to stay with us tonight, and probably not any night, because we don't have a bed for her. Looks like the parents will be sorting out what to do and hopefully it'll work out for the best."

This is my final farewell.,throwaway261985,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wlkt6/it_has_to_be_tomorrow_this_is_my_final_farewell/,"I posted nearly 2 weeks back fixing the day I was going to end it. But I somehow could not get around to it. Feeling scared, lonely and also unsure of how to say the goodbyes. But I have been pushing myself in a deeper corner where the joy and the sunshine of life seem distant and almost dream-like. I thought getting few extra days would help me finish arranging my affairs, but now I can see that it has not. Things are as bad as ever. They might have even gotten worse since I now have exactly 5 euros on me, enough to get to where I need to go. But it also makes me sad. Not only the thought of never hugging my parents again but also the idea of never sharing secrets with my brother, never seeing my friends and never again wondering at the absurdity of life.

It was a short life. And a life that I wish I had lived with more gumption. I was scared of many things and in the quest to appear braver, smarter and tougher, I pushed myself away from the simpler joys in life. And that I will regret. I will also regret not taking risks like my brother and not having his tenacity to truly believe in his ideas and follow them through. I regret not being more compassionate like my parents who put my and my brother's wishes above everything and taught us to think for ourselves. I regret not living in the present due to the stress of the future. 

But I am also thankful for many things. I feel like I have lived through a plethora of emotions, places and ideas. I am thankful for the love of books, cinema and the arts. I am thankful for my family. I am thankful to the many friends I made in my life. I am thankful for the kind of person I turned out to be. 

But I am sorry too. Unlike others here, I do not have a moment in my childhood that I or others could point out and identify as the moment that scarred my mental health. I just have a sense of despair. I felt trapped by history and the political struggle of my people. I felt the brunt of being in exile. When your identity derives first from your political history, you are caught in the churning of history. It is a fate that you cannot escape; yet, I never thought that I would be here today. This sadness is not people-induced. It is not a sadness that stems from others behavior towards me, but rather from a self-realisation of failure. I will never be able to match the high standards and the harsh self criticism that I inflect upon myself. 

So, in all, I have had a good life. I feel very guilty knowing that I will be upsetting the lives of all the people close to me and especially my family. But I want them to remember me the way I was and not the weak broken person that I have become now. I want them to know that I am sorry that I did not tell them or confide in them my state of depression and nervous breakdown. 

Often I have seen or heard people say, ""Could I have foreseen this? Could I have stopped this if I just paid more attention?"". I want you to not be like me that way. I want you to forgive yourself. There is nothing that you could have done. Please do not live with this burden. I live with all my regrets and what-ifs bludgeoning my self-esteem at all moments. I do not want you to go through the same.

I love you. I really do. But I cannot see myself living another day more.  Remember I told you that even in my dreams I could never see myself aging. Maybe I was meant to join the 27 club. Maybe. If you miss me, know that I am around with you at every step. In that song by the velvet underground, in that chance you took in learning something new, in that extra smile at the new person in the room: I am there with you.

So, I have to leave now. I wish you happiness and the best of life. Hope you forgive me for this. It will be hard but one day you will get over this. Please don't forget me. 

love,
T

EDIT 1: I wrote this yesterday as I was desperately looking for a place to crash for the night. I woke up today and I really want to believe that things will solve themselves and that I don't have to do it. But I am running out of places to crash at and the chance to end on a high note. I fear that if I draw it out, I along with many others would suffer more. I am saving the last 5 euros I have for the bus that will take me to the end. But I hesitate. I really do. I saw my family last fall. I would be dead in an unfamiliar country and that does make me worried. Worried that they will get the news over the phone and imagine their failings, even when there are none. I wrote this not only as a farewell that I needed to get off my chest, but also as a place where my brother can find some answers. I created an account with deathswitch and he will get my account details. I hope that being on reddit and meeting some of the amazing people I did will help him through his loss of me, and then he would be strong enough for my parents. I wish for reddit's kindness and tenacity to get my family through this. 

EDIT 2: chatted with brother a little on facebook. He says he is proud of me. Nearly broke my heart. In library now in tears. It is 1.30 pm. Have to board the train at 1.57 to reach my final destination. So scared. Really want to talk to somebody and hear their voice and just tell them to tell my brother that I am sorry. But dont have a phone anymore, and might not be able to access free wifi once I get there. 

EDIT 3: Could not write out individual messages. But **thank you**. I hid in the library bathroom and cried a lot today, probably for the first time in three months. I came clean to a friend who is not in the city at the moment. She is arranging for me to stay over at her place. I will try to reconstruct my life. Going to see a counselor asap. Next week will talk to academic advisor and ask what to do. Finally asked my parents for money. Looking for paid internships for next six months. Still troubled, but I so want to live. Thank you for listening to my whining. I am not done yet. Not giving up on life just yet."
wle59,3,2012-07-15,Long Distance girlfriend of 10 months just diagnosed with 2 chronic illnesses. No idea what to do. ,milarya,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/wle59/long_distance_girlfriend_of_10_months_just/,"I'm 20 and a guy, she's 18 and a girl.

We met in August on OKCupid, even though I live in New York and she lives in Florida. 

We saw each other in November, December, March, and spent the last two months together. We fell madly in love with each other almost as soon as we met in real life, and have always wanted our relationship to last. 

However, throughout her life, she has battled depression. She hates where she lives, and she has had body image and self esteem issues. We had a chance to move in together for Fall 2012 in March, which I rejected because I thought it was too soon to make that commitment with someone who I'd only spent a total of 3 weeks with in real life. She resents me for leaving her stuck in a place that keeps her so depressed.

In March, she got a UTI. This UTI was persistant, and she had been dealing with pain since that date. She saw various doctors, and finally, a week ago, they diagnosed her with 2 chronic vaginal diseases (IC and VVS). These diseases mean she's in constant pain throughout the day, is urinating upwards of 20 times per day, and can't sit or stand for more than 30 minutes at a time. She can barely leave her house.

I had to leave her about 2 days before she had the diagnosis. In March I was offered a very good internship that was too good to turn down. It requires me to go to England for the rest of the summer. After this, I'm spending 4 days with her at the end of August, which include our 1-year anniversary and her birthday. 

The fact that we're long distance makes this issue even harder. She feels like I'm abandoning her, whereas I feel like I'm trying my hardest to help her even though circumstances have forced us apart. I've given her letters for every day that I'm gone, and I'm going to send her the odd present to cheer her up over the next month and a half. But still, this is not enough when she has basically nothing and I get to live a normal life and pursue my dreams. 

I'm trying my hardest to help her, but the fact that I'm not physically there to help her during this horrible time in her life is just too much to bear. The past week has been filled with arguments where she calls me names, says that she's done and that it's over. I'm worried about her mental state if we were to break up. Many IC patients commit suicide, and she is a person who has had suicidal thoughts before.

I'm scared. She's the girl I love, and I feel powerless to help her. On one hand, I could drop everything to be with her. But that would require sacrificing a potentially career-making internship and abandoning my schooling. For me, that's just not an option. But the alternative is just as bad -- it mean's letting the girl I love sit in a place she hates while in unbearable pain. All while I get to live my life and not have to deal with her problems first hand. 


I should make it clear that this isn't the first issue we've had. Even before this she was depressed, and blamed me for leaving her in Florida. 

Every conversation we have now is heavy and filled with the anger she has towards me. I try and be accommodating and understand that she's going through a tough time, but when she attacks me personally and tells me how horrible I am, it's hard not to take it to heart and be hurt by it. 

I honestly have no idea what should I do? Am I being emotionally manipulated? Or am I being extremely insensitive to abandon her when she's going through a life-changing ordeal that has ruined a lot of things for her? And maybe it would be better for us to break up. Perhaps her seeing me live my life causes her even more pain. But how can I break up with her at a time like this, when everything in the world is going against her? When the topic of breaking up comes up, as it often has in the past week, she says ""I'm sorry for what happens next."" I'm scared of what she might do while under the influence of this pain, anger, and the numerous medications she's on to combat her pain. 

I still love her dearly, and I don't want to lose her. But is breaking up for the best? For both of our sanity? And if so, should it be a complete break or could I still act as a friend to offer support? It's just hard to contemplate ending this with her when I feel that we were robbed of what our relationship could have been by this horrible disease. I appreciate any feedback, I'm drowning here. Thanks.

**TL;DR: Girlfriend has 2 chronic illnesses, would breaking up be best for both of us?**"
wl77r,3,2012-07-15,"Really want to go to therapy and see a doctor for possible depression/eating disorder issues, but am currently overseas living with parents.  Is there anything I can do in the meantime until I go back to school in September?",[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/wl77r/really_want_to_go_to_therapy_and_see_a_doctor_for/,"&gt;**TL;DR: I am currently in my parents' homeland in which I do not speak the language.  The system is also so that every transaction at the hospital/clinic is recorded.  I don't want my parents to know I went to the doctor on my own.  I can't talk to them about these issues because 1) we do not have a close relationship, and 2) I've seen from the past that they do not react well nor act supportive (both sisters had eating disorders and had to seek treatment on their own).  I feel like my symptoms are getting worse, and worried that by September, things will be much harder to fix.  Is there anything I can do in the meantime?  Like-- are there online professionals who can have online sessions or something?  I'm getting desperate.**
*Also don't want to tell sisters (both at least 10 yrs older, by the way) about these issues because I'm worried they'll tell my parents.*

**Details**

A few months ago I was happy, motivated, feeling optimistic about my future and slowly gaining confidence in the way I looked.  I don't know what happened but now I'm just completely apathetic, I'm kind of becoming an asshole which is upsetting to me because before I was probably one of the nicest, most Zen people you'd ever meet; now I'm totally withdrawn and haven't seen any friends in weeks nor do I want to.  I don't talk to my parents and I spend most of my time in my room when I'm not at my cubicle at my internship.  **I notice I've become quite snappy and short-tempered and it's a complete 180 degree change from who I was just a few months back, where I was laid-back and chill all the time, just enjoying life and appreciating the world.**  For example, I'll become very irritable and easily angered in the kitchen and my parents talk to me about food.  It's very upsetting because I love them and I feel like it's not **me** saying those snappish responses back to them.

I'm also struggling big time with food and body issues.  **I think about food all day and it's what my day, and thus life, revolves around.**  I'm 5'2"" and as of this morning 79 lbs, and although I still feel gargantuan, I know it's not a good idea to eat as little as I have been eating.  But whenever I try to eat the way other people do, I just can't seem to do it.  I really want to because maybe it might help my recent mood swings and drastic personality change, but I can't!  **Eating more than half a normal portion floods me with anxiety** and sends me into panic mode, and I either don't eat the next day while exercising, or I end up throwing it up...something I never wanted to do, because my older sister was bulimic.  Needless to say I don't want bulimia in my life in any way, shape or form ever again.

I'm really concerned about my physical health because 1) my head hurts all the time and 2) I have been seriously constipated despite exercising plenty and consuming plenty of water and foods that aid digestion.  I'm not sure if it's because I'm simply not eating enough mass to produce a bowel movement, or because my colon has grown dependent on the laxatives and/or artificial sweeteners I may excessively consume in the form of gum and low-calorie candies that can produce laxative effects.  At this point, it is easier for me, and often more frequent, to throw up food than it is for me to pass a bowel movement.  I also find I can't enjoy life in general because food, calories, and negative feelings about myself have invaded my mind.  So I'm not getting as much out of this fantastic internship that I've gotten over the summer as I could.  And I avoid going out because I feel like people shouldn't have to be exposed to someone as ugly as me.  Despite everyone telling me how thin I've gotten and how pretty and doll-like I look, I still feel like a monster who is too ugly to be seen and everyone is conspiring to fool me into thinking I'm not, while they're all laughing behind my back.  Irrational, I know.

**I really, really want help.**  I've struggled with food and body issues the past two years.  Some parts were ""restricting"", some parts were ""overeating"", and some parts just ""obsessed"".  I never realized I might have an eating disorder, or a serious issue with food, but in retrospect I've probably had one for a long time now.  I'm also wondering if I have PMDD, because my sister has it as well and I wouldn't be surprised if I had it as well."

What school to go to, where and how to get jobs and whatever advice you can give!",jungle_i,computergraphics,https://www.reddit.com/r/computergraphics/comments/wl0q8/another_career_advice_thread_what_school_to_go_to/,"Hey all, I've seen these types of threads before but I'd like to make a good and comprehensive list for my situation and would like to hope for the best! 

---My current situation is that I am a senior in Computer Science at a University [In Texas if it Matters]. I love animation and modelling and want nothing more to further myself in the field. I have an internship during my last year here doing animations for games for disabled peoples (Kinect for wheelchairs and caned individuals). I **love** education, and I would like to think my work history is impressive. My question to you, /r/computergraphics is should I jump into the workforce right away, get a masters in a related field, or get another Bachelors? I would prefer a Masters but life is tricky and I'll go down whatever road I can. Money is not an option. I've worked a lot and saved up plenty. I'll spare no expense if my future depends on it.

Some good schools that I know have a Graduate Studies program are:

--Clemson [South Carolina]

--Texas A&amp;M 

--CalArt [California]

UnderGrad Schools:

-A&amp;M [Visualization]

-A&amp;M at San Antonio [Liberal Arts in 3D Animation]

-University of Incarnate Word (San Antonio) [Animation]

-CalArt

-Clemson

I am aware of the many'o'businesses that are located in Austin, TX. But heck I would pack my bags to Sweden if I got a good opportunity. So go ahead and educate me and the world. As information comes in I'll update my list.

Bonus Question!

What do firms look for? Is education all that? I know experience is awesome but do schools really even help?

I don't know why I kept asking her out when our dates really weren't fun, but I did.  And she kept accepting.  I guess I thought if we spent a little more time together maybe we'd start having fun.  What a dumb idea.




Anyway, a few days pass and one of the interns at work has found the girl's blog and twitter feed.  Turns out she's posted some bullshit about how much she REALLY didn't like me and thought I was awful.  She didn't use my name or pictures, but it was fucking harsh stuff.  I had no idea that was how she felt.  I also had no idea I was the polar opposite of the kind of guy she wants.  Even though there's nothing in her post to identify me, it's still a shitty thing to do to someone.




So, of course, I'm going to do the same:  The kind of guy you describe as being attractive is not going to go for you, except maybe to fuck you once and never call you again.  There will be no relationship with him because he's already dating a smoking hot actress/model/whatever type.  You're a brunette with a weight problem and no amount of hair bleach and makeup is going to change you into a thin blonde.  Why don't you go drink a few more cocktails.  That'll help your figure.

I'm currently a CS major living at home with my parents during the semester, and living in a nearby city every summer to intern for a software company (which pays rather well).  Working this internship during the school semester is not an option, as the drive between the city where I go to school and the city I work is over an hour.  I'd like to have some income during the semester that doesn't involve flipping burgers.

My school holds a CS job fair twice a year, and I've been to two of them so far to find possible semester jobs, however every company I talk to is mainly looking for summer interns or interns who can work year round.  My current summer gig pays a lot more than these companies are offering, so I don't plan on leaving it.  They also intend to hire me when I finally graduate, so I don't think it would be smart to take a different internship over the summer.

Is freelancing a viable option here, or would it be better to keep looking for companies who are willing to hire me solely during the semester?  As far as I can tell, freelance gigs can be kind of sketchy and may be offered by people with little experience hiring programmers.  I've briefly checked out sites like elance and odesk, however a lot of the jobs seem ridiculous (I want to make the next facebook, lolz!), or the developers offering public quotes seem to undercutting each other left and right to the point that there doesn't seem to be a point in pursuing such jobs.

Is there a more legitimate avenue for freelancing, or is finding a normal job/internship the best option?  Some guidance in this matter would be greatly appreciated."

wkoxg,2,2012-07-14,Some questions about sex and long-term engagements I'm struggling with. (Throwaway for obvious reasons),hereticalthrowaway,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/wkoxg/some_questions_about_sex_and_longterm_engagements/,"So, a little backstory:

My fiancee, who are both Christian, (she was raised Presbyterian, me Alliance, so pretty conservative.) and I met on a missions trip with our college's Christian group (Cliche, I know...) a bit more than three years ago, in the spring of 2009. Without going into detail, we ""hit it off"" so to speak, and kept in touch until we ""officially"" started dating that fall.

After dating for about 6 months, we were hanging out one evening in the winter at my apartment. She ""was bored"" and asked me if I had ever fingered a girl before. I hadn't, so we kind of played around for a bit. I felt that it wasn't really right, but unfortunately, I have testosterone, and sometimes I don't think with the right head. Fingering soon turned into something more, and it kind of went downhill from there, but we still had never had intercourse.

Fast-forward another year and a half. We're both looking at what could be our last year of school, and I proposed to her at the end of the summer. Due to financial reasons, I cannot get married until I graduate college. Well, things didn't quite go according to our plans, and with internships (among other things), I'm now graduating next may, in 2013. Which is when I was *supposed* to graduate anyway, but I could have done it earlier. So now we're looking at an almost 2 year engagement. 

Once we got engaged, the temptation to have sex just grew and grew, until just this past march, 4 months ago, we gave in. She was rightfully upset, and I felt quite conflicted myself. Since then we've only done it twice more, but both are apprehensive about it, because we were raised that any sex before marriage is bad. 

There's a few things that complicate this, though. First, is obviously the length of our relationship, particularly our engagement. We've started pre-marital counseling, but we feel that the couple who is counseling us doesn't quite understand it, as they were engaged for only six weeks after meeting a year earlier. Second is the fact that my love language is physical touch and hers is quality time. When you combine those two, particularly the way they are to each gender, it makes it EXTREMELY difficult to avoid this.

I mean, my biggest conflict with this is that we're engaged, and the only difference between engagement and marriage is a few legal documents, a fancy ceremony and dinner, and what Christians say you can do. I'll go into more detail if anyone asks, to a point, but basically, my TLDR is this: Has anyone in r/Christianity been engaged for over a year, after dating for two, and if so, how did you deal with the temptations?  It seems that most Christians I meet get married barely a year after meeting ""the one"" and, as such, find it (apparently) easy to stay pure."

So I'm a college student who moved here about four weeks ago for a summer internship, and let me start by saying that your city is unexpectedly awesome. I was amazed at how pretty it was on the ride in from the airport (bridges... bridges everywhere); PNC Park is great and I admire your much-tested loyalty to the Pirates in the face of - well, you know; your museums are fantastic, and oh yeah - Batman.

But part of my experience in your lovely city has been less pleasant. Over the past three weeks, there have been four separate incidents of men making lewd comments at me. All have been in the downtown business area during the daytime with plenty of people around. Two were drive-by shoutings and two were from guys walking past on the street. I wasn't dressed provocatively at all (either business attire or jeans and a T-shirt) and while I don't think I'm bad-looking, I'm *definitely* not attractive enough to merit that kind of attention. 

I've lived in cities much bigger than Pittsburgh, and I've never - not once - been catcalled or shouted at before. It's a little unsettling, and I'm wondering if there's something different about Pittsburgh culture that explains it or if it's just a coincidence that it's happened four times in three weeks. Again, I love what I've experienced of Pittsburgh so far - with this one exception (well, and your habit of putting french fries on/in everything). It's actually kind of frightening when a truck slows down next to you and a strange man shouts, ""Thank you so much. You have a perfect ass."" and then drives off.

So what's the deal, Pittsburgh?

I'm not trying to be accusatory here; I'd just really appreciate any sort of explanation or insight you guys could provide on the matter. Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Thanks for the responses, everyone! I think I understand a little better now and definitely don't generalize all Pittsburgh guys as creeps -- most of the people I've met have been super friendly and helpful. I think I was just caught off guard since I've never experienced anything like that before, and then it happened several times in a short period of time. I definitely won't let it take away from my enjoyment of your city though :) Go Bucs!"

So today I was just doing some random research using excel and bloomberg at my internship and I came across some odd information. I was checking out relationships between exchange rates and US treasuries. Here's a little table of what I found:

http://i.imgur.com/rwHCg.png

sorry about how it looks, I got kicked off the bloomberg terminal and don't have my spreadsheet, but thats a screenshot I emailed myself. It's correlations, just to clarify. For example the correlation between a 10year US bond and the USD/Yen exchange rate over the past 5 years is 0.818

I thought it was odd that there were such highs correlations, especially with the 5yr and the 2yr over the past 3-5 years. There's even a high correlation over 10 years for all of them, but in the short run, there's pretty much no correlation for any of them. Barely enough for the .6 to count, although it's something.

Anyways, does anybody have any theories as to why I'm finding these numbers? I'm going start working on my own theory, but I have no idea. I know that the correlations may just be a matter of chance, and these variables may comove for no reason, but I'm looking for something to impress during my internship. Help me out reddit!"

wnr6t,3,2012-07-16,Question about how to handle my finances and my last year of school,dtlss22,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/wnr6t/question_about_how_to_handle_my_finances_and_my/,"Hellom 

So I am a senior at my university and I was looking about how to handle my finances for my last year.

I currently have $8000 saved up to use over the next 12 months (til I graduate).  This number will go up by at least $1000 as I am finishing up an internship this summer.  I have estimated that I will need $6,000 for housing over the next year.  Tuition will cost me $3,800 for the fall, $2,800 for the Spring and $2,000 for the summer (I will graduate at the end of summer).

So basically I will have about $9,000 after this summer, I will get my tax returns back in April (which will be additional income) and I already have an internship lined up starting in May of next year (making about $30/hour) and I have a full time position lined up for when I graduate next August.

So as you can see there is no way I am going to be able to pay for housing, food, other expenses over the next year while paying for tuition also.  I have a scholarship but that will really only help pay for my fees and such (and make a small dent in the tuition). 

I have the option to take up to $2,750 in subsidized loans and $1,000 in unsubsidized loans each semester.

How should I approach this situation?

Thanks again in advance!"
wnpg6,9,2012-07-16,Stuck on my side ,stephyt,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/wnpg6/stuck_on_my_side/,"My blood pressure was ungood at the visit this morning so I was sent to the hospital. When I got here, it was way too high.  The plan is to induce. I've been here about four hours. 

I have IV fluids and had labs (good results)  and bp is good when I'm on my side. I'm having cytotec in a few. I was 1cm dilated and 50 percent effaced. 

Honestly I'm tired and itchy from the fetal monitoring. My husband is at home cleaning up and will be back shortly. 

Eta: managed to sleep for about an hour and a half so far. Had two doses of cytotec, first one brought on regular contractions. They stopped before the second dose. A few intermittent ones after that. Sent husband home around 9, went to sleep a bit later. Midwife and intern came in to discuss cervidil. A little later,  intern came in with a really nice nurse who held my hand while I tried to breathe and stay still. My cervix moved from intermediate to anterior so that is good. I will probably start pitocin in a bit (3am my time now)  but they don't seem to be in any rush as the little guy is doing well. 

What sucks the most is the big production just to get to the restroom.  I have to unplug the IV, disconnect the transducer cables and wrap them around my neck, demolish my pillow fort and move without setting the IV alarm off. Oh, and I found out that I'm GBS+, midwife thought I was told as did OB. 

Eta 2: 430am now. I've hit the wall. Normal tampons are not something I cope with well, no idea why I thought this would be okay. Husband is on his way in. Exhausted, at a 3 baseline and 7 when contractions come. Can't stop tearing up and I feel like my body let me down. 

Eta 3: 930am. Had a good cry when husband got here. Midwife was supportive and we agreed on a low dose of morphine to help me rest. Contractions are every 15 minutes or so and I feel a lot better as they let me lay on my back with a wedge under my side. "

During my schooling I started and sold my own tech firm (high school) and was a program manager of a prestigious program within my college that allowed non-profits to have ""interns"" that could mess up and do basic functions so that they wouldn't have to hire someone that they couldn't afford with myself as a failsafe and teacher (some of these kids didn't even know how to use ipconfig let alone what linux was). I was recruited into this role because the program adviser saw that I was going through the motions of college (which I was just to have a piece of paper) and that I knew what I was doing %99 of the time. I was in charge of roughly 30 ""interns"" at around 10 installations on 24/7 on call and no pay for about a year.

My question and frustration I guess is how are the kids that I taught how to do the jobs they're getting hired for (anywhere between $40-60k/yr jobs) when they couldn't find their own feet? Am I overqualified already to be a recent graduate? I feel like I shouldn't have even tried at all now as I keep seeing posts of these kids getting these jobs and being like ""if only they knew how retarded he really is...""

wndjw,11,2012-07-16,[FR] Week 2 after Seddit,wierdo5000,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/wndjw/fr_week_2_after_seddit/,"So this is my FR on how I did week 2 after reading Seddit. I hope everyone can help me get a little better. I have yet to close any girls, I think I have just had a very bad string of bad luck.

Day 1: Train Station/Train
So I'm waiting for the train back home which was to be a long 2 hour wait and I walk and sit down next to an HB7 blonde. I open her asking what game she is playing on her phone and we start hitting it off there. She talks about her job and how it sucks to be a teacher sometimes. She was going to be around my area for an internship. So I kept conversation moving until she said the magic words ""my husband blah blah"" I didn't completely cut off conversation but I called off any chance for a #-close. So I politely continued convo until she had to leave. Bummer, almost the same as last week (If you read my other FR on askseddit)

After that, I went to go to the bathroom. When I head back to my seat I found out someone had taken it. So I spot another HB7 and plop down next to her. I spent a good 3 minutes trying to find out how to open her and I come up with a ridiculous opener and comment on how beautiful her hair is. Although I don't nervously AFC say it. With that I open conversation. We talk for a LONG time. Turns out she lives in my town so we get on the same train and we talk there. However, I ran out of stuff to talk about (when I got home I read a post on conversation threading and I wish I would have done that). She shit tests me only twice. I pass the first one, and then the last one is the ""I have a boyfriend"" Some of you may remember my post on this shit test and taking that advice, I should have alphaed it. Someone said, ""unless they bring up there boyfriend right away, theres no reason to eject"" Anyway, I didn't get a number because of it and I lamely betaed off the train shaking hands and saying its been nice talking.

Day 2+3: Riding my bike
So I ride my bike to working out, and as I was riding home an HB6 pops up on my route but going the opposite direction. This is more of a question for help, but how would one Open in a situation like this?

Day 4: YMCA

There's this HB6 that works at the front desk and I have always thought about opening her, but I never worked up the courage until now. So I opened with ""Hey, isn't it funny that you know my name, but I don't know yours?"" and she gave me her name. Since I didn't want to stick around too long, I asked if she'd be interested in going out for a coffee or something. She instantly bought up that she had a boyfriend and hammered it pretty hard. So I naturally ejected and said thats cool and goodbye.

So Seddit, I hope I did all right, please give me some tips! THANKS FOR READING!"
wnde9,2,2012-07-16,I won concert tickets after a ridiculous series of events. What were the most ridiculous things you did for a contest?,tenentenen,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wnde9/i_won_concert_tickets_after_a_ridiculous_series/,"So I was at work one day (Just some desk job where I sit at a computer all day), when for some reason my ""supervisor"" (only kind of. Also she's about 20 years older than me) was looking on Facebook for some reason. I get out of my seat and go walk up to see that she's on the fanpage of a country radio station (not really what I listen to). She also had headphones in. I ask her whats up, and she lets me know that this radio station was giving away concert tickets, and to get them, you had to follow a series clues (on Facebook) and locate the intern IRL.

She wanted these tickets badly, but strangely enough, she already had tickets that she had bought, but she was looking to upgrade to these, as they were much better seats. I agreed to help If I could.

So the first clue appears on FB and it tells us we need to go to a shopping center about 15 minutes away from where we work. So we just looked arround, and up and left work at like 10:00 AM. We got in my van (without AC on a really hot day) and  began to drive there.

On the way there, the next clue was revealed. It said ""One of the colors is red."" Immediatley I think Rainbow Foods (A grocery store in that shopping center) as red is in the rainbow. So we immediatley go into rainbow, and begin asking numerous employees if they were the Intern (I forgot to mention that the intern could be in disguise, and that it could be a worker or a customer or anybody.) We asked so many people, and none of them had the tickets, so we reasoned that it must not be in Rainbow Foods after all. 

So we left, asking other people around the store if they were the intern, including some window washers at Jimmy Johns, who were really confused. Then the next clue came. ""Another of the colors is blue."" So now were are.looking for things that are red and blue, or had red and blue associated with them. We also saw many other people also looking for the intern. All of them were teenage girls.

We went into resturaunts, nail salons, movie theaters, banks, and nobody seemed to know what was up. Then I had a Brain Blast (see Jimmy Neutron) and realized that parking ramps were often color coded. So we checked the parking garages, most of which were not color coded, but one was, and guess what? It had red and blue, but also green. So we looked in every single car and asked everyone we saw. Nobody fucking new ANYTHING about this contest, or the intern.

At this point we had spent an hour and a half looking, when we should have been at work. As we exit the parking ramp, we see a girl in a red shirt standing with her friend listening to a portable radio. They then informed us tgat the tickets had just been found, and they said so on the radio. So they get in their car, and we wqlk to my car, feeling shitty as shit, cause we lost.

As we are driving back, I realize that we never actually confirmed that these girls were telling the truth. They seemed really sincere, and sad that THEY lost, so we dismissed the idea that they were lying.

But upon arrival to the office where we work, we checked Facebook, only to find that the tickets HAD NOT been fucking found at all. I was honestly really upset. So I was like FUCK THAT SHIT, IMMA GOING BACK! So I leave work a SECOND time, by myself, and race back to the shopping center.

On the way there, I get a call fromy supervisor with another clue. ""Plenty of food to eat."" And I'm all like, I FUCKING KNEW IT WAS MOTHERFUCKING RAINBOW FOODS! And as I'm distracted by this phone call, I accidentally took the wrong exit. So mow im trying to reroute while freaking out that someone will get the tickets before me. I finally get there and park, and begin to jog up to the building. And guess who I see run into the store? MOTHERFUCKING RED SHIRT BITCH! So I start sprinting, and I run past the door she went in to the other door, thinking Ill have a better chance if im in the other half of the store. 

I run into the first isle I see, and ask this youngish girl, who was wearing a UofM shirt, shopping cart full of food, ""Do you have k102 tickets to see Kenny and Tim?"" And she hesitates for a second, and a smile creeps upon her face as she says ""I do."" At this point im hufging and puffing and super happy. I fall back onto some Uncle Ben's minute rice to rest. Then RED SHIRT Cunty McCunt turns and runs down the isle, and sees me with tickets in my hand and horror fills her face as she realized her evil plot had failed, and she had lost. 

I returned to the office in triumph with tickets in hand. I ended up keeping the tickets, because the very next morning, there was another hunt for the intern, and my ""supervisor"" and her husband found them on their way to work. Go figure. I gave the tickets to my sisters instead of selling them for like 200 bucks, cause thats just how I roll, motherfuckers.

TL;DR: I beat out the bitch, without profit.

wn9py,0,2012-07-16,[FR]s: GET YO SWAG ON!!!,[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/wn9py/frs_get_yo_swag_on/,"Ok, I’m especially talking to you guys (and gals!) who are struggling with AA.  The attitude that I’ve adopted for this summer is one that I think would be helpful to anybody who gets the heebie jeebies from the idea of talking to a girl (guy) they don’t know.

I’m a 21 year old straight male student.  I moved to a new city this summer – for only the summer – for an internship.  Before I even arrived, I decided that summer 2012 would be the summer that I forced myself out of my social comfort zone.  I made a pact with myself that, each day in June, I would do one thing that forced me out of my comfort zone.  Here’s how I kicked it off… Prepare to laugh at me.

[FR1]: I thought of this the night before in my hotel room on the way to the aforementioned new city.  I would highly recommend it (but wait until you read it – you’re gonna think it’s goofy!).  I needed something that would simulate approaching a girl, but there was no way I could have worked myself up to do the real thing at that point.  So what would (a) make me say something that made me uncomfortable to a stranger (b) force me to be outcome independent?...

When I wake up in the hotel room the next morning, I'm already thinking of what I've decided to do.  I get ready, take my stuff out of the room, and throw it into the car. I head toward the hotel entrance, where my goal awaits.  A few steps from the door, I turn around, get into the car, and contemplate driving away.  I force myself back out of the car.  I kid you not; I repeated that same little dance three fucking times.

The fourth time I approach the entrance, I go all the way in, and wait for an older couple to finish talking to the concierge, who happens to be the subject of my scheme.  She’s actually probably about my age and not totally unattractive, but that’s irrelevant for my purpose.  When, they’re done, I approach the counter.  I look the concierge in the eye, and say in my best metallic voice, “I-AM-A-ROBOT.”  I immediately turn towards the door to walk out while the concierge stifles a bemused guffaw.  I don’t look back.

What I think is awesome about this exercise for people in the early stages of working through AA is that, yeah, you have to put yourself out there, but it’s much easier to convince yourself to do this than to walk up to a random girl in the coffee shop because you can tell yourself going in “Hey, [your name], all you have to do is look this person in the eye and recite this predetermined line, and then you can just walk away.”  Baby steps.  Also, it forces you to be outcome independent – because how the hell could you expect a positive reaction to something this dorky/weird?

Over the next weeks, I set more goals.  Sometimes, I chickened out.  Sometimes things fell into my lap and it was easy to ask for a girl’s number or flirt.

[FR2]:  Later in the month, I’m out with my cousin, who’s 32, but has the lifestyle of someone just out of college.  We’re at a bar near a large university, with a lot of students around.  Full disclosure: I’m about 4-5 drinks in, so some of this courage is synthetic.  We do some mingling with some friendly dudes and maybe a dudette or two, but it’s getting late and we both decide that we want to flirt with some girls.  We spot a booth of four girls (closer to my age than his), HB7, 5, 7.5, and 4.  He advises that we place ourselves strategically closer to them, so we walk over to sit at the booth behind them, him facing their booth and me looking the other way.  We debate whether or not a group of girls like this wants to be approached by a guy they don’t know.  

I say, “You don’t think that group would be receptive to me walking up and talking to them?” He replies, “Really, the best you can do in a situation like this is sit back and wait for an opening in their conversation that gives you a reason to talk to them.”  I guess I have a flare for the dramatic: As he finishes his sentence, I stand up and step in front of the girls’ table.  “Hi, my cousin right here thinks that you guys would not appreciate it if I tried to flirt with you” (he cracks up in the next booth).  They laugh, and ask me about myself and I do the same for them. Things start off hot, but I’m nervous and it shows.  I’m not sure who to look at and I’m super conscious of trying to keep the conversation going.  Eventually they pretty much stop taking me seriously and the bar closes anyway.

My cousin and I head to a restaurant near the bar and sit outside for some late night grub.  I say something humorous to him about getting relationship tips from Seinfeld and the HB7 sitting with her friend HB7.5 behind him turns around and smiles.  I jump on the opportunity.  “What, you don’t think Seinfeld can tell you how to run your life? (or something like that)”  Our groups converse for a little bit.  We end up leaving, but when we’re a block away I decide I want to do one more courageous thing for the night. “I bet you I’ll go back and ask for those girls’ numbers.”  My cousin doesn’t believe me (or he pretends not to).  I walk back to the restaurant and put my hand on the girls’ table.  “HEY. My cousin bet me I was too scared to ask for one of your numbers” (pretty much the same strategy as before). They laugh.  “Well, which of ours do you want?”  At this point I got super awkward and said something like, “Um, well, I guess yours (gesture to one of them), not that you don’t seem nice (gesture to the other)” (with a smile on my face, so they might have thought it was kind of funny). Obviously, I should have asked for both.  But I wasn’t turned down :)

The point is, follow my attitude, not my actions.  Right now, I’m super crude, and sometimes awkward, but I always say yes to opportunities to practice. I even called the girl from the restaurant the next weekend and left a voicemail inviting her to a houseparty, knowing full well she probably wouldn’t call back due to my awkwardness/the amount of time that had passed since we last talked.  Practice.  I haven’t read the book, but apparently, in The Tipping Point, Malcom Gladwell theorizes that you need to do a thing for 10,000 hours to become a genius at it.  I’m making it my goal to just get my number of approaches up.  The more times I do it, the better I’m gonna get at it.  Once you adopt this attitude, I swear to god, it’s so fucking fun.  You can do it in other arenas of life too: Whenever I have chance to call someone who I don't know at work (which, believe it or not, is something that used to make me nervous), I latch on to it.  I wake up every morning excited to find a new way to challenge myself.  And I have gotten a lot better at approaches, I’ve since gotten a couple more numbers/taken a girl I didn’t know home from a house party.
If I can do this stuff, you probably can too.  You aren’t a special case :)

P.S.: Any advice on approaching groups of girls?  What about on talking to girls older than me (25, 26)?  Any other thoughts?

tl;dr:  I worked hard – read the damned thing!"

wn15c,0,2012-07-16,"[24/M] hooking up w/ a co-worker [22/F] I'm moving away soon, don't know what to say",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/wn15c/24m_hooking_up_w_a_coworker_22f_im_moving_away/,"Hey- first time posting in here, thank you for helping me out.

So I've been working for the summer in Portland at an internship while I'm in between my 1st and 2nd year at a grad school in Boston. I hooked up with one of the other summer interns (who just graduated undergrad and lives in Portland permanently) about a month ago and we've been hanging out a lot since.
I don't think either of us would say we're ""a thing"" or more than just friends who have hooked up a couple times, but I'm starting to catch serious feelings for her. I move back to Boston in 2 weeks for my 2nd (and final) year of school. 
I know there's not much hope of us continuing anything while I'm back at school, due to being on literally opposite sides of the country. Also, just in hanging out, I get the sense that she is not as much into me and I am into her. I think in her mind we're just hooking up, but in my mind she's someone I could see myself getting very serious with. 

For example, we were hanging out in the park the other day, and I had one of those moments where I was looking at a beautiful landscape, on a beautiful day, and she looked amazing sitting next to me. I wish I had a picture of it. I leaned over and gave her a quick kiss (because it was one of those ""life is good"" sort of moments), and, while she didn't say anything, she stiffed up a bit, and seemed a little tense, just by body language. 

I don't want to freak her out by telling her I think about her all the time, especially since I'm leaving soon. But, I feel like I should say something. It's a significant possibility I'll end up in Portland after graduation in May, and I guess I'm just trying to feel out how she feels about everything- I just don't know how to put my feelings into words in a way that isn't too intense and won't make her feel pressured to make any promises or anything like that. 

Ideally, her response would be something like ""I've liked hanging out with you too and I really hope sometime soon we end up in the same city again. Let's stay in touch because I really like talking to you"" (as opposed to ""It was a mistake hooking up with you and now you've become way too attached. You're leaving in 2 weeks, and I was just trying to run out the clock, but now that you said something, bye and have a nice life""...I have a very ""worst case scenario"" kind of mind). 

**tl;dr:** casually hooking up with a co-worker- became attached- moving away in 2 weeks and don't know how to express my feelings without freaking her out.

I just finished my sophomore year in high school, and I've been looking for new ways to further my programming knowledge and/or get an internship or a job pertaining to my field.

It might be a little too late to find an internship for the summer, but I still see listings on certain internship websites (i.e. internships.com) for internships. I'm not sure if i'm too young to be hired to program or not. However, I still believe I am able to be an asset for a company. I would mainly like to know where exactly to start when looking for a job for programming as a high school student.

wmfao,1,2012-07-15,Attemping To Restart,oneupshroom,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/wmfao/attemping_to_restart/,"Hey guys.
A little background info:
Male, 21, 5'9, ~215lbs, Vegetarian (no fish either!)

Coming into the year 2012 I was around 240 lbs. So far through the year I had lost 25ish pounds. This sounds all well and good, except that was pretty much done in the first two months of the year. I made pretty drastic changes... such as cutting out soda completely, eating super fresh and healthy, and going to the gym.

Well, my gym buddy and I kinda tapered off because we had two totally different schedules, and with that kinda came everything.

I stopped eating as well and kinda just slid by on junk food. I still don't really drink soda (maybe 1 or 2 a week). 

How do I restart and get back in the game? I currently live with my family while attending school, so it's harder to get my way when buying food... especially in the summer while I don't really have a job but am rather doing an internship. 
Edit: I should mention that my internship is a desk job, so not on my feet at all there.

My family typically just buys quick and easy food and doesn't cook, things like oreos, cheetohs, crackers, ice cream, etc... Very little fruit and veggies.



I know this isn't structured the best, so I'll try to outline what I'm asking:

1. How do I restart a weight loss and convince my family to buy some healthier things at the store?
2. Does anyone know a good place to find lower carb vegetarian recipes that aren't too difficult to make? 
3. Focus on Cardio or Weights for weightloss? Or both?

Thanks for any information you can give me!

wq4kn,5,2012-07-17,I've had two partial lung collapses and a thoracic lung surgery in the past two years. AMAA,JesmasterAgain,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wq4kn/ive_had_two_partial_lung_collapses_and_a_thoracic/,"Since people are interested, I going to tell the ordeal from the beginning.

The pain started Feb of '11 as I was walking home from the bus stop.  I wouldn't really describe it as much as pain, but more of an ache, and it almost felt like my left shoulder joint was sore, almost like I had pulled it.  The pain became a little worse, but never more than a 4 (out of 10) that night, and neither I nor my mom (a retired navy operating room nurse) was worried.  Early that morning however, things got interesting.  Well, it was more like 1 am because I had procrastinated on a school project.  Anyways, I called my mom because my heart was sounding funny.  Funny as in you could hear it making a little farting noise from 5 ft away.  Also, it was bouncing against my chest wall, and I could almost feel bubbles in my chest.  We decided to wait a little while for me to try to get some rest; if I was going to die, I wasn't going to die tired.  

We drove to the hospital that morning, and the pain had increased quite a bit.  It was more of searing stabs than moderate aches and throbbed, especially when I breathed in, but lessened when I breathed out.  It seemed worse when my heart raced faster, like when I got out of the car.  The pain felt like the artery at the top of my left shoulder was being pressed.  When I got in the emergency room, they hooked me up to the normal monitors.  I was pretty chill at this point.  I'm thinking, if I die of a heart attack, at least I'll be over it.  The heart rate monitor starts beeping.  I was so chill I was at 45 bpm, and it thought I was in trouble.  The older ER nurse had a pretty good idea about what I had, but the X-ray confirmed it.  I had a very hard to see partial collapse.  I also found out, after getting a cardiograph, that the air had caused a meniosteinal crunch from air being near the heart cavity.  Just my luck, every doctor and intern in the hospital wanted to hear it, and I was inundated by countless stethoscopes.  The treatment involved an oxygen mask and rest.  Sadly, I did miss going paintball with my friends that weekend for my birthday, but I was back to running a few weeks after.

Skip ahead 11 months.  I had a bit of a cough, but nothing too serious.  I did have another school project again though.  I began to get the ache again one night.  When I layed down, the characteristic bubbles in my chest returned (think having gas, but near your sternum).  I immediately guessed it was another one of these (same lung, same pain) and wondered if I could just ignore it.  The pain soon became heard to ignore, and the next morning I was back.  Since they  definitely knew what it was this time, I didn't have to deal with all of the heart-related stuff.  They put me on oxygen again, and scheduled a VATS( no not fallout, but video-assisted thoracic surgery).  I had to wait for the surgery in February (thankfully after exams).  

February, and my birthday, finally came and I had to go in for surgery.  They put me in a bed, my friends dad, the anesthesiologist, injected a bunch of syringes in my IV, and I next woke up really cold in recovery.  The guys there were just covering me with blankets.  My memory was fuzzy, but improved after getting to my room.  While I was out, they had put my chest iin a clamp, made two holes through my chest wall for chest tubes, and used a camera as well as a cutter and titanium mini staple sewing machine to cut out my bad tissue, bubbles in the lung called blebs, and then put it back together.  It sounds bad, but they only removed a very small amount.  They also roughed the lung wall up at the top so it would heal and cling to the lung, keeping it from falling down. When I woke up, I had two drainage tubes going throughout the left side of my chest cavity.  Both started midback, with one reaching the bottom of my lung, and the other the very top.  The tubes were the thickness of garden hoses, but less forgiving.  When I moved, I could feel them pressing against the chest wall.  They also went between my ribs.  Try to put a thumb between your ribs and you'll know how this feels.  After a couple morphine infused days I could go home.  After getting the tubes out, I felt fine.  I still have  numbness and soreness on my chest because some nerves were severed, but for the most part I'm fine and back to normal, able to run 7 min miles, etc.

Before I went to surgery, I thought of a joke to tell the staff, something like ""surgery?  I'm going to miss my Pilates."" I'm a guy, btw.  When my mom and I went back to the follow up, we saw a couple of guys from recovery that recognized me.  I had no idea who they were.  They had helped when I had first come out of surgery, and then we had talked for almost an hour.  I had no idea.  They asked if I had made it to my Pilates."
wpwl6,0,2012-07-17,What should I lookout for next!,LogicalZim,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/wpwl6/what_should_i_lookout_for_next/,"Well, life as always has been a big rollercoaster of awesome and suck. But now that I have finished Highschool most of the things I was worried about turned out okay.

* I have a summer internship that is guaranteed for 3 years in a row.
* I have a full ride through college as long as I maintain a 3.5 gpa or above.
* My roommates seem okay...

What I'm concerned about is that I can't find something to be concerned about. What problems will I face in college? Learning has always come easy to me and I haven't really developed any study habits but that doesn't really throw me off since I have 2 semesters of courses that I would find easy or simple to build up a decent study habit (my hardest course would be computer architecture or discrete computational mathematics).

I'm a CS major, and I'm terrified of not knowing what to be terrified about.

I'm looking at correcting those mistakes with a proper education that will eventually lead to a BS in Computer Science.  

I know quite a few of us fear that people won't want to hire in that 30-something intern, or will be ridiculed by their younger colleagues. I'm hoping that maybe there are a few people out there in the redditverse that could change this mindset of these people; including myself. 

A friend of mine recently got a decent degree in web development at 35 and said he has the hardest time fitting in at his new job since most of his co-workers are 10 or even 15 years younger than he is, and they like to make snide remarks now and then about his age and when he finally got a degree.

wolel,1,2012-07-16,Working in California under age 18?,walkerneo,legal,https://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/wolel/working_in_california_under_age_18/,"I'm 17 and have been looking for work or an internship in programming / web development. 

The first company I applied for interviewed me a couple times and didn't know much about what needed to be done considering I'm a minor, so they did a quick search and printed out a work permit and permit to employ that I needed to fill out and have signed by the school district. This seemed to be in line with what I thought needed to be done to work as a minor. 

Now, I applied recently for another job to help construct a website for a lawyer firm. I interviewed with them today and was told I would intern for a week to see if I could do what needed to be done. The only thing I'd filled out for the firm was a basic application. I was given a desk to work at and spent today installing the software I would be using and reading api docs for the various services that would need to be utilized. I told the guy I interviewed with about the other internship I applied for and mentioned that, because of certain things, one of them being that it's a paid internship, that were I to be accepted there, I wouldn't be able to intern for him. I had mentioned that the other internship was paid because, during the interview, when asked about pay, I had mentioned that my primary goal was experience and was under the impression that said internship would be unpaid. In responding, he said that the internship WOULD be paid and that they don't do unpaid internships anyway. 

The lawyer (man above) has been really nice, and I like the office, so I am in no way under the impression that I'm going to be cheated for whatever ""work"" I'm able to do, but I still would like to ask about things for the sake of knowing about them. 

First, can I be considered employed or interned there without having filled out and signed the work permit papers? 

Second, is there something in the laws about the first week, where after the first week I would need to sort things out? And are internships for minors required to be paid? 

As I said, the guy is a lawyer, so I would bet that he knows what's needed and what isn't, but again, I'm asking for the sake of my own knowledge."

I can't find any motivation at the age of 23 with just a semester left to complete my CIS degree. Right now I'm currently working for a manufacturing company as an intern at the IT help desk.  It's simply boring.  I'm not given enough permissions just because I'm an intern. I feel as though I'm stuck.  Can't do any minor tasks such as laundry, dishes, cooking, practice programming, or working out (given up on this fairly recently). When I get home there is nothing I want to do except either lay down or play video games (I love them but I feel like they'll get me nowhere. Playing too much LoL at times). It's one of the reasons I got into computer programming, but I feel like I made the wrong choice and I'll just be stuck in a cubicle.  I know the field is very promising I just can't seem to motivate myself to expand my knowledge on the subject.  I want something to live for just can't find it.

Don't really have a girlfriend just been sexing up this older woman about twice my age although she is quite sexy I can't see myself relating too much with her.  Weekends are literally a blur because I'm getting drunk at night then dealing with hangovers during the morning and day.  The only thing I'm looking forward to is a vacation, which is only about 2 weeks away just to get away from the norm.  

Maybe I have one goal, but I can't seem to figure how I'd go about doing it.  It requires money and lots of time.  I'd love to travel to different countries.  Just to meet interesting people from different cultures, but I got a little bit of social anxiety with not knowing what to talk about half the time when I'm spoken or approached to.

Arrrrrgh. I just feel really stuck in a routine that will never end right now and I can't stand it.

1. Web Development (lots of jQuery, PHP &amp; Coldfusion) 2. Mobile Development (No experience) 3. Security (No experience) 4. Parellel Programming (No experience)

Beyond course work my internships entirely consisted of web development and IT support, I've done lots with OOP and MVC (building a CMS for the USDA), YII, Coldfusion etc... but I am not sure how I can tailor that to applying for jobs.

My main questions are:

1. How do I find a job before I graduate that will start after I graduate?

2. I'm going on a fantastic honeymoon, and won't be able to start for 1 month after graduation. Will this be a problem? Graduation is around May 10, I won't be able to start until after June 10. Will most employer's care?

3. When do I start applying for jobs?

4. I have lots of experience, lots of people have told me to come talk to them at the career fair when I'm ready to graduate--How do I sell myself to them?

5. I'm looking at Continental United States, but will prioritize companies in Arizona (Phoenix area), Colorado (anywhere), Dallas or Austin or somewhere without beaches or snow. What's the job market like for Web Developers across the country?

6. How hard will it be for me to get a job given 6 years IT/Web experience + a 4 year degree @ 24?

wqwve,3,2012-07-18,"my partner wants to go from living together to apart, is this normal?",rshipsthrwy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/wqwve/my_partner_wants_to_go_from_living_together_to/,"Right now my partner (m/21) and I (f/22) live together with separate rooms, along with his friend (m/19). We have been together about 7-8 months. 

It might be important to note that we have separate bedrooms and only got together after living as housemates for 1.5 years. 
we are both very busy, he has 2 jobs and goes to college full-time and is starting more extra-curricular activities soon, and I work part-time, have an unpaid internship and also have full-time college. 

The guy we live with is aggressive and rude, and in his most recent incident went from being nice to throwing furniture around the living room within 3 hours. He earns more than me and is eating my food and making my partner and I pay bills he should be contributing to.

Our lease ends in December and I began asking my partner if he wanted to live with me if I moved out of our current place, considering how unsafe I feel here. Originally my partner said yes, but then changed his mind and waited a few weeks and told me a few days ago that he wants to live separately next year. 
The reasons he used were things he had never brought up before - that he feels like he's walking on eggshells (I have PTSD in regards to previous sexual and physical abuse and have recently asked him to not do drugs around me right now, I think that was the main reason he said this though I'm not sure) and ""feels like we're married"" but won't elaborate on what that means. He has also said he ""feels it would be better for the relationship"" because we wouldn't be able to fight if we lived apart (?) and that he is worried about breaking up while we live together.


I feel abandoned. I genuinely feel unsafe here and I think that's reasonable. But I know that despite my boyfriend thinking he will be able to find time for me between post-grad work and 2 jobs, we won't see each other much at all. and without him, I don't have anyone I could live with. He is really bad with time, and is always dramatically late for things, is generally unable to keep appointments, and doesn't have any time for anything as it is. honestly, I don't want to deal with that in the future.

I have told him I feel abandoned, and that it's unfair he is choosing to live here instead of finding a place with me, and that the reasons he's using could have been fixable if he'd just told me. I have also said I'm unprepared to move this relationship backwards but he doesn't seem to understand any of it. I have also said that I don't know if I want to be with someone who is willing to leave me out in the cold like this - I don't have much chance of finding a place with my financial restrictions and no friends that are able to move out with me.

Is there anything I can do or say to fix this situation? Is there any sort of compromise possible that I'm overlooking? Is there any way I could magically make him understand and still want to live with me?

I don't want to break up with him when I move out and he can't find time for me, but I don't want to be the girlfriend sitting at home waiting for her boyfriend to be free either, especially after he's just left me to fend for myself like this.

TL;DR boyfriend has decided we should live separately despite me wanting to live with him. he has 2 jobs goes to college full-time and won't have enough time for me. Is there anything I can say or do, or any compromises that we could reach?"

Almost done with 2nd degree in SoftEng,Sforza,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/wqslk/career_change_advice_almost_done_with_2nd_degree/,"I've been working on completing a BS software engineering course after work over the past two years, and this is my last year. My current job at the moment is an (online) marketing manager for a hotel chain, although my first degree was in Political Science. My problem is that I'm 28, so I can't bounce around from one job to the next every year or so. I took up a 2nd degree because I find what I do currently to be unfulfilling, and I've always liked programming.

My question is: Do you think I'll be able to leverage previous job experience (mostly in the hospitality industry and HR) to get slightly better pay than others who are looking for entry level work? Ideally, I'd like to code but not spend all day doing it. I'm not sure how to go about my upcoming internship requirements either, because obviously I'd have to resign from my current job.

I was recently offered an internship by a guy at a company I've known quite awhile. Officially, I don't know if the position is technically ""web development"", but I figured given what I'll be working with it would be close. My primary duties would include:

Source Code management (Git, SVN, JIRA)

Bug ticket management

HTML5

Learning stuff by playing with code

CSS/JS/AJAX

Python

Linux/Puppet admin

Cloud stuff (Amazon EC2, Linode, Heroku)

NoSQL databases

RDBMS

Documentation, diagramming, flowcharting

In addition to some more ""interny"" jobs such as taking the office dogs out for a walk, picking up lunch, and listening in on client meetings just to get a feel of what the company and I will be working on.

The job requires no prior knowledge of any of the above languages or frameworks. It's really a great opportunity I want to get involved in, but how much should it pay? 

Looking at [this](http://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/web-developer-intern-salaries-SRCH_KO0,20_IP2.htm) site reveals somehwere in the 12-20 dollar range, but I feel anything above maybe 13 is too high. I do know some people currrently in internships getting paid $15-$20. 

For reference, I live in Southern California (Orange County) and I'm a third year CS student at UC Irvine

Thanks!

I treat musculoskeletal conditions of the spine and adjacent regions using therapeutic exercise, myofascial release, at home recommendations, and yes spinal manipulation.

Proof [1 diploma!](http://i.imgur.com/8Uu9F.jpg), [2 license!](http://i.imgur.com/MOGWt.jpg), [3 http://i.imgur.com/db14R.jpg!](http://i.imgur.com/db14R.jpg).

I have a bachelors degree from a moderately rated state school in biology and attended Logan College of Chiropractic.  During my time there I tutored, participated in an internship, and what the school called equivalent to residency (totally not).  I argued with teachers who presented crazy stuff with no proof or evidence and was even threatened for this by a 'professor'.  About 1/4 of my education (~4500 hours) was crap that could be thrown out and evidence based medicine taught in its place.

I often get asked why I went into chiropractic and I had a great experience working in a chiropractic office after undergrad so I really enjoy what I do, but not the closed doors and instant skepticism of me based upon my profession.

In the end I like what I do but wouldn't recommend it to most people, lots of other professions out there with less hassle and better job prospects.

FWIW I will never use the term subluxation unless we are talking about a TRUE partial dislocation but I have only seen that in radiology cases and never in practice, if I did they are getting referred to the ER.

Well enough about me, bring on the questions.  I promise I won't be offended so ask anything about chiropractic education, practice, quacks (I have met my share), its future, or its past.

Edit: Alright folks it is about 1 AM in my neck of the woods so I am going to call it a night.  Feel free to post up more comments/questions and if I get time tomorrow I will be sure to respond."

Do you guys have any case studies or links to where I can get more compelling arguments for the switch? It is a small business but I don't expect them to be small forever.. not to mention I wouldn't want to take care of a workgroup that large myself."

So much differently that i always felt as if i was pushed into a corner and forgotten about. It wasn't only my father, though, it was my mother. Several fights ensued because of this feeling and i was just forced to deal with it. My grandpa, who is my fatherly figure kept telling me ""One day you'll understand why it is like this."" I always assumed it was one of those ""when you're a parent you'll understand"" type deals.
When i was 16 i moved to Virgina, with my uncle, and did some internship work. During that time my great grandmother died. We were trying to make arrangements to get to the funeral. My mom, refused to let me go to my grandparents with my uncle for one night. An argument developed between my uncle and mom. My uncle (mind you my uncle is an awesome man who means no ill intentions), in a fit of rage, said ""If you don't settle down i will tell him."" After the argument came to a halt, because mom hung the phone up on him, i said to my uncle ""Tell me what?"" He looked at me and said B(We will call him B, the man who i thought was my father) is not your real dad. There was the huge wave of emotion that hit me. Confusion, frustration, sadness, and yet a feeling of understanding, overwhelmed me to the point where i lost it. I couldn't eat, sleep nothing. It was such an odd and unsettling feeling.
Mom has only admitted to me once that Bill is not my father. She still tries to suck me into her lies and deceit. When she admitted i tried to have her help me find out who my father is (she knows and I know now.) This has ruined my relationship with my mother, even 10 years later.
When i was 18, i went on a mission to find out who he was. Through talking to mom's old friends, and finding old admission papers to the college she went to, i ended up finding out that it was a middle eastern fellow. He moved over here from Kuwait to attend college. Him and my mom had a fling for quite a well and out came me. This man left my mother once he found out she was pregnant. Because that is completely against their beliefs (Sharia Law) and could not accept me as a son. My search wasn't done though, i wanted to know more. I ended up finding out that i have a sister through him. A girl that i thought stalked me throughout my teenage life. I would see her everywhere, staring at me. Driving past my house etc. She knew i was her brother, but i didn't know that she was my sister. She was afraid to say anything, and her mother advised her to not approach me as she didn't know what kind of damage it would do if any.

I come from a college town where the average age in the city of 100k and the median age is 29, compared to 35 in the rest of the nation. It's a very young atmosphere and all of my interactions have been with girls in their late teens early 20's.

Once I got to the city I started going out very often trying to meet people. Women seem to assume I'm well into my late teens, they say I can hold a conversation, have many life stories, and I carry myself like I'm not in college. This is usually what we talk about after I reveal that I'm still 21 and finishing up University. 
I don't mind the compliments of acting older than my age, but I would rather avoid that topic all together, I feel like after I reveal age the conversation dynamic shifts for the worse. 

I don't want to lie about my life, and when talking about what I do it's hard not to incriminate myself as a student transitioning into graduate school.

How should I deal with the women who persist to know my age, or know about things that may incriminate me about my age.
I am leaving to go back to my university town soon, so I don't think this problem will follow me there, but I would like to know anyway because it will help in all future interactions"

I am a rising senior at a NY university and am currently interning full time at a security lending services company for the summer. I am nearing the halfway point (5 more weeks) and was wondering if r/finance had any advice on how to utilize all this internship has to offer/gain relevant experience for future internships or jobs. Regarding career goals, I am very interested in the quantitative analyst path and am researching graduate programs in the area for post undergraduate, but as of right now I am trying to learn anything I can . I used to be a Computer Science major but have since switched over to Economics (looking back, sticking to Comp Sci would have been the smarter choice). 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
Anyways here are some things that I have access to:

* Bloomberg
* Crystal Reports
* Series 7 Study Guides
* Accounting (financial statements, cash flows, expense reports, I assume)

I may be missing some but this is all I can think of right now

I wanted to learn more about Excel but unfortunately there isn’t much use in my department. I’ve since bought this Excel Book to learn some more. I also wanted to pick up C++ as well but the developers here mostly use Java.

Of course, all of this will be supplementary to my work in case anyone is concerned.  Thanks for all your help and let me know if you need any more info!

I am curious about a new salary figure.",job1234,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wtnsi/just_started_a_new_position_will_be_doing/,"I started at a new company about 3 weeks ago, and since then my IT manager left to go to a new company. I actually inherited all of her past SQL tasks and maintenance in the companies data base. Since she has left my boss is looking for me to continue to do these tasks and develop the database more and create new automations. Well this is well and fine, but I was hired on as a help desk employee. I *am* the help desk, I work along side one other person in the IT dept. and he is the sysadmin. 

Some background on myself, I actually have experience on both sides of technology. I went to school for programming (Associates Degree in Web/Application development) and I have always done IT work for outside customers. I have been doing software/hardware troubleshooting for about 6 years now. I did two internships during college, one was an IT job in a school system and the other was a programming/project manager job for a non-profit. My last position I was a project manager for web development for about a year. I have not done a lot of SQL work outside of college but I am pretty fluent in there pulling information and reading/changing stored procedures.

So as you can see I am all over the place, and I didnt even mention that I have worked in many different fields other than technology. We wont get into that though.

Before my IT manager left I had a talk with her about the company and how much power I have behind position changes and salary compensation. She mentioned that since its a smaller department and a medium size company that I could basically present my research and work my way into anything I want. Since then, my boss has asked me to look into some SQL classes for a refresher in the ""language"", and I will be starting one in the next few weeks. Now for the questions:

1. I am trying to figure out what my title will be. I will basically be doing SQL procedures every morning, adding new procedures to the database for new clients, maintaining the current procedures, and creating new automation. What sort of title might this be?
2. As far as salary goes, after these next few weeks I will be deep within their database and I know they will not want to train another person in there. So I know I have some leverage, so I know that I will be seen as an asset. With my education and experience, what salary range should I be looking into here?

I will also mention that I am working on the state line between NH and MA if this helps.

I am therefore interested in a paid internship or an entry level position as Software Engineer in an English speaking country.

What I can offer: I have some experience with a broad range of languages. However, most larger projects I have worked on so far were written in Java, Scala, Matlab or C/C++. I know basic technologies like ER, UML and have the theoretical background in Algorithms, Maths (Linear Algebra, Discrete Maths, Statistics etc.), Object Oriented Programming, Concurrency, Functional Programming and so forth. Unfortunately, I have little experience with specific frameworks (e.g. .NET). I have put a few code samples up on my [github page](https://github.com/dkgi/).

What I am looking for: A chance to get some practical programming experience within a motivated team working on challenging problems. My primary interests are in software architecture, software engineering, formal verification, concurrency, simulations and computer graphics. I am, however, always eager to broaden my horizon.

In short, I have a solid theoretical foundation and I am a quick and eager learner looking to get some practical experience.

Please pm me if your interested in working with me. If not, feedback about what put you off is welcome as well.


* I'm fluent but not as fluent as I'd like to be. Since I am a Swiss citizen, immigration should not be a problem in most countries except for the US. However, Switzerland has treaties that would allow easy immigration for internships for up to 18 months.

I have been working as a software developer for an oil and gas company for about six months. About three months ago other executives came to our department saying asking our opinion on the direction of technology. Well I am a huge hobby guy when it comes to electronics and have tons of practical experience with microcontrollers and control systems. I gave them some ideas and also kind of talked them through how we theoretically would implement some of their grand ideas. Well they basically gave me a green light and told me to do my thing. Recently I designed a SCADA package for their equipment them that does everything their old system did but for cheaper and over cellular networks instead of expensive satellite. I even made it controllable and modifiable on iPads and iphones which the marketing team loved.  

So now I am moving over to the application engineering department as basically an intern. So the moral of the story is don't be complacent in your position. If no opportunities arise, CREATE THEM!!"
wsyq1,3,2012-07-19,"I told my girlfriend if I ever buy a house with 100% of my own money, that I'd make her sign a prenup excluding the house (or equitable remedy) during a divorce. She disagreed. Who is right? [Details inside]",I_hate_alot_a_lot,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wsyq1/i_told_my_girlfriend_if_i_ever_buy_a_house_with/,"I'll put a little insight in everything.

Okay, so when I was 18 I started a venture in online advertising, I didn't make millions but I made enough to be able to invest in a very bull market and accumulate $100,000, along with setting aside enough to live off of and pay for college.

About two years ago, my ex-girlfriend of 5 years broke up with me while I was trying to grow my business, go to school full time, and work various management-related internships. It killed me, my heart was broke (I stayed in bed for a full day, dry heaving and not eating a single parcel of food). And she even took my dog (A beautiful red Doberman named Ella). I told myself I would never be fucked with like that again. Ever.

Cue to today, my girlfriend of almost two years now, and I, click. I don't know how to explain it but we just get along very well. We don't plan on getting married any time soon but are very comfortable talking about it. Mostly in a joking manner, with *very* little serious talk.

But, I told her, in a serious manner, that if I bought a house 100% with my money, that I would request she sign a prenup on the house (and it's equity) because I don't believe I should have to give something up I paid for 100%, just in case shit does hit the fan. But I said everything else like my savings, retirement, etc. would go through divorce court as per usual and as per Michigan law, she would still get a shitload of stuff. She says that it isn't fair because she would have to leave her place of residence for years, uproot all her belongings, find an apartment or house of her own, and leave all her memories behind, etc. I cited that if we loved eachother, we shouldn't worry about a divorce any way, and that a prenup on 1 asset is nothing.

We both really disagreed with eachother but stopped arguing about it because I don't own a house, nor have I proposed to her. Plus, we were just sick of arguing and went out for ice cream. But, it has been bothering me. I just don't think there is anything wrong with not wanting to get fucked over and protecting yourself a little bit.

Am I right or is she? If anyone could offer some thought or insight, that would be greatly appreciated. It's 2AM and I'm usually in a dead sleep but it's been bothering me so much I have to post this question here."

Here's my problem: I want to win by ex back, but I've hurt her emotionally.

This is the story.  My ex and I met at school and dated smoothly for about one school year.  Things got a bit rocky towards the end of the year and we hastily decided to break up. That's where the trouble started.

I made the stupid decision to get drunk for an entire weekend to ""get over the heartbreak"" and ended up dancing with a few girls at 2 different parties.  She heard about me dancing with her friend at the first party and actually saw me dancing with a random girl at the next day's party.  And thus, her emotional pain began.

And what would you know, when the weekend ended I realized how stupid I had been.  I hastily gave myself a remedy to heartbreak before giving myself time to consider how I REALLY felt.  I suddenly felt lonely, sad and beaten down.  I wanted her back, but I knew I had hurt her so much...  She basically hated my guts for the rest of the school year.

And then comes summer.  I got her an internship prior to the break up and we end up working together.  I try to show her that I am willing to change and better myself to get her back.  I had several different situations over the course of the summer so far that began with me in high spirits and ended completely crushed... but I would get back up and try again after every attempt.

But tonight, she brought up every bad emotion she has ever had.  She said she hated me, she called me a monster and that she never wants to get back with me again or have anything to do with me.  I dont know what to do reddit...

PS. She has stayed with me several times over the summer and we've also had sex on occasion.  I've also been going out of my way to give her free transportation tickets ($200 worth) and have taken her out on several ""Dates"".  All while me and her were not together and I was trying to get her back...

All of it.",eldudemanbrah,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/wslap/ok_ents_time_to_let_it_out_all_of_it/,"Wall of text incoming, so beware: Recently I've been doing a lot of thinking and reflecting on my past, mostly because that's just about all I can do at my job. I have also been told that it's better to let your troubles out than keep them bottled up, and since I am a generally lonely person I figured the most tolerant, friendly, and caring community has to be r/trees, so I figured I'd make this a nice community experience. EVERYONE: Post what's troubling you. It doesn't have to be trees related, and it would probably be better not to attack anyone, but still I suggest you let it out. I'll start.

This is the story of *Dr. Nolove: Or How I Learned to stop Self Sabotaging and Love the Friendzone.*

I lived in a small town where, if you've lived there for more than a year, odds are your reputation preceded you. Starting my freshman year, I was coming off the heels of being a weird kid. I mean, public-freakout-two-months-earlier weird. So I went in with that just calming down. Anywho, I hadn't hit puberty quite yet so I was a 5' 2"" skinny kid who was also quite obnoxious a.k.a. not very popular. I'm doing marching band, so I have no outside life and I'm happy. No one bothers me and I live life. I hit on girls, but given my stature and squeaky voice, I fail constantly. Finally, a breakthrough: A fellow bandie. She's 2 years older than me, so that adds to my already heightened nervousness, be she's very nice and she's been giving me *the look*. We go on a date, I get cold feet after that and break it off (A year later, she'd tell me how much she was into me at the time, so fuck me right?). **Confidence level:** Exists. She noticed me and said yes to a date, so I was pretty jazzed.

Begin sophomore year, and I just grew 7 inches and my voice dropped at least 2 octaves. Holy fuck, I was ready to go. I hit on girls in my class all the time, which probably factored into my lonliness when I was an upperclassman. I was awkward, lanky, and my voice cracked every other word. I tried to make a move on a sexy colorguard lady who was clearly attracted to me not two weeks prior to the incident, but she said no. **Confidence level:** Dropping, but still hopeful. I recognize I have yet to hit my adolescent prime, so I say fuck it. Later that year, I am witness to a very unfortunate event, which get a teacher fired and my ass out of band. I joined the improv team and started working at my school's theater. It's like starting anew. 

Between my sophomore and junior years I become best friends with he-shall-be-known-as B. This guys awesome, and aside from physical and very minor personality discrepensies, we're practically carbon-copies. This friendship would later factor into my issues, but I wouldn't realize. We'll touch on B more towards the end of this tale. **Confidence level:** Tony Stark. B has brought me out of my shell and we both start in every Improv match we attend. We chill every weekend, at least, and start becoming occasional ents.

Junior year; what I'll describe as my best year in high school. It's basically my emotional senior year because almost all of my friends are seniors. We hang everyday, love improv, and manage to restart our school's Drama class. I talk to a girl  everyday (who's still one of my closest friends), but she was taken so I'd bide my time. She was worth it; kind, beautiful, caring, adventurous, the whole package. About 4 months into the school year, she comes back into the market and makes it obvious she's interested; I'm oblivious. My absent mindedness lost me a great catch (I still get shit about it from my parents). **Confidence level:** Audible ""fuck me."" Self- loathing ensued and I essentially friendzoned myself. It sucked but I could still salvage it. I enjoyed the rest of my year and was hopeful for the next year. I'd be big man on campus and I was finally showing people I was more than an obnoxious loser. Life could be better, but it certainly wasn't shitty. 

Senior year: All of my friends moved out of town. B and my 4 closest went two hours north just to go to a specific community college. I was devastated. I had maybe 2 good friends and they were very much part of a group I didn't fit very well into. I became **the** group-hopper: I'd never eat lunch with the same people two days in a row. I developed a horrible fear of rejection and it fucked with my sleep, my friendships, and my leadership in Improv. I stopped going to meetings, I'd sleep through my classes, and I was quiet. I became a recluse for the most part. On weekends I'd play video games with one of my close friends from school. I was baked out of my gourd 24/7 and I almost was suspended for it. I pulled a 4.3 but how, I'll never know. **Confidence level:** Mao ze DONE. I was dead to the world. I wouldn't speak unless spoken to, and my answers were usually really terse. I ended up not applying to any UC's or Private colleges and I'm still regretting it now. At the end of the year B and the crew moved back down, but I was pretty bitter still.

During the summer I started to brighten up. I'd hang out with some of the semi-friends I made during the year, but for the most part I'd chill with B. He started smoking more and I slowed down to his pace; life was good. About this point I realized my poor choice of college.

Freshman year again and I meet people like me. They were nerds, we played games erryday, and we'd occassionally play ""basketball"" as we liked to call it. I'd talk to people but my senior year fucked me. I was so afraid of people I couldn't make conversation with most. My life consisted of movies, video games, and class. About 2 months in I meet a girl. She's shy, but gorgeous, and we talk for a bit. Eventually she comes to my room. I'm fucking terrified. It's the first time I've been remotely intimate with anything but my right hand and the nerves get the best of me; I don't finish. I guess she felt bad too, because she wouldn't let me walk her back to her dorm. She didn't answer texts or calls, and she'd avoid me if she saw me on campus. **Confidence level:** *Deliverance*. And if you don't get that reference I'll explain: Raped while my friends looked on in horror. They saw me go into that room and they saw me come out. I didn't have to say anything for them to know. I hated myself. I was confused. For two weeks all they saw me for was lunch and dinner, and I didn't say anything. I'd play games with them after that, but I was the worst. I'd swear if I fucked up at all, and I'd brag if I won. I was a total douchenozzle. Sometime around the release of Skyrim, I realize what a dick I've been and I lighten up. They welcome me back with open arms. Beginning the next quarter, I realize I've developed some pretty crippling nervousness when I deal with attractive women. I clam up and can't look them in the eye; it sucks. After a bit of coercing, I manage to ask a girl on my floor to go smoke with me. She says yes, but our schedules are really conflicting. We manage to get to watch Breaking Bad for an evening, but my oblivious roomie manages to inadvertently cock-block me. She gives up on me. **Confidence level:** [Just about here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djZFHTa6TfA) It was around the end of the year and I knew I was moving home. 

I got the job I currently have, and other than my video game friend previously referenced, I can't seem to get out that much. B is at an internship out of town, and almost everyone I used to know treats me like a leper. I constantly put open invitations to see movies, or hang out on facebook. I've managed to see maybe 4 other people for a day, but that was a month ago and now they don't talk to me too much. My parents are moving over 9 hours away and I have to find my own place to live in a month or so. **Confidence level: Like I'm starting all over again.  Some of you may be all like ""BUT WHAT ABOUT B? YOU SAID HE FACTORED INTO YOUR ISSUES!"" and here's how he does. He's like my clone right? But successful. Every one of those situation I failed in he would've prospered. He's got something I don't and I've played second fiddle to him all these years. It's neither of our faults, but it really hit close to home once I realized it.

ANYWHO, now I feel awesome. Finally expressing why I've been so jaded and awkward and nervous for the past year has been like lifting 1,000 pounds off of my shoulders. And I invite you to do the same. Let it out, but don't let it go. Write it. Feel it. Learn from it. That is all.

ww9a0,2,2012-07-20,Datto Inc. hiring co-ops: network administrators and coders,fuhry,ritforhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/ritforhire/comments/ww9a0/datto_inc_hiring_coops_network_administrators_and/,"""Datto Inc. is a leading provider of backup and disaster reco...""... meh, I'll give you the short version. We make little boxes that suck up your data and spit it up into the cloud.

We need people to help us with both the little boxes and the cloud.

**Little boxes:**

You'll be hacking on an Ubuntu-based appliance which has the job of accepting data via Samba shares and pulling it in from machines running our agent software, stashing it, snapshotting it, virtualizing imaged machines, and syncing everything offsite. There is high demand for rich new features, speed optimization, better UI design, you name it. We work a lot with Bootstrap and jQuery.

On the back-end you'll be dealing with Ubuntu, Debian package repositories, ZFS, VirtualBox, Samba, OpenSSH, rsync and lots of other great open source projects.

Some of the cool things that the device team does:

* ""Hardware independent restore"": We figured out how to take almost any Windows image and make it boot anywhere. Using Linux to hack Windows installs is a big deal here.
* Spin up a VM from any amount of time ago, in under 30 seconds
* ""Bare metal restore"": set up a PXE boot OS that lets you re-image a machine from a backup

***Requirements:***

* Excellent communication skills.
* At least a little bit of Linux knowledge. The more the better.
* No knowledge of specific technologies like ZFS or VBox is required but if you're familiar with them it's a **BIG** plus.
* PHP and shell scripting knowledge are both required. Helps if you know OOP.

**Cloud ops:**

We operate over 500 servers with over 10PiB of storage in several datacenters, and we need some help designing better ways to manage and monitor them. Cloud ops typically is a mix of longer-term projects and putting out fires. Some of the things we want to work on are full use of IPMI across all datacenters, better server-to-server communication (for better resilience during offsite virtualization scenarios), improved monitoring tools, cleanup of old facilities, IT/office network optimizations, and more.

Some of the cool things that the cloud team does:

* Keep 500 servers synced, alive and happy
* Work with customers to recreate a destroyed site entirely in the cloud
* Make occasional trips to datacenters to install/swap hardware
* Keep our gigabit office Internet connection happy (we receive seed drives here, and need fast tubes to get their contents to the datacenters)

***Requirements:***

* Excellent communication skills.
* Moderate to advanced Linux knowledge.
* At least some grasp of designing things that scale
* Some familiarity with PHP
* Strong acquaintance with shell scripting

**General:**

* Location: 101 Merritt 7, Norwalk, CT
* We're looking primarily for co-ops, but full-timers are welcome to apply
* Our biggest need is for fall and winter interns
* All the start-up perks:
 * Two soda fountain machines
 * Awesome company outings, like seeing The Dark Knight Rises in IMAX on premiere night
 * Fairly loose management structure, ability to choose your own direction with projects
 * Low bullshit factor
* Very competitive pay + opportunity for housing assistance

**Tips for getting hired:**

* Show us your personal projects that you cut your teeth on. Pretty much every dev here was hired because they had a kick-ass project they worked on for the hell of it, not because a professor assigned it to them. Startups have a huge need for initiative and enthusiasm.
* Let us know when you're available, and whether you're a co-oper or full time
* Show networking knowledge
* Show good communication skills. I can't emphasize this enough.

**How to apply:**

wvyyc,25,2012-07-20,Gabe is a Redditor now.,CircleJerkAmbassador,circlejerkcopypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerkcopypasta/comments/wvyyc/gabe_is_a_redditor_now/,"So funny story actually,

I was an intern at Valve a little while ago. It's the best place to work even if I didn't get paid. I've followed my dad's footsteps in the gaming industry and he eventually got my foot in the door.

I was fresh out of college and still green to the world. This would eventually get me in trouble at Valve. So college was a blast and pretty easy for me since I've been studying game design and have been an active gamer for pretty much my whole life. 

So I happened to be on /r/gaming when I get a beep that says I got a new e-mail. I got called in for a 1 on 1 with my boss. Ugh..

I guess I was in trouble for browsing the internet too much (we're allowed to take intermittent breaks during the day so we can ""freshen up our minds"") So I hesitantly walk over to the office and knock on the door. Lo and behold Gabe is sitting in the chair. Now I see him every once and a while around the building but it's only a little hi and bye so this was scary and exciting.

He sits me down and the first thing he says to me as he turns the monitor around, ""So is this what the internet thinks of me?""

Apparently they saw some Gabe meme from monitoring my net usage. My voice cracked and I whispered, ""um, I guess..""

Gabe bursts out laughing so hard and I let out biggest sigh of relief. Well then he told me to keep on the project we were working on and try not to ""take breaks"" as often.

So now every once and a while I get an email from him with some meme about him and it kind of became our inside joke. I'm pretty sure he's a Redditor now since he would always send me stuff that I just saw earlier that day.  And I thought I only had to deal with this on FB.

By the way, Gabe gets the 3 jokes. 3/3/13"
wvuuc,1,2012-07-20,Made it to the third date - is it over for us? 20M,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/wvuuc/made_it_to_the_third_date_is_it_over_for_us_20m/,"This is going to be a long one, so try to bear with me. I met a girl, 21, at a party and went home with her (we actually met about a month before, but she recognized me at the party and we started talking). We hook up a few times during the semester, but she makes it clear that she's only had sex with guys she'd been in a relationship with. Seeing that we both had a strong connection, I eventually sack up and ask her on a date. The date goes better than I could have hoped for.

I keep up contact with her, but it was roughly 7 weeks after our first date - already into summer break now - that we had our second. Life just seemed to get in the way with her internship and other things. The second date goes great, and I could tell she wanted to see me again. I keep texting her and getting warm responses, but same thing happens and a month passes before our third date, which was last night.

When I texted her, she seemed cold at first but eventually opened up and agreed to see me. I had her over for dinner, and I was a little nervous at first (as usual) but everything seemed to work out fine. I tried really hard to set everything up nicely, and I may have actually overdone things in her eyes. She works every day and I could tell she was getting tired, but at the same time not wanting to leave. We start making out on the couch close to midnight, but she stops me from moving things further.

She said ""you don't want to do that."" I obviously did, but then she said that she hasn't done this in awhile. I stop and we sat together on the couch for awhile, until I eventually decide it's late. I get up and lead her to the door and we hug and share one last kiss before she leaves. Still, I was left with the sinking feeling that things are over and that we're not going and further than this third date.

**Some possibly important things**
* Part of why she was so attracted to me early on is because I'm a year younger than her, and she thought my ""innocence"" was adorable. She would also call me out jokingly to stop being so nervous.
* She told me last night that I need to be more self-confident (this was before I kissed her).
* I asked her if she wanted to leave after she stopped me. I probably shouldn't have worded it so strongly, but she said she wouldn't be there if she didn't want to be. Still, her body language told me she was either uncomfortable, or that she lost the attraction she had for me a few months earlier.
* She also said I tried too hard, and that I shouldn't have because she's easily impressed. Basically, I went a little overboard with preparing dinner and everything. She said that my hard work didn't go unnoticed though, and that she appreciated it.
* I asked her if she wanted to see me again. The last few moments of last night are a little blurred, but she made some joke about playing hard to get and didn't really give me an answer.

**TL;DR**
* Met a girl, we hooked up, we liked each other, I eventually asked her out.
* Things progress slowly over the course of several months. On the third date she didn't want to move things further, and I think she may have lost attraction for me.
* Is it over, or is there a glimmer of hope? If you didn't read the entire post, at least look over the important things I listed to get a better insight. Thanks for any advice and input.

My account is a throwaway.)

I've been dating my boyfriend for about a year and two months.  He is 21 (his birthday is this weekend, actually) and I am 22, also male.  We have broken up once before for six months. We have always been a fairly problem-filled couple.

We were doing fine for a really long time, but it all came to head when we decided to move in together.  I told him I wasn't sure if I was ready, but he was belligerent and said that it would be fine so I trusted him and we went through with it.  Now we live together and it is pretty awful.  We fight practically everyday.  I really feel like he is just always angry with me for something all the time.  

We went to the store the other day and he said he was in a bad mood, so I tried to help by giving him suggestions of what food to get (we were looking for a quick meal) and he said no, rudely, to all of my suggestions.  He then snapped at me and said I wasn't helping.  A majority of our fights are stupid things like that.  God forbid I have a problem with him though, and then he just gets really pissed at me and is in a sour mood for a really long time.  He blames me for absolutely everything, I feel like he accepts no blame.

He says he can’t trust me, but I’ve never done anything to warrant this.  I have always been a trustworthy boyfriend and been there for him in many situations.  This was an instant red flag for me.

He requires that I check in when going out, and I basically have to check my schedule with him whenever I go out.  I'm going to Batman tonight with some of my friends and I told him I might hang out with them for a while after, and he told me ""That would have been nice to know more than a day before now.""  We didn't have plans.  I understand not just disappearing for hours, but I didn't see the harm in what I said.  It’s like that with everything.  He gets mad when I stay out passed two, and bothers me constantly asking me where I am.

And then now: He wants me to commit to him.  Like, wedding ring commit to him.  I absolutely don't want to because I feel I am way too young and I still have a lot of exploring I want to do before I settle down.  He, of course, gets really mad at me for this and asks why I need time.  I try to explain I'm just not ready but he doesn't understand, he just gets upset.  

I've been feeling like breaking up for a while.  It’s just so stressful.  My life is already completely jam-packed (I'm a supervisor at work, I have an internship, trying to get a student group off the ground, and write in my spare time which I'm trying to get better at) and this is stress I just don't need.  I don't think understands that I'm having a hard time with this.  I try to explain, but it doesn't seem to work.  

I'm afraid to talk to him about all of this because if I tell him I'm thinking about a break he's just going to get so upset and probably start crying...which, sadly, is something I don't want to cause.  As much as we are having problems, it was really great before.  I still do love him, and I’m not sure if we can recover from this.

And the last part:

I have an enormous crush on a guy at work.  I don't know or not if he is straight/gay/bi or whatever, but he's just so funny and cute.  I feel like I’m basically cheating on my partner with the feelings and everything.  I haven't done anything to make an advance for the guy at work.  From personal experience, when I start developing a crush on someone it is usually because my boyfriend and I are fighting or I am starting to feel disconnected from him.

I just don't know what to do.  I still love my boyfriend, but I'm getting physically sick from all the stress.  I'm almost always tired, sore, tense, or sick to my stomach because of it all.  I don't want to hurt him, ever.  Unfortunately, I feel this is the way it is heading.

Maybe I should try telling him about my feelings?

**tl;dr** --- I'm in a long-term relationship that isn't going very well anymore, its stressing me out more now than anything.  I find my attention wandering to other potential dates.  When is the best time to call it quits?

wvlsi,1,2012-07-20,Who decides the curriculum taught at Technical Colleges and Universities?,ModusMan,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wvlsi/who_decides_the_curriculum_taught_at_technical/,"Our company has hired several interns for technical positions and even with detailed screening, we are finding that they are severely un-knowledgeable about the subject matter of their respective degree's, certificates or fields of study.  

Every one of the interviewee's  are working on or currently possess a Network+ certification or degree in networking and cannot even describe the difference between a symmetrical and an asymmetrical internet service and why one would be better than the other.

God forbid that we ask them to describe Domain Name Service as it applies to a non-Microsoft based operating system.

In my opinion, the colleges are not teaching these folks anything that will help them in their careers except if they plan on working in very specific fields (Windows, Cisco...) and even then they have no practical knowledge of any related area's or how to apply the little knowledge they do get to anything beyond a lab project.

How can you go to college for four years and not know what DNS is?"

wvbtw,8,2012-07-20,Personal victory leading to awesome chocolate orientation-internship.,Zylll,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/wvbtw/personal_victory_leading_to_awesome_chocolate/,"Heyy guys, 

A while back I've posted in a win-wednesday (or whatever it was) that I threw my application for school in the mail. After some long weeks of waiting around I finally got an intake for becoming a pastry baker. 

I'm at the intake with the same person who gave me some info at the information evening some weeks back, but apperantly she somewhat changed her mind. While she said I knew what I was getting into and had a realistic view of my jobchances and what not, she decided that now I don't. 

I felt they focused very much on the stuff I ""can't"". I'm a bit older (25 in august), while most first years for this degree (somewhat of an associate degree) are around 16. I know it's quite the age-diffrence, but I already have another degree, even a bit higher, but I want to do something that I wouldn't choose because I ""had too"", but because I want to. 

Besides the age, which could cause some problems in terms of working experience when I'm eventually looking for a job, they focused very much on my ADD. My ADD expresses itself in me being easily tired. I sleep around 10-12 hours a day and I can't maintain a fulltime (five days a week) schedule. 

Seeing as I've already gotten a degree at the same level and doing a lot of the theory at home, I didn't think this would be much of a problem. I've managed before, I'll do it again. They weren't so convinced and it all ended in a negative review. That means I'm not ""allowed"" to start (YET). In theory a school here is required to just hire any possible student who wishes to join and has the level to start (a.k.a. you need to have a highschooldiploma). 

They told me I should do an orientation internship, but even then they saw small chances. A negative review automaticly leads to a conversation with someone of the ""succes centre"" to perhaps give you other options that might be more suitable. They came up with the most insane ""solutions"" that didn't suit me at all. 

So stubborn, old, ADD impared me (or how I felt they viewed me) planned to walk in some bakeries this morning to ask for a possible orientation internship. The first one also was the last one. For the next three weeks, I'm going to do two days a week at an awesome chocolate/bonbon/icecream store that also makes weddingcakes on order. I'm SOO much looking forward to it and even though it might not be huge, I'm very excited and it feels like a personal victory. 

After I've completed the orientation, I can just re-apply again, have another intake and the whole thing starts again, but I do feel I'll be more confident with the orientation behind me. I'm really looking forward to making the most amazing stuff and I just had to share my good news of the day. I truely feel I'm on a roll again :)

Thanks so much for reading (if you still are, haha)! And please, feel free to share your moment of personal victory. I love reading feel good stories :D"

I've taken a few programming classes and I'm *okay*, but programming by itself doesn't seem like my best area of expertise. Computer science is too...well, theoretical and mathematical. Isn't it essentially applying the scientific theory to computing? I don't think i'd enjoy that and it doesn't seem as ... practical?

So, IT seemed like the natural choice for me. But I'm having second thoughts. Is it really still a good career to get into? I'm already about 1/3 of the way towards my B.S. in IT, and I also will be getting an internship at a computer company as tech support/help desk kind of situation.

For all intents and purposes, I should be all set in a couple years.

Is the IT demand in the job market still high? Is the pay still well? (i don't expect starting salaries to be under 30K). What should I expect after getting experience at my internship, BS degree and compTIA certifications? 

Thanks in advance."
wv602,3,2012-07-20,Need DESPERATE help concerning visa to and from Shanghai and Hong Kong (x/post from r/askreddit),myrealgrandparents,HongKong,https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/wv602/need_desperate_help_concerning_visa_to_and_from/,"Somebody told me to post this here, so here goes.

Okay here's the deal:

I'm from California, but I am currently spending two months in Shanghai for an internship program. For this, I applied for an F type Visa, allowing me to stay here for 60 days. It is near the end of my program and I was interested in going to Hong Kong for a few days before I left. The plan is this: Go to Hong kong July 30-Aug 2, come back to Shanghai for 1.5 days, then leave for America on Aug 3 at night.

However, due to the nature of my visa, which was only single-entry, I needed to go to the security bureau (or whatever it is) and apply for a multiple entry visa. I went, filled out forms to the best of my capability, and handed my passport and necessary forms in. Barely looking at it, the security guard put it in an envelope and handed me a receipt telling me, in Mandarin, to come pick up my passport next Friday. I looked at the receipt and it says this (other than passport #, name, date of birth, etc.):

Application Type: 旅游签证 Entry(s): 一(1)次有效

Now I'm freaking out because from what I understand, they only gave me a single entry visa on top of another single entry visa, but I hear you have to get a MULTIPLE entry visa. Is it safe that I go to Hong Kong under this visa, or will I be unable to return to Shanghai afterwards?...

wuzxi,15,2012-07-20,Davis from the Institution ,randomfiction,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wuzxi/davis_from_the_institution/,"A friend of mine had to intern at an asylum to qualify for her CNA degree, she told me a few creepy stories, one of which sticks out.



There was this patient named Davis, she couldn't say whether that was his first or last name, as that was the only name she ever saw on his charts.  His incident record was all but blank, save for a note from the admitting physician that Davis was extremely dangerous.  She said he was always quiet and well behaved, but that his eyes had some sort of vacant look in them, likely due to the drugs he was on.


Davis had the highest prescription dose of haldol of anyone in the facility, as well as a heavy tranquilizer regiment at night.  The nurses in the medication line always took special care to ensure he always swallowed his pills, as he tried to hide them in the past.


During a particularly bad flu season, several members of the nursing staff were out sick, including a lot of the senior staff.  They managed to get some extra help during the days but the night shift was left understaffed for a few days.  

My friend was working the night shift when another patient noticed that Davis hadn't been seen in awhile.  She went to his room and found it empty, save a small pile of pills in the middle of his unmade bed.


She called up to the nursing desk and requested an orderly or two to help find Davis and forcibly medicate him if needed.  They sent two orderlies, one huge black guy who apparently looked like a parolee and a tall husky white guy who was in some sort of motorcycle club.
She said she felt more than safe with the two huge guys, so they went room to room, searching for Davis.  


After checking each room in the ward, then made their way to the end of the hall near the bathrooms and heard a noise.  She said it was splashing, following by furious sounds of eating.  Like a hungry dog eating wet food, wolfing it down.  They found Davis.

He was on his knees in front of a toilet deliriously eating the contents inside.  Either one of the other patients or Davis himself, had shit in the toilet and he was eating it.  Grossed out the white orderly grabbed Davis by the waistband of his pants and pulled him away.  Davis responded with a inhuman roar, and with one hand pushed the orderly hard into the bathroom wall.  Hard enough to break some of the tiles on the wall and knock the wind out of the guy.  

The black orderly straight up ran at the guy to tackle him, but Davis batted him down like he was nothing.  The dude just slumped to the ground, out cold.


My friend was screaming at this point and tried to run to the nurses station but Davis was on her too quick.  He grabbed her by the throat and pinned her against the door.

Then he became still, relaxed almost, yet his grip on her neck was firm.  He began to sing, so soft and gently, from a mouth covered in shit.  He sang her a Celine Dion song, the one from Titanic.  


Near the end of the song people started banging on the door, other nurses and concerned patients, brought by her scream.  He started laughing through the end of the song, as if the pounding on the door was bringing him a lot of joy.  He then leaned in close to her ear, and frantically whispered something to her as the door was forced open.


In the end it took 5 men to subdue Davis.  A mishmash of patients and staff.  It took 3 times the normal dosage of their strongest tranquilizer, injected into his shoulder muscles, to finally drop him.


She quit that night and enrolled in a dental assistant program offered by one of those for profit schools, and is now a happily employed dental assistant.


I asked her what Davis whispered to her.  She never told me.

wuvr1,6,2012-07-20,My girlfriend of 3 years has cheated on me twice in the span of the 2 months when she moved in with me. Please tell me this shit gets better.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wuvr1/my_girlfriend_of_3_years_has_cheated_on_me_twice/,"So a little back story. I met her while I was living in Florida 3 years ago, We instantly hit it off. According to her it was love at first sight. And it really was great, after about a year of us being together and happy and awesome, she moved to Chicago and I moved to Washington state (because of parents) this caused a little rift. But we did the long distance thing and it worked. We flew any little chance we could to see each other. Skype every night you know the works. 

During that year, I was 19 and started working. I worked 2 jobs, Macy's and Panera. So I would open Macy's 5 days a week and closed at panera  5 days a week. I still barely made friends because I was focused on moving to Chicago, and starting school in Chicago.

And I did it, exactly 1 year later (btw still together) I moved to Chicago leased an apartment July 1st and started possibly the coolest experience ever. My girlfriend was close to me, I worked at Panera (ended up eventually quitting that and working at an Apple Store, best job yet) 

Although she was close to me, she still lived out in the suburbs which took a 1 hour long train ride but fuck it was great. After a while she finally had enough money and had finished school so she could move in with me. In retrospect: what the fuck am I doing why did I do this. 

I have a little studio but the space has not been an issue, the issue's started with her job search. She was feeling down and Looking for a job, as you can guess it took her a good long 2 months to finally land something. During this time I was stretching myself financially to feed us and still pay for the apartment. Eventually she finally had 2 offers on the table, My Apple Store actually called her for an interview, as well as the Lego Store. I wanted her to work at apple, I new she would love it and it payed more as well. But because she knew it would take another month for the interview process with them she chose the Lego Store. I mean I can't control her so that was that. Now I was really happy because that means I was gonna have some money for myself finally. But little by little stuff started changing. She never payed for half of the apartment. she helped me with as little as she could because she knew I made more money. which although not that bad a problem, it took its toll on me. I was starting to become unhappy, I was wanting a break, some money for myself. At that time I started to have some feelings for one of the girls at work, She reminded me of My Girlfriend so much. But that went to nothing because I did not want to cheat on her, I felt like she may have had an interest but I killed it by playing dumb. 

I felt horrible for even having a crush on someone else. And decided to tell her, she was hurt and I understood why. But I did not do anything, I have always been the best boyfriend I could be, Treated her to the best I could do. But because of this we took a little ""break"" 3 days tops. On this break she ended up visiting and fucking someone at her work place. The asshole, as any good asshole would do, fucked her and dumped her easy as that. She thought he liked her, she thought it wouldn't be this way. But it happened. because of the circumstances. and because dammit I love this girl, I forgave her (Another huge mistake.) I mostly forgave her, because she felt horrible for it, she came crying to me that night when she got home and told me everything. But here is the kicker, she had sex with me before she told me anything.

So whatever that was that, I forgave her I felt she deserved it, I did not help the whole situation with my little crush. But as time progressed, she still had a crush on this asshole, she told me so, she hated it but she wanted him. But he was done with her, the last time they saw each other was when she STAYED OVER HIS HOUSE about 2 weeks later. She tells me that she did not do anything but I don't know if I believe that anymore. 

So meanwhile this is happening there is another asshole lets call him #2, now this one was not too bad, he would just text her constantly. And I mean constantly there would be times when we are at home or hanging out somewhere, and he would text and she would text back and it would be like that the whole night. It infuriated me, but like a dumbass I let it slide because I did not want to hold her down (Because I was afraid that might push her away... I know I am a fucking dumbass anyway) Eventually, after many a seen text by mistake on her phone. that's right she did not care enough to hide them, and to clarify I did not go through her phone. I saw that #2 was calling her babe and she was sending him pictures in some lego tshirt he bought him. GOD DAMN IT I was so mad. So I confronted her about it, and I told her I saw the picture and she got mad, she said it wasn't what it seemed like. But she eventually dissented and stopped talking to him.

And life was finally starting to take an upturn, it was great for a short while, it was me and her. she was finally happy with me. until 2 days ago. Now during the summer she has been working as an intern at United Airlines, causing a lot of travel for her. Which is great. but 2 days ago on the weekend she had an office at Lego (she is keeping the FUCKING job when she starts school since her internship ends after the summer) and proceeds to tell me she is going to hangout with the crew and go to TGIF which is cool whatever. That was the last I heard until the next morning. I stayed up waiting for her, Called her once and texted her twice, and nothing, I was already expecting the worst. 

And in comes asshole #3 that is correct folks #3. So when she finally got home that day she told me what happened. she left TGIF with about half the group to #3's house and did some hooka and proceeded to spend the night making out and staying over at his place. Yep she made out with asshole #3. 

But the worst part about all of this is that. I still want to be with her. What is wrong with me Reddit? She has hurt me so many damn times in such a short span. But I still love her, of course we broke up. But damn it I act like such a little bitch and want her back.


 But I am still so angry about all of this. I don't fucking deserve this. I just don't, in fact right now she is staying over at #3's house again. And she wont be moving out, to dorm into her new college. until august. I can possibly take this shit anymore. 

Edit 1: sorry for the wall of text.

wutjy,2,2012-07-19,"Ted's journey. A story of love, regret, and acceptance.",[deleted],atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/wutjy/teds_journey_a_story_of_love_regret_and_acceptance/,"Let me tell you a little story...

Once upon a time, there was a young man named...well, the names not important. If it's ok with you, let's call him Ted. Once upon a time, there was a young man named Ted. Now Ted wasn't a special boy, he was the monthly cover of Average Boy Magazine. Ted had two parents, one brother, one sister, a dog named Timmy, and lived in a small house in a small town. Now, you're probably telling yourself, ""Wow, how did Ted get so lucky? Two parents and a dog named Timmy?"" Don't get the wrong idea about Ted this early into the story, wait till the end.

Ted grew up sharing a room with his brother. Ted reigned down from the top bunk of a bedroom which should not have housed two growing boys. Ted stayed this way until his freshman year of high school, when his sister moved out to escape the terrorizing man she called Dad. Ted ended up with the big room and his brother the small room. Teds sister ended up an 18 year old girl working full time to pay rent. Ted, being the young man he was, did not understand the situation of his sister’s departure. Instead, sat in the glory of finally achieving the impossible...Ted's own room.

Ted had his freedom and took full advantage of it. Never was his room empty of friends. Never was Ted’s room vacant from glaring blood shot eyes and screams of his father. ""Music? Turn it OFF! Friends? Make them LEAVE.""

Ted found safety in a new skill called skateboarding. He chose to escape rather than face the demon at home. This became an expensive hobby, causing a chain of events, ultimately ending in the only answer allowing Ted to continue his pursuit of excellence...a job. Ted became a dish washer.

Ted's Mother was Christian and his dad...well, that's a good question. Ted was always pulled in two opposite directions, but one always suffocated the other. Ted was terrified of Hell. Ted was terrified he might die and end up trapped in infinite suffering. Ted's Mother was relieved. ""A good sense of fear will keep a boy hanging onto God"", she would always say. Ted was taught that having Jesus in his heart meant salvation from the eternal torment and fiery pits that are Hell. Ted believed this as reality and never questioned it. Why would his Mother lie to him? Isn't lying a sin?

Ted grew up having Christian and non Christian friends. Ted never preached Christianity but instead kept it to himself. Ted never worried if you believed or not, but sadly understood that his non Christian friends, were headed to the blood dripping gates of Hell.

Ted graduated Highschool, went to community college, applied for a University, and found himself surrounded by young adults. Ted was finally free to feel, think, and do as he pleased. Ted partied, he fucked, and he made unfortunate choices, but never failed. Ted's grades never suffered, he was promoted at work, and found himself an internship. How could be so lucky? At night Ted would pray, ""Thank you God for supplying me with such amazing gifts. I will live in your word and show the world who you are through my actions."" Ted continued to fornicate.

Ted eventually realized that beer and masturbation were ruining his life, and found himself back into the loving arms of God. Ted became a youth leader at a local Christian church. Ted also became a member of a skate ministry. Ted spoke about his life with drugs, an abusive father, and a child hood filled with regrets and sadness. Each time Ted spoke, he felt God lifting weights off his shoulders. ""I'm such a good person!” Ted would tell himself. Ted pursued this until school and work became priorities again. Ted left church, left skate ministry, and found sex, drugs, and rock &amp; roll all over again. Teds penis became the only roll model he needed.

Ted graduated from college, proposed to the love of his life, and found himself a job traveling the United States. Ted had finally made it; He was at the top. ""I knew God had a plan for you."" ""God has blessed you with amazing talents."" ""Jesus, he just keeps on giving."" Ted received these words of encourage from his Mother and friends. Ted believed them.

Ted worked, traveled, bought nice things, and witnessed his bank account increasing in size. Ted felt nothing could get better. Eventually, Ted found himself surrounded my Christian billboards somewhere in the Bible belt. This was a new experience for Ted. Never had Ted ever felt crushed by the idea of God. In that moment, something changed in Ted. A seed was planted.

Ted kept working, kept traveling, kept living this false sense of reality, but he slowly began to see it. The seed in Ted had started to grow. Each week, the smell of manure fertilized this seed. Each month, the roots searched for nutrients. Eventually, the seed became a living and breathing idea. Ted felt this idea grow directly through a sheet of glass, shattering it into pieces. Depression, anxiety, fear, hate, regret, shame, and disgust, this was the new Ted.

Ted dreamed of a razor blade, a hanging noose, and a twelve gage shotgun. Ted trusted no one. Drugs, that was the answer to these unrelenting screams. Ted drowned out the voices and opened the door to others. Clearer voices, logical voices, Ted’s voices. Eventually, Ted no longer needed drugs. The screams were gone, but the voices of logic remained. What was Ted to do with this new understanding?

Ted confronted his friends and found acceptance, discovering they had seeds of their own. Ted felt loved. Ted felt relieved. The new idea in Ted grew fragrant and beautiful flowers. Ted was no longer surrounded by fear. Ted no longer felt tormented. Ted decided to dedicate his life to showing others that Human beings alone can love unconditionally.

Ted had found his Atheism."
wuqit,9,2012-07-19,Lack of money and boyfriend's lack of ambition is hurting our relationship,sadlyfrustrated,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/wuqit/lack_of_money_and_boyfriends_lack_of_ambition_is/,"Sorry about the throwaway...I really don't want him to know I'm posting this.  I'm a female in my mid-twenties and he's a male in his late twenties.  We have been dating for 2 1/2 years.  He and I get along great.  We have similar interests, we're both intelligent, we have fun together etc.  I'm trying to keep this as vague as possible but I'll try to convey the situation.  

I am currently in professional school.  I intern full-time and take classes and am generally always working.  I am nearly guaranteed a relatively high-paying job upon graduation.  However, I currently live off of student loans.  Many professional schools, mine included, do not allow full-time students to work more than a certain number of hours per week because the workload is too vigorous.  So, we full-timers live off of loans.  I borrow around $26k/year for living expenses (don't even ask me how much I borrow for tuition..ugh) and we live in a very expensive city.  

On to my boyfriend:  He works in a skilled trade.  He's been working in said trade for less than ten years.  He works 8 hours/day 5 days a week like any other person.  He devotes nearly all of his free time to hobbies. He has no college degree.  The pay in this trade is not regular; he is only paid when there is work available.  There is no salary or hourly.  He sits around for the majority of the day at work eating, drinking and hanging out with his coworkers waiting for customers. It is really undependable.  He brings in maybe 1/4 of what I borrow/earn if he's lucky.  His 1/4 barely covers his food costs.  Thus, I support us.  I pay rent, insurance, bills, gas, most groceries, etc. He uses gas when he drives my car, I almost always pay when we go out (rare).  Nearly everything I pay for is x2 because he cannot afford it.

This is the problem:  When we get really poor, we rely on my credit cards and it's hurting my credit. I also am just frustrated that he thinks it's ok that I contribute easily 4x what he does.  I have little ""free"" time because I'm always filling my free time with productive things.  Working, school, extracurriculars related to my profession, honors groups etc.  Anything to help me get a fantastic job when I graduate.  I'm working hard to ensure our future.  His free time is spent doing hobbies.  Only.  Hobbies or hanging out with his friends/drinking.  I know it's important to have free time and hobbies, but he spends most of his day at work just hanging out having fun.  I have asked him so many times to help me out, but he comes up with excuses.  Even when he does work more hours, the business is so uncertain that we never know if he can even contribute.  Essentially, if I'm going to marry this man, I want to make sure that if something happens to me/my job, he can take care of me or our future children.  If I all of a sudden left the picture right now, he would be homeless and screwed.  He hates it when I bring up the issue of him working harder and us being poor because he feels like it's a personal attack.  I used to feel bad because I don't want to make him feel worthless or anything, but I don't feel bad anymore.  I don't think it's too much to ask him to be an adult and pay his own way.  A friend of mine suggested I move out and separate all of our funds to show him I'm serious.  I just don't know if I could do this to him. I really do love him and we get along great.  I just feel like he's got it so easy because I've enabled him (and I knew he was in this trade when we first got together) so why would he want to change? Please help me. 

TL;DR I work really hard and my boyfriend doesn't work that hard.  I contribute financially 4x more than him in direct proportion to our incomes.  So while it seems ""fair"" to pay proportionally, I work very hard and he coasts along on my hard work (which I unfortunately have enabled).  Love him though.

Simply moving to an apartment in town really isn't ideal, since I'd still be in debt to them for certain things, and my town is shitty and I don't want to live here anymore.

I've considered the Bay area, Washington, Oregon, etc. I'm ready for a change and want to start planning/saving now.

I'm in the social work field, 21F, and have student loans. I have a car and am ready for a change and adventure. If any of you need a roommate, know of a great place to live, or simply have advice, please, please, please help me any way you can. Reddit is awesome and gives me a lot of advice when I need it.

Also, I'm from the Central Coast of CA (seems great, but my town is lamesauce) and I've lived in LA for school for the past 4 years, and I hated it. I lived in DC for a few months and loved it, but as I just bought my first car, I'm not sure about driving cross country...but it is an option. 

I have to plan soon, since I have to figure out an internship for the 2nd half of the program in the next coming months.

Thanks :)

wxnnf,6,2012-07-21,As a floating intern pharmacist I see a lot of stuff going on that would make me quite uncomfortable once I'm fully licensed. Thoughts? Advice?,PharmDvsTRex,pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/wxnnf/as_a_floating_intern_pharmacist_i_see_a_lot_of/,"I work for a major chain in California. I float from store to store. Here are a few things that make me quite uncomfortable, but I'm not sure what, if anything, I can/should do about it.

1) California law mandates that if there is only one pharmacist on duty then there may only be one technician. There may be as many clerks as the rph feels comfortable with, two pharmacist interns, one technician extern. When there are two pharmacists there may be three techs. Clerks may ring up scripts, type scripts, and accept refills. Now in this chain I constantly see two techs per pharmacist. One of those techs should be working as a ""clerk,"" doing nothing but clerk duties in order for it to be legal. But both the techs do tech work (ie filling scripts, restocking drugs, etc).  An inspection by the board could land me fine if I'm the rph on duty at the time. 

2) California requires mandatory counseling on ALL new scripts, copies, and changes in dose or directions. Techs must instruct all patients to go to the counseling window if their script falls in these categories. I routinely see/hear ""do you want a consultation with this?"" I rarely see a tech direct the patient to the counseling window unless the patient asks for it. Not only is this illegal and could result in a fine, but it is dangerous! As an intern I've learned that patients don't know shit about their drugs or their side effects. It's important they talk with a pharmacist. 

I'll leave it at two. These are the things that bug me the most though there are a few other things that strike the wrong chord. 

Once I am working as a pharmacist I will demand any tech I work with to follow the laws. If they don't I'll report them. If I'm a manager I'll write them up. If corporate doesn't do anything to remedy the situation I'll report the pharmacy to the board.  This makes me seem like a bitch, but it's my license on the line. 

*tl;dr* I know counseling takes a lot of time, we are slammed with scripts, have corporate deadlines and goals to meet, and are usually understaffed, but I don't think that is sufficient reason to blatantly ignore the law. People are going to hate me.

wxh0n,0,2012-07-21,New photographer - looking for gear advice about quasi-professional shoots,cubanjew,photography,https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/wxh0n/new_photographer_looking_for_gear_advice_about/,"First of all, I'm very new to photography. I'm currently doing a summer internship and decided to use the money to finally dive into photography. I'm doing a lot of reading in my free time (trying to focus on 1 article per day) and practicing my shooting outside at least once a week usually.



**1) Gear:**

A little bit about some of the (relevant - ie: other than backpack, memory cards,  cleaning kit) gear I've purchased this summer:

Camera:  

* [Nikon D5100 16.2MP CMOS DSLR](http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-16-2MP-Digital-Vari-Angle-Monitor/dp/B004V4IWHY/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1342887713&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=d5100)



Lens:

* [Nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens (kit lens)](http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-18-55mm-3-5-5-6G-AF-S-Nikkor/dp/B000ZMCILW)

* [Nikon 50mm f/1.8G AF-S NIKKOR Lens](http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-50mm-NIKKOR-Digital-Cameras/dp/B004Y1AYAC/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1342887450&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Nikon+50mm+f%2F1.8G+AF-S+NIKKOR+Lens+for+Nikon+Digital+SLR+Cameras)

Misc:

* [Manfrotto MKC3-H01 Compact Photo-Movie Kit](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MKNJ84/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00)

* [Hoya 52mm HMC UV Digital Multi-Coated Slim Frame Glass Filter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009R98A/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00)

* Wireless release remote - almost done building


**2) Background Info:**

I've been seeing a lot of semi-professional photoshoots popping up on Facebook recently of friends and thought they were really sweet - things like [this](http://imgur.com/a/MfCjT#2).

I thought it'd be nice to have some shoots of my buddies and myself where we're not all wasted or at the bars. Would also make for some nice momentos for after we all split ways this coming year, post-college. Would be neat to maybe do one of those side by side photos for one of our group reunions in the future.

I talked to my friends and they all loved the idea, one buddy even asked if I could possibly do some shoots of him and his girlfriend and another asked if I could do shoots for his music/sound projects. Point being here is that maybe I want to venture a little bit into some crude semi-professional portrait/cover photography. Not looking to do anything that looks like photostudio work, but just more on the slightly humorous side, like [this](http://tampabandphotos.com/wp-content/uploads/images/Mighty-Mongo-vans-warped-tour-600x436.jpg). 

There's about 6-7 of us in our close group of friends that would be included in the shoot. We were thinking of all suiting-up (HIMYM &lt;3) and putting on some WWII gas masks to achieve a quasi-steampunk effect.

**3) The Question:**

I understand that I'm going to need to invest in some studio light kits and/or external flash to achieve the right amount of light exposure to give off the semi-professional look. I've been doing a lot of research and read up on hotlights, strobe lights, umbrellas, reflectors, hot shoe mounts, and the likes. Obviously each offers their own unique advantages, but I can't afford to buy them all. 

So my question is **what sort of items you would consider to be essentials for my purpose** (models/links would be greatly appreciated)?

I have my eyes set on the [SB-700 AF Speedlight - **$330**](http://www.nikonusa.com/Nikon-Products/Product/Flashes/4808/SB-700-AF-Speedlight.html).

I was also looking various light kits - a la

[Cowboystudio Triple Lighting Kit - **$60**](http://www.amazon.com/Cowboystudio-Photography-Portrait-Continuous-Umbrellas/dp/B003WLY24O/ref=pd_sim_p_1)

[Cowboystudio 4 Piece Light Kit - **$84**](http://www.amazon.com/Cowboystudio-Continuous-Photography-Umbrellas-Background/dp/B003VBKSWK/ref=sr_1_17?s=photo&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1342656606&amp;sr=1-17&amp;keywords=photography)

[ePhoto 3200 Watt Lighting Kit - **$200**](http://www.amazon.com/ePhoto-Photography-Continuous-Lighting-H9004S4/dp/B005HFB4KS/ref=sr_1_28?s=photo&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1342656730&amp;sr=1-28&amp;keywords=photography) 

[CowboyStudio Triple Light Kit + Backdrops - **$148**](http://www.amazon.com/CowboyStudio-Photography-Lighting-Backdrops-Background/dp/B003G9DRPC/ref=sr_1_5?s=photo&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1342656933&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=photography), 

but I don't know what sort of items would make a real difference for my application. Most of these shoots would probably be done indoors in an apartment setting, with some moderately large crowds of up to 6-7 people.

What suggestions can /r/photography offer?

**4) Budget:**


Bottom line is that I'm comfortably willing to budget **up to $500** for this purpose,  but I'd rather have a few quality items than a bunch of low-end crappy ones that become obsolete/useless in a short amount of time and end up piling up in the garage.

Anyone need a summer internship w reduced rent? Here ya go:


Hola! I've rented my place for a long time! My landlord lives next door. I went broke from a video game start-up but never, ever want to give up my place. I can rent 1/2 to you if you're cool for $675 (inc wifi, water, gas, parking)

Recovery is slow but I'm also an indie film producer and we've been winning BIG. I also produce website content. Are you a programmer?

I need help w/ booking my speaking tours, secrets of Hollywood industry nights, and film fest workshops... The more you help me book, the more you get my place to yourself. And again, my place is AWESOME! 

Full bath+shower, free wifi, big tv, projector, couch, fridge, dishwasher, stove, oven. Unfortunately no laundry-- but I'm cool w/ weird late night hours from coming home from bars, dating drama w/ your ex, etc.

Plus, you'll never need a car in LA again! Walk to Sony, Culver, TJs, Rush. Expo line to Downtown LA. Culver City bus TO THE BEACH! Bike path!

How much furniture do you have? Where did you grow up? What's your favorite movie? Where did you go to school? What job have you hated the most? What's your other favorite site besides reddit? :-)

Perfect if you're a photographer but sooo choice if you like messing around w Wordpress, php, etc. Accountant, CPA, business minded even better.

I'm a female entrepreneur w/ a solid track record who refuses to give up... A roommate would really help right now. My biz partner screwed me but I'm already positive I'm on the next big project-- after several months of coconut ice cream, yoga, gym membership, and sleeping it off ;) 

If you need to hide out and get your life together, too, I won't judge. I can even make sure my place is dark enough during daylight hours if you need to sleep... Game... Edit your film, code your website, be socially awkward, artistic, creative, or be an all around introvert. 

Tons of historical stuff nearby if you like to get out and explore. A few gyms nearby, too.

Just checking to see who's out there. I can sign off on your school credit; I'm legit in this town. 

Thanks!

wx284,17,2012-07-21,Should I tell my girlfriend's boyfriend about me before I dump her?,anotherschmuck222,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/wx284/should_i_tell_my_girlfriends_boyfriend_about_me/,"I'm 21/m, my girlfriend is 21/f, and her other boyfriend is probably 20 or 21.

So last summer I meet this girl who goes to Harvard. I'm in Portland. We dated last summer for a few months and things seemed to go well, but I'd never really consider getting serious with her - she's kind of inexperienced and annoying and scatterbrained in a way that isn't cute, but she's also a fucking genius and an enthusiastic lover.

Summer ends, she goes back to school and we talk pretty rarely because neither of us really initiates it. Towards the end of the school year we pick back up and we've been dating since she got back in town.

Flash forward to tonight. I come over for a dinner party she's having with some other interns at her company who she knows from school. Her roommate seems eminently surprised to see me - I haven't come over in a few weeks, we mostly meet elsewhere - and her friends seem to have never heard of me, which is weird because last summer all her intern buddies knew probably more about me than I'd have liked.

The night goes pretty normally. She's as into me as ever, and after she falls asleep I (with permission) hop on her laptop. She's automatically logged into Skype when I start up the computer, and this dude messages me like ""Hey babe, you free tomorrow?""

and I was like Whaaaaaaaaat is this?

So I do some snooping and find out two things.
1. She's been dating this guy for like four months. I'm reading chat logs and they seem to talk every night. He flew out to Portland last week to see her and spend the night on Wednesday (roommate must think this girl is super classy amirite).
2. My girlfriend has more issues than I realized. I did some more snooping, and she keeps a daily journal on a word document which is one of like two things on her desktop. Shitty security if you ask me, but that's kind of her style. Apparently she's pretty seriously bulimic, which I guessed, and cuts/self injures in various other ways. I knew she cut because I'm not a fucking idiot and I know what it looks like when you fall down some stairs, which she used to explain her injuries.

I'd like to make my exit as gracefully as possible. I'm typing this on her laptop and plan to bounce in the morning and not look back, but I'm wondering if I should tell homeboy that he's getting fucked around on, too. On the one hand, from reading the chats he actually seems like a nice guy and I can tell he really cares about her. She's been open with him about her issues and from reading her journal it seems like he's a huge support to her. I don't really blame her for having no social skills - I think either she doesn't realize that what she's doing is wrong, or that she's narcissistic enough not to care. She needs a support system other than her mother, and I don't want to fuck up the only good thing she has going for her. On the other hand, I feel bad for this dude. If I were him, I'd want to be told about the situation and know that I was getting played.

For the record I've been having unprotected sex with this girl and so has he. She's got an IUD so pregnancy isn't really an issue, but now she's exposing me to potential STI's from other people without my knowlege or consent.

I've also considered testing her a little bit to see how far she's willing to take it. Maybe dropping the L word and talking about moving in together. That seems kinda immature and not really worth the trouble but it'd be amusing.

**tl;dr Girlfriend has been in two relationships for the past few months without either of us knowing about it. He's the only person she talks to about her mental issues and I'm not sure whether telling him that he's been getting played is worth screwing her out of her only support system.**"

**EDIT:** I'm done with this thread now, folks. I think I've said all I have to offer, though hopefully this has gotten enough upvotes that other filmmakers and industry employees can offer their own opinions, since no one person, whether an intern or an executive producer, can speak for such a large group. I hope many of you have found this interesting, and for those that were offended by having this conversation, I'm still glad your hearts remain with the victims.

wwx2n,2,2012-07-21,"Soon to be LDR, College advice?",underley,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/wwx2n/soon_to_be_ldr_college_advice/,"(Apologies in advance for the wall of text, it's late and I tend to ramble.)

So i'm extremely new to both reddit and the LDR community, so please forgive me if I'm doing any of this wrong.

A little backstory: I (18/F) and my boyfriend (18/M) have been together for about a year and a half now.  We met about 2 and a half years ago, started dating immediately, but soon broke up because we were both too nervous to make any moves.  He dated someone else very shortly, before realizing he had made a mistake (his words not mine), and after a few months of getting to know each other better as friends, we got back together.  Everything was going amazing for the early months, finally fell in love and both had sex for the first time, etc.

But this is where we start to get backlash about wanting to try for a LDR.  Basically, in short, about 3 or 4 months after we had gotten back together, he cheated on me.  He was really drunk and high at the time, and he didn't have the courage to tell me about it, I had to hear from a friend of the girl. He's worked unbelievable hard to help us work past it and trust each other again.  He swears he has changed since then and he realizes how much he never wants to lose me etc. etc.

Now, we're both going off to college this year.  He's staying closer to home, while I'm going about 12 hours away by car, or a 3/4 hour flight away.  I'll be home for thanksgiving and christmas and such, and as a graduation present I'll be able to fly him up to visit me once or twice throughout the school year.


We both think our relationship is definitely strong enough to last long distance, however we both have slight jealously issues because of our past. We've talked about anything and everything but sometimes jealousy can be tricky for us, though we've gotten much better over the past year.

I saw that he had posted on the overall relationship advice subreddit about basically what I'm saying now, and the overall response was guys saying we should break up so he can enjoy college.  He responded sweetly saying that was never his intention and he really thinks we can work.  Still, the 'advice' he was getting broke me up inside.  He's going to a school known for it's partying, and though I know he's definitely not a partier himself, the tiny bit of jealousy that still exists in me is scared for us.

TL;DR Boyfriend and I are going to college, cheating happened early on in the relationship, jealously can still crop up on occasion because of it.

I guess what I'm really asking for is if you think we're crazy for trying to make this work, from people who have a real perspective on LDRs.  I'm also wondering what you guys do to make each other feel more secure when you're far away. Thanks guys :)

EDIT: My other fear is feeling like being long-distance will take away from the ""college experience."" It's a criticism I hear a lot but I've never known how it feels first hand, so if anyone has any experience that'd be amazing.

DUALEDIT: Woke up to this text this morning: ""___....I want us to stay together more than anything....you wouldn't be holding me back. I wart to talk to you, I want to spend time and Skype.  It might be hard but what else would you want to do. I want to be with you. I want to try. If anything we will grow more mature than any other couple. We will have trust coming out of our ears. And if something happened (which I don't believe ever will) then we'll have to do something. But ___, we are strong. You can't let fear let you falter. What we have is a relationship that will be taken to a new level. We will have harder times being away. But that will make seeing each other oh so much more special. So many people do it now with marines and college and even moving to a new country. So many people do it and work things out. We will still see each other. I'll see you at thanksgiving, Christmas for like a month, spring break, pax, summer all the time, and the same over and over. Maybe we will both get internships out in California. But what I know is that we will work it out and be together. I want that. You want that. Nothing can or will stop is. No girl can be you. No person can replace you. You, ___, are the girl I love. And no one else. And that will never. Never. Change."""
wwoww,74,2012-07-20,Basics for the Young Professional,gossipsquirrel,femalefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/wwoww/basics_for_the_young_professional/,"Yes, I know women's bodies vary, and this caters only to one type of style, but I thought I'd make one anyway. Let me preface this wardrobe with some quick facts about myself.

1. I'm 19 years old, about to be a junior in college, but am currently interning at a Fortune 50 company in an eCommerce office, where it is jeans casual and super relaxed. However, during the school year, I do consulting where most of our clients are Fortune 500 and business professional to business casual is required.

2. I'm 5'2, 110 pounds, wear 34B and am a pear shape, meaning that my hips and legs are where my fat is stored, but I'm relatively slim elsewhere. Forgive me if this seems as though it's focused on one body type-- I've tried to include examples of others as well!

3. Budget&amp;Style wise, I shop at H&amp;M, Forever21, Nordstrom Rack a lot. But whenever I buy anything from these shops, I am thorough with checking the construction of the garment, as well as the material it is made out of before buying it. I'm a college student, so everything is budget constrained.

I'll try and go through all the basics a young professional should own.

*Let me also say one important thing: before you go out and shop, you look at your body with a non-critical eye and pick out the things that you like best about yourself. Keep this in mind as you dress yourself and go shopping and pick out clothing that showcases these parts! *
___________________________________________



&gt;**Business Professional
**

**Jacket**

I find myself in a suit often, whether I'm presenting deliverables or interviewing for my next internship. I only have it in black, but a dark grey would work as well, if you wanted to wear it for other occasions. I also looked for a good weight to the fabric. As a pear shape, I also make sure my jacket ends before the widest part of my hips start. Otherwise, I find that my hips are emphasized and I look fat.

I also make sure that the fit is right, meaning that the arms are not too long. The arms should cover your wrist bone, but not extend down your palms or more. The shoulder seam should lay right next to the little bump, toward your arm, not your neck. It should not lay on or inside, otherwise it won't fit right. I'm not sure if everyone has this bump on their shoulder, but I just checked my sister and she does.

[This](http://bim.shopstyle.com/pim/56/32/5632b7a9368adf74eefda09f7bbc8201_best.jpg) is the exact suit jacket that I have from [Express](http://goo.gl/QHBA5) in black. I button it when I'm standing, and unbutton it when sitting down.

For more well endowed girls, you would probably benefit from a jacket that is a 2 or 3 button jacket, such as[ this](http://goo.gl/X9UwK) one. The problem with this example, is that the lapels might be a little bit too wide. Look for a jacket with narrow ones, as well as ones WITHOUT pockets on the top half. Simple pockets for the bottom half are okay. *--Thanks Jamanduh!*


**Trousers**

I have two pairs of trousers that I wear, but only one that I pair with the suit for a business professional outfit. I have [this in black and a dark brown](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;size=l&amp;tid=51371615) which I got again from [Express](http://goo.gl/xYmrZ).

When trying these on, I make sure that they are not too tight in the crotch. If the fabric wrinkles or puckers when you're standing up, then they don't fit right. They should fit perfectly on your waist and not require a belt. This gives me the most trouble, since my hips are bigger than my waist, so I'd advise going to a tailor to get anything fixed. As for the length, this wholly depends on whether you prefer to wear flats or heels to work. Regardless, your pants should not be long enough where you'd start to step on them. They should not touch the ground, or be close to touching the ground. They also should [not drape](http://us.123rf.com/400wm/400/400/nruboc/nruboc0611/nruboc061100010/603454-a-woman-carrying-an-umbrella-going-to-work.jpg) over the top of your shoe, because you want clean lines. Refer to the picture of the pants above.

Whenever I go out to buy trousers and try them on, I make sure to wear shoes I would wear to work. I also sit down in the dressing room with the pants on to see if they gape in the back. This way, I can also check length based on what shoes I plan to wear often.


**Skirt**

For hot days, or for when I want a different look, I pair the suit jacket with a pencil skirt. As always, when shopping, I look for fabric weight and content. For skirts, I check to see if it is lined, just due to personal preference of not wearing slips. The skirt I have is high waisted, but again, this is due to personal preference.

Fit-wise, I don't want a skirt that is too tight to my body. The fabric should not pucker when standing up. Sitting down should be comfortable. If you feel like the skirt suddenly gets tight when you sit down, then it does not fit. You should also be able to walk normally in them. If your stride is cut down, then the skirt is too small for you. A pencil skirt should also not hug your legs. It should hug your hips and slightly hug your butt. If it hugs your legs as well, then it's a bandage skirt, not a pencil skirt, and is inappropriate for work. The fabric should hang from your butt.

My skirt ends at the top of my knees. When I sit down, it does not pull up past mid thigh, because that would be much too short. It has a slit in the back that facilitates walking. Your skirt could be longer or have two slits by each leg, or be a dark grey or a dark brown. It could be high waisted or not. What matters is that it fits and flatters.

[This](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;size=l&amp;tid=9191912) is a skirt similar to the one I have, and it should fit like [this](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/318SXNVuBxL._SY445_.jpg).

Not like [this](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dq4uLVj7DxU/Tp3q9tCaZSI/AAAAAAAAAaQ/B96HuP3cwh8/s640/GG-8.jpg). The weight of this fabric is much too thin, and you can see the outline of the shirt that she has tucked in here.

Or like [this](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Xa1aoSEldMs/TLVNCNyjZcI/AAAAAAAAAH0/sNHKFzA_KAE/s1600/pencil-skirt.jpg). This skirt is too tight and the fabric is puckering.


**Shirt or Blouse**

I say shirt or blouse here because some people cannot wear button up shirts without getting them tailored. It just makes sense financially then, to avoid them all together.

The classic white shirt is button up and made out of a high quality cotton with a decent weight to it. Ideally, it shouldn't be too see through. [This](http://bim.shopstyle.com/pim/7b/53/7b53d10bce9a81d32ee813ae23b8f83d_best.jpg) one from [The Limited](http://goo.gl/5Lb59) fits perfectly, as well as [this](http://goo.gl/QyuZb) one from H&amp;M. The arms hit the top of the hand and should peek a little bit out of your suit coat. The buttons in the chest area should not gape. The fabric should not pucker. It should be fitted throughout your waist. If when you wear it, it does not satisfy these requirements, you either must get it tailored, or not buy it at all.

This is when you should wear a blouse underneath your suit coat. This obviously can vary widely and is up to your personal tastes. It helps to pick something in white, or another lighter color, especially if your coat and trousers are in black. But for business casual, you can wear pretty much any blouse, as long as it fits, is modest, and is flattering. Cleavage should not be shown. I like details on my blouse to be part of its construction, and not in the pattern of the fabric. Personally, I think patterns aren't business professional.

[This](http://resources.shopstyle.com/sim/76/18/76187294483213072c30266166cd2604/express-tees-lace-yoke-ruffle-sleeve-easy-tee.jpg) from [Express](http://goo.gl/ZBYlp) is appropriate under a coat, as well as [this](http://goo.gl/gL1gU), [this](http://goo.gl/9XKQs), [this](http://goo.gl/Y28qb), [this](http://goo.gl/iEgnM), or [this.](http://goo.gl/ZIYJa)

Basically, any blouse will do, as long as **fits, flatters, and is appropriate**.

**Shoes**

Close toed shoes are business professional, however these days, I find that an open toed shoe has also become accepted. However, I was taught that they weren't appropriate for business professional. Shoes should be in a solid color with minimal hardware. Flats or heels, just make sure you can walk comfortably in them. Nothing is more unprofessional than hobbling around on heels that you clearly haven't learned to wear. If you do decide to wear heels, there is a line to be drawn for what is appropriate and what isn't. Obviously, 6 inch platform heels are not appropriate for the workplace. My rule for shoes is this: if I bought it with the idea of going to a party/club in mind, then I shouldn't wear it to work.

I have [this pair](http://a2.zassets.com/images/z/1/3/0/4/1/3/1304139-p-MULTIVIEW.jpg) of low wedges from [Cole Haan](http://goo.gl/4vlw3). Honestly, this was the most expensive thing I've ever bought ever, but it was so worth the price. They are the most comfortable pair of shoes I've ever set foot into, but I've also heard good things from their line of Nike Air bed shoes. If your suit is black, so should your shoes be. If your suit is brown, brown shoes.

wwl49,0,2012-07-20,Bane's not too shabby for a fifty-something.,Scottama,TheDarkKnightRises,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkKnightRises/comments/wwl49/banes_not_too_shabby_for_a_fiftysomething/,"So, let's think this through.

In Batman Begins, when we first see Bruce, he is at Princeton and Rachel is an intern at a law firm.  This would have to make them at least 18 or so.

Bruce returns after 7 years, so by the time he was Batman he was 25 at the youngest.  [Apparently](http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/The_Dark_Knight), TDK takes place about 9 months after Batman Begins, so let's call him 26.  There's then an 8 year gap, making 34 at the very youngest in The Dark Knight Rises, and it is here that he is old and out of the game.

Then, there's Miranda Tate.  Less information to go on here, but she looks about the same age as Bruce Wayne, and she is played by the 36-year-old Marion Cotillard, so let's go for 35.

And then consider the fact that [Miranda Tate is the child who climbed out of the prison, helped by her adult protector, Bane](/spoiler).  [Apparently](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/social-network-actor-lands-role-176577) this took place 30 years before the story of the Dark Knight Rises, which would put her age at about 5, which seems about right.

[Her *adult* protector,](/spoiler) Bane, certainly looks to be at least 20 when his hood is removed.

Which would mean, of course, that Bane is at least 50 years old when he's beating Batman to a pulp in The Dark Knight Rises.


EDIT: It's been pointed out that Bruce has his 30th birthday party in Batman Begins, making him 39 or so in TDKR."
wzl3j,3,2012-07-22,I don't think I'm going to do what I want to do,Frustrated_Wannabe,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/wzl3j/i_dont_think_im_going_to_do_what_i_want_to_do/,"I'm going into my senior year at my university, and I'm starting to think it's a waste of my time. I'm learning a lot, but not all of the things that I NEED to learn. I'm trying to get into journalism and I'm having a lot of trouble conducting interviews, which is something we've never really gone over in any class. This is extremely concerning to me and I feel like my interviewing abilities will not be up to the same standard as the other potential journalists coming out of my school. 

Speaking of living up to the same standard, there are some guys who have gotten ridiculous internships and I haven't been in one decent one yet. Best I've done is work at a local museum pointing people to the bathrooms.

On top of all of that is the tanking state of journalism and the lack of trust in media in general. I have my morals and values, but I'm terrified that an editor might squash all of that in the name of making a few bucks.

I'm trying to learn another language as well and potentially move out of the US thanks to this new skill. However, even after learning the language for 3 years, and studying abroad in another country, I'm not sure if I'll ever be ready.

My medical stature is failing as well, as my kidneys are tanking and I will probably need a transplant in less than a couple years. I'm not sure what that will mean for my professional future.

Lastly, my girlfriend and I got into a heated argument Friday night which lead to a horrifying discovery as to how far my girlfriend's depression goes. It's much, much worse than I thought it was, and she can't get any help due to insurance issues. I'm also worried that she won't be able to go to another country with me as she gets panic attacks when she leaves her hometown, and she'll be terrified if we stay in a hostel somewhere since she'll worry that everyone in the room will be talking about her and she won't know what they're saying. She's on the heavy side so she's worried that she'll be made fun of and have a mental breakdown. 

So, I'm freaking terrified about a bunch of crap right now. If you want to give me a motivational speech, go right on ahead. I need it."

wz9mn,2,2012-07-22,Laptop Now or Later??,[deleted],SuggestALaptop,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/wz9mn/laptop_now_or_later/,"Hey SuggestALaptop, I have posted here before about what kind of laptop I should get, but I have a new question that is burning in my mind. 


So should I buy a laptop now or later?? I will be a senior in high school next fall, so I will definitely be getting a laptop for college at the latest by next Summer. I am working all this summer at an internship, and will be making around $3000, the majority of which I am looking to invest in a high performance laptop. My parents agreed to pitch in $500, so budget isn't really an issue.  So by the end of August I will have the ability to get a laptop for myself.


What I really want to know is... will it matter if I decide to buy a laptop this year 2012 (September-December), or early early to mid next year 2013(April-June)? Will the hardware/software be that much better that I should wait? I have never had my own computer before and I am really excited to get one. I can't wait to get into PC gaming, but I am unable to do that with my current computers. I don't exactly NEED my own computer, but I would love to have one that I can use for myself. "

wynnn,1,2012-07-22,[20/F] I think I'm becoming unhappy with my bf [23] of two and a half years - am I overreacting?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/wynnn/20f_i_think_im_becoming_unhappy_with_my_bf_23_of/,"My emotions are still a little shaky.  I'm considering that it could just be hormones, the time of the year, etc etc.  The thought of breakup has come to my mind more frequently lately, and it both scares me and comforts me.

I'm a fairly attractive female, graduated valedictorian of a class of 3000 seniors, and am attending a prestigious university, have a job, an internship, etc etc - I've got options with guys, they approach me all the time, and I always turn them down.  I know the guy I'm dating is an asshole (typical story, am I right), and yet because he's my first long term relationship, I feel so attached to him, and have put up with verbal and mental abuse for over two years now.

I've always been aware of abuse - whenever we argue, he resorts to calling me names he knows will crush me, telling me about how i'm a failure, and will never go anywhere.  This may seem like a typical fight, but I've never talked to someone who so maliciously wants to beat the other person down.  

If I have a problem with his actions or decisions, and I want to discuss them with him (and I really have to walk on eggshells when I do), he turns it around, calls me selfish and immature, and I end up apologizing.  I know I'm not wrong in these arguments, and that he is to blame, but it's just not worth getting my feelings hurt.  

I certainly am not totally innocent in our relationship - I freak out about stupid shit sometimes, and overreact (especially when I'm PMSing).  Let me give you an example of what happened today:

A couple days ago, I tried to talk to him about how I feel very poorly when he refuses to go to the beach with me every time I ask (especially since he knows the beach is my favorite place to go, and I am rarely able to make it there), and yet when his friend asks he jumps out of his chair and runs out the door to get there as fast as he can.  I tried to explain to him that it is not a problem I have about him hanging out with friends instead of me, but rather that I don't understand why he never wants to go with me - I seem to be only an option, and he obviously doesn't have a problem with the destination, so it must be with me.

So today, he goes to the beach again with his friend.  I have been one to sit at home when he refuses my invitation, but today I decided that I'm not going to let my summer slip by because he doesn't want to do anything with me.  So I texted him and told him I was going to the beach (at a different beach than the one he was going to, so as not to disturb him).  The response: anger, call me a slut and just wanting to pick up guys by going to the beach alone, etc etc.  

As he always does, he calls back an hour later, apologizes, and then offers something stupid as an apology ""Wanna hang out tonight?"" - as always, I accept, and feel terrible on the inside.  As I am on my way to his house, he calls me and tells me he is going to a bar with his friends.  

I suppose I'm just getting sick of being put second when I put him as the primary concern in my life.  

I tried to write the above as unbiased as possible, but of course it will be biased.  Just considering the events of today, do you think I am at least justified in my drifting away from him?  Am I just being selfish..."

wyekw,25,2012-07-22,Pokington's Eviction Notice,stephyt,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/wyekw/pokingtons_eviction_notice/,"I had a midwife appointment at 1045AM on the 16th. My blood pressure was high so I was sent to the hospital. Honestly I'm  not shocked it was high as I found out my mother-in-law showed up at the office the day we were in the hospital getting our NST/Ultrasound asking for us and basically annoying the office staff. Essentially she threatened to ""get the baby out herself"" should she be picking me up at my appointment so we told her she would not be needed the same day we asked - within hours. My husband had even called her and told her that morning when we had the NST/Ultrasound. Fortunately he didn't tell her where it would be (hospital vs one of the clinics) and though she called him AND me twice ""checking up on things"" (we declined to answer) she STILL showed up at the clinic and tried to say she thought she had to pick me up. Then I find out how irritating she was to the poor office staff who were all ""WTF?"" and couldn't release any of my info to her (thank goodness) - welp... yeah.

I'd already been pissed off at her and I'm sure part of what I had was reactionary and part was because I'd been taking Benadryl for the PUPPPs rash I had.

We stopped at home to get paperwork and take care of the cats and dog. I spoke with the midwife here and we agreed that induction was a good idea. After an hour, I had my husband tell his mom what was up and go home to clean the place with her.

I had my first dose of Cytotec to assist in dilation. I was at 1cm and 50% effaced (thinned) and my cervix was just starting to move anterior which is where it should be for childbirth.

I found out the cramping I'd been having were in fact contactions. I was hooked up to fluids via Iv and was on continuous monitoring. To get up to pee, I had to disconnect myself from the monitors but keep them on my belly, wrapping the cords around my neck loosely. I would have to unplug my IV pole and wheel it in. It was really, really irritating but contractions plus a full bladder would make them worse.

I was asked by another midwife if I wanted to use Cervidil and I agreed. It was placed and it was painful. When it was removed, I screamed. I have a pretty darn high pain threshold but it felt like sandpaper with fishhooks. As it turns out, the midwife intern had heard of people reacting like this to it before. It was inserted without any lubrication and coming out, it was scratching at an area you REALLY don't want scratched. I bled a lot. They then did an exam and I had to breathe through that and hold my husband's hand while staring at his eyes to distract myself from the pain. My cervix had become anterior and softer, so there was a bit of progress.

After this, I was given Cytotec again. I was having pretty painful contractions and had to call my husband in to help me after he had four hours of sleep at home.

Tuesday morning rolled around and I hadn'y slept due to the pain. The midwife on duty agreed that I should have some morphine and explained the risks and was very apologetic about my experience with the Cytotec. 

I slept for a little bit and was allowed to lay on my back with a wedge underneath so I wasn't all the way flat, but my hips no longer hurt from putting all my weight on them.

Honestly I was thankful that they were going so slowly because the little man was tolerating things fine and they didn't want to rush him out if there was no need.

I had more Cytotec Tuesday evening and agreed to Pitocin on Wednesday afternoon. Unfortunately the midwife on duty was a lot more of a ""medwife"" than any in the practice and the nurse on duty was a cunt. There really isn't a better word for it, and you'll see why I didn't use the word bitch or whatever later on. So this nurse, ""C"", keeps upping the Pitocin and says she wants me to be uncomfortable because that means it is working. We ask how long it takes to kick in. She doesn't really answer.

I start having contractions... contractions... more contractions...contractions that don't stop. I am in so much pain and the midwife is acting like it is not a big deal. ""C"" acted thrilled that I was in pain but within a few hours she left, leaving another nurse ""V"" to tend to me. She was REALLY nice and funny. I was given a water heated pad which was heaven and she was working her best magic to try and coax the little man out.

I was examined again by ""medwife"" and there was no real change. We agreed that I'd try Cervidil again only if she used a ton of lube to put it in and I was allowed to remove it myself (that was ""V""'s idea, woo) and I was given Pitocin for a couple hours. I was also told I could have dinner. They ordered for myself and my husband and ten minutes later, while I was crying due to what we thought was back labor and the water heating pad was there, I felt a pop.

Yeah, that pop.
My water broke.

No dinner for me wednesday night.

""Medwife"" kept the Pitocin on and I was having landslide contractions again, worse than before. V kept encouraging the woman to turn it off. She said that I'd be allowed a ""sleeping dose"" of morphine. I was crying, so upset and in pain. I was told my options were to breathe through it or get a c-section.

V went to the OB and the OB agreed to give me an epidural even though I was only 1cm dilated. Pitocin was turned off. The epidural was scary but the man administering it was amazing. I shook a lot right after it was done and again my husband was amazing and helped me focus. 

I was excited about the prospect of sleeping and that my little man might be on his way soon. Unfortunately he wasn't tolerating the Pitocin-induced contractions and was having decels (his heart rate was decreasing) after most of them so I was being moved every 15-20 minutes.

Thursday, I had progressed to 3cm. I had a catheder in and I started feeling contractions in my bladder (OW!) and it was removed for a bit. ""C"" was there and didn't seem to believe that what I was feeling was honest feelings and after the catheter was removed, she shoved her fingers into my vagina without any warning, causing me to yelp in pain. At that point, I did not feel comfortable around her and I made that pretty damn well known. The catheter was reinserted and the epidural was boosted. The midwife who I really liked was assisting and noted that my labia were swollen, probably from the Cytotec and the ""exam"" I had. When the epidural was boosted, I had an episode of the shakes and that was really, really weird. My heart rate went nuts for a bit.

A few hours later, my blood pressure went scary high. It was over 170 on the top and nearly 100 on the bottom. The midwife, my husband and I talked at length. I'd made no progress even with being on Pitocin more and we agreed with my water being broken, my blood pressure being high and being on the fourth day of an induction that it was time.

We planned a c-section.

Midwife explained everything and I was wheeled in. My son was pulled out of me at 2:19PM. He was 7lbs, 12oz, adorable and I was able to give him a kiss before he and my husband went off for other stuff.

I was doing okay, focusing, breathing... and then the epidural started wearing off. I could feel pushing on my organs that progressed to feeling pins and needles and then pain. The anesthesiologist had done a test prior and I could feel from a few inches below my breasts and above. As the midwife told me later, there are nerves that branch out from the area they were working on to that area so that was the reasoning.

I was asked ""stabbing or pressure"" and I couldn't think of anything but A or B, so I said ""stabbing"". The midwife said she was confused because they were using hands. I also had abdominal edema and that was causing issues closing me up. My husband heard me scream when my composure started to fail me and asked to come back in the OR. He sat with me and had me focus on him and breathe and we got through it.  don't remember being wheeled back to my room really. I remember the second anesthesiologist being asked what she gave me and she said she'd upped the epidural and given me two doses of morphine and something else. 

As it turns out, my son was wedged in my pelvic bone and started developing a welt on the side of his head. That's gone down considerably, but there was next to no way I was going to get him out vaginally since I wasn't allowed to move around much due to the constant monitoring.

I couldn't feel anything anymore and after a few minutes, I asked to feed my son. He started rooting immediately.

I blame being high on a bunch of drugs but I allowed my in-laws to come in and visit. Unfortunately they did so for hours and MIL asked if she could invite her pregnant niece who lived across the street. I like her and her husband so we said okay. She managed to get her aunt (my MIL) to leave and that was nice.

One thing i was thinking about earlier is how gender quotas might increase the 'wage gap' in certain fields where women aren't applying to jobs (and/or college programs) in those fields as much.

Lets take stem fields: say Microsoft decides its been getting too much flack for their gender numbers and puts out a policy telling all HR managers that they have to hire equal numbers of men and women for tech related positions.

So now we have the hr recruiter going to a college job fair. say, 5 women graduating in comp sci apply, and 20 men do. (i don't know what the numbers of tech program enrollments are, so this is just a example situation)

That hr manager can now only hire as many men as women, so only 5 of each can get hired. This means that only the top 25% of men applicants get hired (they would all be equally rated in terms of degrees, but there are other things to consider such as certifications, intern work, gpa, etc ).

One year down the line: the effect of only hiring the top 25 percent of males, but all qualified females has lead to more males getting promoted. (although to be fair, if this happens, some of it would also be from a unfair bias view on women as having only gotten in due to gender quotas.)"

wy66o,2,2012-07-21,How should I learn Computer Science/Programming?,summereddit,IWantToLearn,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/wy66o/how_should_i_learn_computer_scienceprogramming/,"I'm interested in learning more about computers and programs. I understand that this question has been asked before, but it's a pretty broad topic so I'm looking to get some advice, given my specific aspirations and interests.

I've had a little programming experience but I'm looking to expand upon it. I learned BASIC and C-based language in grade school, and then had a little more C-programming in a college-level intro to robotics class a couple years ago. Recently I've been talking with some CS majors and realize that I kind of wished that I took the opportunity to take more programming classes when I could have.

I'm interested in machine learning and seeing how a computer takes a big input from a database and recognizes patterns and can predict things based on it. I'm also interested in artificial intelligence and how computers can seemingly learn things simply based on its environment (I'm thinking kind of with robotics, but also other more generic applications of AI. It's all pretty awesome). My goals are: first, being able to experiment with these things as a hobby. Write some code, test things out, see how it learns (and make a computer do awesome stuff; let's be honest, this stuff is cool); secondly, I'd like to learn enough to be able to get a CS-based job in the future. Although my undergrad degree isn't in CS, I was in engineering and I'm guessing that if I can show people that I know computer science (through experience, I'm thinking working on open source software and maybe getting an internship? There always seems to be a demand for people who know CS...), I will be able to go to grad school for CS or maybe even get a CS job without that. 

My question for /r/IWTL is how should I go about doing that?
I'm thinking that I will teach myself either Java or Python (suggestions appreciated) and watch some lectures to introductory CS classes from free online resources (MIT OCW? Saylor.org maybe?). Then move on to algorithms, maybe a software engineering class, and then find some classes on AI &amp; machine learning. Is this the right order of classes to take? Is there anything else I should add? Am I totally off-base? Let me know!

Thanks for all the help!"

x1js1,2,2012-07-23,Really interested in having sex with other people but I'm engaged,TrickyTramp,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/x1js1/really_interested_in_having_sex_with_other_people/,"I'm not really sure what I'm looking for but I figured I could get some advice.

So right now I'm engaged to the love of my life. She's great and I want to spend the rest of my life with her for sure. The problem is that due to school and me having a summer internship, I'm not getting the kind of sexual satisfaction I want. We see each other for just a couple days a month except for this summer, where I haven't seen her for a month and a half and I won't see her for another month.

Masturbation just isn't cutting it anymore. Sex is on my mind all day with every girl I can imagine. In fact, besides just generally being lonely, I've become really interested in having sex, at least once, with someone else. I've never had sex with anyone else and I'm beginning to realize that unless we ever have a threesome I'll never get to experience someone else. She said she's definitely interested in a threesome, we just haven't found the right person since she lost interest in the first person we had lined up. Now, due to the strain this distance has put on the relationship she wants to wait until we're better off.

That doesn't help with the fact that I'm unhappy with sex only once a month (or only a couple times this summer) and I'm a little nervous of the possibility of not being able to explore a little. At the same time, I'm really reluctant to break up with her just to fuck around a bit, because we truly do have something special.

Anyone have some thoughts on this?"
x1e0g,6,2012-07-23,Can I make this function better ?,cyberbemon,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/x1e0g/can_i_make_this_function_better/,"I'm currently doing my internship, today I had a code review, one thing I was told during this was there are too many for loops and if statements. The code is written in python and for the task I thought what I did was good, I'm fairly new to python, but I picked it up faster than other languages and I'm very comfortable with it. My task was to test installation of a particular program(SCons), in order to do that I have to compile few .cpp files using this program.


There are about 6 .cpp files, the first test uses the default compiler in the system, the second set uses visual studio.

Here is how I approached this problem

* I made 4 lists that contain 1) files for default compiler, 2)files for Visual Studio, 3)names of .exe file from default compiler, 4) names of files from VS

* I have 2 functions, one for the default compiler and one for VS
* I use a for loop to Iterate through the list and compile each file 
* once that's done I look for the path where the compiled exes are saved, I can't hard code this because the folder names depends on few settings, so they are different each time!
* So I look for two keywords one at the start and the other at the end (it ends with an exe file ), based on the info I get from using 'tree=all' 
* then I iterate over each line and use if statement so look for the keywords, then add them to a separate list and run it at  the end.

So here is that in code 

**List 1**
[file1,file2,file3]

**List2**
[file4,file5,file6]

**exelist**
[exe1,exe2,exe3]

**exelist2**
[exe4,exe5,exe6]


**keywords**
dir_key = ""/out""


    def fun1():
         for f in list1:
		try:
			treeinfo = 
    subprocess.check_output(['C:\Python27\Scripts\scons.bat','-f' ,f,'--tree=all']).splitlines()	
			for afile in exelist:
				for line in treeinfo:
					if dir_key in line and afile in line: #Parsing scons output looking for 'out' AND and 'exe' file
						exe= line.split('-',1)[1]
						print ""Compiled file %s "" %afile
						print exe

						try:
							with open(exe) as f:
								exe_paths.append(exe)
						except (IOError)as e:
							print""File %s doesn't exist""%afile
					else:
						pass		
			print ""\n""
		except(subprocess.CalledProcessError,OSError) as e:
			print ""ERROR %s\n"" %f
			

Any Input on how to make this better ?

x1819,676,2012-07-23,Guide to having a hot girlfriend,weddingthrasher,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/x1819/guide_to_having_a_hot_girlfriend/,"Having a hot girlfriend is different than having a not-so-hot girlfriend.  If you're like me, you have been out picking up women for a while, but found someone that's just so awesome, cool, and attractive that you decide to make her your girlfriend.  This guide is about what to do AFTER you get the hot girl to agree to be your girlfriend.  I haven't seen a lot of guides on how to handle this situation, so here's my stab at how to keep her attracted and keep the relationship flowing smoothly.  It includes some observations I've made, but feel free to add your own:

* Don't be needy.  Ever.  Even for a second.  Hot girls can sense neediness and they respond negatively to it.  This is especially true when you're in a relationship with one.  Don't beg to spend time with her, don't fish for compliments, and don't call/text too much.  Give her space; this shows her you are secure in your relationship, and she will respect you for that.  If she decides to travel or go out with friends without you, let her do that, and go do your own thing for a while.  If you aren't with her and you feel yourself getting needy, leave your phone at home and go do something without it for a few hours, even if it's just going for a run or going to get a beer by yourself.

* Continue to demonstrate abundance and value.  Have lots of friends that you spend time with.  Provide value in every situation.  Make memories that you can share. 

* Don't let her be your purpose.  She's there because you're a complete and centered person, that's what attracted her to you in the first place.  Don't let this slide.  Have hobbies, business pursuits, passion for something besides her.  This will allow you to keep her respect.

* Other women will hit on you when you are with her.  Often, this will occur when a woman comes up to you and says 'your girlfriend/date/friend is really pretty,' or something similar.  To be clear (and it took my girlfriend to point this out), this is not them hitting on your girlfriend, *this is them hitting on you*, albeit indirectly.  Women, especially ones less attractive than your girlfriend, get insecure, and they will try to put chinks in your relationship armor.  Don't let them do this.  Deflect and ignore, but be cordial and maybe set them up with your single friends if they're around.  Having a hot girl with you conveys loads of value and women respond to this, it's their nature.

* Men will hit on her when you are with her.  You need to step up to this.  Most of the time, the dudes that hit on your girlfriend will be total chodes and it's likely that your girlfriend has been dealing with these types for years.  She knows how to handle / deflect them, but if they get annoying or clingy or creepy, you need to step in and make some kind of move, physical or verbal, to indicate she's with you.  Be the alpha and befriend, ignore, or tool on the guy (tool on him only after you've tried the first two).  However, be on the lookout for a signal from her (especially panicky eyes that are scanning the room or looking straight at you - it looks reactive).  If you see a signal like this, step in right away.  One time, I saw this happening and literally pushed another girl we were with between some dude and my girlfriend (in a playful way).  The dude backed off instantly and my girlfriend came up to me and I got a very appreciative makeout.

* A hot girlfriend will test your testicular fortitude on a frequent basis.  For me, this usually comes in one of two ways.  First, she will make some snarky or bitchy comment to undercut you in a small way.  Not a mean comment, but something borderline funny/snarky/bitchy to see how you respond.  You can do one of three things that seem to work to keep her respect and keep her knowing you are in charge and centered: a) ignore and don't respond - change the thread entirely, b) reward her in some fashion - a kiss, a squeeze of the hand, a smile.  Choice (b) may seem ridiculous and counterintuitive, but it works, I promise.  Getting rewarded for being bitchy short circuits her brain: she doesn't get a negative reaction from you (in fact it gets a positive one), so she realizes you aren't affected or made insecure by her comment, so she backs off and doesn't do it again.

She can also test you by trying to get lots of things from you.  You have to draw a line in order to show you are not a pushover.  Be nice and do things for her (she's your girlfriend and you - presumably - care about and respect her), but don't be too nice.  It's a fine line to walk.  Let me give you an example.  My girlfriend wanted a ride home from a work event, and doesn't have a car.  I agreed to pick her up.  She later asked if I would take her two interns to their respective houses, kinda far from where I live.  I straight up said no to this, but agreed that I could give them all a ride to a bar after and we could all hang out.  Nice, but not too nice.

* Show her off and be proud to be with her.  Most guys never get girls like this.  Take her out dancing, to bars, have her meet your friends.  This lets her know she's important to you and keeps her in the social loop.  She likes being out and about, I promise.  

* You don't need to buy her stuff.  Buy a drink or two when you're out, but you should be equal partners in who pays for things.  If the expectation becomes that you pay for dinner, then you become the guy who just has the hot girl because he has money to spend on her.  If you travel together, you get the flights, she gets the hotels, etc.   Give gifts sometimes, but make them meaningful and spontaneous.  If you are a pushover and pay for everything, she will lose respect.  

* Tap. That. Ass.  Seriously, she loves sex and you should be doing it frequently, improving your skills at it, and figuring out how you can have better sex together.  Dominate sometimes and do what you like doing, but be sure to keep her satisfied.  No one ever broke up because the sex was just too good.

* Overall, keep it spontaneous and fun, but with a punch of drama once in a while.  Women don't just like the super happiness bit all the time.  Once in a while, a little drama doesn't hurt.  Doesn't have to be anything serious, just something where you come off looking awesome.  For example: we were grabbing the last train home the other night, she was able to get on and I, (two seconds behind her) got the door shut in my face.  I literally screamed at the conductor to let me on, and he did, I got on the train with my hands in the air like Rocky and I made out with her in front of everyone.  The entire train was cheering (this was a 1:30 train home from the bars).  Be her champion.

* If she fishes for compliments, don't take the bait.  She gets enough positive reinforcement (especially about her looks) elsewhere.  But, offer up spontaneous and serious compliments that you truly mean.  If she acts a way you like, tell her.  If she's being bratty, treat her like you would treat a bratty little sister.

* Improve yourself and encourage her to improve, she will respect and love you for it.  There's always a harder workout to do, a run you can go on together, a new skill to learn, a new activity to try.  

I'm sure this guide is incomplete, and my only disclaimer is that some of these things only work for VERY hot women.  Minimum of a 9 for some of this stuff.  Otherwise you're just going to end up hurting her emotionally.  Some women who are very attractive have never heard a negative thing in their life, and rarely get told 'no.'  You're going to be the guy that doesn't put her on a pedestal.  Do this, and she'll stay attracted to you for the duration of your relationship.

EDIT: BadGirlThrowAway brought up a solid point, and I want to clarify.  Don't confuse neediness with being emotionally open.  These are two different things.  Being emotionally honest in a relationship is vitally important.  Neediness ruins relationships, emotional honesty sustains them.  "
x17dz,2,2012-07-23,How to Systematically Expand My CS Knowledge,mxmm,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/x17dz/how_to_systematically_expand_my_cs_knowledge/,"I am a rising sophomore doing a Math/CS degree at a top-15 school, and have gotten good grades in my courses and programming work experience over this summer. I learned how to program the month before college so I could pass placement exams, so I don't have the experience that many of my peers do. I am immensely interested in the subject and have surpassed most of my peers who are only casually interested, but there remain those intimidating few who have a very large knowledge base. I know that knowledge isn't nearly as important as creativity, but when it comes around to applying for top-notch internships for next summer, I feel slightly insecure with my relatively limited resume of knowledge. Also, when I sometimes see someone mention an interview question unfamiliar to me, I immediately research it and understand, but I'm not sure I'd be able to hold my own in an interview.

All this to say, I want to know how to best spend my time over the next 6 or so months before I apply for internships and have these interviews. I plan to create personal projects in the languages I do know, and r/programming and related subreddits have really expanded my knowledge. However, I don't know the best ways to learn Linux, web programming, and the intricacies of operating systems (specific system calls and all) within such a brief time.

I hope all of this came off sounding the way I intended, but the interview processes of Google, Microsoft, etc. really seem intimidating from my perspective right now, and I want to figure out how to best prepare.

Thanks."

I've been looking to build a PC to complement my Late 2011 i7 Macbook Air. It's an awesome machine, just too slow for some applications. I'll be using it mostly for software development and hopefully in the near-future some bioinformatics, computational neuroscience stuff (I'll be starting my MSc. in September). 

The Intel Xeon E5-2620 was chosen because it's the cheapest (reasonable) 6-core Intel, and although a lot slower (and without OC capabilities) than its i7 counterpart it does come with the perk of ECC. 

I'm Dutch so some of the parts are more commonly held in stores than in the US I've noticed. 

What do you guys think?"

I'll start...,CIassic,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x0qc1/what_is_your_most_frustrating_experience_ill_start/,"Today I was in a meeting for our internal sales team, who sell 401k plans to small market accounts &lt;15m. While idling sitting in the back of the room as every intern does, the meeting started to heat up and some of the sales team were getting quite animated about their commission not being appropriately distributed.

And it hit me, their commission isn't being properly distributed because of an internal database error on our program we use to log sales. Everybody knows that the territories are mixed up and do nothing about it other than vehemently complaining.

After 45 minutes or so of this complaining, I had mustered up enough courage to speak up about their problem. My solution verbatim : "" Could I interrupt for moment please? I was just wondering if (company name) had ever thought of hiring a computer programmer/ scientist to simply write some code and fix this problem"". ""I mean I took basic computer science programming in college, and this code would not be entirely far fetched, plus it would save hundreds of hours.""

The room quiets down....

And then erupts into laughter. FUCK THIS. These old school internal sales people fucking laugh at my suggestion to fix their fucking problems. I can't even begin to tell you my pure frustration, I wish I had a massive barbell that I could just smash windows with here. 

Companies like this deserve to fail if they fail to see a clear solution for a problem like this.

I am of Indian descent, but I'm 100% American(born and raised here).  I'm an INTERN, and only get paid hourly, so I do not make money off of the people I connect with.

I send emails to candidates that we have contacted in the past(2 of my colleagues have connected with him in the past 3 years), to reconnect and see if they're interested in finding a new job, or not.  It's pretty simple, if they're interested, I send them a job description and forward their resume to a Sr. Recruiter.  If not, they normally just don't reply. 

But, last friday, I received a response email that kinda made me tick.  As always, I take my time writing emails, and I make sure they are carefully worded not to offend anyone, or present false information.

Subject: Reconnecting - New Job Opportunity

*Kevin,* 

*I am writing to you today in hopes of reconnecting and introducing you to a new opportunity that may interest you.  Your experience as a project manager and business analyst is very relevant, and I was wondering if you are interested in a position to work as a PM/BA at a major consulting services firm located in Secaucus, NJ. 
Also, it has been a several years since we last connected, so if you could please send a current resume, we will more accurately match you to your desired position. 
Please contact me at your earliest convenience to discuss this, and future opportunities.*

*I hope to hear from you soon.
Regards,
ME*



So, I have drafted a response, but I wanted to know if you think I should respond to him with all the reasons he's wrong, or just forget about it?  **Below is the draft i want to send to him:**



*Kevin,*

*First of all, nowhere in my email did I say or imply ""we did business"".  All I said is that we were connected at one point, inferring that myself or one of my colleagues contacted you in the past.  In this case, my co-worker M. contacted you last year, and another colleague, P. received your resume through Dice in 2009.  You are also connected with her on LinkedIn.  Calling me a liar is impetuous and completely false.*

*Secondly, there's no need for arrogant, hateful racist comments.  If you don't want to do business with me that’s fine, but bringing race into a professional place of work is out of line.  Also, I was born and raised by my legitimate parents, in America, so unless you're calling me a 'bastard' in the slang term, indicating that you think I'm a vicious, despicable, thoroughly disliked person (which could also be seen as racist, and absolutely hateful since you don't even know me), you are foolish and presumptuous.  Either way, I can confirm that, yes, you are an arrogant prick.*

*Thirdly, learn how to spell.  It's 'lying' not 'lieing'.*

*Finally, I would be happy to 'reconnect your ass', since dealing with racist, ignorant assholes like you isn't part of my job description.*

*Have a great day!*
*Me*


**Is this response appropriate?  Do you think I should respond with everything but the profanities(calling him a prick and asshole etc.), and just tell him why he's wrong and ignorant. Or just drop it :(**

Thanks in advance, racism makes my blood boil, so I want to call him out, but I also don't want to become the bad guy. HELP PLEASE!


**EDIT:  Thanks for all the responses; It seems we have come to a conclusive decision.**

I guess i posted to see if his comment warrented a response, and the consensus seems to be NO.  

So thanks for the responses, I will take everyone's advice and just forward it to my boss, without responding to Kevin.  


I appreciate your input and I'm glad I asked Reddit before doing something stupid lol.

Also i'll probably delete this soon, just a heads up.


**EDIT 2:**  So I added him to our 'do not call list' as he requested, and responded (with permission from my boss) saying:

*Check your grammar.* 

*Regards,*
*Lying Indian Bastard*

x0blr,12,2012-07-23,I have been in an exclusive FWB relationship with my best friend for 2 years. Should I ask him to become an official couple or is it better to not fix something that's not broken?,doremifasolathrowawy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/x0blr/i_have_been_in_an_exclusive_fwb_relationship_with/,"I'm 20F and he's 21M. Let’s call him Henry. We have a really complicated past and FWB relationship so I fear there is something glaringly obvious I’m not seeing and that my other friends feel too awkward to tell me. Give me some tough love, Reddit. And brace yourselves for this long HIMYM-esque plot.


I’ve had a crush on Henry since we met in middle school, as our friends ran (and still do) run in the same circle, but we never got to know each other until college since I was painfully shy up to that point. The day after I broke up with my last ex, he started asking me to hang out. We went to get ice cream. Best decision of my life. He was actually incredibly easy to talk to and we had long conversations even though we didn’t have a lot in common.

We actually “dated” for 8 months. I say “dated” because though everyone else considered us a couple, he never called me his girlfriend. We spent every waking and sleeping moment together for the first 4 months. He even made us wait a month to have sex. He introduced me to his entire family, including extended relatives. The whole nine yards. So when he tried to get some time to himself, I started hanging out with other people but secretly thought he didn’t like me anymore and was seeing other girls. I guess I’ll also mention that we both have a lot of platonic friends of the opposite sex. This led us to become crazy people having crazy fights. When I finally asked him if I was his girlfriend and he said no, we really started falling apart. We had a rough “break up” a couple months later. I’ve only ever seen him cry once and it was when he was telling me he couldn’t do this anymore because he felt like a fuck-up for not being able to make me happy enough. After a week, we ended up hanging out all the time again, just without the sex and PDA.

Fast-forward 3 months. We got trashed at his house party and ended up having sex. Then he asked me to stay the night, which led to sex again (yes, we have awesome sex; he can give me multiple orgasms with only one finger). A few days after, I asked him for a relationship because I am still madly in love with him, but he said he wanted to be exclusive friends-with-benefits because he didn’t like me that way, seeing that he didn’t even know what he wanted to do with his own life, much less someone else’s. Then he said loved me, took a deep breath, and followed it with “as my best friend”. My heart seriously shattered all over the floor, but I agreed to being FWB. 

Here’s where it gets complicated: despite the fact he says we’re not in a serious relationship, he treats me like we are, especially in private (he doesn't like PDA unless he's drunk, but when we’re in his room, I can ask him to do anything sappy and he usually will). We still spend at least a couple hours together every day and I sleep over at least a couple times a week. Our friends consider us together. We can communicate with glances. He notices all the tiniest things no one else does, like when I get my teeth cleaned or that I trimmed my hair, and is always telling me how pretty I am without makeup. He comes to every event I invite him to and tells his parents every big thing that happens to me, like when I got my first internship, and they are very supportive of me too. 

I had shitty luck recently (family issues, illness, car accident, serious crime) and every time, he was the first to comfort and cheer me up with things he knew I liked. I went to the hospital once and he convinced all of his roommates to stay up all night so they could come get me in the morning. Then he made me food, put me in his bed, gave me my favorite bear (which he’d gotten from my apartment), and held me while I slept because he knew I didn’t want to be alone even though I didn’t tell him. For the last 3 years, he has always shown up right away wherever I need him without question, no matter the task, to help me. 

This is why I believe that deep down, Henry also loves me back and eventually he will make the move to make this FWB thing something more. The only thing is that I don’t know if I can invest anymore emotionally into this relationship without it being official. I’ve gotten so depressed and anxious when I think about this not working out in the end that I have started to see a counselor. When I’m not with him, I really really miss him, and when I am with him, I’m so incredibly happy and my heart still gets all nervous. 

Should I ask him to be my boyfriend, even though it’s very likely he’ll run away, or is this relationship a good thing I should just leave untouched and wait? If so, how much longer should I wait before it becomes pathetic? Is there a reason he won’t say the words he knows I want to hear? Is he just not that into me? Thank you for reading all of this! Please help :(

TL;DR: FWB of 2 years I’m crazy about treats and is committed to me like a girlfriend, but won’t say the words and I’m not sure why or what I should do about it."

Informality and general friendliness in relationships of all age, economic and social groups characterize the Thai culture and people. Thai people are tolerant of almost all kinds of behaviour and never expect foreigners to understand the intricacies of Thai social customs. But by following a few simple rules for conduct, and adopting a few Thai ways, you can quickly and easily gain respect from the people in Thailand.

A Thai greeting
In Thailand people do not normally say 'good morning', 'good afternoon', 'good evening' or 'good night'. They greet each other with the word Sawadee, and instead of shaking hands, they put their palms together in a prayer-like gesture and bow slightly. It is customary for the younger or lower in status to begin the greeting. When taking leave, the same word and procedure is repeated. This gesture is called a Wai. If you are greeted with a Wai you should reply with the same gesture, though it is not necessary to return a Wai to a child. Think of a Wai as you would a handshake. Initiate a Wai because of sincere pleasure at an introduction. You will not cause offence if you Wai inappropriately in Thailand, but you may create confusion. Don't return a Wai from waiting staff, drivers or other help. You might hope to strike a blow for equality, but will in fact cause embarrassment. A Wai to your teacher (any kind of teacher) is definately appropriate; any smiles you receive in return are of appreciation.

Sanuk means fun
One of the first things you will notice when you visit Thailand is the Thai people's inherent sense of playfulness and light heartedness. Sanuk is the Thai word for fun, and in Thailand anything worth doing, even work, should have some element of Sanuk. This doesn’t mean Thai people don’t want to work or strive. It is just that they live more in the moment, and do their best to enjoy it. The famous Thai smile stems partly from this desire to make Sanuk.

The concept of saving face
Thai people have a refined sense of public image and believe strongly in the concept of saving face. That is, they will go to great lengths to avoid confrontation and endeavour not to embarrass either themselves or other people (unless of course it is Sanuk to do so!). The ideal face saver does not bring up negative topics in conversation, or talk in an argumentative, judgemental or aggressive manner. Raising your voice or losing your temper will never be constructive in Thailand. It will result in loss of face for everyone involved, and you may be ignored as a result. You may notice Thai people smiling in the face of another’s misfortune. This is not a sign of callousness, but an attempt to save face for the person suffering misfortune. Saving face is the major source of the famous Thai smile. It is the best possible face to ease almost any situation.

shout out to me for not killing myself yet.

Yalgoo is an Aboriginal name first recorded for Yalgoo Peak by the surveyor John Forrest in 1876. The name is said to mean ""blood"" or ""place of blood"", derived from the word ""Yalguru"". An alternative view is that it is derived from the Yalguru bush which abounds in the area, and has blood red sap.
The spelling Yalgu was used because of spelling rules for Aboriginal names adopted by the Lands &amp; Surveys Department (the letter u best representing the ""oo"" sound). Within a month the Lands &amp; Surveys had decided reluctantly to use the original Yalgoo spelling, and this spelling has been used ever since. Some doubt about the spelling being officially changed resulted in an amendment from Yalgu to Yalgoo being gazetted in 1938.

wzzz0,0,2012-07-23,How Washington Works,[deleted],politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/wzzz0/how_washington_works/,"Oh reddit,

Before the last presidential election I heard Gloria Steinem compare Barak Obama to Jimmy Carter on a radio show, to the effect that Obama didn’t know how Washington works. In Steinem’s mind Hillary Clinton was the better candidate at that time, for her political finesse.

It must never occur to East Coast sophisticates that out here in the middle most of us are sick and tired of the way Washington works. As a result of the way Washington works, with its majority politics, toleration for superfluities of presidential signing statements, and other use of privilege by individuals superior to the law, the day Obama took office this nation was in full bank bail-out and newly involved in two wars.

The way Washington has worked since Jimmy Carter left office has been as demoralizing as any process possible. Men and women go to congress, get seduced by lobbyists and seduce interns, and with their pockets full of cash soon discover they just plain lack the backbone to stand up for any sort of principle. Talk soon turns to compromise and bipartisanship.
 
We’re left to read headlines that don’t deal with any real issues, but only scandal. At election time Americans are routinely served distracting sexual fare like abortion rights and gay marriage to keep our minds from going down to the deep end where no politicians dare to dive, among complex expensive problems such as poverty, judicial, educational, and prison reform, and corporate corruption.

Meantime every administration since Carter’s, who stepped into office as Pol Pot’s regime was winding down, has witnessed brutal genocides during which the United States stalled  interminably, evaluating its economic self-interests rather than providing humanitarian assistance. While the Kurds were exterminated in Afghanistan, while girls and women were held in rape camps and thousands of men and boys were systematically slaughtered in Bosnia and Srebrenica; while millions were hacked to death over months in Rwanda and Burundi, while the United States itself was implicated at the highest levels in war crimes in Afghanistan, and now, while in Darfur and the Congo not a day goes by that we don’t read of unspeakable atrocities occurring in particular or en masse, where are our armed services and why are they there instead of interfering for justice?  The wars undertaken on the basis of systematic and calculated lying by homicidal bunglers in the White House and Pentagon, who had to phony-up an emergency to meet their ends rather than risk exposing the actual merits of their designs on Iraq to fair debate, have inflicted long term consequences on our country and on the entire world.   

If slick ambition is what it takes to do Washington, it is also what distinguishes a politician from a real statesman. The role of a statesman is to transcend him or herself and find identity in a larger more noble meaning than personal gain. A statesman pursues ideals, for the good not only of his own soul but for his fellow’s sake, for his country and for all.  Statesmanship requires a person of fundamental goodness, intelligence, nuance, and skill. Today, politics is all about cynicism and celebrity, it’s about wealth but not about nobility. 

And that has come about because the idea of statesmanship embarrasses us. It’s too romantic. If we are satisfied to let politicians' publicists frame our issues, to be fed slates of easy positions on matters of marginal relevancy, we will never see big changes in the world.

A statesman needs a citizen. We voters have got to demand that fundamentals (like health care incidentally) be addressed, avoid dynastic leadership, step out of the machinery and drive the political process. If instead all we do with the information in Human Rights Watch reports, and books like Gourevitch’s We wish to inform you that tomorrow we will be killed with our families, Power’s A Problem from Hell, or Danner’s Torture and Truth is to award those writers prizes and scold among ourselves at book clubs, we will never advance in our own lives, let alone in Washington. 

Romney probably knows how Washington works. 

Me?  I’m voting for Obama and I invite your solidarity."

I'm 23 years old and halfway through a dual degree in International Business/International Relations. My main areas of focus are foreign affairs, trade and finance. I'll be finished by June 2014, so two years down, two years to go. 

I worked in a really well paying job from ages 18-21 but hit a bit of an income ceiling with that and decided to go to university to further my career opportunities. I was making great money for a young adult, but there wasn't much room for more and I wasn't happy to be on that money for the rest of my life. Now I've gone back to study after those years, and I'm having a lot of trouble finding work. Internships and Cadetships tend to want people who are in their last or second last year of study, which I am not as of yet. Simple unskilled casual jobs are also hard to come by because they're either going to younger people or to people wanting full-time work. Furthermore, I can't really get back into anything like my old job, and because I worked that job during ages 18-21, I haven't got much experienced in lower-level casual jobs that the average 23 year old might have (barista, warehouse work, hospitality etc.) 

So I'm at this real crossroads where I want to get a job that furthers my career but I can't. I also can't really find an unskilled casual job because I haven't been suitable for the role due to my previous work experience and age. Has anyone been in a similar situation to this? How did you react? I'm still trying extremely hard to get any sort of job or internship, but I've had countless knockbacks even with good work references and a GPA of 6.0 (out of 7). 

I'm not really looking for an all-encompassing solution to this, just wondering if you have experienced similar issues and if so, how did you deal with them? "

I have been living in Houston for the last two months while completing an internship that was supposed to end at the beginning of August but was recently asked to stay for the entire month of August. 

My problem is that when I originally came to Houston looking for a sublet (I am not from here), I only found a lease for June/July and no longer have a place to stay. I was wondering if anyone knows of any housing options that offer month-to-month leases or what some good options are? I know if I had to get a new lease I would have to go through deposits, applications fees, and background checks - which aren't a problem, just extra expense and time. I have been looking for rooms and sublets on craigslist but they seem kind of sketchy. 

I would like a place within 25-30 or less (preferably less) minutes of downtown in a safe neighborhood. I would like a 1br/1b to myself since it would more comfortable but at this point, I would consider a place where I have a private locking door in an apartment so that my things are safe such as a garage apartment, a shared apartment with private door, etc. 

Anyway, I am a SAP who plans to be working long hours archiving information, spend limited time at home browsing the internet and watching TV/movies, I am very quiet and clean and do not go out much. I may have friends visit me on weekends so would like to be able to have that option. For these reasons, I have been hesitant about living in someone's home. 

I am looking for something between the price range of 300-650 (depending on what utilities are available) but really need to keep a budget because I am going to be dipping into my savings since the internship is unpaid. I may be able to work a bit though with the price. 

Does anyone know of anyone that would be willing to help me out or can help me find a place that meets my needs?
PLEASE AND THANK YOU IN ADVANCE!

**TL;DR:** SAP looking for 1br/1bath apartment for the month of August because internship is getting extended and summer sublet is ending. "

Secondly, the only thing I'm somewhat good at is computer programming and I feel as though all it has done has hurt me.  I'm planning to major in computer science and I love it (I graduated high school this year); however, in high school all it did was drive me to isolation because no-one else there shared the interest as me and I was socially outcast by them as a nerd. Never had a girlfriend or even kissed a girl for that matter.  Right now I'm an intern at an IT company for the summer, but all my co-workers are 40+ years old so I can't gain any friends from the one field that I love.  I enjoy music; I've been playing guitar for 5 years and started taking drum lessons next month, but because of my nerd stereotype, it seems as though the skills are worthless because no-one will even consider me to play in a band.  I used to be really addicted to video games, but have since broke said addiction.  However, the time that I used to spend playing video games is now spent doing nothing and just sitting on the couch makes me feel worthless.  Every forever alone meme I have read perfectly describes me.  To me it just feels like my life was built to fail.

We met in college in our home state of Tennessee; I was a junior and she was a freshman. We've had ups and downs, but generally a very secure and loving relationship with great chemistry between us. We have talked marriage, children, careers, etc. She is my first real girlfriend, and she was a virgin before we were together. I graduated in May, and she still has 2 yrs left.

She went to New York this summer to pursue a summer internship. After about two months without seeing each other, I finally bought a ticket to NY. I was there for a week and we had a wonderful time (romantic dates, sight-seeing, cuddling and sex). I just got home 2 weeks ago.

She has been distant since I left. I called her this morning, and it all came out. She felt like we had lost a spark. Our week together felt like one between ""very best best"" friends to her. We didn't have any deep conversations anymore. Her feelings of being let down coincided with her fears that, with a boyfriend, she won't get as much out of college as she wants. (We talked about that a lot at the beginning of our relationship). 

Now, I'm feeling incredibly frustrated. I know she wants to go out with her friends and not lose touch, and she has told me that it's not fun for her to go out with them when I'm not there, so I offered all last school year (and this summer when I visited) to go out partying with her group. She took me up on this once the whole year, and never during my week in NY. I've been doing all I can to give her space, but it seems like all she wants is an opportunity to shop around. She's very afraid of divorce and regretting the fact that she's only had one sexual partner. She also revealed to me that she hadn't been planning on staying together when she starts her dream internship in California, which would last about 3 months starting in January.

What should I do? This morning I proposed that we cancel all communication until she returns to TN in 2 weeks, as sort of a trial separation. She agreed that this might be a good idea. She said she loves me very much, but wants to get the most out of college.

I love her too. I want her to be happy, but at the same time I don't want to lose her. Up until today, I had no idea that those two were incompatible. I am lost and afraid and I would very much appreciate some advice.

So I'm in a bit of a life predicament. I am about to graduate in Fall 2012 from a Big 10 University with a BS in Mathematics (concentrated in applied math) and Economics, and I am planning on applying for some graduate programs in Applied Math and pure math aswell (I loved my analysis and algebra based courses). I so far have a 3.62 cumulative with a 3.57 in math.
The thing is I am slightly on the fence due to finances and debt, so I was planning on searching for a job.
 Thing is I havent had an internsip in my last four years, I am not sure how heavy this will affect my search. My first summer of college I worked at a pharmacy helping out some pharmacists deliver medicine and stuff, my second and third summers I worked at a few retail places. Some I left on good terms, some I just left. Although for the last semester and this summer I have been tutoring students in elementary algebra to CALC 2. Will my lack of experience hurt my chances for jobs? I am really worried my lack of internships will have a severe effect on a search. If I can't find much I will probably just put an intense effort to my GRES in math and hope for the best when applying to grad schools in January.
I am putting my feet into a few applications for positions, but no luck (then again I had to rework my resume and I just recently got into the habit of writing cover letters, been lazy in the past).

So reedit, what do you think I should do here? I can possibly extend my graduation to the spring aswell and try to get a coop for the spring, but it seems like that would be difficult/ spending more money on credits.  

Thanks guys and girls.

I've been living in a new area for work and I've moved into a flat owned by a woman often not around (she has various things going on).  Anyway, with two or so months left until I will be returning to my usual place of residence, my landlady informs me that her mid-30s ish friend will be moving in.  No mention of when or for how long, just that she will.  At first I thought it'd only be a for few days, but a month later I'm pretty sure it's a permanent thing.  This is all fair enough, but there are a few main reasons why I'm really REALLY fucking annoyed.

Firstly, I'm 99% sure that her friend isn't paying any rent, while mine stays exactly the same.  It's a two bed flat, what I've been paying for it to myself has been perfectly reasonable, however now somebody else has moved in, I feel a little cheated. Especially considering I'm on an internship and my rent is a considerable expense at this stage of my life.

Secondly, she has two dogs.  Fair enough, I don't mind them, but she does very little cleaning up after them and they make a complete mess.  She just got two cats as well.  In my opinion, on a ground floor flat with no catflap or anything like that, it's unfair on the animals having to lock them both in and out (dogs and cats respectively).

My next major gripe is that she's one dirty bitch (kinda following on from my last point).  One thing I learnt from my up bringing is that you keep clean things (cutlery, plates etc) separate from the dirty things or things that don't matter (washing powder, shoe polish etc).  Yet, in her mind it's acceptable for cat hair brushes to go in the cutlery drawer, cat foot on the dining room table, the list goes on.

Le sigh, I'm sorry for troubling you Reddit.  I'm sure some of you have got equally bad or probably worse experiences with living with complete slobs. To put a positive spin on it, it's good experience in the field of how-not-to-live-your-life."

(http://www.dailypaul.com/246012/shooter-james-holmes-and-darpa-weird-science)

Wayne Madsen Report

July 23-24, 2012 -- Aurora massacre: several links between James Holmes and U.S. government research (Salk Institute involved in neurologically enhancing soldiers' abilities on battlefield...connections to DARPA)

James Holmes, the 24-year old suspect in the mass shooting of Batman ""The Dark Knight Rises"" movie goers in Aurora, Colorado that left 12 people dead and 58 injured, has had a number of links to U.S. government-funded research centers. Holmes's past association with government research projects has prompted police and federal law enforcement officials to order laboratories and schools with which Holmes has had a past association not to talk to the press about Holmes.

Holmes was one of six recipients of a National Institutes of Health Neuroscience Training Grant at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Denver. Holme is a graduate of the University of California at Riverside with a Bachelor of Science degree in neuroscience. Although Holmes dropped out of the PhD neuroscience program at Anschutz in June, police evacuated two buildings at the Anschutz center after the massacre at the Aurora movie theater. Holmes reportedly gave a presentation at the Anschutz campus in May on Micro DNA Biomarkers in a class titled ""Biological Basis of Psychiatric and Neurological Disorders.""

Initial reports of Holmes having an accomplice in the theater shooting have been discounted by the Aurora police. However, no explanation has been given by police why the Anschutz campus buildings were evacuated after Holmes was already in custody in the Arapahoe County jail.

The Anschutz Medical Campus is on the recently de-commisioned site of the U.S. Army's Fitzsimons Army Medical Center and is named after Philip Anschutz, the billionaire Christian fundamentalist oil and railroad tycoon who also owns The Examiner newspaper chain and website and the neo-conservative Weekly Standard. The Anschutz Medical Campus was built by a $91 million grant from the Anschutz Foundation.

In 2006, at the age of 18, Holmes served as a research intern at the Salk Institute at the University of California at San Diego in La Jolla. It is noteworthy that for the previous two years before Holmes worked at the Salk Institute, the research center was partnered with the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Columbia University, University of California at San Francisco, University of Wisconsin at Madison, Wake Forest University, and the Mars Company (the manufacturers of Milky Way and Snickers bars) to prevent fatigue in combat troops through the enhanced use of epicatechina, a blood flow-increasing and blood vessel-dilating anti-oxidant flavanol found in cocoa and, particularly, in dark chocolate.

The research was part of a larger DARPA program known as the ""Peak Soldier Performance Program,"" which involved creating brain-machine interfaces for battlefield use, including human-robotic bionics for legs, arms, and eyes. DARPA works closely with the Defense Science Office on projects that include the medical research community. Fitzsimons was at the forefront of DARPA research on the use of brain-connected ""neuroprosthetic"" limbs for soldiers amputated or paralyzed in combat.

According to his LinkedIn profile, James Holmes's father, Dr. Robert Holmes, who received a PhD in Statistics in 1981 from the University of California at Berkeley, worked for San Diego-based HNC Software, Inc. from 2000 to 2002. HNC, known as a ""neural network"" company, and DARPA, beginning in 1998, have worked on developing ""cortronic neural networks,"" which would allow machines to interpret aural and visual stimuli to think like humans. The cortronic concept was developed by HNC Software's chief scientist and co-founder, Robert Hecht-Nielsen. HNC merged with the Minneapolis-based Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO), a computer analysis and decision-making company. Robert Holmes continues to work at FICO.

It has also emerged that Holmes, when he was 20, worked as a camp counselor at Camp Max Straus of the Jewish Big Brothers and Sister of Los Angeles. According to the Jewish Journal, among other tasks, Holmes helped to teach boys between the ages of 7 to 10 archery. In another unusual detail, the car Holmes used to drive to the Aurora movie theater had Tennessee plates. Holmes is originally from San Diego.

James Holmes is the grandson of Lt. Col. Robert Holmes, one of the first Turkish language graduates of the Army Language School, later the Defense Language Institute, in Monterey, California. Graduating from the Turkish language class in 1948, Holmes spent a career in the Army, which likely included more than a few intelligence-related assignments. Typically, U.S. military officers conversant in Turkish served with either the Defense Intelligence Agency or the Central Intelligence Agency at either the U.S. embassy in Ankara or the Consulate General in Istanbul, or both.

Terrence Sejnowski, the Francis Crick Professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and the director of the Computational Neurobiology Laboratory, in an interview with Cognitive Science Online in 2008, had the following comment about recent studies of the human brain: ""Alan Newell [cognitive psychology researcher at the intelligence community-linked RAND Corporation] once said that when AI [artificial intelligence] was founded not enough was known about the brain to be of any help and in the early 1980s, symbol processing was the only game in town. That has changed and we now know a lot about the brain, perhaps more than we need to know [emphasis added].""

More than we need to know!

The links between the younger and elder Holmes and U.S. government research on creating super-soldiers, human brain-machine interfaces, and human-like robots beg the question: ""Was James Holmes engaged in a real-life Jason Bourne TREADSTONE project that broke down and resulted in deadly consequences in Aurora, Colorado?"" In any event, if the Batman movies are now serving as a newer version of J.D. Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye"" subliminal messaging triggering mechanism, -- Salinger's novel was of interest to a number of American political assassins --

Holmes seems to have received a research grant from the National Institutes of Health, 26 Grand IIRC. According to budget information, the NIH is partially funded by public/private donations, but also shares funding and real estate with The Department of Veterans Affairs, and multiple DoD entities, including a Cybersecurity Department,DARPA and the Office of Security and Strategic Information. (OSSI)

National Institutes of Health . ...... Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense to share medical facilities and expands authorities for urban organizations.

DARPA’S BIO-REVOLUTION
DARPA is hard at work spearheading a “Bio-Revolution.” This broad-spectrum strategic thrust
develops and leverages advances in all areas of biological and medical sciences to improve
Department of Defense (DoD) capabilities. http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CEsQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.darpa.mil%2FWorkArea%2FDownloadAsset.aspx%3Fid%3D2581&amp;ei=pxIPULTHKMie6gG5xYHADA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGtA635l_MstYxLa02sMtrJIkjDTg

Perhaps the most frightening of DARPA's weaponized science projects are those that deal with militarily enhancing that most violent of apes – man. In its 2003 strategic plan, DARPA touted the ""Enhanced Human Performance"" component of its ""Bio-Revolution"" program whose aim is to prevent humans from ""becoming the weakest link in the U.S. military."" Lest rats, bees, and trees become the dominant warriors, Enhanced Human Performance will ""exploit the life sciences to make the individual warfighter stronger, more alert, more endurant, and better able to heal."" Yes, what now captivates DARPA researchers once captivated comic-book readers – the dream of creating a real-life Captain America, that weakling-turned-Axis-smashing-super-patriot by way of ""super soldier serum.""

This excites me not only from a proponent of bitcoin's perspective, but also just as a general web developer because of how great of a stride it's been since even only a few months ago for me. I would like to use this new capability to tinker with the framework and see what sort of web applications I can contribute to the bitcoin community.

This isn't nearly as impressive as the mining rigs some of you have, but my main goal isn't mining. I hope to contribute to bitcoin's value by introducing more applications for it.

Does anyone have any tips for me from here? I've pretty much just echo'd getinfo() so far, and it seems pretty straightforward from here to scale to complex applications. I plan on reading the proper money handling guide, as well."

x2zwk,1265,2012-07-24,"UPDATE: Our summer intern has gotten lazy, what should I do?",iaacp,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x2zwk/update_our_summer_intern_has_gotten_lazy_what/,"[f]irst time updating, be gentle ;)

Hey everyone! I promised I'd come back for you, unlike Kate did for Jack. I don't even know what that means.

Sorry for being a little later than planned, I had a mini emergency that I had to tend to before I could get back here. Here's the update, and the thread in case you missed it yesterday:

http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x0tpe/our_summer_intern_is_extremely_lazy_and_spends/

So, I met with him in our small conference room this morning. He seemed really nervous. Asked how he was doing, how work was going, etc. Asked if he had anything to air out, if he was happy with his work, interested in it, etc, etc. He gave me mostly small answers like 'yes' and 'no', while remaining a little nervous. So I asked the ""okay, well do you know why I asked you here?"" while remaining friendly, not stiff (heh) or anything. He had this shit eating grin on his face and said ""uhh, you don't go on reddit, do you?"" to which I also had a shit eating grin on my face. We laughed, and I said how browsing the internet is fine, and I don't want to have to monitor him, but we *need* more work coming from him.

So then I asked if he has trouble focusing, or is bored with work or whatever. It mostly came down his lack of focus, which I can completely relate to (I was very recently diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, and we are close in age). We talked about things that would help him stay on track. I recommended getting up out of his cubicle every hour for 5 minutes, or walking around on our floor, and drinking plenty of water. Maybe take 5-10 minutes at lunch and go for a walk. He responded well to all of my suggestions, and I feel like the talk went great. 

Then I had to inform him where we go from here: like someone suggested here, I told him we're not here to baby sit, but to help him grow and learn as a programmer. We need to make sure his time is being used appropriately. If I notice another decrease in work, that's when the the punishments are going to have to get serious and I'm going to have to inform *my* boss about all of this, which will likely result in early termination. You know, to let him know we're cool, but we are still professional and work has to be done. I also told him if he feels like he's drifting again, or needs more assistance, to contact me before he goes back into this loop.

As we parted, I said to take 10 mins to browse reddit or whatever, and then continue on his assignment. Little did he know I had my IT friend redirect reddit to his own ""GET BACK TO WORK"" page, just for a short while.

I believe the problem is fixed. Thanks to all who gave input on the situation, to all interns who shat their pants upon reading this, to the few that sent me some seriously awesome FBI-level interrogation techniques, and to the many of you that inquired about jobs. No, I still can't get you one. I'm sorry. Oh, especially thank you to all those that called me a hypocrite for going on reddit at work. Please read more. Browsing is fine, as long as you get work done.

**tldr: Thousands of interns produce brown fruit that flows into their sabatons upon reading this thread. Our guy was one of them. We're cool now. I'll leave it up to him if he wants to out himself here.**

Edit: I'm still getting tons of messages about how evil we are for taking an unpaid intern, and how I have *no* right to make him do any work. If you'd read the damn thread and original post, he makes around $18 an hour! Also, plenty of people are chiming that this is fake because no intern makes $18 an hour, that's unheard of. That's the going average rate for internships in this area for the major (CS) and pretty much all engineering majors."
x2pva,0,2012-07-24,28M Sex History,iamathrowaway111,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/x2pva/28m_sex_history/,"Jennifer: I was 18, she was 17. Love of my life. Lost our virginities together. Very cute, petite hispanic girl. She got on the pill and we had lots of passionate sex (where I learned to love sex without a condom). Lots of sex with the risk of getting caught. We were together 2.5 years. Fell apart in college which I regret terribly. She married but her husband suffered traumatic brain injury and is a sustained vegetable. No kids but I still feel so bad for her. I wouldn't definitely become involved with her again if the opportunity presented itself.

Melissa: I was 20, she was 21. Another cute, petite latina (Venezuelan). We lived in the same dorm in college and shared a few classes. We had lots of sex but not any strong romance. She got on the pill and we had great unprotected sex. Really tight body and kinky outlook. We weren't seeing anyone else but it wasn't very committed. More FWB than romance. Saw her for about a year and half. She is married. I'd probably hook up with her again but probably not looking for a relationship.

MG: I was 21, she was same. Curvy white chick. Friend of some friends. Hooked up with her for around a month (safe sex). Sex was normal but pretty hot. She had a little bit of weight but I liked it. Great oral. She ended it because she thought I was more into sex than her. Which was true.

Katie: I was 21, she was 20. Fucking hot petite redhead. Smaller breasts but gorgeous sexy ass. I had an internship in another city over the summer. She was a friend of my sister. We first hooked up on a coach in a room I was renting. No condom. She pulled me into her as I came. Sex was fucking hot. She was submissive and eager to please. Only partner I've had who did not orgasm during sex. Very sexual but also a little unbalanced. Fought a lot. Didn't last past summer. More on Katie later.

I saw her a few more times when I was in town. It was a great time in our youth. She was hot and would dress provocatively. She certainly had more partners than I had.

T: I was 21, she was same. Curvy indian chick. Thin waist, great breasts, and a great ass. Grew up in States. I hooked up with her during last year of undergrad through my first year out of school. We lived together in a shitty apartment for almost a year. She was smart and sexy. Sex was pretty average but she had a great body. Used a condom early but she quickly got on pill. She had some pressure from her family and things ended. Badly. Relationship was bad for a while before it though. Some of it was certainly my issues. I did hook up with Katie again while I was involved with her.

Katie (again): I was back in town for a conference. We had dinner and she talked me into taking her back in the room. Hot sleazy sex. She was wearing these very feminine butterfly underwear. I don't think I came (inside) harder at any other time. I still remember every detail. She had a trendy pea coat over skinny jeans and a white blouse. Her curvy auburn hair was around her face. And her soft skin was so hot underneath me.

Nicole: I was 25, she was 30. Another friend of my sisters. Attractive brunette. She was anxious about sex at first. Became a pretty involved relationship, maybe two years. She was living in Brooklyn but working from home. I was moving and she came. We lived together. Very needy emotionally. I ended things. I feel bad about everything. She changed much of her life for me. She wanted the relationship. I didn't. She's a good person but I couldn't make it work.

Katie (again): I was 27. We started talking again. I offered to fly her to see me. We did that for a few months. She had lost her job and was being evicted so she came down permanently. She's extremely intelligent and has a degree. But she is extremely impulsive with bad judgement. She can't really hold a job unfortunately. Plus her degree is in journalism from a mid-tier school so it's worth very little in the job market. We had great sex. I lived on the water and had a nice convertible with a sexy woman next to me. Life was easy. Sex was fucking hot as always. She played house. We probably fucked twice a day. Once or twice a week I'd come home and she'd have a bottle of wine open and was horny as hell. We played with anal sex occasional. She'd always tell me how lucky I was to have her ass. That made it hotter. We also fought. And things may have started to soon after Nicole. Things ended again about four months. We still talk occasionally. She asked me to take her on vacation maybe six months after things ended (and presumably fuck her silly). Timing didn't work out with my work. Plus that's a box that shouldn't be opened again. She's still so hot and sexy.

?: This was a pretty slutty few months of my life. I had just moved back to the city from the coast. Lots of young attractive women. I was 27, she was 26. I'm not sure why I can't remember her name. Cute, tall asian chick. Nice breasts. Medical student at a good school. Crazy. Met her on internet. She was very inexperienced. Made out like being a teenager again. But would not come back to my apartment and make out in private like adults. We did have sex. It wasn't good. She wanted to talk dirty during sex but couldn't quite do it and chew gum. Lot's of daddy issues.

J: I was 28, she was 23. I had actually met her before I moved back to the city. Curvy, redhead. She had a body that was a little chubby but she was young enough it was only in the right places. Great breasts and a sexy soft ass. Freckles and long hair. She had the softest thighs and labia. I still get hard thinking about her. She was a friend of a friend. Nothing ever happened before I moved back to the city. But she called me up out of the blue. I think she was a little lonely. I flew her up to see me. We got back from the airport to my apartment to drop her bags off and she was ready to go. I was in my kitchen when we pulled our bodies together. We kissed and pressed her breasts into me. We made out like that for a while. She was demure about fucking me at first. But her pussy was perfectly shaved and completely wet. She knew what the weekend was about.

We moved to my bedroom. She gave great oral which I reciprocated. I got a condom and we fucked in every position. I loved pressing her stomach and breasts into the bed and having her from behind. She sucked my cock after I came. I love that. As I recovered, I rubbed her back, ass and thighs. I kissed the back of her neck, down her spine, and her pussy as she lay face down. I moved my hips over her ass as I rubbed her body. My cock was rubbing against her slit. We were both so wet. The head of my uncovered cock slipped into her wet pussy. She pulled me into her and told me she was on the pill. She wanted to feel me come in her. It felt so sleazy and hot to fuck her on our first ""date"" bareback. We fucked that entire weekend like that. I must have came in her or on her about a dozen times in two days.

She came back for another weekend. She had relationship expectations that I wasn't ready for. I stopped seeing her. I still get hard thinking about her. She texted me a few months ago with some photos of our mutual friends' baby. She tried to lead the texts toward sex. I still think she wants to hookup again. A nice sex weekend in the Caribbean or Mexico would be nice...

A: I was 28, she was the same. Thin dirty blonde. Smart, successful, and remarkably free of any major issues! We're in a good relationship that started on the internet. Sex is usually pretty average with an occasional stand-out. It's a healthy relationship and we're still together. Although, I do think about Katie and J occasionally. A purely sexual weekend would nice with one of them."
x2pcb,4,2012-07-24,Date was not memorable? (long read),[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/x2pcb/date_was_not_memorable_long_read/,"Hello to everyone who will read this. First, I'd like to say this is my first post on reddit. (sucks that it has to be about my relationship problems). So, if I do something wrong, just correct me please. Sorry for wall o'text!!!

My gf(18) and I (19) have known each other for about a year now. We started talking about a month before college through a facebook page for our college class. We would debate different music artists, random accessories, and other things. When we got to college, we hung out a lot. Like, everyday after our classes were done, I was either in her room, she was in mine, or we were sitting outside talking. About two months into the semester, her friends confronted me about her. They said she liked me a lot, and she was driving them crazy because she was freaking out about what to do. This confrontation also informed me that I would be her first boyfriend...and first everything. (Except for kiss maybe, I dunno.) Anyway, I told them I did like her, and then I asked her our in the following days. Everything was going fine, but then she started to take away from me time. Meaning, I wasn't allowed to play video games, or hang out with my friends. I thought, alright, I'm her first boyfriend, she expects me to be around her 24/7. Eventually I started hanging out with her a little bit less, so then she constantly dropped by my room. I broke up with her cause she started to criticize me on how I spent my time. I tried getting her to understand that at home I didn't have freedom, I wasn't really allowed out of the house, and that I was always being used by my parents. (As in lots of chores, always helping around the house, and helped build 3 houses with my parents. This would leave me too physically tired to do ANYTHING.) She didn't understand. So I broke up with her. This all happened within a month or so. (~october-november)

I think we went a few days without talking, and then she stopped by one day, and we started to talk again. We hung out a few times. However, it didn't register in her that we weren't together, and she would randomly kiss me. Yes, I would pull away when I saw a kiss coming, but she wouldn't let that go. During this time period, I would be mean to her. She would come to my room, and she would lay on my bed wanting to hang out, but I played video games or did homework. Yes, that is fucked up, I know. Then I would hang out with my friends, and when I wasn't in my room, she would check my friend's rooms. She would find me there, and then she would get really upset that we weren't hanging out. Most of the time when she asked to hang out, I didn't respond, but there were a few times where I said we would, but I went to my friends. (~november-april)

In December, we were on break from college, and she though it would be cool if we hung out. I admit, I did want to take her to the movies and hang out. So we did just that. We went to the movies, did some sight seeing, and I paid for all of it. (Transportation, movie+food, and pizza before she went home that night) That same day, while we were hanging out, she confessed that she loves me. At that point in our relationship(as friends) I was kind of iffy on saying I loved her too, because of all the stuff we went through. I said it back, and I meant it. I don't remember if we hung out after that, but we texted everyday, and skyped here and there.(decemeber-january)

Now we're back in college, and things are going great. And then shit hits the fan again. I try to hang out with her, but I like doing other things too. At first, she suggested we hang out every other day, and just see each other to say hi and bye in the morning/evening. We tried that, but she would constantly come by. From januaury, things would be hell until april. She would come over, we would fight, she would cry, and go back upstairs. My friends didn't like her, and her friends started to dislike me. Then, in mid april, things changed. My friends decided they like her, and they would stop making fun of her as severely as they used to. (Yes, I stood up for her even when we WEREN'T dating/going out). We drank together a few times(me, gf, and friends). 

This is where it gets weird. I was going to ask her out again, because I started to see things getting better. One day we're laying on my bed, and she decides she wants to have sex. Through our relationship, I took it really slow to do anything with her. At times, she would get upset of this and say that I'm not interested in her, or that she is ugly...y'know, the regular stuff. Anyway, she decided she wanted to have sex, and I didn't get a chance to ask her out before that. So we decided to say that I did ask her out ""before"" she lost her virginity to me. So we started dating again, and things were going fine. (april-may)

In may, the second semester ended, so we headed home for summer break. She cried that I would leave her and not pay attention to her. Within the first week of summer, I got an amazing opportunity for an internship. Of course, I took it. I was out of the house 8-7 every single day of the week. However, after every day at work, I would get home, and only want to skype her. Sure, I did play video games while skyping her. I understand that this is wrong, and have stopped this. This worked for about a few weeks. (may)

Then she started complaining that I should visit her. I live about an hour away from her by car, but I cannot use the car on the weekends because my parents need it then. Also, it is not my car to just take it and drive to her. So we decided she will drive out, and come pick me up, and then we can hang out. Let me just drop this: her parents make x3 as much money as my parents do. They also have two cars. Her parents don't really get along, but haven't gotten a divorce because her mother would end up in the street, simply put. She doesn't get along with her mom. Her sister is away at a good college, and her dad works everyday. So she doesn't have a picture perfect family. And I respect that. I always try to talk to her about whats going on, hows the family, but she gets upset. Then she blames me for not asking how she feels.

I convince my parents to let me spend the weekend at her house, and they said alright. So we spent the weekend seeing her town and things like that. I paid for everything except gas money. (which she asked her father for) Then two weeks went by, and everything was nice. We skyped, texted, and didn't argue. I went to her house again, and we did the same. I paid for everything except for gas, and she asked her father again. Then she came to my house one day after work. This marked our third month together. I took her to the flower shop, and I had ordered flowers two days ago. Little did I know, the store didn't have them ready. This upset me, because I lost a lot of time waiting on the flowers. Finally, the flowers were put together, wrapped, and I was able to pay for them. We walked back to my house. I then took her for a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge in Manhattan. We took a few pictures, and I enjoyed it a lot. We took the train back to my house, and since I couldn't use the car, she decided to drive her dads car to the restaurant. Now this is stupid: I took my brother along because he loves this restaurant. Yes, I know it was just suppose to be just us two, but I promised him I would take him the next time I went. I paid for the meal, and I left a huge tip. (Counted wrong, and left a 40% tip. The people at the restaurant know my entire family, and we have been going there for years now, so yeah) Anyway, we drive back home, and she waits in the car as I go to get her flowers. I looked into my backyard, and noticed my parents were there. So I asked them how I should pack the flowers. They quickly explained and I went to prepare them. I prepared the flowers, and took them outside. I didn't want her to leave, so I kept asking her to come outside of the car, and stuff like that. We kissed goodnight, and she said she had fun. I told her to drive safe, blah blah, her parents are going to be worried, so head home now. I also told her to text me when she gets home. 

I spent this past weekend at her house. Everything was going fine. I took her to see the new batman movie, and I paid for the tickets. I was about to pay for her drink too, but she declined. So I said okay. So we are sitting in the movie theater, and have a few minutes before the movie starts. She decides she wants popcorn. She pulls money out of her purse, and asks if I would get it for her. Okay. This pissed me off. When I ask her to hand me something, she responds ""You have two legs, and two arms"". So I said I don't want to get it, in a whiny kid voice. She understood, got up, and got it herself. Later that night, we were both hungry. So I asked her if we could go to the store to go buy something. She said alright. But she then said, ""I don't want to ask my dad for money anymore today."" So I said, alright. I understand. I'd prefer if we could split the cost or something, rather than pay it all. This came out of my mouth wrong, and she immediately got offended. She took me to Wendys, I bought a sandwich, and she didn't want anything. The entire drive TO the store, at the store, and the drive home, I was begging her to buy something to eat. (That I would pay for.) Nothing. Okay, fine. 

The next morning she drops me off at the train station, and I take the train home. Later, she texts me saying she is really upset that I didn't offer to pay for her. At this point I lost my cool and texted her back: are you fucking kidding me? I might not instantly say I'll pay for you, but all you have to do is ask. I have never took you out and not paid for you. Every time we hang out, I pay for everything BUT gas money. She then replied, ""I wish chivalry wasn't dead"". At this point I just wanted to respond, ""I wish princesses still existed"", but I knew that would cause trouble. 

As of right now, she is still ignoring me from the fight about the money. I have spoken to one friend, and the friend told me ""you guys aren't married, but movies and food is something you should cover. And you did cover it."" Please keep in mind that I am in college, and have to pay a LARGE amount of money because I refuse to take out loans. I am STILL nice enough to pay for her on the date. 

She also has sent me a package with a shirt in it. She has sent me cards saying how she misses me, and I have sent cards back. 

How am I suppose to go about this? I don't understand what else I should be doing. 

**TL;DR:** Girlfriend thinks I'm not chivalrous enough. Complains that I don't do enough ""loving"" things to her. Then goes to say she didn't think our date was memorable. "
x2n88,8,2012-07-24,Thinking about moving on from my first job. Need advice.,marpstar,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/x2n88/thinking_about_moving_on_from_my_first_job_need/,"I landed my first CS internship in 2009, writing COBOL (with a GUI) for a small software company. The job was very easy, just sat in my cube and fixed bugs all day long. The code quality was very poor, but I didn't care. I was being paid to code. It was great. At the time, I had much less confidence, and I was actually pretty content with the $33k job offer they made me 3 months before graduation. I was going to take it. Then my girlfriend got pregnant, and my world was turned upside down.  I needed a higher paying job, so I applied everywhere. I graduated with a degree in Computer Science in May 2010, and landed a job with a local company starting the Monday after graduation.  Compared to my internship, I've got a dream job. Working with C#/.NET, Android, 

A little background: The company was founded 15 years ago, and sells management software to the public sector. We've got a flagship product that's just as old, and within the past 12 months, the company has began development on our next-generation web application. Only one person on our team (of 20 developers) has had prior JavaScript experience, so I took it upon myself to start learning web development including JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.  In the 12 month since we've started this project, I have become the go-to guy regarding anything JS/CSS/HTML. We've already built a large part of the system's core, and it's just adding more and more domain-specific functionality from here on out.  

The problem:  I'm getting tired of the Business Analysts, UX Designer, and Product Managers telling us that we need this software out the door yesterday.  I feel as if they spend all of their time conceiving this ""game-changing"" product, but when it comes to the developers, we're simply the construction monkeys and we have no say in anything. Throwing 20 developers with no JavaScript experience at a 3-year project the powers-that-be want complete in 1 year has left us with a mountain of technical debt, and some parts of the architecture are shaky, to say the least. 

Because the BAs and the PMs order our backlog, we're constantly struggling to squeeze in refactoring stories so that we can try and keep the architecture as scalable as possible.  My immediate superiors have responded to this by 'assuring' us that the leadership team 'knows' that they 'will have to pay for this technical debt', but I'm not so sure that they know how much actually is there, or that they'll ever actually allow us to address it. 

The lead PM has, to say the least, been less than inspiring to the development team, even going as far as to announce to the entire company that ""Yes, development has hit every milestone so far, BUT there's still a lot to do."" at our most recent milestone celebration. I get the feeling that these BAs and PMs feel like they're the ""rockstars"" developing this new product, while we're nothing but the expendable labor they can boss around. Combine this with the recent rumors that these BAs/PMs are receiving sporadic bonuses while we get $25 gift cards for working a month's worth of Saturdays, and I'm just not as happy as I was when I walked through the door. 

For the average developer, I think that this place is a dream come true. The hours are super-flexible, and the pay is pretty decent for the Midwest, we aren't micro-managed by our immediate superiors, but I'm just tired of dealing with all of the politics between development and product management. I'm not afraid to say that I'm an above-average developer, and even with only two years on the job, I'm ready for something more challenging. I want to ask for a raise and promotion, as my manager has repeatedly said that I'm one of the most productive employees she has, and my advanced knowledge of JavaScript has made me a crucial component to this project being delivered on time.  Every 3 weeks for the past 6 months or so, I have been giving 1-hour JavaScript training sessions at lunch to the rest of the development team, which has been the only education on JavaScript provided to our team. 

I feel that at one point, this company really did value their engineers, but now just wants to give bonuses to people that aren't us. 

TL;DR I loved my job until they stopped appreciating their developers. I think I'm ready for a new challenge, but could very easily get a raise and promotion at the end of the year.  Burning out and not sure what to do.

Just looking for thoughts. "

Any creative/critical/constructive comments welcomes. Any ideas on an ending are welcome too, but I'm ready to work that out on my own as I write the damned thing. Just to clairfy it is meant to be a comedy or perhaps a modern farce.

*There's this office for Collin's Dictionary. It already has Tom Murdoch who's the only adult (Mike just got casted) who runs the the office for Collins. He's ex-MI5 and quite muddled, a bit of PTSD and a little paranoid. Got shuffled there because he interrogated a shop a ginger student for 36 hours when he suspected he might be an IRA spy. Now he gets cheap interns to come in and do all the work for him.*

*George Clarke is the long term 'intern' working on the thesaurus section. He's clever and knows it, sloths talk about being 'as lazy as a george'. Passive aggressive and believes that his talents are going to waste, which they are. Very frustrated and take it out on those around him with long winded rants but also likes to snipe at and devalue others, in his own sardonic and comic fashion.*

*Sarah McNeil plays mummy, makes the tea and coffee and friendzones people. She isn't innocent and knows what she's doing, she does it to prove her own personal feminist agenda of women being feminine and weak but ultimately that making them more in control. Ultimate cock tease. Lost her place on her masters course after sexually assaulting a first year student and leaving him unable to achieve an erection except whilst wearing a bib with 'good boy' written on it. This counts against her community work.*

*David Watson is crazy and reclusive. He plays scrabble against himself, and challenges his won words. He also claims to be able to do the Times crossword without filling any letters in, but when asked to says that there's no point. Tragic characters, haven't decided if he's really intelligent and stuck there because he's so odd, or he's thick as two short planks, and being odd is why he's still there. Says shit like ""What would happen if Pinocchio said 'my nose will now grow'"" and ""I don't think it's called the secret service, because otherwise how would we know about it?"" and ""If the Pope dies, is he being fired or promoted?"" and ""Since superman has x-ray vision, can he still see with his eyes closed"". He's definitely on the spectrum.*

*Henri Houwen is the protagonist. Fresh if the English Literature at Cambridge conveyer belt that delivers overeducated under-lived young people. He's idealistic and unadjusted. His white clothes are all pink because of a red sock in the washer and Sarah has to bring him in leftovers because he's starving. He joins the office as a new intern at the beginning of the play, or has already joined them, or is about to. He tries to get on with people and is torn between enjoying perfect grammar on one hand, but believing language is to be used by people in the real world on the other. He dresses like you, in fact he's a bit of a Claudio. Torn and undecided, easily swayed as he tried to please those around him. Has deep issues with people misspelling his name.*

*Tom believes there's an anarchist cell working to place spelling, grammar and definition errors into the Collins Dictionary. Tom's too well know in the dictionary world after receiving a number of prizes including best definition for his cutting edge definition of 'Tweet' in the '09 awards. He sends Henri to spy on the anarchists for him and work out how they're getting the spellings errors into the prints.*

*When Henri finds the anarchist (how?, I have no idea) they have almost exactly the same office with perhaps one picture changed on the wall. All the characters are mirror images of the ones in the Collins office just they all wear badges with an 'A' on them and have ruffled there hair. They talk about more aggressively but are essentially the same characters played by the same actors.*

*Henri gets chatting a lot to the equivalent of Sarah; Sister Sair-rah. Talking about words and freeing ones mind and comparing acts of first world anarchism (e.g. dating your signature one day earlier than you signed it, walking on the grass, opening packs of crisps at the wrong end). Walks home and gets pulled of the street by Sair-rah, who it transpires is a member of the Oxford Dictionary lot. Same actors playing similar characters just posh.*

*No idea what happens next. This has not been proof read or spell checked or any of that fascist bullshit.*

Oxford and Collins are the two big publishers which produce dictionaries. Thanks so much for your time in advance, reading all these scribbles, this is why I hate showing it to people, I feel like such a burdan on you people. Also, if you steal my idea I'll tear out your windpipe and wipe the wet side on your face.

x27ta,5,2012-07-24,Going into desperation mode soon...,patiencerunawau,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/x27ta/going_into_desperation_mode_soon/,"Good morning everyone!

If you would be so kind as to provide a little guidance to me I would forever be in your debt.

Here's the situation, I am being forced to law school. I have no interest in going to law school. I am going to be a senior in college and my parents are literally forcing me to go (they themselves did not go, my mother did not even finish college herself. She dropped out to help pay for my father's education). We already had it out a few months ago where my mother and I did not speak for a few days. I can’t stand that, I love my mother and want to please her and make my father proud. They promise they would help pay for it, ""there is money for you to go"" is what she says. My family is not rich by any means but we are certainly not poor.  

Now I realize how lucky I am to be in this position (they will not pay for all of it but they will certainly take off most of the burden if what my mother says is true). That alone is keeping me interested, how much could having a law degree hurt? The problem is, as I stated above I have no intention to be a lawyer. Not to mention within my group of friends they are already getting job offers from their internships while I am plugging away at my part time job and studying for the LSAT in my free time. 

Now, the only reason I have not gone insane at this point is because my mother is certain her connections would land me a job in the state's attorney office. Again, given these circumstance I am in a state of self loathing because I seemingly have it so easy, I realize how easy it could be (there are no guarantees she could actually get me a job) yet still manage to complain about the situation (I also volunteer a lot, so I see the underprivileged on a regular basis and get to listen to their stories and feel even worse).

What I really think I am meant to do, and what I am very interested in is law enforcement (when I offered the prospect of being a beat cop my mother almost had a heart attack and threatened to “cut me off” if I don’t follow through with the plan “we” (she included me but really it was her and my father) made for my future. 

I consider, on a regular basis, dropping out of college and joining the military to get my foot in door with law enforcement. This, I am fairly certain would kill both of my grandparents, they would probably drop of a heart attack if they heard that (they are also my best friends and I want to make them proud as well). Ultimately I would like to go into the FBI or some other agency on a federal level, but not the legal side.

Thank you for reading this far if you have, I appreciate it.

I just need some guidance here. My mother and father would certainly cut me off if I don’t follow through with what they have planned for me.

**TLDR: Parents forcing me to go to law school. Even offer to help pay for the MAJORITY of it, I don’t want to go...at all. Self loathing ensues (I realize how good I have it). Want to go into law enforcement, but not the legal side. Won’t listen to my reasoning, will cut me off if I break away from the plan they have choose for me.**

Have a great day everyone, and good luck on the exam those taking it!"

3 software internships, all at different firms  
1 part-time college job I held for 3 years on and off, software/IT job

I can fit 5 of the 6 jobs on my one page resume, if I include all of them I run over to a page and an extra job.  I want to leave off the 'useless' job, but would leaving off one of the non-full-time jobs make more sense to avoid an 'employment gap'?"
x22xl,33,2012-07-24,Being a woman with feelings caused my boyfriend to resent me and caused me to resent myself...,[deleted],SRSWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/x22xl/being_a_woman_with_feelings_caused_my_boyfriend/,"My boyfriend of almost two years and I split recently.

We started hitting a rough patch in our relationship when I was feeling particularly vulnerable (many of my friends moved away simultaneously, I was very stressed about work/college/my body/my future/money etc., and he was pretty much all I had), and I increasingly grew more dependent on him. During this time, rather than feeling supported by him I felt like I was being resented. He would never tell me any of what he felt upfront and I would often have to drag it out of him. This often resulted in him telling me how he questioned our compatibility, citing how our brains work differently, how he doesn't ""feel"" as strongly as I do, and how he needs his space. All this took a real toll on me emotionally, which created a vicious cycle of me becoming depressed because of the resentment I felt from him, and him becoming more resentful because of my depressed and increasingly dependent/emotional state.

Our breakup was a long time coming, but I refused to acknowledge it for months. In fact, I convinced him once or twice to stay with me. I told him that things will get better, basically promising that I will change. I found myself suppressing my feelings all the time for the fear that I will start a fight and he will finally decide that he doesn't want to be with me anymore. I was very afraid of being alone, thinking it would tear me apart completely. I was basically waiting for him to love me again, despite watching him pull away more and more. Meanwhile I was completely oblivious of the fact that I didn't love him anymore.

After spending a few weeks apart, due to him having a summer internship, I realized I didn't really love him, need him, or desire his approval of me any longer. After months of crying and convincing him that we should be together, that I could be better, that we could be better... I just didn't care anymore.

We broke up over the phone. I literally had to make him call me and break up with me.

After all the work to keep us together I now wonder why I ever bothered to stay with him. I felt no sadness when we finally split. In fact I felt free, and I feel free now.

Now, a few weeks later, I wonder how I let this happen to me... How did I manage to fool myself into thinking that being with a man, when the relationship is a shitty one, is better than being alone? How did I let myself think that my feelings weren't worth feeling? In retrospect, I see the extent to which that relationship caused me to see myself as a gendered stereotype. I saw myself as the nagging, clingy, ""bitchy"" girlfriend who needs to control her emotions. Ughh!!!

I don't really know what I'm looking for by posting this... I guess I just want to share what I have been discovering about myself in the past couple weeks... it is also lucky that I discovered the Fempire during this time, and finally feel like I have a safe space online to share these kinds of thoughts :)"

Will the Real Accountant, Please Stand Up? – To the rhythm/beat (whatever) of “Slim Shady” by Eminem

May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please? 
Will the real accountant, please stand up?
I repeat: Will the real accountant, please stand up?
We’re gonna have a problem here:

Y’all act like you’ve never seen a real audit before
Jaws all on the floor like Ernst and Young just burst through the door
Started sampling worse than before, going through drawers, turnin over furniture
It’s the return of the—aw wait, no wait, you’re kidding, he didn’t just say what I think he did…did he?
And Arthur Andersen said --- nothing you idiots Arthur Andersen’s dead, they’re all over the country

Feminist women love CPAs *chigga chigga chigga* “Deloitte, I’m sick of them, look at them
Walkin around, sampling you know what, interviewin you know who”
“yeah but they’re so efficient though” Yeah we probably got a couple of screws up in our head loose
But it’s no worse than what’s goin on inside your board room
Sometimes, we just want to leave our laptops and just let loose
But we can’t, so can we at least get some grey goose?

My rec is on your lips, my rec is on your lips, and if I’m lucky
You might just give me a little tip, and expect me not to know what the expenses balance is
Of course you’re gonna make me adjust entries, by the time I hit send re: here’s your reconciliation, reply please?
We ain’t nothin but camels, we go from audit to audit without stopping for even happy meals
But if we can balance budgets and fudge it through the audit, then there’s no reason that another
Auditor can’t get hope

If ya feel like I feel I got the antidote, seniors let us go on home, sing the chorus and it goes:

(Chorus – Repeat 2x)

I’m an accountant, yes I’m an accountant, all you other college majors are
finance and haters. So won’t the real accountant, please stand up? Please stand up? Please stand up?

You know, private companies don’t have to follow Sarbanes-Oxley. Well we do, so fuck that and fuck you too. You think we give a damn about your work flow? Half of you critics can’t even remember us, let alone understand us. 
But auditing, what if you weren’t, wouldn’t it be weird? Why, so you guys can just lie to keep me here, and sit me here next to Britney Spears, yo you know she needs an audit better switch me chairs, so I
Can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst, and hear em argue over who is goin bankrupt first
Lil Jon, he needs to file his 1040 and do it quick because it’s getting close to 10/15
I should download his audio on MP3 and show the whole world how we do our 1120’s
I’m sick of you little interns all you do is annoy me so I have been sittin here to destroy you
And there’s a million of us just like me, who dress like me, who just don’t give a fuck like me,
Walk talk and act like me and might just be the next best thing, but not quite me!

(chorus – 2x)

I’m like a head trip to listen to, cause I’m only giving you things you joke about in your cafeteria room,
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y’all and I don’t gotta
Be false and sugarcoat it all
I just get on Excel and hit it, and whether you like to admit it, I just did it 
Better than 90% of you associates out there and then you ask
“well how can firms take on these workloads in truckloads?” It’s funny, cause at the rate I’m going
When I’m 30, I’ll be the only person in the cubicle hurting, 
Crying to myself while outlook isn’t working, and the intern, he’s surfing 
The internet and isn’t working
And every single person is an accountant lurking 
He could be working around your state
Or checking out your LIBOR rate
Or in the parking lot, circling
Screaming “I NEED A BALL POINT PEN”, with his windows down and his notepad up

So will the real accountant please stand up and put one of those blue pencils in each hand up
And be proud to be out of your house and under control one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

(Chorus 4x)

x1wty,8,2012-07-23,Seddit I need your help to transition out of being a textbook beta,[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/x1wty/seddit_i_need_your_help_to_transition_out_of/,"I've read all the side bar posts.  I've studied inner game. I think that I have begun to comprehend what it all means.  But I have no idea how to go about to bring this change into my life.  For example here is a quote from the inner game wiki post:

&gt; You do not NEED approval from others. Approval is something a high value individual doles out to others. Receiving approval is taking value. Seeking approval is being a value taker. YOU dole out the approval. YOU are approached by value takers. YOU are a value giver. Every person you encounter in your life is better off for having met you. Whether it's just a wave hello to a stranger, a compliment to your butcher, or a massive party you help organize and invite high value people to, you're enriching the lives of others. You are benevolent and compassionate. You look out for and protect the people in your life.

That's great and all, I now understand what a value giver is.  But how to I go about changing so that I transform from a value taker to a value giver? I'm experiencing the same thing with all the points of inner game; I can understand them, but dont know how to act on them.

What I've found is that I can understand the concepts presented to me by the seddit community but I have no idea of how to implement them. I feel like I've been overloaded with information but I have no idea what to do.

Heres a little background info on me, make of it as you will: 19 y/o, currently have an IT internship for the summer. Never had a girlfriend, been or a date or even kissed a girl for that matter.
Basically on mondays, tuesdays, wednesdays and fridays, I get up for work in the mornings, go to my internship, get home at 5, eat dinner, and watch tv or browse reddit the rest of the night, along with practicing my drums.  On wednesdays after dinner I go over to my friends house where we have our weekly ultimate game. Thursdays I have off work, which is occupied by tv and reddit, plus I have my drum lesson. On saturdays, sometimes I do something, sometimes I stay at home and do the usual reddit + tv, and sundays is the typical reddit/tv combo. When I was reading through the 8 characteristics of the modern alpha male the only one that applied to me was number two: be firm in your beliefs.  Whenever I hangout with people I am a textbook value taker, giving very little to the group in return.  Whats really weird is that my friends rarely text me or invite me to parties/events, but if we are at are weekly ultimate game even if an event hasn't been mentioned they will make sure to bring it up and invite me, and I have no idea why this is happening. 

I think part of it is because I value myself as an individual very lowly.  I am always very negative on myself, mainly because I can't see any positive characteristics of myself.  The only thing that I know I'm good at and that I feel confident about is computer programming. Anytime I find myself thinking there's a possibility I might be good at something else or enjoy something else my brain always tells me you suck at that, don't do that, that's not you etc.  Also what I have found is that in conversations (not necessarily with females but in general) is that I have no problem talking and carrying on a conversation, but that I often run out of content because my life is really boring and most people don't want to talk about programming stuff. In group conversations this leads to me being a fantastic listener but most of the time people forget I'm there. I learned about threading a couple days ago and have tried it out, but it wasn't really going that well.  

Another point is that I have what I guess I would call induced approach anxiety. I have no problem talking to women, however, because so many women in the past have rejected me/ignored me/etc, I have found myself unable to progress past opening and having pleasant conversation for fear of rejection. 

I'm trying to break out of this; today I went to the library and picked up some political philosophy books as well as ""How to win friends and influence people"" by Dale Carnegie, but I feel like that's not doing enough. 

So, Seddit, what should I do to stop being a beta?"

 EDIT: I'm gonna go out on a limb here and state my general grades. I don't live in the U.S. though so classes are specific to my country, but I'm sure you can figure out how I'm doing. I am about to become a senior in highschool, this fall:

2. Programming! - Oh... but my math grades are pretty bad... wont't get in such a college...
3. Psychology! - Huh. Pretty much won't get in a good psychology college since the spots will be filled up by better people... and it's pretty expensive...
...
?. Medicine, way too expensive.
??. And finally, here I am thinking about getting into politics. But... it's a job for old people. And I'm not really into all that...

You may have noticed that I over think about jobs that actually pay well. I can't go for the stuff I prefer because I want a job with a future. Something that will eventually pay well too...

 **tl;dr**: Can't choose college at all. It's really a good time to make my mind already, and nobody around me is helping.(My rating of how well I do in subjects at school might help you help me, haha...)

x1qo3,2,2012-07-23,First ever break-up... happened about an hour ago.,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/x1qo3/first_ever_breakup_happened_about_an_hour_ago/,"I'm 23M she's 23F, we had been going out for about 8 months.

I feel like shit right now but not quite as bad as I thought... I kinda saw it coming but then again not really... It was going so great between us for the first five months, I would see her every weekend, and occasionally on weekdays when work would allow it (she was doing an internship). Then when my semester ended we spent a week together it went great.

Afterwards I left on a trip for 2 months, didn't do anything stupid, missed her like crazy.... When I came back I could feel things were a bit different. She was a bit rude with me sometimes and was reluctant to activities with me. We got a couple arguments, she would tell me she wants to be alone or with her friends but I hadn't seen her in 2 months so of course I wanted to see her. Then things started going good, we would go out to eat, to see movies, cudle like before, she would be happy to see me and all that.

But today, we were leaving her parents' cottage after a wonderful evneing. We had sex in the morning like before, joked around, and I felt great.

Couple hours ago, she shows up to my door and tells me it doesn't work. She doesn't love me anymore and it's not working. I was pretty devasted because I REALLY loved her. We spoke for 3 hours, we were both crying and holding each other, I tried to get reasons out of her but she just wants to be alone, and says its not the same with me.

I feel not bad right now, but when the memories start flowing in I break the fuck down. I don't know if things will get worse... My biggest fear is seeing her with other guys. She has a lot of guy friends lurking aorund and I'm afraid that's why she broke up with me... 

I told her I don't want to see her again, at least for a while and she started crying hysterically, I don't fucking get it. If it hurts her so much why did she break up with me? I still love the shit out of her and don't know to do. I felt like writing this to vent though. 

Cheers."
x1pzm,0,2012-07-23,What is a professional way to deal with a student/intern plagiarist?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x1pzm/what_is_a_professional_way_to_deal_with_a/,"Of whom, I am not their supervisor and I’m certainly not the head of any department.  Because the last time I confronted one of our students I was far too angry to go about it gracefully. (/TL;DR)  

I work in a healthcare facility and we have students come in for different types of internships.  Some require they observe for a week, others require months of participation as members of a department under the supervision of a licensed professional.  The students who are with us for two to three months are required to complete a project and give a presentation to most or all of the relevant department(s) during a mutual break (sometimes we’d get fed too!).  

Please note, first of all, the student was in a doctoral program (not MD, but PhD kind of doctorate.)

What I watched, as fellow member of the department, was the student plagiarize his PowerPoint presentation, and present it as his own work without any sources.  How did I know, you ask? 

I became suspicious when the presentation didn’t appear to be cohesive, but that could’ve just been a sign of working to the last minute. I wasn’t happy to see large chunks of texts without any citation, but maybe there would be credit at the end.  Sloppy work, but not worth vilifying the presenter.  

Then the font size occasionally changed without any apparent reason, and text appeared out of line.  Finally, the double bullets were the unambiguous sign that he had copied and pasted from another list somewhere.  I took out my smart phone and wrote a sentence into google closed in quotes.  LO AND BEHOLD, the same chunk of text appeared on an advocacy/education site.  I do it again when he advanced slides, and more information from the web shows up word-for-word in the top google result.  

I am vibrating with anger at this point.  I look around at my colleagues to see if anyone else has noticed, but they are all placidly watching the student talk.

Finally it ends.  No slide citing of any sources.  He asks if there are any questions.

I do not remember exactly what I asked, but it was about where he got his information.  Things went downhill from there.  He attempted to brush off my question, saying everything was his own work.  He wouldn’t plagiarize, NEVER.  I was mistaken.  I remember him asking why I was so angry, like it wasn’t a big deal.  

I showed him what I found and had saved to my phone.  That I could tell by the shoddy formatting. That it is a violation of academic and professional ethics to present someone else’s words as your own.

That’s when he started complaining about the time frame for the project and being given very little direction on how to proceed.   He apologized.  He’d spoken with a previous student who did practically the same thing he just did.  He apologized and apologized.  He would never do this, normally.  It was only this once, and had no bearing on his character.  I shouldn’t think so badly of him. This was a one-time thing.

In my mind, and I told him so, nothing excused plagiarizing, and it certainly didn’t excuse presenting the whole thing to a room full of people.  He showed an utter lack of respect by plagiarizing, and doing it so obviously.  What he did here made all of his other coursework suspect.  What would we see if we put his presentation through TurnItIn?  This could cost him the passing grade, and get him into a great deal of trouble with his supervisor and his school.  Students have failed courses and been expelled from schools for plagiarism.  This should not be taken lightly.

This went on for a good fifteen minutes.  I was riding on the adrenaline rush of anger.  I’m sure I looked scary to the people watching.

The end of the lunch hour brought an awkward end to the whole thing.  No one spoke, neither to me nor to him.  His supervisor, watching in the back of the room said nothing.  Everyone cleaned up, and I went up to the computer/projector to show him the evidence against him (he really, really didn’t understand the double bullet thing).  The rest of the day was largely quiet, and I was tired.

What could I have done differently?

I ask you about this, Reddit, because I have gotten a WIDE range of reactions to the incident.  Healthcare professionals outside my department and facility have defended my actions to one degree or another.  Non-healthcare workers think it’s hilarious.  A few colleagues gave me a thumbs up, while others I work with quietly took me aside and said I should have handled it differently, taking him aside and out of public space as they did me.  I embarrassed the student in front of his supervisor and the department.  I left a good student with a negative experience, and he may not want to work with us in the future. 

The student’s actual supervisor never once spoke to me about it.  I was so thrown by pulling a Bruce Banner --&gt; Hulk I shied away from asking about their take on it.

On the one hand, yes that wasn’t the best way to go about it…  However, I can’t help but feel that telling him one-to-one would have let him think “oh, only one person noticed, and it wasn’t my supervisor. Meh.”  I honestly don’t know if taking it straight to his supervisor would have changed anything, especially since it’s clear he passed the internship and graduated from his school.  Public shaming seems to have been the extent of his punishment.

But as far as efficacy goes, I think I gave him a good scare and showed him he’s not as good at BSing as he thinks he is.  

Ultimately, what I did was unprofessional, no matter how justified my actions.  I need to do better in the future.  So, the question is, what’s the better thing to do professionally?"

x5kpu,3,2012-07-25,what's the point ?,IjustCantStandThings,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/x5kpu/whats_the_point/,"I'm 24

I was in a long distance relationship for 4 years (broke off a year ago). Even though my ex girlfriend was adorable on some levels, she was way too overly attached and I couldn't stand it any more. She could have jealousy crises for just about anything even though there was no reason to have them. She was my first and only girlfriend.

But now, one year later I feel lonely as hell. 

I'm doing an intern-ship that I can barely stand, all that to get a job that I'll probably not like either. I slack off as hell during the intern-ship because I don't even understand what the hell I'm doing there. I don't understand what's the point in doing that shit ? The last two intern-ships went OK. But this one is in a big city where I barely know anybody and plus the work I've been given is just not captivating me at all. To be honest, I feel useless and not good enough.

We're all supposed to work at least 40 years in our life. All my life at the moment is work. And I hate it. I can't even see myself finishing the intern-ship. 

We're supposed to ""suck it up"" and work to get money. But what for ? Why ? To be able to continue working ? To do the same crap over and over again just to eat and sleep. I spend so much time in commute (2 to 2.5 hours a day) that when I come back to the flat all I can do is cook, eat and watch an episode or two of a series and go to bed. The week-end I'm too burnt out to feel like doing anything.

All of this would be much less of a pain if I had a girlfriend. But that seems impossible. My ex-girlfriend already seemed like a one in a lifetime thing, ie a girl that can accept me as a huge sensitive geek. I'm way too much of a SAP to even be able to approach women. I don't think I'm unattractive, sometimes women look at me. But I don't have anything to say to them, I lack the courage to go and talk to them. I'm almost positive that I'll bore the hell out of them like the few other girls I've tried to approach in high school (I was studying computer science in university and there were no girls). And even if I did, I'm too scared they'll crush my fragile heart. I'm also incapable of telling if a girl is interested in me or not, I'm completely oblivious.

By working in the computer science field, there's no chance I'll even be able to meet a girl. There is the one female intern at my job but she already has a boyfriend and I seem to not be fun enough. I also hate going out in public places. I don't feel comfortable at all in those places.

All what's happening now is that I'm looking at my life going down the drain and feel helpless. And I especially don't see the point in fighting back. I'm not going to miraculously find a group of friends, a girlfriend and an interesting job. I don't feel capable of doing it. I feel like a completely bland person, which is not a trait other people look for in friends.

I have a couple of friends, but I don't feel comfortable talking about this shit to them. My family never takes me seriously. And my cat is at home, not where I'm living at for the intern-ship, so I can't cuddle with her.

I just needed to say all of this, even though nobody will read. And if someone does, don't get me wrong, I'm not thinking of committing suicide. The idea of death scares me way too much to do that.

**TL;DR Broke up with girlfriend 1 year ago, feel lonely as hell, shit intern-ship and don't feel any motivation in anything. Can't understand the point in having to work all my life to to ""live""**

x5hgk,11,2012-07-25,The past 30 days of my life.,wingnutua32,selfhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/x5hgk/the_past_30_days_of_my_life/,"Hey guys, this is my first time posting anything on Reddit but the past month or so of my life has been a roller coaster, to say the very least. I decided to write about what has happened and how I have learned to better myself for the future. I thought I would share it and maybe provide hope to others.




The past 30 days have been some of the most tumultuous of my entire life. I graduated college a little over a month ago with a degree in Business Administration specializing in Marketing. I had no job but a “promising” internship that I had hoped would lead to a full time offer. I had a girlfriend of almost a year, who I saw as potentially someone I would spend the rest of my life with. My life was going great and I was on the right side of the tracks……Then that all changed.


After graduation I went on vacation with my family to North Carolina for a week, a celebration of sorts, for obtaining my degree. I returned a week later and within days of returning I received a text message from my girlfriend saying “I need to talk to you about something.” I didn’t need to be a rocket scientist to know what that means. My girlfriend broke up with me, telling me the typical cliché “it’s not you, it’s me” and “I don’t feel the same way anymore.” At the time I was devastated, we had spoken about “us” long term and marriage 48 hours prior to her breaking up with me. We had known each other since freshman year and had a myriad of mutual friends. Coincidentally, I learned at my “promising” internship that same week that there would not be a job offer for me at the end of the summer.


At this point, I felt like life had pushed me into a hole with no chance of climbing out. No job and lost my girlfriend all in the same week, the phrase “great things happen all at once” didn’t exactly fit. I just wanted to give up, I had applied to more than 50 jobs by the first week of July (I have the spreadsheet to prove it) with all them saying “I wasn’t who they were looking for.” I also was lucky enough to see my ex-girlfriend make out with some guy less than a week after we broke up. I was angry, depressed, sad, hurt, basically every sad adjective in the book. Thankfully, through a strong support system from my family and friends, I was helped from the bottomless hole life put me in.


I was more motivated than ever to prove myself right and put the past behind me. I applied to every job under the sun. I networked whenever and wherever. I accepted every cup of coffee and went to every happy hour. I told myself its not “if I get a job, it’s when I get a job.” I only allowed positive thoughts to run through my head.


Through patience and perseverance, I received a full time offer last week from a great company. I wouldn’t have been able to write this if it wasn’t for my constant networking and my pursuit of every opportunity. I will never forget the moment when I received the phone call from the human resources department saying, “We would like to extend an offer to you.” I knew my life was going to change immediately. I no longer had to worry about going back to my parents’ house or brown nose at my “promising” internship.


The reason I wrote this was to remind myself to never give up hope. Life will knock you down, it is your choice if you want to get back up and keep fighting. If you want something bad enough, you will get it. Maybe not tomorrow or the day after, but through patience and determination you will achieve your goals.



Hopefully, I did this right. Please take this however you want, I really wanted to share this."

There are a great deal of examples on the internet, but my mentor has asked for one requirement that I cannot figure out.

The fan has to be functional between 12 and 48V. Most of the examples I've seen just draw power from a Molex connector or something similar, but This particular application (because of confidentiality I can't be much more specific) needs to draw power from outside the device and its not always the same amount of power.
Most of the microcontrollers that I've looked at have much narrower ranges.  Even if I used a simple resistor voltage-divider, no combination could shape these voltages to fit in a 2.2:5V or similar range.

I'm still in the very early parts of the design process, and I have very little experience in this field, so if any more information is needed, just let me know."

I met what I taught back then what was the most beautiful, smart an awesome woman I’ve ever had the pleasure to meet in my life. 

In June of 2011, 13 students of my college got selected for a summer internship with a well recognized Top 500 Forbes company. I was one of them as you can imagine.  Half of us arrive in late may of the program &amp; the other half arrived in June 4th.

I still remember how everything was before meeting this woman.  This was my second time returning to the company as an intern. I was single &amp; enjoying life was not even thinking of being in a relationship because I did not felt the need of being in one. I was enjoying my single life so much. Focusing on my career and so on..

I had a female friend who before me coming to the internship had approach me to let me know that a friend of hers was coming to the internship also but was really nervous because it was her first time as an intern in any company.  Let’s refer to this woman as Angelica (My ex).  So I go and tell her hey, tell your friend to not worry.  Give her my number and FB profile &amp; tell her that we will have a blast, I will show her the way through the program.   I was being as friendly as I could be because that the type of person I am.

So fast-forward to June 4th 2011, Angelica arrives to the apt were we are all living, so she calls me and the first thing she says is... I arrived!!! But I’m in a crisis I need to go to Wal-Mart and buy some lady stuff. We both laugh through the phone &amp; I told her hey ,don’t worry let me go down and get you &amp; I will take to Wal-Mart .

When I go &amp; get her…  I was blown away by her beauty!!!  We both stared at each other for like a minute. It was an instantaneous attraction between the both of us what occurred that day. I immediately knew that I liked her &amp; that we would hook up during the 10 week program. 

This is when everything started…   as you can expect we clicked immediately; we were super attracted to each other, so on the upcoming weeks we got more involved with each other.  Our relationship was so intense and her personality, charisma, the way she treated me &amp; the intimacy we had was the most fulfilling thing I’ve ever experienced. 

Now… here are the red flags that I ignored &amp; bit me in the ass that till this day has crushed my soul into oblivion.

When I met her she had just broken up from a 5years relationship with her ex-boyfriend. She had been broken up not even a month when we met.  By the second week we had our first kiss &amp; by the 4th week we had sex for the first time.  

During the summer she had explained to me what happened between her ex &amp; her.  I told her , be honest &amp; tell me what you plan to do because I am developing strong feelings for you and I don’t want to get hurt in the long run.  She goes and tells me everything its over bla bla bla!  Like a fool I believed her.. :(

After the program finishes we return to our campus &amp; from there we keep ongoing with our relationship.  For 8 month we had the most intense &amp; beautiful relationship. I came to love this woman with my soul.  She fueled me in such a way that I managed to do better in other areas of my life. She complemented me in a way that I felt she was the one!  

But at the same time her ex boyfriend during those 8 month kept calling her and texting her, trying to get back with her.  I always knew about this because she would show me the text and phone calls.  To which I had suggested her to block the number. But she never did..

Suddenly by our 5th month  I notice her very distant and I knew this was the beginning of the breakup,  I got so nervous &amp; panic because I felt how I was losing her for no reason at all.  I could have not been better than what I was as her boyfriend.  Suddenly she tells me she thinks this will not work out …  I immediately start crying because I could not understand why she would leave me after all we have been through.  She would constantly say things like she loved me.. I was the most influential person she has ever had in her life. No man had treated her the way I did &amp; that I was the most complete gentleman she had ever encounter.

She started by saying that she needed time for herself, blab la bla. For me all of this is bullshit.  Now I get pissed because I felt like I got screwed. The reason for this is because in her 5 years of relationship with her ex,  she had broken up multiples times with him and each time she would break up she would meet someone start a relationship with them, then would end it and come back to her ex.  Therefore I was a rebound.

Back then when she breaks the news of breaking up,  I begged her not to, So in a way I forced the next 3 month of the relationship. During those 3 month she would get annoyed by the most bullshit things. One time I got so consumed by a project that I arrived late to her apt &amp; because of that she gave me a ton of shit for it.  She even used this as a reason to breaking up with me.  Now fast forward to November, she suddenly calls me one day cursing at me!! Saying how could you do this to me?!  To my response I go &amp; tell her: “What are you talking about” 

She goes and replies with: “I have Chlamydia “  I’m in shock!!!!  Because before her I had not had sex in like over a period of 5 month.  So I go and tell her this has to be a mistake I will take an std test.

She would not give me the benefit of doubt, I was just receiving her wrath of hatred.  To me, it was understandable her reaction but I knew I did not have any type of std nor ever had one in my life.  She goes and dumps me that day.  I go and take my std test, but then I found out that a month earlier she had booked a flight to Florida for December where guess what?   Her ex lived.

I confronted her &amp; she admits having been talking with her ex &amp; that she was going to see him over there. That news crushed me so much. A week later I get the test results and all of the tests are negative. Took it twice &amp; negative were the results. 

 I go and scanned the documents &amp; send it to her email and through text msg ..  Then I tell her what do you have to say about this..   She goes and tells me that she does not know what to think about the situation.  Later then shows me the second test she got and it came negative. So all this time it was a false positive.  

Everything calms down for a while, but I keep suffering because she is acting really wreckless and it does not make sense.  What happened to the charming sweet woman that I met?.  Now she is just acting  crazy.   January comes by and she invites me to a restaurant to celebrate my bday. But she is acting so weird and confusing.  One moment she is being very caring and treating me the way she used to when we were together &amp; suddenly the same night she does not want deal with me.  Then she tells me her ex boyfriend is coming to our campus area for vacation.   

By this time we are already broken up, but still it just destroys  me hearing this from her, so eventually she  hooks up with him again but while she is with him,  she would keep texting me and calling me. 

 What happens next?

She goes for spring break and visits him   but when she returns.. she broke up with him and later on not one month goes by and she starts dating a friend of mine!  It was so hurtfull to see all of this that I went on a mega depression.  Having to go to counseling &amp; a Psychiatrist.  

You may wonder.. Why are u suffering so much for somebody that obviously its not worth it?  The answer is simple..   Im not over her, I love her so much.. I skipped way to much stuff and everything seems that was always negative but it was actually the opposite. 

Now IM in a situation where… Im back for a 3rd internship  for the same company &amp; she also is here, we live to each other apt.  and 4 times already we have hooked up ( NO sex) .

We have had talk about what happened to us &amp;  she confess that the reason she never came back was because she knew she did wrong &amp; did not have the courage to come back to me because of shame.  Therefore she decided to move ON.  To which I ask her if she loves this new person in her life.  She tells me no , but that everything is going great &amp; she does not want to fuck this up.

But this is the real scenario  while we’ve hooked up,  she would then text her boyfriend but at the same time text her ex boyfriend.

After all of this Im still devastated because of the situation I’ve gotten myself .  I miss the person who I fell in love.  That person does not exist.  I see the potential she has but she is so emotionally unstable that I know its done foerever.  It just sucks!!  Ive cried so much for 8 month its pathetic.

Suddenly camed upon this : [When the Relationship's Over - By Randi Kreger](http://155.42.33.13/StudentLife/CounselingServices/documents/When-the-Relationship-Ends.pdf)

Now I’m wondering if she has BPD…  Please don’t judge me. I need your help r/Breakups.  Lift me up and be as honest as possible.  I know what I have to do,  but its so hard because I want her back.

**Summary:**  Met this girl, became a couple.  We were best friends, complemented each other in a marvelous way.  Suddenly she has a crisis with her past.  Dumps me,  tries to go back with her ex.  Does not work dumps him .  Gets new boyfriend…  Now we are living side by side on the summer internship. Have hooked up couple of times,  We have talk about us.  Im still suffering while she keeps doing her.

Suddenly camed upon this : [When the Relationship's Over - By Randi Kreger](http://155.42.33.13/StudentLife/CounselingServices/documents/When-the-Relationship-Ends.pdf)

Therefore  I think I was with a person who has BPD.

Which beer bar should I go to?,gull_senator,LosAngeles,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/x4x8j/i_have_4_days_in_la_which_beer_bar_should_i_go_to/,"I lived in Los Angeles for one year while I completed an internship at a social service agency on Skid Row. It was awesome and I loved living there, but I'm a New Englander at heart. Anyway, I'm coming out in August for a wedding and I'd like to take the time to hit up some beer bars in LA while I'm there.

When I lived there I didn't have a lot of money (obviously). Now I have a bit more so that's good. Anyway, the only three bars I every made it to with any regularity were Father's Office (not crazy about it, but close to a friend's apartment), The Blue Palms in Hollywood (because that's where I lived and I liked the atmosphere) and this one bar sort of in the downtown/Little Tokyo area that I THINK had a German sounding name. I liked it too. I might be off on the placement; it's been a while.

WHERE SHOULD I GO THIS TRIP? I don't know if I just didn't do a good job seeking out beer bars because I was so cash strapped (probably) or if the beer culture is just different here in Massachusetts. 

THANKS! 

(I did do a search but everything was old-ish. I'm also interested in new good bars, if you can think of any.)"

I bought a laptop from HP and paid for overnight shipping based on the ship date to make sure the laptop arrived before I left for an internship abroad for 3 months. HP delayed the shipment by a week in spite of explicitly guaranteeing on the phone that it would ship on or prior to the date provided and now I don't have a laptop with me. HP refuses to compensate me for international shipping and customs (~$300) that I have to pay. Buying a comparable laptop here in London would cost me almost double (I bought the laptop on sale).

Why does HP think they are not responsible to pay for their mistake? I think it is completely unfair that they do not hold their end of the bargain. I understand that legally they probably have fine print that protects them, but is there I can do to make them listen for the sake of fairness? I have already spoken to supervisors and ""customer relations"". I understand mistakes happen but how come it is acceptable for a business to just ""sincerely"" apologize and not make the customer whole (within reasonable limits)? "

I'm from Philippines and I want to know some points... (Sorry for my bad English...) 

Last May, I graduated from college, starting a new life as a web developer. You may say that ""Oh hey here we go.. Another Kiwi wannabe"" BUT Please, before you close this tab, let me share my story.

I came from a country that was too different from your country (I don't want to mention it one by one coz it will take ages!). When I was a kid, I met this Kiwi guy, he asked me if its always like this in here. ""I said yeah, but its a beautiful country isn't it?"" Then he started talking about this New Zealand. I couldn't believe what he said to me. Until one day when the Internet era came, I looked up what this New Zealand is. And suddenly I was convinced. I wanted to go there. I feel like this is my salvation for what's missing in my life.  

Now I'm determined to go to NZ.  I am.   

So here I am, a fresh graduate Computer Science. I don't have any jobs yet but these are the things I need to know:


1. I need to know how to get there in the fastest possible and legal way. I read  all about the migrations so I am aware about the technicalities to go there. But I don't know what kind of immigration plan I should take..
2. As for the developer/programmers. I read that the most indemand programming language there is .NET. How about PHP? Is it possible to get a high chance to get an employer with less in demand Programming languages like Java?
3. What do you think about the next 2 - 3 years? I heard that getting a job there is getting harder and harder...
4. Is there anyway I can get an internship? And how would it cost?


Thank you very much kiwis! Please help me fulfill my goal in life, and I will be forever in your dept

What do you think I should do?,alphaforfun,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x49js/i_am_going_through_a_slight_career_shift_what_do/,"I have worked in software development for long years and I guess you can call me a full-stack developer.  I have worked in networking and infrastructure for a few years too.  I really like what I am doing now. However, I have always been passionate about networking security and malware analysis.  So, I am thinking about doing a career shift.

After asking around, it seems that I won't be able to get a job unless I have security certifications such as CISSP, even if I have more skills and experience than the already certified employees.  The issue is that I can't afford paying for these certifications.

My questions are:

    1) Should I just stick to what I am doing now? I mean I still really like software development, architecture, and all that good stuff.

    2) Do you know if there is a computer security company that would hire me (even as an intern) and pay for my certifications?

    3) How would you recommend doing the career shift? two part-time jobs (old and new)? Cold Turkey? two full-time jobs?

x4603,6,2012-07-25,It's like I'm not allowed to be happy,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/x4603/its_like_im_not_allowed_to_be_happy/,"I have overcome chemical depression (or imbalance or whatever you want to call it) and all the horrid and deranged thoughts, behaviors, beliefs and confusion that comes w/ growing up not knowing who your going to be from one day to the next.  

Several years of introspection, therapy, trial and error and painful realizations and failures, along with appropriate meds for a specific time period, allowed me to untie those knots.

I have beaten alcoholism, teaching myself how to drink responsibly and not become a blacked-out scene causer.  

Several years of public drunkenness, potential relationships destroyed, friendships ended, jobs lost, opinions of me irreparably damaged and plain old self hate provided me with the motivation to not fail.

I have overcome a debilitating case of social anxiety and insecurity to manage to go from a kid who never kissed a girl until he was 17, a virgin until 19, to become not a ladies man or a player, but someone who can hold his own and is able to attract new women.  

A lifetime of rejection, failure and a relentless will to stop feeling this (the biggest of all pains) on a regular basis pushed me to work out my fears and identify my over compensatory behaviors, and allowed me to mature into a kind, charming and somewhat well dressed man.

I have gone from being the broke friend for 20 straight years to being the guy who picks up the tab.  This took 7 years of sacrifice, walking or taking public trans to community college, and going right home after, having no available time for a workable job schedule that could provide funds capable of any more than small daily rations.  Unpaid internships, minimum wage and watching everyone w/ money enjoy everything I wanted and was working for gave me a goal to strive for over the years of nothingness.

*not to mention all these time periods overlap one another*

And every single one of these things has been taken from me in one way or another.  Not all at once, but each time the achievement was stripped and reduced to a source of regret.

Dui arrests have taken my job and my money.  My family, my friends and more than anyone I am so disgusted and disappointed in my failure.  3 dui's over 9 years.  1 without driving a car.  1 for marijuana.  My freedom remains only until my sentencing.    

After playing the single scene for years, I finally was in the position to transition to a more healthy lifestyle.  The girl I was seeing and beginning to fall for, in turn played mind game after mind game as she used me to whatever end I am still not sure of.  Deeply hurtful and cool-headedly cruel comments and actions that I absorbed, afraid of being alone to face this sentence, knowing that having only a few weeks left, it would be impossible to find someone new and build again, and mostly stubborn and unwilling to admit I was going to come up short once again.  

My efforts were viewed as pathetic, needy..desperate.  Her lies and manipulation caused me to be insecure to a point I hadn't been since I was a depressed little kid with hyper anxiety, new in school having moved towns in 2nd grade.

Everything I was proud of myself for has been pieced away in this year alone.  I entered 2012 ready for the best year of my life.  And I stand now worse than before, not because I am in the same place but because I had so much and wound up here.  

There's something about ""to have loved and lost"".......that's bullshit.  Not that I was in love w/ any one specific person or thing..but I loved my life for 2 months this year, for the first time in my life.  2 months more than I could piece together over my entire life, and they were back to back and looking to continue onward.  And it is all gone.  And I have never felt worse.

I bring this here because your strangers.  And I'm anonymous.  With epic novels that could be spun about my family-that whole thing, my friends and the relationship I have w/ them, and my wandering and impersonal sex life (or it was, until I met this last one- who, again, I went all in with only to be systematically deconstructed by, to the point where I wouldn't dream of sharing personal stuff with her) I will simply say they are not an option in this regard.  

I'm hurting.  And I need to get shit off my chest without it coming back.  

I feel like I am not allowed to be happy.  The things in my life I work at and build on...always fall from beneath me...my first love was my best friend (a female) who ended up choosing my other best friend (male) over me.  She would later have sex w/ just about every friend I have- proving to me how pathetic I was to love her in the first place, it was a wake up call for how unacceptable I was as a person, but also it was the first inner time bomb placed- eventually developing into an instinctual belief that I am wrong....always being less than everyone because I was broke, only to become one of the more successful friends in my group- just for it to be lost because of a mistake I supposedly stopped making years ago....being walked all over and spat upon because I was vulnerable and open- after working literally decades to actually allow myself to let people in....beating depression to becoming damn near suicidal....the irony alone is enough to make you sick.  

Add to that the repercussions of my actions and these events...Christ I can barely get up in the morning.

I know my actions and choices dictate my life and not some unforeseen hand...but I cant shake this feeling that I am not allowed to be happy.  Fuck..I am hurting."

x3yzg,6,2012-07-24,"I'm feeling really lost and shitty. I need some real talk right now. TL,DR at end of post",fabul0uslyfoxxy,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/x3yzg/im_feeling_really_lost_and_shitty_i_need_some/,"Hey guys. So, I'm feeling really, really down right now, and I'm not really sure who to talk to, so I figured I'll give this subreddit a shot. I don't necessarily expect any pity talk, but just real constructive advice if anything.

BASICALLY, I wanted to pursue a career in financial services, something more in investment management/ advisory, but this desire only surfaced in the past 15 months. I just graduated from a non-target undergrad, doubling in Econ &amp; Lingusitics with no prior internships. I work(ed) part time at the MFE office in the business school, but obviously that's not really any finance experience. 

Anyway, I studied abroad in China last spring semester in a business/econ focused program, and that's when I got bitten by the financial career bug. I came back in late August looking for internships, didn't find anything, began full-time recruiting, &amp; signed up for the CFA Level 1 to take in June. Of course, without any prior experience, I was nowhere near competitive to the other candidates at my school, but I tried anyway.

During winter break, I had a super short ""internship"" at a M&amp;A advisory firm. I didn't get any quantitative/ modeling experience or anything. It was more like reading Marketwatch &amp; Businessweek and discussing/ reporting any interesting stories/ trends in the morning (more educational), and then in the afternoon, I spent my time contacting boutique banks and business brokers to find companies to acquire (so I guess I was technically on the buy-side of this particular transaction). In terms of learning, I became a lot more knowledgeable on financial news in general.

When I came back to school, I made a feeble search for internships, but by this time, most places were looking for underclassmen, and so I started to study for the CFA. I somehow managed to get an interview with a registered independent advisory (RIA) firm (they were a boutique investment advisory firm). The 1st round was exhilarating, just talking the news and I actually really enjoyed it. There were no behavioral questions, and I knew I did a great job. I got a call for Round 2 about two hours after my interview. The 2nd round was a case interview along with a couple ""get to know you"" interviews with the VP that I'd be working under. Finally, I get called back to the final round, and I talk to all 6 partners via phone or in person. I think I did pretty well overall, except when I talked to a 2-partner team interview in which they ripped apart my econ gpa/transcript, and I caved under that pressure. Also, I talked to the partner under whom I'd be working, and he pretty much told me that I had no idea what I was doing/ talking about/ getting into. Therefore, how could he expect me to work well for him? Needless to say, I didn't get the full-time offer. Apparently some other guy did a much better case interview in round 2 than the other 3 candidates (including myself).

My final quarter was dedicated to studying like full time for the CFA, and if you don't already know, results for Levels 1 and 2 came out today. Despite my efforts, I didn't pass. I know I should've studied even more than I already did, but I didn't slack off. As expected, my weakest section was accounting/ financial reporting standards because I had only taken beginning accounting at school. 

So, the thing is I had put CFA Level 1 candidate on my resume, and THAT alone had given me some kind of a leg up. Recruiters and professionals that I talked to were somewhat impressed and encouraged me to study and do well. Now, I don't even have that. I'm really at a loss of what to do. 

Summary of academic background: beginning accounting, micro/macro economic theory, investment theory, finance. I have no financial modeling experience, proficient in Excel (but not like super, I just learned how to do pivot tables.. kind of), and my accounting is really weak.

I really apologize for the long post, but I really needed to just get it off my chest and possibly get some real feedback. Is it possible for me to even fathom getting into investment management/ advisory? Or is it just not possible/ maybe I'm just better fit for something else? If it is possible, can you shed any light on how I can continue? 

**TL;DR: graduated from non target, no real internships, took CFA Level 1 &amp; didn't pass. This is what I had worked for all year, but now I don't know if I can actually continue this path.  Is it possible for me to even fathom getting into investment management/ advisory? Or is it just not possible/ maybe I'm just better fit for something else?**"

Shift is an internship programme; disguised as an innovation lab, ran like a creative agency. Over the next few months the team will have their heads down, underpaid and malnourished challenging traditional methods of creativity and encouraging cross-discipline collaboration to explore and uncover new ways of thinking.

To do so we're planning on holding a one of a kind event to showcase this new thinking, streamed live across the web from a leading UK venue, exhibits and a mass workshop will engage those lucky enough to attend and others interacting online. Guest speakers, unique collaborative performances and an after party to end all after parties will complete a night to remember. 

For those who can't attend we will be producing the 1st edition of 'white paper' a must have publication documenting our early trails, tribulations and triumphs. Acompanying that will be a DVD featuring our findings, exclusive interviews, coverage of our event and much more. But we need your support to help make this a success, help invest in the future of the creative industry, get involved and help us take creativity forward.

Driven by a niggling urge to take projects beyond the brief, his desire to empathise and to do the right thing in giving something back and creating opportunities. Shift was born from good morals and it's ethos is not to do things right - but to do the right thing.

Nick truly believes that innovation begins with people having fun and that aspiration breeds innovation. Through pairing vivid imagination with a collective vision we believe we can create and define a brighter future. Shift it is not at all about productivity but impact, not excellence but significance and unearthing something new.

Alongside Nick you'll find co-founder and Shift Studio Manager Andrew Kilburn and the studio's current trio of team leaders; James McCaughan (New Media), David Carr (Copywriter) and Carl Storey (Art Director). Followed by our current army of change makers; Mark (Creative), Josh (Creative), Wes (Editorial), Rachel (Product), Sam P (Designer), Sam H (Graphics) and Alex (Illustrator/Animator).

Shift will evolve organically as we look to expand and as our interns one by one move on into full time employment. So much so we're currently in the process of building a diverse team of interns, collaborators and mentors to get involved with our projects and our up and coming event. If that could be you, please don't hesitate to contact Andrew andy(at)studioprecept.co.uk to get involved. You can also keep up to date with our progress and help us spread the word on twitter, follow us @weare_shift


**Great, so where will the money go...**

The $15,000 (or whatever we raise) will help make our vision for the 'Taking Creativity Forward' event a reality and allow us to produce and amazing publication in our first edition of 'white label'. We're not in this to make a profit, but any remaining proceeds from the event will simply go towards the running costs of the Shift studio, it's tech needs and basic office equipment. If we exceed our expectations and we raise more than our target, we’ll reinvest back into the internship programme to give further opportunities to emerging creative talent.


**Finally, what does the future hold for Shift...**

As well as an innovation lab Shift is available to clients and brands just like any other agency; however, they will be getting something completely new and often unexpected - and becasue it's ran by interns it's really cost effective too. Through this unique approach we hope to build a finanically stable internship programme, offering a fantastic service that covers it's costs and continues to provide fantastic opportunities to emerging talent. In addition we want to continue to showcase this talent and our findings through running more events and producing further 'white paper' publications.

We’re 100% committed to making Shift a huge sucess over the coming months, and have put a lot of blood, sweat and tears in to get this far. We see a future where Shift is self funded but first we need your help to get Shift off the ground!

So please get involved, do your bit to support new thinking and for the future of the creative industries - help us take creativity forward.

If the perks don't work for you then contact andy(at)studioprecept.co.uk to offer alternitive forms of support. Every little counts and a 'Good Luck' message will go a long way.

Thanks for reading, pretty please share this link at the top of the page.

Would you like someone to watch it?",[deleted],london,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/x7oy1/this_might_be_crazy_but_do_you_have_a_flat_in/,"I recently met someone who was staying in a flat that their friend owned in Russell Square in london.  The couple left the flat empty for months at a time as they lived in Switzerland most of the year and only used the flat for visits.

It struck me how I would worry about leaving my property unattended, but I also realise that renters are a hassle and are really hard on a property.

So here’s a proposition, I’m a 21 year old female who comes from a solid home where I was taught to respect my space and be responsible. I’m incredibly clean, I do my dishes the same night I dirty them, I put my dishes away, I sweep and hoover once to twice a week, I make my bed in the mornings and I don’t use and abuse where I live because I respect my space as my home.

I’m also a serious student who is in my final year of study in London, doing two degrees and working an internship, which means I don’t have time to party or go out and waste money at a club.

My evenings consist of a book, homework, or perhaps a glass of wine and a movie.

If there’s a London redditor out there who has an empty property and would love a clean respectful young lady to watch it, here I am! I would be willing to pay rent and maintain your property.  I would be willing to sign a full contract, release my full details to you (If you would like, you could even speak to my family!) I can provide character references, my visa details and my university details. I would also be willing to provide monthly photo update emails of your property so you can see that all is well. 

I would also be willing to leave the flat whenever you were in town.  I would be completely flexible to your wants and needs.

What benefit would this be to you?  

* You receive extra income each month for your property so it’s self maintained. 

* You would have someone watching over your property that you could trust, and you wouldn’t have to worry about squatters or a break in.

* Your charity would help a student, and provide an unmatched opportunity.

If you’re interested, please contact me!

My school starts up again in a month and I'm not looking for a drastic weight drop but i atleast want to get down to the 180's-190's range.

At the beginning of the Summer, I was 226 and I got down to this weight in about a month only from going to the gym once a week so I can usually lose weight pretty easily but I never have time to do anything. Here are some things that prevent me from going to the gym;

- I have a summer intern job at my parents office that I go to every Monday - Wednesday and Friday for 8 hours a day.
- I don't have my driver's license yet so usually I have to get a ride from my parents, but since they don't work out much, I go pretty rarely.
- This may be because I'm lazy but the weather has been over 100 here a lot recently, so whenever I am at home, it's usually too hot to go for a walk or a bike ride

So if anyone has any diet tips or work out tips, please tell me.

After I wrote this I thought of something that could help with my weight loss, since I work on the 12th floor of the building I work at, maybe I could walk up and down the stairs everytime I get there or want to get lunch"

I want to live in Calgary as it seems it would be more enjoyable to be in the city instead of a suburb on my free time, especially since I really want to experience the nightlife, DRINK SUPER CHEAP LIQUOR COMPARE TO BC, join some events and meet people so I don't feel lonely for four months.

Discrimination Upon my hire at UVU’s Women’s Success Center

It was common knowledge among the staff members serving in the equity in education Center, Turning Point, and our center (WSC) that Dr. S.m. (the head researcher that created the need for the center)was not pleased that the decision was made to hire a man. The second director, N. K. --whom was terminated, let me know of this fact, P. P.  --our coordinator-- was well aware of this fact and even defended by hire to AVP/Dr. M. T., A. L., a Presidential Intern, also knew of this prejudice and an assistant to J. B. discussed this fact with me on numerous occasions in the UVU lunchroom and at the Provo Library. K. also made mention of it in the Losee Building. Upon A's. hire, she quickly had her first “steering Committee meeting” with the associate vice president and two other high administrator/professors. She came back to the office from that meeting to be greeted by P. P. vocalized her defense of my hire and A. disclosed that S. (professor) wanted me either terminated, and if that was a HR violation, transferred.

Equal Employment Opportunity

When the PBA (public budeget and accountability) was announced and my job was becoming full time with benefits. This meant that I would need to reapply for my job.  N. Johnson, S's (head researcher's Assistant seeking for quid pro quo for her work with S. M.), got in contact with A. about the position. Now I understand that an inquiry is by no means a violation however, A. remained adamant that she would not discuss the position with me --other than the fact that it would “open” as it would be an equal employment opportunity violation. 

Below are some correspondences of private meetings (directly titled in the E-mail, “Admin Job.”) and even a special request to remind N. to apply for the position from A. because she had not done so at that point due to her presence at a funeral in Idaho. I believe that out of seventy applicants, the one that receives the official offer is the applicant whom had a private, “offline” meeting with A, the center’s director and Committee member for the hire. The inference here is that not only did I not have a equitable shot at the position, neither did 69 other candidates.

Thanks for reading Reddit! any help would be amazing --even just a few emails would have a tremendous effect.

A,  I wanted to share this while it was fresh in my mind. Have you seen the www.beautyredefined.net posters/billboards (see attached for a flier)? It made me think that we could create something similar for the WSC. They could say things like “graduating is my plan” or “educating me can change the world” or “my children will have a better chance in life because I graduated from college” or “my education gave me greater independence” … we can use some of the specific finding of the research to create the slogans, but also include positive and encouraging statements. At the bottom of each we can have the WSC logo and an invitation to stop by/call/chat online. Something like “Come see how we can help you succeed”  And, to save on cost, they could be displayed throughout campus on the electronic ad boards. This could be another service learning opportunity for some creative media design/photography students.   I looked over the website today and have some ideas for improvement. I’ll work on getting them organized and on paper for you by early next week. I like the new look; it’s very fresh. J   N

Hi S (high level professor),   Quickly cause I know you’re busy, you mentioned that you have a couple of good admin job descriptions that are more Women’s Center friendly. Could you please forward them at your soonest convenience?   Your friend, A

Yes. I’ve actually attached the two I am using now for an admin and a coordinator so you can see those, but I also have the 2010 and then the 2011 (very similar) versions of what I used as well. I think a lot of it will be applicable for yours, but some may not. You are welcome to use any of it you would like. We did put “associate’s degree and experience” because of N Johnson being in school—but I think most of the official admins (as your position would be) have a bachelor’s degree or higher. I really think you need someone with that education.   I hope this helps

Comments from Anne Regarding my presence at the Women’s Success Center

From: A  Sent: Friday, February 17, 2012 4:04 PM To: P P;   Hi Everyone,   The Women’s Success Center is truly becoming a Success!! Thanks to all of you, we are making great progress! I love you all and am happy to welcome Y to our team.  We’ll need to do a good welcome party for her when we’ve made it through all the paperwork, but hopefully she will start next week. I’ll let you know when Marcy tells me.   On another note, I’ve come to the conclusion that W's (me) video editing talents are critical to our success. As we try to brand and market what we do, we need a polished electronic presence. His skills contribute greatly to our ability to move forward despite the lack of budget. That said, I’d like to have R. cover the front desk Mondays and Fridays. N. has agreed to cover Tuesdays and Thursdays. We will see what Wednesdays look like but W. will cover those right now. He will still handle the budgetary issues but the vast majority of his time is now going to be dedicated to video production and website love!   Let me know if you have any questions or concerns or of course, insights.   Thanks again, A. 

Letter of Recommendation From A.

February 28, 2012 Letter of Recommendation for W.

To Whom It May Concern:

I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation for W. I am his direct supervisor at Utah Valley University. Back in August he was hired as the administrative facilitator of the Women’s Success Center. There were many other talented applicants, but W’s skills and talents helped us select him from a large pool. His advanced ability to communicate personally and electronically was a key factor in our decision. It was the right choice; he is very polished and professional without losing the ability to relate at a personal level.

We interact with people from a variety of backgrounds and interests and I believe W’s experience completing a Master of Arts at Temple University in Philadelphia expanded his understanding of human communication signiﬁcantly. W. is a dedicated scholar and has an impressive academic resume. He has a great background in the details of academic freedom and the integral part that communication plays in the educational fabric of society. He constantly demonstrates that he is verbally articulate and an excellent writer.

Without hesitation I recommend and endorse W. in his application for the assistant director with Prospective Students. If you require further insights into my recommendation, please contact me at 801-863-3020 or annew@uvu.edu.

Sincerely, A Director Women’s Success Center Utah Valley University

in 2004 i graduated highschool and went to college, immediately becoming lonely and depressed i decided to chase one of my dreams and join the army. i always have had issues fully committing to something so i just joined the national guard in my home state. i was gone for about a year worth of training and then came home and realized that the national guard is a joke and not fulfilling at all.

i got a decent job working in telecomm but it was dead end and eventually i was let go. i was involved in a near fatal car accident which involved a medevac... my insurance did not cover all of it and i was left with thousands in medical bills that i could not afford. i decided i wanted to go back to school and use my GI bill. this is when i realized that i had no GI bill because all of my active duty time was filed as ""training"" and therefore did not count, this was the first crushing blow.

later the next year i was jumped while visiting a friend in a city and hospitalized without insurance again... massive bills, i could not afford.

i decided to quit my full time construction job and take school on full time to minimize the amount of semesters and loans. everything went well, i took 20-24 credit semesters spring summer and fall and sped to my senior year.

coming home from a grad party i got pulled over, i was slightly over the legal limit and charged with a DUI. this was the second blow, i now had two semesters left in school, no car, no way to get to or from school since i could not afford to live on campus and could not drive to work in order to pay my rent (i live alone).

i thought to myself (all i have to do is make it through this year and i can start working and straighten this all out). with just 3 months left to go before graduation i was out with friends drinking (not driving obviously) and we stopped at a local convenient store. when i walked out of the store i sat down in the car and a cop approached me, i don't exactly remember what happened because i was pretty drunk and i ended up under arrest for DUI... again. i assumed this would all be straightened out and wouldn't come of anything.

my lawyer had my friend sign an affidavit stating what happened that night and how i was not operating the car and he was just in the store blah blah blah. well my lawyer never got this notarized and therefore could not be used in court. i got fucked. hard. i honestly do not drink often, but i decided at this point to just swear it off completely. its just not worth it. it wasn't a hard decision, just a necessary one.

during this semester i landed an internship at one of the top firms in my field, it was great, i was so proud of myself for being selected and worked my ass off as i always do.

graduation came and went and i got a phone call from the VP at my internship asking if i would be interested in a full time position. i said yes, calmly, then hung up and danced around for a bit.

then this week, i received a phone call telling me i would not be allowed to work with the firm because of my DUIs and my credit problems. i had the full backing of the team i worked on and the VP of the firm... and i still could not be hired.

i have $71,000 more debt now from school, i now realize i have no shot of getting into my field of work with my record and credit. i have no idea what i'm going to do. i feel like because i half committed to things, i fucked myself. i feel so terrible about not having money to pay those bills, i feel like pushing so hard for my education was a waste, and i am not worse off than before i started to make a positive change for myself.

x7860,5,2012-07-26,Can any Redditors currently at or going to Disney World EPCOT help me out with a small project ?,[deleted],Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/x7860/can_any_redditors_currently_at_or_going_to_disney/,"Thanks for stopping by. This takes a little explaining.

TL:DR I need someone to take a few good photos of the piggy bank object from the ""Piggy Bank Adventure"" game at EPCOT Innoventions so I can 3D print it for my 3 year old who has been begging for it for a solid week. I'm not kidding. He is that obsessed and the pig is apparently that cute. Read on.


I was at EPCOT with my 9 year old and 3 year old boys last week. Long story long, the 3 year old's favorite thing on the planet was the T Rowe Price sponsored ""Piggy Bank Adventure"" game at Innoventions 'cause you get to carry around this football sized piggy bank and put it in these machines and it animates on screen and you get to push and pull things and go wheee ! He loved it more than anything else we did all day... yeah... But then the last machine kept the pig and the game was over and there was a 3 second beat as the look of bewilderment spread across his face and he turned to me with wide teary eyes and asked : ""Wah piggy go?"" (Translation: ""Where's mah muhfuggin PIG ?) To which my only possible response was ""Piggy went bye bye""... This was evidently not the correct answer. Bewilderment led to anger, hate, tears and the dark side... Total elapsed time 4 seconds. Result, 30 mins of all out, nuclear powered, steam driven rage face on this kid which simmered and boiled off into a tarry, black, 60 year reserve supply of resentment and bitterness which you can still see lurking just behind his eyes when they catch the light just right.

Meanwhile, 10 seconds after the occurence of the great pig disappearance of 2012, the look of bewilderment was on my face as well because that game character appears to be the only one at Disney that's not on sale. (With the exception of the live ""Ariel"" character. It is NOT ok to ask. Different story. Moving on.)

Anyway, fast forward a week later and I have a 3 year old who's waking up in tears every morning asking where piggy went because he's still DREAMING about the T Rowe Price Pig EVERY night. This bears repeating... out of ALL the damn Disney characters we saw, every one of which can be bought within a 5 minute walking distance of any geographical location in the continental United States, he wants the friggin piggy bank character made out of mil-spec, platinum plated Unobtanium. And he will-not-let-it-go. Accept no substitutes... yadda, yadda.

So I have a solution. I am a 3D modeler (and intern architect). I can 3D model this pig. I also have access to a 3D printer... Yay me !

I have no reference photos to work from however. I didn't take any pictures during that game. I would need a couple of decent front, side and top views to model from traditionally, or a series of shots taken all around the object to use photogrammetry software (like Agisoft Photoscan http://www.agisoft.ru/products/photoscan/ )

So if anyone who is going to EPCOT can stop by Innoventions and manage to find the time to take a few pictures of the Piggy Adventure piggy bank character you have no idea how happy that would make me. As well as this future Darth Bundy currently residing in my house. Think of it as saving the Galaxy from evil. Lots of karma involved.

Meanwhile, for those of you who don't have a 3 year old at home yet ... be advised that reproduction potentially leads to a dramatic increase in ""Maker"" skills with an associated dramatic loss of any free time you might have had left to spare.

Many thanks for taking the time out of your lives to read this far. Protip: If you are at work and still reading this you're going to have a bad time..."

Long story long, the 3 year old's favorite thing on the planet was the T Rowe Price sponsored ""Piggy Bank Adventure"" game at Innoventions 'cause you get to carry around this football sized piggy bank and put it in these machines and it animates on screen and you get to push and pull things and go wheee ! He loved it more than anything else we did all day... yeah... But then the last machine kept the pig and the game was over and there was a 3 second beat as the look of bewilderment spread across his face and he turned to me with wide teary eyes and asked : ""Wah piggy go?"" (Translation: ""Where's mah muhfuggin PIG ?) To which my only possible response was ""Piggy went bye bye""... This was evidently not the correct answer. Bewilderment led to anger, hate, tears and the dark side... Total elapsed time 4 seconds. Result, 30 mins of all out, nuclear powered, steam driven rage face on this kid which simmered and boiled off into a tarry, black, 60 year reserve supply of resentment and bitterness which you can still see lurking just behind his eyes when they catch the light just right.

Meanwhile, 10 seconds after the occurence of the great pig disappearance of 2012, the look of bewilderment was on my face as well because that game character appears to be the only one at Disney that's not on sale. (With the exception of the live ""Ariel"" character. It is NOT ok to ask. Different story. Moving on.)

Anyway, fast forward a week later and I have a 3 year old who's waking up in tears every morning asking where piggy went because he's still DREAMING about the T Rowe Price Pig EVERY night. This bears repeating... out of ALL the damn Disney characters we saw, every one of which can be bought within a 5 minute walking distance of any geographical location in the continental United States, he wants the friggin piggy bank character made out of mil-spec, platinum plated Unobtanium. And he will-not-let-it-go. Accept no substitutes... yadda, yadda.

So I have a solution. I am a 3D modeler (and intern architect). I can 3D model this pig. I also have access to a 3D printer... Yay me !

  I have no reference photos to work from however. I didn't take any pictures during that game. I would need a couple of decent front, side and top views to model from traditionally, or a series of shots taken all around the object to use photogrammetry software (like Agisoft Photoscan http://www.agisoft.ru/products/photoscan/ )

So if anyone who is going to EPCOT can stop by Innoventions and manage to find the time to take a few pictures of the Piggy Adventure piggy bank character you have no idea how happy that would make me. As well as this future Darth Bundy currently residing in my house. Think of it as saving the Galaxy from evil. Lots of karma involved.

Meanwhile, for those of you who don't have a 3 year old at home yet ... be advised that reproduction potentially leads to a dramatic increase in ""Maker"" skills with an associated dramatic loss of any free time you might have had left to spare.

x71k9,12,2012-07-26,My mom wants me to wait another year before I out myself to anyone else. Should I?,GemsAreOutrageous,lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/x71k9/my_mom_wants_me_to_wait_another_year_before_i_out/,"Hi. First of all sorry for the wall of text, anyway here goes.

I'm a 21 y/o Belgian guy, who has been confused about his homosexuality for most of his life. I am quite masculine so I've never had any real problems hiding my homosexuality, while having my intern struggle. After some failed relationships where the girlfriends told me there was no ""spark"" between us, I decided to explore my sexuality online. After discovering lgbt, gay, gaymers, ... subreddits, I realized that I'm not alone. That there are so many amazing people out there, that have great lives, without having to hide themselves.

Today I am perfectly fine with who I am. I realize that homosexuality is an important part of who I am, and I'm proud of it. At first I didn't know what to do with all this new found happiness. I no longer had to feel guilty or sinful for who I was. So I decided to tell my mom. She was incredibly supportive and asked me all about how I felt. I told her then, that I was going to tell my dad and my friends in the nearby future.

Now four weeks later, I was just getting ready to confront my dad. When my dad steps out of the house to do some gardening. Suddenly my mom comes up to me and with a soft voice she tells me: ""I need to talk to you"". Basically she told me that it would be better and ""safer"" to not out myself to anyone until I'm independant. Some explanation:

Currently my best friend (since I was in elementary school), who's a conservative but awesome dude, carpools me to school daily. Although I presume he's slightly homophobic, I think he should be able to accept me for who I am. My mom however would rather me not taking the risk of not being able to get to school for my graduation year in college (I don't have a car and public transport connections are aweful).

My mom also doesn't want me to tell my dad because suddenly my home could become a hostile place and she desn't want that for me. She said it might be a whole lot easier when I get a job first. So even when my dad's being a hard-ass I can just find my own place. My mom even said that if I really wanted she'd move out with me.

So basically my mom left me a choice but called it good advice. She also said she'd always be there for me, she'd always love me and she'd always put me first in her life no matter what.

I believe that the recent gay bashing/killings in Belgium might me what triggered my moms reaction. She doesn't want me to get hurt, but I have come to terms with the fact that people that are ""different"" to society need thick skin. (This is something I noticed when reading all the stuff on here and watching a lot of youtube videos on this topic. I've always walked between the lines and I've almost never been in a fight/argument &gt;_&lt;). Belgium is supposed to be one of the most liberal countries in the world concerning lgbt rights. Yet this entire outing thing seems like such a struggle.

Is my mom being overprotective? Should I hide it for one more year just to be sure/safe? Thanks for reading and please let me know your thoughts/experiences."

",BenFalvey,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x70l0/finally_left_my_job_of_2_12_years_and_i_feel/,"I worked for a chain supermarket for about a half year before they switched me to the Dairy Dept. I did really well, but, to simplify, they hired 3 new people who made a mess of the dairy products in the case (Didn't rotate the case) and I had to clean it all up one night. Every time I went to put anything out, I would have to rotate the case, which is time consuming. On top of that, I was training one of the three new people who recently came to the department, and at the end of the night didn't have time to put out the milk. However, I put out some anyways, and left a note for my manager. It didn't matter. The next day, the store manager decided that I didn't deserve to be there anymore and moved me. I called my Union, and they never got back to me. The next day, they put me in Grocery, and I sliced through my finger with a box cutter that slipped on the edge of a box. I called the Union that day, and they didn't get back to me then either. They took the money for that day and the rest of the weekend out of my sick pay. 

I went back to the front end, (Carts, Cashier, Bagger) and started to really not mind the job. I then moved and transferred to another store, where I stayed as cashier until June. During that time, I was harassed by my manager over the phone for calling out for my uncle's funeral. I suppose I could've skipped it, but he was my godfather, his wife is my godmother, and I was a pallbearer. I called the Union, and they didn't show up, they sent the store steward, who was the front manager's buddy. The steward was also the meat manager. The front manager acted like it didn't matter what was going on outside of work, and that I had to be at work when I was scheduled. I protested, since this was an emergency, but all three managers in the room, agreed that I was being unreasonable. I settled with them, and didn't really care so much about it, as I wasn't getting fired. 

I continued to work there from Sept. 2011, to June 2012, when I asked to be switched to another department, due to a customer telling me to ""Go fuck yourself"" after I asked for her ""Fuckin (Store Name) card."" The people at my store were scum, and I had four bad customers in a row that day. I didn't want to work up front anymore, and the managers said that there was an opening in Meat. I always heard that Meat came with a pay raise and all sorts of perks, so I jumped on it. I was then ignored, never properly trained, and left alone. They expected me to clean the machines at night, which I was taught, but not right. I was taught four different ways that all conflicted and did things completely different. I cleaned for the first week and a half, and then got yelled at for not putting any meat in the case at the end of the night. I was never even told that I had to do that, and it made everything a lot more rushed. 

The first Sunday I worked in the department, (Sundays are the worst days due to high volume of people) I was harassed by another employee, which I made clear to my supervisors. They didn't do anything about it, and put me on the next Sunday with someone even newer than me. They expected me to work Seafood that night, which I had never been trained for. The night was a disaster and a mess. We did what we could, but the other guy in the meat dept. didn't start on the machines until way too late. I left a note stating that I was putting in my two weeks. It wasn't worth it anymore. The next day, I came in, and the guy who harassed me two Sundays ago told me that ""He knew I didn't give a shit..."" and I walked away to talk to a manager. The manager ignored the harassment again, and apologized for the situation. I told him that I wanted to finish out my two weeks and leave. The following Friday, my harasser was working with me alone. He refused to take customers he was supposed to serve and called a manager on me. This is a guy who smoked pot, came back reeking of it, and did nothing for an hour, which I made clear to my supervisors who didn't care. 

A manager came down, and I told him that I was focused on cleaning the machines, because if I didn't someone could get salmonella. He left and came back later, after I had finished. After finishing everything I went home. I came in the next day and a manager told me that yesterday should have been my last day. I protested, called the union, and after typing up a full report for my union rep even longer than this, my union rep told me that I didn't need to do anything. It was company policy that an outside company handled all the HR now, and that my reference from the company would consist of my date of hire and the date that I left, and a list of my company duties. When I found that out, I threw the Union meeting. I didn't go, and let my rep know that he should cancel it. 
The next day, I found out that the Seafood manager ratted out the Meat manager (I had never seen or heard from either of them for the whole month I worked in the department) about a separate harassment case. The Meat guy touched some girl in an abusive way at work, and was now getting fired. The manager who ignored me, was getting moved over the incident. The store had the health department called on them for not using the right chemical to clean the machines for weeks. I didn't do any of those things, and when I heard through my (Retired from the same union) father's contact in the higher up of the union, I laughed really hard. 

The next day, I got called by a TV show that I love for an internship opportunity, after I sent them a resume with some fan mail. I have an interview at another job, and while it's not guarenteed, I know the head manager there, and a lot of the employees, so I have a decent shot. I have never felt better in my life as the day I walked out of that building and never looked back. I'm really excited for the future now. The question I have for you, reddit, is what is the worst job you've ever worked, and why? 

TL;DR I was harassed and screwed around by my job for two and a half years without ever being able to defend myself. When I did, I felt great and left the job. What is the worst job you ever worked, and why?"

I deposited $300 because retirement. I reported $300 in retirement savings on my taxes, which I believe makes this a traditional IRA because I recieved a tax deduction. The money sat there for 5 months until I graduated college this June. I had no other savings at this point and I got a job in a different city. I accessed the funds to pay for a deposit on my new apartment. I'm working my new job and once again contributing to the same account.

My question is whether or not I will have to pay fines on the money I withdrew if I put the $300 back to what it was before? 

Since I am so young I'd like to have a Roth IRA, is there any way to make this same account a Roth IRA? Or would I be required to open a 2nd account, this time not deducting the contributions

I'd only be able to put half of the annual IRA contributions in each account if I had two IRAs, but is there any sense/benefit in doing this?

x6ogb,3,2012-07-26,"2.1 GPA non-accounting graduate with no accounting experience dreaming of working for a Big 4 or top 10. Am I delusional? If not, what do I need to do to achieve this goal?",anf1eld,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/x6ogb/21_gpa_nonaccounting_graduate_with_no_accounting/,"As the title states, my undergraduate GPA was horrendous due to having my priorities backwards and lacking any career goals. Being the first person to attend a 4 year university in my family probably did not help either. That being said, I take full responsibility for my actions and am only trying to move forward.


I graduated in 2009 and was only offered work at a dead end job, a result of the tanking economy and my lackluster credentials. After working said job for a year and hating it, I realized that I had to completely rebuild my resume and qualifications in order to ""reboot"" my career prospects.


After doing some serious soul searching, I decided to pursue the CPA designation. Some of the reasons supporting this decision:


1. It is a solid career foundation and opens a broad range of career paths(I have since narrowed my goal to fraud accounting)

2. A professional license would hopefully balance out my deplorable GPA

3. Auditing and fraud accounting seem to match my questioning personality 

3. Accountants are always in demand and have reasonable job security

4. Achieving this designation would help restore some self-confidence (Job hunting in this economy is brutal!)


 To complete the unit requirements to sit for the CPA, I went the community college route since it was highly unlikely I would be accepted into any MAcc program with a 2.1 GPA. Although most likely irrelevant, I did earn a 3.7 GPA(while also working full-time) in the accounting classes I took at CC. During this time, I also took on a leadership role in a campus club.


I have since **passed** BEC, FAR, am waiting results for AUD(cautiously optimistic), and taking REG in August. With a bit of luck, I will have completed all 4 in the span of 6 months. I left my job(same one since graduation) back in May and my current job is studying for the CPA exam.


Because I am not in school, internships and campus recruiting are out of the question. I also understand that I will need to network my butt off to land any interviews. The choices I made as an undergrad have cost me dearly, but I am staying positive and am doing everything in my power to turn things around. 


Now for the big question.


Has anyone else gone through a similar experience, and if so, how did you end up where you are now? There are all these threads with people worried about 3+ GPAs and here I am with a 2.1. Am I crazy for thinking I have a chance?

I know I'm late to the show but I really want to show recruiters I'm dead set on becoming an auditor!


 Any feedback is greatly appreciated! Thanks!


**edit 1** If asked about my GPA, would it be wise to contrast the 2.1 and 3.7 to show how I've changed/improved? This is a sticky topic that I'm not sure how to approach.

**edit 2** It's 5am so I'm gonna try to sleep. Will answer any questions when I wake up. Good night!

**edit 3** Thanks for all the solid advice so far! As recommended by some of you, I've redone my linkedin account, updated my resume (and approved by a friend working in big 4), and will make networking my full time job after the CPA exam. Hopefully this thread has also been useful to lurkers in the same boat as me.
Feel free to drop knowledge or questions if you have any. Don't be shy!"
x6nv1,1,2012-07-26,Mother died and lost love,Elefante_en_la_casa,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/x6nv1/mother_died_and_lost_love/,"College life hasn't been all that good to me. I am 22 now and while I know there is still a whole life ahead of me I feel like I'm stuck in a dark place instead. First of all in my first two years, quite a few of my beloved old pets died, but I pulled through. During this time I've been in a long distance relationship since high school with an European girl (well woman now) while I am American. During the second year I visited her for 3 weeks and... things didn't quite go so smoothly. To put things simply, I got way too nervous and shy and botched things and got overly sensitive about stupid things. When I returned home we argued and nearly broke up things got so heated. It took months for things to finally smooth over then we seemed to be pretty patched up. Through all that happened I continued to love her a lot.

In my 3rd year of college my mother began having lung problems. Eventually hear hatred of hospitals forced her into psychosis and she even went crazy which was very heartbreaking and stressful. My brother and I are both very close to our mother and not so much our dad. Since my room was close to where she slept I often helped take care of her when her psychosis kicked in and she thought we were evil people keeping her trapped in the house. Often she'd ask for Vicodin to relieve her pain (she had a prescription) but she'd often ask for one even after having already had one. One night she kept shouting for once even though she already took a vicodin so my father and I ignored her request telling her she can't or she will overdose. The next morning I woke up to police in my house. Apparently she had called to claim spousal abuse. We told the police the story about the vicodin but they had to take her to the hospital to get checked out anyways. For a day or two we had no idea where she was. Hospitals would not confirm her being present because of the spousal abuse claim even though the police knew it was bogus. 

We did eventually find her but her health was failing and she was in critical condition. We visited her every day for however long we could but she passed away a couple days later. We were able to thankfully speak with her a little on the day before she died though she seemed out of it. During this time I had my wisdom teeth pulled and had terrible tooth aches so couldn't stay overnight... which I now regret since she died the following morning before we could make it to the hospital.

Ever since I have been depressed (and I was already down over my relationship troubles though thankfully we were in better shape before this happened) and I haven't been able to get over losing my mother. I mostly spent the days distracting myself. I still had college work to do, games to play, movies and shows to watch, a girlfriend to talk to etc.  I began to lose focus and unable to find interest in other more creative hobbies like story making, role playing, or drawing. 

However I still had a goal in life to keep me going and pressing on - graduate college and go visit my girlfriend again to make things right and show her my true self rather than being all shy and crap. The summer after my mother died I managed to land an internship that paid well. I made enough for airfare. Things started looking up despite my underlying sadness. I graduated this year and had a plane ticket ready. All I really cared about was seeing her again.

Things went well mostly, certainly better than the time before. We had a lot of fun, we talked and laughed, went out to eat just overall was good fun. The problem was it seemed more like two friends together rather than any kind of romantic interest. I find her extremely attractive and was wanting to hug and kiss her but she didn't quite feel the same way about me. She didn't feel like kissing me, although we did try cause she wanted our relationship to work too. Basically in the end, I was the only one feeling something. For her, we didn't quite click. She isn't sure why, possibly she's still reminded of the previous time I was over and the arguments afterward and things just got damaged beyond repair. I don't know either. She said I am fun and everything but she sees me more as a Best Friend.

I felt burned. I flew all the way to see her, worked an entire summer even, to see her and apparently she doesn't quite love me the same way I do her. I had fun, and I appreciate her friendship but still I felt bitter. I had a long flight home. Way too long to be stuck with such crap on my mind. The more I thought about it the more I thought that yes I do love her still even if its not quite returned so I don't regret going to see her, its not like I'd use the money for something else anyways, I don't care all that much about money. I want her in my life no matter what happens so even staying friends is nice... just still I had hope we'd stay together.

When I returned home we talked again, and she basically brought up something she said before. Where a friend suggested to her that maybe we are just too inexperienced and should break up and see other people then see what happens from there and maybe fate will have us cross again. By inexperience I mean we are both each others first love. Sort of. I had a girlfriend before but it was in middle school and I could tell that one was meaningless compared to what I had with this one.

So basically... I flew to a foreign country happy and in a relationship and fly back home and become single. We are still friends but I feel extremely heartbroken and a little bitter. I still care for her deeply and I want her to be happy... just she was the sunshine in my life and now I feel like that light burned out and I'm all alone in the dark. I'm not that close with my family other than my brother and sister. My sister I don't even see that often since she doesn't live with us.

I know there is plenty of fish in the sea as the saying goes, but the thing is I am not interested in pursuing anyone. Maybe after some time I will be but I doubt it. I just feel extremely low right now and I won't be surprised if even my usual attempts at distracting myself will not be enough this time. As I said before I graduated college, but I don't feel ready at all for a job when I am in such a terrible mental and emotional state."

After she spent about 15 mintues complaining about the CD and the program my boss told her ""Make a copy of it*(the CD)* and leave the copy in my mailbox in the lounge. So I can see what's wrong."" Later on that day my boss comes in laughing with a sheet of paper in one hand.  The piece of paper had a photo copied black and white picture of the CD and the words ""Thanks"" written on the bottom. And then he goes ""I guess she doesn't know what 'make a copy of it' means..."" So he goes into Google and prints out a picture of a cockroach and writes ""No problem, I found it"" and places that picture in her mailbox in the lounge.  After that I never heard anything about her again. 

I don't know if she realized how silly it was of her to send in a photocopied picture of the CD and was embarrassed to really ask for help again OR if she thought that he found the bug and it was somehow fixed. o_o"
x6koy,6,2012-07-26,Are there any alternatives to breaking up at this point?,ImHappyUpHere,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/x6koy/are_there_any_alternatives_to_breaking_up_at_this/,"Note: I'm really sorry about how long this ended up being, I wasn't planning on writing so much but I think it really helped me get a clearer picture by writing things down. Feel free to skip to the TL;DR and read from there.

My girlfriend and I are early to mid 20s, I'm a little older than her, and we've been together for a little over a year, mostly long distance but seeing each other every week or two.

When we saw each other for our anniversary about a month ago I got a weird vibe, like she didn't want to be around me, and since then it had been kind of rocky, but we talked through it. When we saw each other almost two weeks ago we both had an amazing time, and things seemed really good. 

Soon after last seeing each other, we talked, and she asked me whether I had decided what I was doing after summer, to which I told her that I didn't want to talk about it at that particular moment. I took a big risk with my life path before summer started, and I'm trying to switch careers, currently unemployed but working on my own projects (and advancing a lot). She's been working at an internship during the week, meeting lots of new, ambitious, active people. She's very activity-driven, and results-oriented, and I think she sees me as doing nothing more than bumming around, being unsure about my life.

About 10 days ago it started to get really hard to talk to her, and at first I thought she may have just been mad at me for not wanting to talk about my plans, and she also has a long commute and works during the day so that's expected, but I realized that she has been finding every excuse not to talk to me. Like she'd call me and I'd miss her call, and when I called her back half an hour later she wouldn't answer. Or she'd say that she's eating and that we'd talk after she finished, but never did. I sent her a text two nights ago saying that we really needed to talk, and she sent me an e-mail Wednesday saying that we'd talk at night, because she forgot her phone at home. 

I've had an intuition that something had been going on, but at this point it became a certainty. It was breaking me up inside, so I took a less-than-orthodox approach to gather some information. I know it's bad, and trust is important, but I just had to know for sure, I needed proof...

Well I found a folder she had e-mailed herself full of conversations with this guy she met at work dating back to about a month ago, and an article about flirting tips. Reading through them, I noticed that she was a lot more flirty that she should realistically be with another guy, but ok I can get past that, its not a huge deal. Then I read her mentioning something about her bf (me) and about how I was just bumming around, and how I was kind of a girl for taking too long to get ready and missing something. That hurt. But, ok, I can maybe still move on, maybe what she is saying is kind of true? 

Reading this, I feel really bad, starting to get queasy in my stomach, both for going through her things without her permission and for discovering something that was only reinforcing my intuition.. So I went to buy some food.

When I came back, I got to a point where he mentions a text she sent him (during the last time we hung out, while drinking, when things were going really great), and she laughs it off saying she was tipsy. But it's only about finding the party stressful (because of some slight drama that happened). At this point I know I should stop, but I can't stop myself from reading. Then I get to a part where she tells him that she'll have to do something she loves a little less, because it reminds her of me (mentions me by name now, so obviously she's talking to him about me further). And about skyping with him late into the night.... when she'd be unable to skype with me because she has to sleep to wake up early in the morning for work.

I couldn't take the feeling in my stomach, and the adrenaline surging through me when I read that, and my feet were tingly. I got up and walked around and paced, and I had to do pushups and other exercises because I just felt like breaking things. This was in the afternoon and I still hadn't eaten anything. 

I then found an e-mail she had sent to one of her really good girl friends, of two pictures of her skyping with this dude, labeled ""&lt;Her name&gt;'s cutie"". In the chat log the dude was talking about how to have a clean break, without it getting messy. I fel like I needed to bolt, I went running, but I couldn't really run consistently and it was too hot outside, so I just let out my energy by sprinting. 


When I got back I still felt like I was breaking down inside, and got to that weird moment where you feel like you want to cry and scream but there's no tears coming out so it makes you feel even worse, right before you cry.. I then did the only thing I could think of and called my mom, and let her know everything that was going on, and had a very good conversation with her about it, and she was very careful not to tell me what decision to take, but helped me come to answer. I had talked to my mom only a few times before about my relationships, and only very briefly and superficially, when asking her for advice.

 I told her that very early on in our relationship, when we had first started going out, I danced with and kissed another girl in a moment of drunken indiscretion, and I that I felt like a hypocrite, and that maybe I poisoned the relationship... I never thought that I could do something like that, but it all happened so fast and I realized how vulnerable I could be to do something stupid if I wasn't careful. I stopped talking to that other girl (a friend that I had only seen that one time since childhood) the day after it happened because I felt horrible about what I did, and I told my girlfriend the next time we met, and told her that I understood if she didn't want to be with me anymore, and though she cried, we decided to continue. This was like a year ago, and I haven't felt like this has been an issue, but its always been in the back of my mind.

I kind of broke down and started crying in the middle (I loved my girlfriend, and I know it's fucked up but I still do), but she told me (in a motherly way) to pretty much man up, and deal with it, and that I have a long life and lots of opportunities ahead of me no matter what happens. She was amazing, and it really helped calm me down, regain my composure, and pull away from that feeling of everything breaking down. 


Then my gf texted me and tried calling me asking about what I was doing this weekend, whether I would stay and she would visit or whether I was going to visit my parents, which had been my plan. I told her I'd let her know tomorrow, that I was busy tonight and couldn't talk, but I was very cool about it and didn't let her know that I knew or suspected anything. She seemed kind of anxious to talk to me, calling me after I texted her, but I was firm and told her I was busy and that we'd talk tomorrow at lunch. I then called my best friend, talked with him about it, and went to hang out and drink some beers with some good friends, and we talked about it, about my decision to break it off with her tomorrow, and how my pride could not let me live this down. I was planning on getting really drunk, but I only had a few beers and I realized that I really didn't want to drink more, maybe because I told my mom I was planning on doing so and she asked me to not get drunk, but also maybe because I was feeling queasy thinking about what has been happening, and wanting to retain my composure. 

I cracked jokes, didn't get angry or swear her out, and I shared a lot with my friends and they with me, something that I hardly ever do--relationship issues have almost always been personal and not talked about in my mind. So there was a clear consensus, both in my mind and in theirs, and I will break up with her tomorrow, I will try to be nice with her as much as I can, but I will also be firm, and I won't take any bullshit, and I'd like to get her to admit what has been happening without implicitly bringing it up myself, or how I know (we'll see how that works--any advice?). 



**TL;DR: Girlfriend flirting with another guy from her internship, talking about how to break up with me with him, sends her friend pictures of her skyping with her 'cutie'.**

She hasn't cheated yet...and from what I've read she is still questioning herself, but she is thinking about breaking up with me sometime (maybe this weekend, but I won't be here when she comes to visit the town), but I can't wait for it to go on any longer. I really want to reiterate that I am still in love with her, and I thought she was with me. And while I've thought she was a great person, very pretty, someone I would have liked to spend the rest of my life with, I also consider myself a 'catch', and even though I don't have a job right now I'm still confident about myself, and there is no question in my mind that I could find somebody else just as great a person, just as pretty, and I don't think I'm putting her on a pedestal or anything. She had even talked with her current, older and more experienced housemate about me, and was told that I was a great guy, someone very hard to find, and that I was just going through a 'searching' period in my life that she had also gone through. And she agreed with her housemate, and told me a while ago that she had been unsure about what she wanted, but that she was sure then. With this regard I think my situation may be slightly different from those of other people, but I probably just want myself to think that so I don't feel like such a complete and utter fool.

I still can't help thinking that maybe there is some way for us to get through this, and that maybe I should give her another chance, because she gave me one way back in the beginning, but this feels like a TOTALLY different thing. I could probably forgive her for a minor drunken indiscretion, but this is emotionally cheating on me, and my pride would never let me live this down. I can't help but feel like if I play my cards right, if I don't act like a little bitch, be a man about it and break it off on my terms, in a sane and 'gentlemanly' fashion she will realize what she is missing out on, how stupid she has been, how she loves me more and how I love her more than anyone else ever could. I guess I am still hoping that this is what will happen if I am the one that breaks up with her. She doesn't know that I know, so I feel like I know her cards and she doesn't know mine.

I know what I have to do, and I will do it. But is there any other way? If she asks for me back, should I give her another chance? Can she ever regain my trust?

Has anyone had a similar experience?

By Jerry Sandusky &amp; Kristina Helfer
Collegian Columnist

By now I have seen and been involved in some unusual romantic and even casual circumstances.

Though I am only 68, I feel like I am finally beginning to figure out human physiology… and maybe even relationships. You could say I’ve been around the block a few times, but I’m still experiencing new things every day, especially in Happy Valley, on the weekends.

I love sex (with boys).

I love talking about it, I love having it, and I’m sure I’m not the only one, male or female, who feels the same way.

Someday, all of us will be having sex (with boys) — unless you’re still living in your mom’s basement — and it won’t be a big deal.

Maybe you’re having sex (with boys) right now, while you’re reading this column (lucky you), maybe you had it last night, or maybe you’ve never had it at all, but sex (with boys) is all around us.

We’re at the point in our lives when we are coming into our sexuality.

We’re learning the mating game.

Who knows, between hook-ups and the need to be “Facebook official,” we might even be the generation that completely kills relationships.

Have you had dirty thoughts about that cute kid at your internship? Have you wondered what your partner would say if you wanted to have sex (with boys) on the 50-yard-line?

Well, I have, too.

Often, sex (with boys) is taboo. We can’t discuss what goes on behind the closed doors of the bedroom, or in my case, under a crabapple tree once.

If you’ve ever watched MTV’s Cribs, you know the first thing anyone says when they enter their bedroom is, “This is where the magic happens.”

Do they really need to say that? Are they sure they’re good enough to really call it magic?

At Penn State, it’s more than in the bedroom — it’s a lofted bed, a walk-in closet at a fraternity or the Nittany Lion Shrine.

For some, it’s a moment of true intimacy, for others it’s just another good night.

Sex (with boys) is the most universal thing in the entire world. Almost every species — except for asexual ones — has sex (with boys) in one form or another.

We were given these parts for a reason, so why not take advantage of them?

The thrill of having sex (with boys) is like nothing else. It’s exciting, and everyone’s talking about it.

College is the time when those whispers become a reality, when people take others’ virginity and roommates are sexiled.

And it’s about time we start talking about it.

I’m not going to tell you to change your beliefs and go crazy, but it’s time to start being open.

It’s time to break society’s chains, and look at sex (with boys) from a different perspective.

Losing control draws me toward all of this.

I am not a thrill seeker, per se. I hate heights; I will never go skydiving. I don’t ski or mountain bike or do any sort of extreme sports that give you the “rush” people describe, so I have sex (with boys).

Don’t think for a minute that sex (with boys) is a less dangerous version of an extreme sport.

And frankly, I don’t think any extreme sport could give you the feeling that a white-knuckle, toe-curling orgasm does.

The pleasure runs up and down your entire body, and just for a moment — or if you’re lucky, quite a few moments — you disconnect from the stressful world.

There is no better time to have a little fun and explore than in college.

We have few responsibilities, and there will never be as many willing people around to experience the same things with.

It’s also the time when were most unsure about how to go about sex (with boys).

I doubt any of us can call ourselves sex (with boys) aficionados, so let’s dive into a sea of fondling, fellatio and frisking, and figure it out.

Let’s get our minds — and hopefully pelvises — moving, and really delve into what’s important.

Everyone has that crazy story or awkward encounter with a partner that is worthy of being told, and I can relate, so let’s talk about sex (with boys), hugs and hand jobs.

You may have thought you could drain away all of your weekend shenanigans, just like that beer bong at last weekend’s football tailgate, but I am here to bring them back to the surface.

We are Nittany Lions.

And we’re mounting everyone.

What's a decision you made that you never foresaw?",don_leno,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x6boe/after_spending_my_high_school_years_training_to/,"A little more detail: Through High School, I took vocational classes in Web Design, Graphic Design, Computer Hardware, Computer Software, Computer Troubleshooting, Computer Networking, and loads of other IT classes. I currently have a CompTia A+ certification and two Cisco Systems program completer certificates. Suffice to say, I spent a lot of time in the computer lab and had a pretty good plan worked out.

Then, I took AP Literature and Composition. 

My love for books and the English language was one I had acknowledged from an early age; I devoured books and consistently did well in my humanities classes. But it was always a hobby beside my ""work"", that being IT. As I progressed through my senior year, my true loves and passions began to show themselves, and I found myself at a crossroads. Pay for college and learn something to make money, or pay for college and learn something I truly loved and wanted to learn. 

I chose the latter, and now I am 100% set in my decision. I have one IT internship lined up and an interview for a second one(At my college) coming up soon. I'm getting a Liberal Arts degree, I know the consequences, and I am fully prepared for it because it's something I love.

**TL;DR - My hobby and my college education changed places.**

Reddit, what is a decision that you made which you never saw coming, but you now know was immensely important?

My male friends are making really outlandish suggestions (blow torches???). 

 I want something thoughtful that shows that I love him, but were not very sappy people. He also makes very good money and doesn't deny himself much, where as i'm a very broke intern. However, I still really want to facilitate an amazing birthday for him. I don't want him to be let down, but the party will cost me a lot. 

He's a 28 year old engineer who makes good money and has pretty much everything. My budget is like 100$ for the gift. He doesn't like clothes. He loves camping, but if feel like he has already purchased all of his camping gear.

What is something cool and out of the box that i'm missing? Would a framed/signed poster from his favorite movie be totally dumb in the eyes of most men? Is a wallet so cliche and boring? Is there a cool gadget that im missing? He's very into computers, where as I am clueless.

I had to turn down the offer because my father didn't agree to co-sign my loans on top of my student loans and the chances of funding were not likely.

So, I've decided to pay off my loans a bit further and see if I can build more research experience *and* potentially raise my GPA/GRE scores a bit. But in order for me to accept admission to anywhere (assuming I'd get accepted), I need funding so that's why I'm posting this here.

*My stats:*

* GPA: 3.1/4.0--I graduated from UW-Madison which is a leader in the subfield I'm interested in. I intend on raising this and building my academic strengths by taking a statistics course and a biology course or two.

* GRE: (old scores): 630V (91%), 500Q (27%), and 5.0/6.0 (84%). I intend on retaking it to raise my quant score because it is embarrassingly low.

* Research experience: field school (top of the class), original research project (which I'll be presenting at an academic meeting in September), and lab work in a neuropsych lab

* One of my LOR writers is an expert in the field and another is pretty well known too.

I'm going to be applying for a paid internship where I'd like to get further work for a year. Then, apply to UIUC and a few other places. But in order to do so, I really, really need funding.

With that said, **what makes a candidate very competitive for funding?** Is it the entire package or what in particular do schools look for when providing funding to entering students?"
x65bb,2,2012-07-25,who needs enemies?,frenemy2012,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/x65bb/who_needs_enemies/,"I don't know what else to do except post here.

It started in high school. I met this girl, who I thought was nice. Lost my virginity to her, dated her, and despite my better judgments, decided to carry on the relationship through college. I was then subjected to the most controlling and locked down relationship I probably will ever experience, which subsequently prevented me from making any lasting friendships. She would get upset if I suggested going out, and being the god damned spineless pushover I am, appeased her. My team then labeled me as the no fun kid and would not invite me out to go anywhere.

The next year, she actually enrolled at a school a couple miles away from me. Even then, she wouldn't let me go out to drink without her. There were still fights and there were many times where I considered ending it, but couldn't, because I'm a spineless bastard. Then summer rolled around. I took an internship about an hour away while she stayed in an apartment close to my school to work at her school. She then, at my suggestion, made friends with my teammates. Which is fine. But then we got into a fight at the end of the summer and she said to me, ""You know, your teammates like me better than you."" And that hit me like a shotgun blast of icicles to the chest. Because I knew it was true. I didn't want to believe it at the time, but I know now it's true.

A month or so later, she cheated on me by hooking up with a freshman. I broke up with her. We tried the staying friends thing but I couldn't. I ended up ignoring her, removing her from my newsfeed, to straight up blocking her. This was because I saw pictures of her getting cozy with my teammates' roommate. I decided, enough's enough. Seeing her will just make you angry and upset. You need to cut her from your life. So I did.

A week or so after, a friend from home messaged me on facebook. I thought, ""Hey this is nice. Catching up is good."" Then she said, ""Why did you block her?"" I forgot to mention that I introduced her to my ex, and they seemed to get along well while I was dating my ex. They apparently kept up this friendship after the breakup. So when she asked this, I immediately became suspicious. Why would she ask this? How would she even know? Simple. My ex found out and talked to her about it. That was the whole reason of that conversation. She wasn't trying to catch up. She was spying for her. I got angry, told her off, and don't believe I have spoken to her since.

So by now it's my senior year. And of course, my ex started dating my teammates' roommate and of course, they have to show up to all of my team's parties, cause they're all such fucking good friends. So I have to deal with seeing her at places where I can relax and have fun. I could not trust anyone on my team, and basically held everyone in my year at arms length because I know for a fact they were all still friends with her. And where were my teammates during all this? My brothers in arms that were supposed to stick by me, both on and off the field? Nowhere. Fucking nowhere to be found. Not once did they approach me and asked me how I felt. Not once did they ask if I was okay with anything that was happening.

And how did this make me feel? Like complete trash. Trash for feeling paranoid about trusting anyone, due either to my ex cheating on me or my friends essentially betraying me. Trash for knowing how close my ex and my teammates are and how distant I am from them.

This is compounded by the fact that I feel like a total failure to my parents because I don't know what I'm doing with my life. I graduated with a 3.47 while my brother graduated with a 3.8 something. He's going to med school. I've taken over (basically was handed) his old internship when I couldn't find a job. Every conversation I have with my parents about what I'm gonna do after this year leaves me frustrated and upset.

There's almost no one I feel like I can go to with this. There's basically nothing for me here. I'm basically biding my time, waiting for this year to be over. By then, hopefully I'll have gotten into a graduate school somewhere far from here, and I can start a new life. It's so weird saying that. To start a new life when I'm just 22 years old. Maybe not.

I suppose I'm really good at hiding all of this. Maybe my parents notice when I get down or my tone of voice changes but they haven't really pushed me about it. However, none of my friends know. Maybe just one or two about how I really feel, and how much this is affecting me, even after all this time.

I don't know what to do. I've been internalizing everything for my whole life and now I can start to feel the armor cracking. I don't know if I want to talk to someone cause I don't know what to say and I'm not sure I'll like what will be said to me. I don't know if anything can even cheer me up right now.

I don't know."

x5ydw,4,2012-07-25,What was it like when you finally realized you suffer from ADHD?,paradoxcontrol,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/x5ydw/what_was_it_like_when_you_finally_realized_you/,"I'm beginning to believe I'm going through this process right now. After reading the post about the lazy intern that hit the front page, and reading that the OP suffered from ADHD, I too was confronted by my superior about my lack of productivity. After the talk I thought back to that thread, remembering that the OP had sympathized with his employee because his ADHD made it hard for him to focus at times as well. 

The more I thought about it, the more I started to notice that this isn't the first time I've been talked to about my lack of focus. Going all the way back to Elementary School I could think of dozens of times that this exact conversation had happened. 

Currently, I have not actually been diagnosed with anything. I did however schedule an appointment with my doctor so that I can discuss it with them. **(edit: I actually can't even remember what the date was for this appointment! Thankfully they will call the day before...)**  I've spent most of my night reading about ADHD and what effects it has on people. I keep finding my self doing a lot of what is listed. 

I have almost no care towards the consequences of not getting important and long term tasks done. This was part of the issue brought up today with my boss. I work in IT at a school district and we have a limited time table to get a lot of things done before the school year starts again. However, I realize now that each day I come in, I have an extremely low sense of urgency about the summer months. As if putting things off wasn't going to cause chaos later in the year. I honestly can't think of a time where I was worried about anything more then a week or two out. 

When it comes to large tasks I find my self easily pulled away from what I'm doing. This could be anything from opening up Reddit (kind of ironic at the moment) to having someone come in to our office to talk with one of my Co-Workers. This is clearly because my task at hand (be it unboxing large quantities of computers/laptops to calling support lines for tech support on software) has fallen to the lowest part of my interest level, and everything else around me becomes way more interesting and rewarding. Sure unboxing 110 computers means that it'll be easier to image them later, but this link about video games on Reddit is just fascinating!

My memory is also vary poor. I have a really hard time remembering people by name, even if I've worked with them recently. If I've just talked to someone on the phone I can instantly forget their name after I hang up leaving me wondering who I was even talking to. It takes frequent interaction with a person before I can know who they are if someone else is talking to me about them. I can't count how many times a co-worker has asked / said something about ""so and so"" only for me to go ""who is that?"" and have them give me a funny look in return because I should clearly know them. Even things I do every day, or every few weeks, I'll have to ask someone how to do it. Simple example, The DNS setting on just about ANYTHING in our network. I should know that, we use it for everything, and even now I'm having a hard time remembering what it is. 

My room is a mess, I've never been an organized person. My desk at work is also a mess (though to be fare so is everyone else's desk) and I never have an urge to put it in any kind of order. 

I also find my self having to ask someone to repeat something to me, even though they just said it. Its as if the words go in my head and never get anywhere. 

This turned in to a really long post... But its helped me feel better about my situation. I used to think I was just a lazy idiot and never thought about WHY. Now everything seems to make sense. I almost feel angry (at the least annoyed) that I didn't have this realization sooner. Maybe I would have done better in school, stuck it out through collage, continued drawing or pod-casting like I used too. 

I don't expect anyone to upvote this, but if you've ever been where I am now, you know how to show it. 

**TLDR: While unconfirmed, I think I might be suffering from ADHD. Anxiously awaiting a doctor visit to see if my suspicions are correct.**"

I am graduating from this program called Year Up and I couldn't be any more excited about it. It's completely changed my life career-wise. A long time ago, I posted on this sub-reddit from my first account about how ITT Tech being a scam, and how it completely ruins peoples lives more than they actually help.


Being in $48,000 of debt because of it, I had absolutely no idea what the hell I was going to do, not being able to find a job after ITT. I heard about this program for about 5 years, but felt like it was way too good to be true.


Here is why:

* Non-profit organization
* 6 months of either IT training or financial ops in class room environment
*6 months of real work experience in a well established corporation (I ended up as a tier II desktop technician at Fidelity Investments)
* 18 college credits that could transfer into other colleges (I CAN'T EVEN TRANSFER ONE CREDIT FROM ITT TECH)
* Get a mentor, meet millionaires and entrepreneurs who step down from their thrones to share their wisdom/experience with us
* THIS PROGRAM IS ABSOLUTELY FREE!!! NO ONE FORCES YOU TO STAY THERE! 
* THEY PAY YOU TO TAKE THE EDUCATIONAL CLASSES!  I LITERALLY GOT PAID TO LEARN 3/4ths of WHAT ITT TECH HAD TO OFFER!!! They even increase your pay slightly when you start the internship!



This program is a miracle itself, and NEEDS more awareness. There aren't enough things in America that provide as much opportunity here. If you are looking for a career in IT, or Finance, or you want to devote your time and give back to the community, look no further, THIS IS WHERE IT'S AT!!!


Reddit, it would mean a lot to me if you guys look into this program, learn more about it and spread the word.

I just received this book, it was released Monday and seems to be doing REALLY well. (I kinda stole the title for this post from the book). I haven't read it at all yet, but it's about the CEO and how Year Up is influencing the work world in America. 


I'm not sure if posting links to buy things is a good idea, but I'm mostly linking because the website has some info on the CEO and such in a nutshell. 


http://www.yearupbook.com/main.php?page=homehttp



TL;DR:

Year Up is changing the lives of young adult's career-wise and is FREE. If you're looking for an IT related career or financial ops or looking to be a volunteer for an awesome program, this is where you want to start!!

x5tcb,1,2012-07-25,"Advice for rising junior: intern, study abroad, and/or minor? details inside",keepcooler,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/x5tcb/advice_for_rising_junior_intern_study_abroad/,"I'm currently a rising junior at an engineering college. So far, I've had one meaningful internship with.. lets say.. Company A, that I really enjoyed. This fall, I will also be studying abroad in europe.

My decision now is what to do with the year and a half that I have when I return from europe. With the number of hours I will have, I will basically have room to do one of these things:

**1.** intern for the second time next summer and get a minor in a subject I enjoy
**2.** study abroad for the second time next summer in Asia and intern next fall
**3.** study abroad for the second time next summer in Asia and get a minor

Regarding the internship, I would probably aim for working for Company A again, except this time in a different city and a different department. I'm very interested in gaining experience in the department I would be interning with. Regarding the minor, it would probably be a liberal arts subject that's not directly related to my desired career, it would just be fun.

Basically, what are your recommendations? I need to find a good balance between what is a fun experience and what is a good experience. Honestly, I'd love to intern again, study abroad again, and get a minor, but I don't really have the time.

**TL;DR**- I need to decide between the numbered options above"

x9red,1,2012-07-27,Engineering Graduate in Seattle wanting hands-on job--should I consider manufacturing positions?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x9red/engineering_graduate_in_seattle_wanting_handson/,"I am a recent Engineering Master's graduate in the Seattle area. I remember at a time I was worried I would have too many job offers, due to my three degrees and international and domestic internship and research positions. However, it has been 3 months with only a couple of interviews and no job offers. The main complaint I have heard, from those who have given me any feedback, is my lack of hands-on experience with certain manufacturing methods or materials. Most of my experience is all theoretical and academic.

I am in the Seattle area. There are a lot of engineering positions, but also a lot of manufacturing jobs.

I am wondering if I should seek out an entry-level manufacturing or assembly position in the industry I would like to work: in aerospace, composites or plastics. Perhaps I could work a year on the floor to give me a feel for the industry and get my foot in the door at those companies.

My concerns are:

* Will it look bad to the manufacturing hiring manager? Would they avoid hiring somebody who is over-educated for the job and likely to want to move up?
* Would it look bad to the engineering team at the place I find a floor-position?  I hope not, since I would hope to make connections with them.
* Would it look bad to any future employers a few years down the road?
* Will it add any value to my experience? I have a heavy theoretical background which may be valuable on its own, and may be incompatible with this plan.

If there are any engineers out there, or people who have gone such a route, I would like to hear any advice."

I met this girl towards the end of college, but she had a boyfriend. She was way out of my league, but we had fun together so we'd hang out. I was interested in another girl at the time so it wasn't a big deal or whatever.

Over time, my girl moved away and she broke up with her boyfriend. We both lived in the same town so we hung out every now and then, but every time we did, we'd have a great time. About a year after we graduated, she got a really, really bad case of depression and basically shut herself out from the world. She ignored me for about 4 months, until one day she sent me an email explaining her situation. I helped her for the next four months, and things were going well, and she was starting to get ready to actually hang out again.

She gets an internship during this time and it's in Europe, so she leaves to go there. Mind you, she still hasn't seen me in about 8 months now. A little more history about her: all of her friends moved away after college, her parents are very cruel and mean to her and thus she has no relationship with them because of constant verbal abuse, and she has a hard time connecting with people.

While she was in Europe, we would have skype dates twice a day. We got to know each other better than anyone could, and I really started to fall in love with her. One day, she got drunk before one of our skype dates, and told me that when she comes back, she feels like there is just this inevitable feeling that we'd hook up. So she asked me if I wanted to hook up and see where it went from there. She was not really interested in a relationship with me or with anyone at the time, so I figured I'd take what I can get.

She came home, and we kissed for the first time, and it was magical. We ended up hooking up for days on end when she came home, and it was perfect. All the while, she never hinted or explained that she wanted a relationship, but she'd send mixed signals in person. She'd hold my hand and kiss me and distract me while I was on the phone, or she'd carve our intials in a heart on the bench, and it seemed so real.

Then, on the day after my birthday, she broke up with me, and that was that. Have you ever seen (500) Days of Summer? She pretty much did that exact thing to me. She wanted to still be friends, and GOOD friends, because she never felt that we were in a relationship.

After a few months, I learned to deal with the emotions and after a few frank conversations, I realized that I don't want to be in a relationship with her ever again because of how much she hurt me and because she would just be toxic for me.

So we go back to being friends, which is fine. It's hard sometimes, but we're always there for each other and supportive, including in romantic endeavors.

But whenever she tells me that she's going out with a guy or that she's hooked up with someone else, I get sick to my stomach. My body gets cold and shivers, I feel like I want to puke, and my head gets all cloudy. I wouldn't call it jealousy because I know what that feels like and I know it's not that, but it's similar symptoms.

I WANT to be able to talk to her about that kind of stuff because, in total honesty, I don't want to get back together with her, but my body still reacts to that in a way that I don't like and I don't want.

Has anyone else had that happen? How have you dealt with it or how do you deal with it now? Does it ever go away? I've been going to therapy for three months now twice a week, and I still can't seem to shake it. Please let me reemphasize - I am not actively pursuing her. If she told me that she does like me and indeed wants to get back together, I'd consider it, but it's not something that I want at all.

Please help!

Thanks.

**TL;DR**: I briefly ""dated"" my best friend, still best friends, get weird emotions and feelings when we talk about her dating other guys and I don't want to feel that way because I don't like her that way anymore.

x9jzc,1,2012-07-27,Leaving an internship one week early,Ilurk23,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/x9jzc/leaving_an_internship_one_week_early/,"So I'm just finishing week 6 out of 10 of an internship  and I'm looking for a little advice. Before I applied for this internship, my parents scheduled our annual week long summer vacation for the 21st of August, the last week of this internship.

Last week I finish the main project that I was assigned, and figured it couldn't hurt to ask if I could head out a week early to join my family, since I was doing very little. Both of my 'mentors' (we'll call them mentor 1 and 2) said that they would be okay with that, but mentor 2 said he'd have to check with the internship higher ups. 

The higher ups said that I would have to return a minimum of $600, and I don't have a final amount yet, but I am fine giving that up. I figure if I start choosing family over money now, it will be easier to continue doing it. But now mentor 2 is urging me to reconsider, because it could affect my reputation if other employers find out about my leaving.

So which option would you choose? I'm leaning toward leaving.

Here's a little bit about my situation and the internship in general:

* Mentor 1 is my main mentor, but he lives about 7 states away. We email occasionally, but I'm mostly on my own. Mentor 2 rarely comes by to check on me and doesn't really know about my project in any way.

* I know for a fact that nothing of any importance is going to happen that last week. I'm staying two weeks later than the other interns here so no special intern party or anything, and my project is already done

* I am basically responsible for myself. I don't check in or out. Honestly I probably could easily just not show up for the last week and no one would notice, but it's become an issue because I went through the proper channels.

* My roommate situation is less than stellar here and I'm homesick as hell. I'd love to be home asap.

* I already have another internship lined up for next summer through a program at my school.

* I like to think of myself as a person who fulfills any commitment he agrees to.

So what should I do reddit?"

It was 2006. My organic chem professor, who I became good friends with had a bunch of us hang out at his house, drink some beers, shoot the shit. It was a good time. 

He was a bald Vietnam vet rocking a badass goatee. He suffered from PTSD, and would frequently have what I now refer to as ""paranoid Heisenberg"" moments. 

One day, he calls me up to his bedroom-office and immediately, my friends who are in his living room, and I get scared. He tells me I need to fix his computer - to be honest, I suspected something far different, and far worse. 

He whipped out . . . a baggy of weed and we smoked a bowl. My friends came upstairs and thought that his murderous Vietnam rage would come out (I AM THE DANGER). Such was not the case. We all got high. 

So he would ask us to ""hang out"" and we eventually got sick of it. We had a ton of work to do for our classes, even his. He forgave the work he assigned, but obviously couldn't forgive other professors' work. Saying no was frightening. 

That summer, he had a research internship where we were to do research on plants and extractions. The idea was that there was a particular flower in western NY that was supposed to have medicinal properties, and we would find a way to isolate the chemical and extract it via steam distillation. 

The steam distillation practice was long and drawn out. He sought out various methods using an espresso machine to generate steam and give a good extraction. 

We learned that all this work - all this research - and all the collecting of this particular flower was because the extraction would be similar to extracting THC. It's apparently difficult to steam-distill THC, and he was trying to perfect the method with cost in mind. 

He never got completely there. Last time I saw him, he grew out what hair he could, and was living in a tent, unemployed (not a joke). He resembled the ""52nd Birthday Walter White.""

***

TL;DR - I knew my own ""THC"" Walter White, and I was his Jesse Pinkman. Couldn't say not to any of his harebrained ideas because his PTSD durned him violent.

Part 2: On the Alliance's Secret Service
((Forgive the bad Bond references. I couldn't think of a good one this time :\ ))

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previous Part: http://redd.it/x4zv0

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Twenty minutes into a conversation with the guy in charge of electronic counter-intrusion, and he still wasn't making much sense.

""In ENGLISH, please.""

""Ok, so the hacker was on our network, He must have been close to the building at the time.""

""Besides that, did you get anything useful?""

""Well, he didn't bother to hide from our firewall, we have the contents of his computer, therefore, it was most likely stolen.""

""But we know who he stole it from, right?""

""Yep. Daniel Lind, Citadel resident, unemployed, but well off. Reported a missing computer a week ago.""

""Thanks, man.""

""Hey, it's my job.""

~~

It's a long walk up from the IT dungeon back to the upper echelons of SAMIS, but I was in a good mood; the day had finally become interesting, and with a little luck, by the time it was done, my paperwork would be magically cleared away by helpful interns.

When I reached the Superior's office, the door was slightly ajar, so I pushed it open and strolled in.

""We have a name.""

""Really? Excellent. Who is it?"" I swear, the man could sweat buckets. He dabbed at his forehead with a hankerchief.

""Daniel Lind. Citadel. His computer was used in the attack. We should talk to him.""

""The Citadel?""

""Yep. I'll need to get there. Any chance of getting a ship?""

He nearly fell out of his seat laughing. I was not amused.

""You want a SHIP?""

""Shepard got a ship,"" I mumbled, ""and you all thought he was crazy...""

""You're no Shepard, Ward.""

Point taken... Painfully.

""Look, Ward, the truth is, ships are awfully expensive, and you need to do your part to stimulate the economy. You'll take a bus."" Now it was my turn to nearly fall down.

Bruised ego aside, I took the bus pass and ID cards he handed me, and grabbed my bag. It was pre-packed for a mission. I glanced quickly at the IDs, then did a double-take. My cover name was Ben D. Over. After swearing revenge on the ID department, I headed over to the bus depot, flashed the pass, and boarded the Number 12, Citadel X-PressLine. 

~~

23 hours later, there I was. Standing in a line at Citadel customs, like a good little spy. It seemed to go smoothly until the small Salarian lady in front of me decided to argue with the C-SEC official over whether 253 Galactic Standard Volume Units was 'close enough' to the limit of 250 for her to pass. Just as it was getting heated -- and entertaining -- a new official tapped me on the shoulder, and took over the line. The Turian admirably attempted to hold in a giggle as he looked at my IDs, scanned my bags, and sent me on my way.


I took the elevator to the Lower Wards to speak to C-SEC Commander Bailey. I'd need access to their resources to both find Daniel Lind, and have the authority to do anything with him. At least I've heard Bailey detests politics as much as I do. Out of the elevator, it's a short walk to C-SEC HQ. 


~~

""How can I believe you're SAMIS?"" Said Bailey. It's an understandable point. I did my best to ignore it.
""Your first names are Armando and Owen.""
""So? Anyone with an extranet connection could find that out.""
""You got all 'A's in grade 3, except for phys-ed, which you got a 'C+' in.""
""Ahhh... Um... Very good... Do what you want, then.""
""But I was just about to say the teacher comments. They were quite interesting.""
""You have my full authorization. Just try not to draw the Council's attention.""
""Thanks, Commander. See you 'round.""
I began to head for the door, when the sound of Bailey clearing his throat stopped me.
""Um, Ben? Not your name, I'm assuming... I'm serious. Don't get the Council involved. Please?""
""Got it.""

It may be because getting results that positively impact the world takes way too long for my attention span but I'm not sure. I'm leaning towards doing graduate studies in EE but I have a bunch of questions - some of which I have answers to but not very thorough ones. So here goes:

* Are there any exams I need to take? (e.g. GRE)
* Are there courses I should/need to prepare with? I've already taken an electric networks class and I'm starting circuits with lab in the fall.
* Are there any skills I should learn? What resources should I use? I already have a bit of programming experience.
* Do most schools offer stipends/fellowships? How much are they and how hard are they to get? I have a very good GPA but from an almost unknown school.
* How should I decide what schools to apply to?
* Does school 'prestige' matter much?
* How do I find out which schools are 'good'?
* What should I look for in schools I apply to?
* How do I determine whether I want to get a masters or a PhD?
* How is research in EE different from research in physics?
* Can I apply to a masters program and then switch to PhD later on? Can I do the reverse?
* I'm mainly interested in studying signals, communications and networking but also possibly circuits, security, and quantum computing. How do I find out more about these areas and which I am most interested in?
* If you have any other advice or suggestions, I'm all ears!

I'm working as an intern at a company that's male-dominated and full of people under the age of 35. It's a really fun place to work and I'm enjoying myself, but this week it hit me that sometimes it's tough to have privacy when you have a friendly, familiar relationship with your coworkers. 

Tuesday morning I woke up with a pretty wicked UTI, so I decided to email my supervisor and tell him I was having some health troubles, and then get myself to the doctor and take the day off. He responded professionally, I went to my doctor, and by Wednesday morning I was feeling well enough to go to work. 

Wednesday morning, I was bombarded with questions from my team. ""How are you feeling?"" ""Are you better?"" ""What was wrong?"" ""Is the outbreak over?"" I laughed it off and said I was feeling better (of course not about to share the details of my genitals with these guys), and tried to get to work. But the questions kept coming, to the point where I was just blushing and saying ""I'm fine, I'm fine."" It was only when the only other woman on my team snapped at the guys that I might not want to talk about it, that they left me alone. 

I though it was over, but at a one-on-one meeting with my supervisor later that afternoon (it was pre-scheduled, he didn't call it to talk to me about this), he started the meeting off by asking, ""So what was the matter yesterday?"" Frustrated, I said, ""I have some health problems at the moment. I went to see my doctor about it and I'm feeling better, thanks."" He gave me a bit of a surprised look but carried on. 

So 2X, have you ever found yourself in a similar situation? What's the proper etiquette here? I want to be friendly with these people, but I don't want to have the spill the beans about my genital ailments just to maintain this environment. "

It was a blast to build and I have been loving it since may when I built it.  I had my share of dumb moments like the time where I forgot to plug in the cpu power and couldn't figure out why it wasn't turning on and when I forgot to put in the standoffs on the motherboard :p but all in all, it came out pretty well.  

I have done some updating since I built like adding in the 750w psu and the gelid silent fans which really do live up to their claim of silence.  I also started with a shitty mouse and a microsoft ergonomic 4000 keyboard which I hated so I splurged on a mechanical which I love so much that I take it to my internship and back every day :)  

But anyway, it runs bf3 on ultra at 1080p pretty well with an average fps of ~50.  I wish I didn't get an ocz ssd and I wish I got a larger one because I have been strapped for space on it.  The boot times are very sub par for a ssd clocking in at 42 seconds when I check the event log :(  It gets from power button to the password screen in 28 though which is better but still nowhere near great.  but here's the specs and special thanks to a redditor by the username of ComancheCorps who provided me quite a few things free of charge despite never even meeting me in his life.  He is a wonderful person :)

xbhic,1,2012-07-28,So i really like my coworker...,[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/xbhic/so_i_really_like_my_coworker/,"I'm 19. She's 22. Were both interns. I like her alot. Wayyyyy more than the average crush like it is not normal how much I like her. I've never felt this way before about someone. I can't stop thinking about her. I try to but I can't. It's impossible. Fuck.

She likes me as a freind but I'm not sure if she'd want to date me. We do talk alot and she always smiles when she sees me. She laughs at my jokes even though they suck. She always seems to be interested in what I talk about. She does like talking to me . Idk if she would want to date me though. There's the fact that shes 22 and im 19. I'm not sure if she would be willing to date that younger. And at the end of August we both go back to college where we would be 1-2 hours away. I'd definitely be up for the distance but idk if she would be.
Another thing that is giving me doubt that she would want to date me is that usually when we talk its me starting the conversations like I go to her desk and talk to her. She never comes to where I work and talks to me. That could be partially due to the fact that I am usually all over the building and never usually stay in one area for more than an hour. She did say to me a few times to fell free to stop by her since she is stuck in a project where she works alone.

So what do you think reddit? Do you think she is interested? How would I go about asking her out or even just hanging out after work? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

TL;DR How do I go about asking out my coworker?"
xbh3t,7,2012-07-28,I never thought I'd have to post here,throwaway09628,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/xbh3t/i_never_thought_id_have_to_post_here/,"And yet, here I am. It all started during the past semester when my friends group started to dwindle, for whatever reason. Some got boyfriends, others found new friends, it doesn't really matter what the reasons are, I suppose. I found myself hanging out with my boyfriend really often, because I just didn't have anything better to do. 

For the past few months I thought I felt better. Some of my friends had more time because of the summer, I was less stressed out because there was no school, etc. But now I feel like I'm back to square one. I feel like I'm so needy of my boyfriend, which is a quality I prided myself on never having. I used to be so independent. I miss being that way. There are just so many things wrong, I'll just try to list them, because if not I'll just wind up rambling.

-I have no desire to do anything. Even things I enjoy I have no motivation to do. 
-I get angry at my boyfriend a lot over really dumb things, and I'm worried I'm pushing him away. I love him, and I don't want him to break up with me over something I know I can control because I'm conscious of it happening. We spend a lot of time together, and right now I'm thankful for that. But I know that he needs to be with his friends and so things without me, but I get upset when I can tell he doesn't want me to come along. I know this is bad, and I really don't want to be like that. He's really, really hard to talk to sometimes, so it's hard for me to explain this to him. 
-I get really, really anxious if I don't talk to someone throughout the day. If i have a day off of work, chances are I have nothing to do. And when that happens I have really bad anxiety the longer that I sit and do nothing. The problem then is that I have no motivation to do anything, even by myself. 
-When I think about my future, I just want to vomit. I'm majoring in something that's almost impossible to break into. I haven't even had an internship, even though I tried incredibly hard to get one, and I'm about to graduate. 

There are just so many other things. I guess the main problem is that I feel like I've lost my independence. I haven't been happy in a while. I used to think that if I felt depressed, I could just let it slide, but I know now it doesn't work that way. 

If anyone has any advice on how to feel better, I'd be more than happy to listen. Thanks. "
xbgpm,1,2012-07-28,How easily would I be able to find a job in Calgary?  IT/Finance,[deleted],Calgary,https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/xbgpm/how_easily_would_i_be_able_to_find_a_job_in/,"Greetings Calgarians!

I'm a Torontonian (who has spent many months in your wonderful city) and am thinking about moving to Calgary.  The reason is that my girlfriend works in the energy industry and we figure it would be a lot easier for me to make the move to Calgary than for her to look for work in Toronto...


A little about me.... I currently work in the capital markets division of a large bank.  I graduated this year with a degree in MIS/Finance.  I have internship experience as a developer at IBM and at another large bank.  I know a fair bit about Finance (mostly interest rate derivatives), am an expert in Excel/VBA.  I am a decent programmer (PHP/PERL/C#) and fairly good at SQL and PL/SQL.


I've posted my resume and indicated I'm looking for work in Calgary but I never get recruiters calling me... only Toronto-based ones.  I've contacted a few headhunters and they said that if I wanted to work in Calgary I should move... the thing is I have a pretty good job in Toronto and don't want to just take the plunge and move.  


Please feel free to share any advice you may have! :)"
xbgar,1,2012-07-28,"Pros, I need insight on the various workplaces of the design field.",[deleted],Design,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/xbgar/pros_i_need_insight_on_the_various_workplaces_of/,"I am a design student entering my second year, and have been fortunate enough to have a great chance at a few different internships next year.  If everything goes as planned, I will pursue all of them over the course of my education (that is if nothing better pops up).  Nothing is final at all yet, which is why I come to you with these questions.

Anyways, I am not going to assume the best and need your help in deciding which one of these I should pursue.  The thing is, one of these internships is with a major **corporations** design team, which I actually was lucky enough to be able to shadow for a bit and get a better idea of how they work.  

The environment includes cubicles, but is far from the cliche in that they are extremely low cut and the team is constantly engaging as a team as the area is easy to navigate freely.  This design team works only within the corporation or their clients, but the corporation definitely takes care of you financially.  Everyone on the design team works a set schedule, allowing time for things like side-projects and having a family.

The second is a major **advertising firm**, the largest in the state.  I am unfamiliar with the working environment and was hoping some of you guys working within the field at a similar advertising agency could give me some insight on the average creative environment of these places.  Are they studio-like, similar to something like IDEO, or are they more open-cubicle like?  Do designers within this area generally have a set schedule, consistent and reliable pay, good benefits?

The third opportunity I have is at a major **video game agency** in the area with multiple blockbuster games on the market.  Again, no idea how a place like this would operate.  Anybody have any insight on the working environment of a place like this?  

Any help at all would be appreciated, if you design within a company similar to any of these I would love to hear about it.  I really just want to get a better feel for what I personally would enjoy more.  Is your area always organized and clean, or does it resemble a classic college studio space?  Are you happy with the pay, hours, benefits, etc?  How much room do you have for growth as a designer, and for your career?  I have a lot of time until then, but I really want to get a better grasp on these environments and gain a better idea of what would suit me the best.

**tl;dr do you design in a corporate environment, advertising agency, video game company, or anything similar?  If so, let me know what you think about it and why.**"

",1nterlude,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/xb4yi/looking_for_some_career_advice_sysadmin_i_just/,"I obtained an advanced diploma (3 years) in Computer System Technology in Canada, with the focus of networking. Those classes were certified Cisco classes, and gave me experience to obtain my CCNP if I wanted to.  I live in a small town, and IT jobs here are scarce. I might see one posted somewhere in a month, that's if I'm lucky. For the time being I'm working a retail job full time, minimum wage. I'm in debt from school, and I do not own a car, so moving somewhere else is out of the question for the next six months to a year. My first step is to start saving money to obtain some certifications.

I'm very worried I'm losing potential work experience. I feel the longer I work a regular job, the harder it's going to be to find an actual IT job later. This worries me a lot, but maybe I'm worried for nothing.

I'm eager to work, and I love networking. Before I didn't like it a lot, but now it's something I really, really enjoy. I feel like a ""jack of all trades, master of none"" kind of person. 

I guess I can just ask my questions now. 

* Should I be worried about losing potential work experience? I graduated this summer. 
* Should my main focus be to obtain certifications right now?
* Is there a site to practice or do small networking/IT projects? I want to keep my skills up and learn new things, I'd love to use a site that had weekly projects. Sort of like what you'd expect from a classroom. I'd probably need to learn linux the most.
* Is there work I can do remotely? Obviously I wouldn't expect a full time job working from home in IT, but are there places that require small projects that could be done remotely? 
* Anything I should know or do in the meantime?

I want to work badly, but I just feel lost. I'd love to be an unpaid intern for an IT department, but I just can't afford to not make money. 

Any help or advice would be amazing :) "

A 32/128 bit addressing junkie?  Master of all things with lots of blinky lights?  You'll need a couple of things to start this journey:

* Genuine interest in technology and computing (its not about the money)
* Committing yourself to **never stop learning**
* A realization that it is a long, stressful road to becoming a network engineer
* Patience, you're going to be working with and supporting a lot of people of varying skills and social levels

So you've got those, let's get started!

1.  **Go to College:** Some people skip this step, but it's honestly the only sure fire way to get a job in networking.  You need the credentials a degree provides in today's world to get your foot in the door.  Look at getting a two or four year degree, with an internship at some point. 

2.  **Get a Helpdesk Job:** Everyone starts in Helpdesk. This is where you gain a lot of confidence, patience, experience, and most importantly: your first battle scars.  You need to find out the hard way that you don't know everything by causing a massive fuck up.  It humbles you and makes you more conscious of what you're doing and how it can impact things.  While you're working help desk, try to help out your superiors in any way possible.  Also, you should be working on getting at least your Network+ and CCNA.  Why Net+?  It's a really well rounded certification that covers a lot of ideas that are very vendor neutral.

At this point you have two options.  Stick around at your current company or jump ship.  I would say jump ship, as most help desk people will work at that job forever without a lot of advancement.  Either way, you want to move up to a:

3.  **Junior Administrator:** Why an administrator?  You want to be in networking?  You need server experience.  The more knowledgeable about servers you are, the more of an asset you are to your team.  Hopefully you picked up a lot of stuff on servers from your help desk position, but if not its probably a good idea to work on getting a Microsoft cert of some kind. You should also be collecting used Cisco equipment for your home lab.  You're going to need it for your CCNP, and companies will typically give old stuff away. 

4.  **Junior Network Engineer:** This title has many names, but it typically means entry-level network job.  This could be at the same company as your last job.  This job will give you a lot of networking related bitch work to do, but that's what you need.  Between looking over configs and working in your home lab, you should have enough experience/knowledge to get your CCNP.  The company should be able to pay for it too.  

Once you have your CCNP, it's descision time.  You can stay in the corporate IT world or move into consulting.  Consulting will pay better and fast track you into network engineer/architect role quite quickly at the cost of a social life and an enormous amount of stress.  Its also somewhat harder to get back into corporate IT from a consulting role.  Regardless, your next job should be a full blown network engineer.   

One thing you'll eventually need to think about is what specialty you'll bring into the table/focus on.  I think Cisco breaks it down the best:

* Routing and Switching
* Voice/Unified Communications
* Security
* Wireless
* Storage and data center

Having a specialty makes you more important and gives you an ace in the hole for jumping jobs.

I hope you found this guide useful. "

Pay no heed at all if you have better things to do...and you almost certainly do than reading a post that ultimately doesn't really matter...

[Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/who5j/probably_not_that_important_compared_to_other/)

Well, now it's almost a month of not really being able to sleep at all.  Nothing much changed with my internship in the last two weeks...aside from Thursday, when suddenly my boss (once again, at her house) decided to teach me something about an aspect of the business I had been interested in.  On top of that, she told me that she may well have a client next week and she wants me to meet with them and mentioned that she needs to pay me for what I've done so far.  This is the first time she's mentioned pay since the interview before getting this position that she's mentioned pay without my asking about it, so (call me naive) I'm hopeful I might get something.  About time, too, because my savings are getting into that stage where even filling up my car to go to her house looks like an unaffordable luxury.  Call me suspicious, though; I can understand the client having their own schedule, but taking 2 months to teach me about something fundamental to the industry and suddenly all of this happening on one day?  The Career Center at my university swears they didn't talk to her yet, but I'm not so sure...

Unfortunately, that's the good news.  It seems my depression has come back in full force.   I've found I have all but withdrawn from my group of friends that I've met this summer because I just can't bring myself to go do anything outside my apartment.  There's a girl I've met and become friends with just because she lives on the floor below us, and whenever I go try to hang out with her (and my roommate who have been inseparable since she found a kitten), there almost always seem to be 10-15 people crammed into her apartment who all know each other and I feel excluded; I've never been much of an extrovert, but the group feels so intimidating that I more often than not stay for a few minutes then slip back upstairs to do my own thing.  As a result, I get left out of most things they end up doing.  This isn't me; I want to be involved or active and doing things regularly, but I just don't feel like doing anything or trying to branch out and try to talk to them.  So, I increasingly just get left to my thoughts in the evenings, making my worries from before even more intense than they would have been.  I've caught myself on more than one occasion wishing for a way out - *any* way out.

At least I can keep my mind off my thoughts and dark issues to some degree with a first (sort of) client for my business.  They won't be paying me much if anything at all, but it will help with getting a portfolio started to bring in more clients down the road, and because of timezones and all of our individual commitments, the times we can collaborate on the project the easiest are in the evening.  There's so much to do that I can get lost in the work – oddly enough, that is when I am most at peace with myself; when all I can focus on is the task in front of me, I can momentarily lose sight of everything that is otherwise weighing me down.  And yet, I still worry about those subsequent clients; I have found that I am in over my head in terms of talking to potential clients and selling them on my services in person. I have everything spelled out well on my website, but I just have no confidence in myself to be able to translate that to a conversation rather than just give them the link.  I can talk about the industry all day if I had to, it's just getting to where I can talk to someone not as a sales proposition, but as sharing my knowledge, that I am terrified of.

Last but not least, my roommate and said friend from downstairs say that they want to wake me up early tomorrow morning – by dropping her 5 week old kitten on my face.  It may sound cute, but I'm not a morning person, especially when I haven't really slept for a month.  I already (rather forcefully) told them **no**, but they seem to think it's all a joke.  Never mind my own whole issue of not sleeping, I'm terrified I might reflexively and completely unintentionally hurt said kitten in the seconds of being woken up by a cat clawing at my face.  Sadly, my room doesn't have a lock, so I just have to rely on either staying up all night, or barricading my room and praying I wake up before they do for once, which means in 5 hours, or 6am.  On a Saturday when I might have actually slept for a while longer (assuming I can even fall asleep to begin with).

I'm just so messed up now that I can't even really think of anything to ask aside from this: how can I deal with my friends both in the matter of the kitten and feeling excluded from everything?  Also, how can I get back my confidence and feel like there's even something worth breaking out of whatever I'm stuck in?"

So today I woke up at around 6:30AM for my job after mini-partying 'till 3:00AM. I had been planning to get sleep, because I needed to be in work for a lot of hours today, but when 12:00AM rolled around last night I was like screw it I know I have work but whatever I'm gunna smoke and screw around for a while. So I did! xD It was fun as hell and I winded up watching like six youtube videos on photo editing in GIMP. Learned a lot!


Anyway so then the morning came, about three hours later. Ouch. I was still slightly buzzed and completely exhausted and entirely not in the mood for a day of work preceded by walking through really hot weather in work clothes that I look bad in. xD Only my Junior year days of getting consistently like 10 hours per school-week of sleep kept me semi-conscious. Sounds annoying right? ...it gets worse.


You see, it's the holy month of Ramadan xD


I am not Muslim, I'll get that straight right now. I'm deist, if anyone cares. My dad is Muslim though, and two Muslim habits I've picked up are: don't eat pork (I know it's good but I honestly am not a really big fan of meat or anything... like steak, ribs, bacon. I can live without em.) and fast for Ramadan.


So here I am, burned out from last night, sweating from heat in uncomfortable formal work clothes, and absolutely starving, and I can't even drink a cup of coffee to help me wake up. My stomach was not only hurting from hunger but also was just unsettled. I had acid reflux all day for some reason. I probably just needed a nice glass of forbidden water to settle it down.


Work wasn't *that* bad. It was a really chill day. I had two long meetings that wasted a lot of time (one even taught me all about Active directory server architecture!), chilled for an hour on my lunch break with all the other interns making jokes about how I couldn't have any pizza, and checked my facebook for constant ""Happy birthday!"" updates which were nice. xD I also cleaned out my entire old email inbox of over 5,000 spam messages! 


I decided to leave work a bit early (planned to stay 'till 6:00PM) and left at 4:30. Fell asleep on train after train trying to read my book, and it took way longer to get home than normal. When I finally got home my mom and brother and our friends named Jin and Thomas were like happy birthday! And then I smoked some bud with Thomas and my brother =) 


Around this time it's probably 6:00 I'm pretty happy and maybe a [7] when my brother says something along the lines of ""We're going somewhere."" And I'm like ""Where?"" and he's like ""It's a secret."" And I was like .......""YAAAAAAAY SECRET PRESENTS!""


...however, a bit later, my mom and brother said that ""the plan had failed."" They wanted to drive me to my dealer and buy me a quarter but he texted something like he couldn't sell today or whatever, so we wound up not going. We chilled and listened to the Strokes for about an hour and at like 7:00 we left to eat dinner.


So we're driving and suddenly I know where we are! It's this cool ass Thai food place called Tuk Tuk. I finally break my fast with calamari and sweet chili sauce which was delicious. Then I get pineapple (haha) friend rice and its awesome and everything is right with the world.


THEN we went outside and go to this park that's right by the restaurant and look at a view of Manhattan. I've seen a lot of views of Manhattan in my life in NYC, but I'd never seen that exact view until tonight. It was awesome. It was pretty breezy, and we were right under these huuuuge canopy-forming weeping willows that dangled down and swayed with the wind. We were sitting in benches that were really reclined and the backs of the benches were really tall so you can lay all the way back and stretch out and look from the bright buildings of the city to the stars between the hanging vines of the weeping willow trees. 


Then we dropped off Jin and Thomas, and drove back home!


The end! xD Sorry if parts of this are written weirdly, I'm at about [7] right now."
xa59d,1,2012-07-27,Specific Questions of asset allocation,PFQuestions,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/xa59d/specific_questions_of_asset_allocation/,"Hey Personal Finance!

I recently found your subreddit, and I hoped to get a little advice on what I should do with my current money situation. Here are the details:

I am an 18 year old in college. I am lucky enough to have my parents pay for almost all of my college, but I do take about 6-7 thousand per year in loans. 

I have 2k in a Roth IRA account with Fidelity, which I was able to fund when I worked at an internship this summer. I put that money into one of the Fidelity ""changing allocation fund"", where you say what year you want to retire (2040) and it changes (currently aggressive growth with almost all in equities) from aggressive to conservative as you get closer to the year of retirement. 

I then have 500 dollars in a checking account, and about 14.5K in a savings account, both with Ally Bank. I am earning almost nothing on the checking account, and about .8% with the savings account. 

My question is basically what should I do with the money that I don't have tied up in the Roth account. I would like to earn more than the measly .8% on the savings account, but I don't know what I should do with it. 

Thank you very much!"

So I'm going in to a game dev. program in university starting in september. As it stands now I have almost no experience with hardware. I do know that my current computer is not sufficient as it can't even run most games (usually due to my graphics card). I'm planning on building one from scratch that I'll be using for gaming as well as programming. For now I just want to know what parts are recommended if I want a PC that can handle pretty much anything in terms of gaming and coding. As of now I have nothing since I plan on keeping my current computer intact for travel since its a laptop. The school program I'm going into is a Co-op program (paid internship every summer) and I got in on scholarship so money isn't really an issue. I'll set a 2000$ budget if it will make it easier for you to help me but higher or lower doesn't really bother me. I just want something that will suit my needs well. Thanks very much for the help in advance to those who respond.

xd1on,1,2012-07-29,"I'm 29, unemployed, freshly single, and depressed.",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/xd1on/im_29_unemployed_freshly_single_and_depressed/,"Here's a bit of background:

I'm 29 years old.

I'm twenty or thirty pounds overweight.

I got an Associate's degree in Computer Science from an accredited technical college back in November.

I had to quit my (night) job in October in order to complete my mandatory (unpaid) internship.

Since then, the only job I've had was a two-month temporary position working at an IT help desk. That helped me get caught up on my bills, but money slips away pretty quickly.

In June, right after my birthday, my girlfriend of 3+ years left me.

I live in a trailer with with Dad and my sister.

I believe that I suffer from depression. I'm pretty sure it's why I let my girlfriend leave. She would probably even get back together with me now, but... I can't do it.

I've alienated most of my friends by working nights and then working nights while going to school. They've all moved on in the last few years, while I haven't, really.

I'm not even really sure what advice I'm looking for, Reddit. I'm trying to get a job and I'm working on losing weight(lost 20 pounds since June!), but I just can't muster up the motivation to actually TRY. I put forth a half-assed effort at pretty much everything I do, because nothing seems worth the effort.

For example, getting into shape is fine and all, but I'm not really doing it for myself. I'm doing it to impress whichever shallow girl I meet next.

Working is fine, too, but I'm not doing it for myself. No job I've ever held has ever paid enough to justify all of the work I've had to do.

In college, I graduated with a 3.95 GPA, I had Perfect Attendance and made Dean's List throughout my entire academic career, but... so what? I'm still unemployed nine months later! It seems like all of my hard work was wasted.

I guess what I really want is advice about what to do differently, Reddit. I'm just really, really unhappy with my life.

(note: And don't worry, I'd never commit suicide, I know better than *that*.)"

Unfortunately, it's unfunded, so I'm trying to find some sort of job so I don't have to take out a massive amount of loans. The problem is that (aside from Craigslist, which seems a bit sparse) I have no idea where to start. I have a bachelors in History with a minor in chemistry and a MA in American History. I have varied experience working in retail, national parks internships, call center work, sales, etc. This past year I've been working at a test scoring company, so anything comparable in Buffalo would be great, but I'm open to anything!

So, Buffalo redditors, do you know of any businesses that are currently hiring? Apart from Craigslist, where should I look for job openings? Is the Buffalo job market really as bad as Craigslist makes it out to be? Thanks!"

I have 3 days to find a roommate. The landlord is okay with the new person being on the lease. No smoking, no pets, no loud parties please. Moving on...

Anyway, the place. It's pretty small, the living room and the 2 bedrooms are carpeted (new carpets). As mentioned, it's $550/month, so $275 from each of us plus gas and electric. The kitchen is pretty sizeable (new stove, huge fridge) and the living room is...average? medium size? Enough for a sofa and coffee table. I don't have either, but you are more than welcome to bring furniture if you wish. My desk is there, by the way, because the bedroom that I have can only hold my bed and not much else. But don't worry, it's a small desk, not taking up much space. I have a bookshelf as well, also small, also in the living room. Your bedroom would actually be the nicer one: it's somewhat larger and has a nice huge window pointing to the street, so lots of light, and the closet is slightly bigger. (My window points to the other building/rusty fire escape and pigeons love to shit all over it, so you are really getting the better end of the deal here). There is no central air so please bring an AC unit, else it gets quite unbearable in this weather.

About me..I am a 21 year old female college student. I am working at an internship til the end of August in Itasca so I don't usually get home til 6:30-10PM. Otherwise, when the semester starts in late August, I will go back to my old job on campus where I do IT work. I will most likely spend most days (and some nights) studying either at home or the library. So...no parties please. But nothing wrong with having small get togethers or movie nights. Just nothing loud and crazy. No smoking and drugs in the house please. I don't care what you do with your friends, just don't bring it inside :) Oh, and also: NO PETS!

I'm somewhat reserved but I warm up pretty quickly and get along with most people. The only things I won't tolerate is people touching my stuff and people being flaky with bills/rent.

I like to cook, dance, read, go out to do random things when I have the time, beach, whatever. We can be friends or just friendly/polite, it's up to you.

So if you're interested in this apartment, please send a message! :) Everyone that has seen it absolutely loved it, by the way. It's no-frills but clean and airy. I would GREATLY prefer to live with someone around my own age, that's probably my only other request. I will get back to you hopefully tonight or tomorrow for sure. Again...I need this settled by Aug 1st. July 31st works too.

Thank you. "

Past Summers I'd waste my time playing Xbox and working minimum wage jobs. This summer I got motivated to get an internship. On top of that I created a schedule that was going to allow me to advance in life. 

When I get off work around 5pm, I go to the gym for an hour and a half, then make myself dinner and eat it for a half hour. Then at 7:30 I go to the local coffee shop and learn web development or read until about eleven, then go to sleep. I feel much more productive and like I'm continually moving forward in life. I'm not depressed anymore, and I'm noticing everything in my life is starting to change for the better. I'm actually making more friends now that I'm a more passionate person. I'm starting to enjoy the little things more, I have a reason to get out of bed every morning. 

To any others on Summer break I highly recommend starting a project of your own, like learning a programming language or foreign language. Also create a schedule and stick to it, once it becomes habit everything becomes a lot easier. At first, going to the gym was gut-wrenching after about the 5th time it was routine, after the 10-11th time it became essential and I started enjoying it.

As such, the family friends took me in for the summer, have let me stay at their house, not needing to pay rent, not needing to do my own laundry or cook. Heck, they give me money some times for things I buy for myself. I love tea and bought myself some. They gave me money since they said I should have just written it on the grocery list. This one time they left for a small vacation and gave me some cash for groceries and if I wanted to eat out. I only used 1/3 of it and gave the rest back. They gave me back the money and told me since I didn't use it all, I could keep it and use it one something else. Hence, they are so nice it hurts. And I have no idea how to show my gratitude back to them. I've been wracking my brain, thinking of ways. They are near retirement, and have no need for money, etc. They want a camper, since they had one when they were younger, but a camper is just out of the question. I've helped with yard work, computer things, etc. but I just don't feel at all if it's 1/16th of what they've done for me. And it's really rustling my jimmies. I'm definitely going to get a super duper nice card I think for sure, and trying to get some semblance of my thoughts onto the page, but that seems to little also. They really like ice cream and I had some brought up from Oberweis which they loved, except the closest one near here is 30 min away. Maybe I'll get some or bring them there, but it still doesn't feel like enough. Any thoughts Reddit?"

I like her alot. Wayyyyy more than the average crush like it is not normal how much I like her. I've never felt this way before about someone. I can't stop thinking about her. I try to but I can't. It's impossible.

She likes me as a freind but I'm not sure if she'd want to date me. We do talk alot and she always smiles when she sees me. She laughs at my jokes even though they suck. She always seems to be interested in what I talk about. Idk if she would want to date me though. There's the fact that shes 22 and im 19. I'm not sure if she would be willing to date that younger. And at the end of August we both go back to college where we would be 1-2 hours away. I'd definitely be up for the distance but idk if she would be.

Another thing that is giving me doubt that she would want to date me is that usually when we talk its me starting the conversations like I go to her desk and talk to her. She never comes to where I work and talks to me. That could be partially due to the fact that I am usually all over the building and never usually stay in one area for more than an hour. She did say to me a few times to fell free to stop by and visit her since she is stuck in a project where she works alone most of the time.

So what do you think? Do you think she is interested? How would I go about asking her out or even just hanging out after work? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

I'm a 23 year old college graduate. I've got a steady part-time job that pays me just barely enough to cover all my bills. I use my days off at an unpaid internship at the company of my dreams - I won't say where for privacy reasons, but in my field they are a very big name and I'm doing real work in the internship so I'm hoping this will let me break into the industry after my internship concludes in October. It's not an ideal situation, but I'm only 2 years out of college in a shit economy and I've been working really hard with what I have. With a $1,200/month income, I pay my $550 rent, $200 in public transportation to and from work and internship, and use the remaining $300 for food, expenses, etc. Even living on the edge like this, I managed to save up an emergency fund and pay down my credit, though the latter has been slowly creeping back up. I have worked very, very hard to become a financially responsible person with the little I have. But I had one blind spot, and it turns out it was a doozy. The only bill I wasn't paying was my student loans, as my parents said they would make payments for awhile until I got a real full-time job. My parents are horrendous about money even though my dad is a fucking accountant, and I realize now I should have been more vigilant - calling the banks to confirm, etc. I have been asking about my student loans - how much are the payments? how much do I owe? who do I owe it to? but my dad doesn't. talk. about. money. I even tried getting around him to figure out what phone number to call to speak to somebody else so I could get the answers, but I didn't know where to start. They assured me it was fine, so I let myself believe that it was, despite their utterly irresponsible attitude towards money. I told myself it would only be a short while longer until I got a real job and became financially independent and would not need to worry about them anymore.

Well, I stopped by my parents' house yesterday to hang out while they were on vacation (since they have a tv and I wanted to watch the Olympics). There was an unopened letter addressed to me sitting on the steps. I opened it up and it was a letter from a collections agency letting me know that my federal student loans are in default. I was completely floored. There had never even been a hint that they weren't making a payment - I have enough emergency money in my savings that I would happily have dipped in to make it if they were having a hard month, but they didn't say a word. I dug around and found an entire stack of unopened letters, clearly bills from the Department of Education, dating back over a year, complaining of late payments and missed payments. I'm thousands of dollars past due.

What can I do? Who do I talk to? What are my options, if any? I don't know where to turn. I live exactly on the edge of my income right now. Originally my student loan payments were around $200 which would be really fucking hard to make, but maybe if I dipped into my savings for a few months I could make it - but as it stands now, I can't possibly make the huge past due payments. How will this affect finding another apartment in the future? My credit is ruined, I'm sure.

Worst of all, while I can rebuild my credit over time with hard work, I don't know if I can ever rebuild my trust in my parents. This is not the first time they've done something of this kind to me. They are so irresponsible they're on the verge of losing their house. They've stuck their head in the sand about money for the last year, and not only are they sinking into an abyss of their own making, now they're willingly pulling me in with them. I could have done something about the payments *if only I had known* but they didn't say a word, even when I asked them point blank about it. I've always loved my parents, so the thought that I can't trust them is rocking my universe and I don't even know what the right choices are anymore. If anybody has advice, I would really appreciate it. Obviously in this economy I'm not the only person having problems with student loans, so hopefully any advice you have would be of use to them as well. Thank you. "

Our SOs were jealous of our friendship, but we were never single at the same time, so we never had a chance to see what it might become.  He graduated a year before me, and moved to a completely different part of the country, but when he'd come back to visit, he always made time to see me.  Even if he didn't have time to see anyone else. I'd feel sick about it afterwards, my heart would be racing so fast.

When I graduated from college, my plans took me even further away from him.  We basically live as far away from each other as possible. He's come to visit a couple times for work stuff, I've spent a couple summers in his city because of internships, but again-- one of us was always dating someone. We'd do activities that were essentially dates, bring each other to parties, or grab lunch in the middle of the work day. It's the same thing as in college, where he might be in my city for a couple days, and only have one free night, and he'll spend it with me. At least for me, that initial connection never went away. We've known each other for almost 5 years now, and I feel like I can distinctly remember every interaction we've had, because my adrenaline is always so high when I talk to him.

This is now the longest we've gone without seeing each other.  Work has not brought either of us to each other's cities in almost a year. We talk pretty often, and I think about him all the time.  These six months have also been the first time we've both been single in our entire friendship.  

Lately, I've felt more and more like I want to tell him how I feel. In a year, we'll both be in professional situations where we could move, and I keep thinking about how great it would be to be in the same city as him. Part of me thinks I should just fly out to where he is, without any excuse but to see him, and see if something happens.  Part of me thinks I should say something first.  Sometimes I feel like if I don't say anything I'll burst. Trying to hide the fact has made me the worst conversationalist ever.

So, what to do, reddit? Do I profess my feelings?  Should I fly out to see him and see if something happens finally?  Do I bite my tongue and preserve the friendship?"

I'm currently an undergrad college student and was wondering if anyone had any input on good places to apply for internships during the summer break months. 

I'm going into my sophomore year of college and am pursuing a degree in Management Information Systems (MIS) through my university's School of Business. I want to get a jump start on my future and see what options are available for places to work at in my near future and I tried to apply for internships this summer through career fairs which the School of Business held my freshman year, but was unsuccessful in my attempts. Each potential employer found that while my grades were good and I had valuable work experience toward my major (I work as an IT guy for the library on my campus during the school year) I was too young for what they were looking for as they wanted to give more opportunities for upperclassmen who were nearing graduation.

I didn't think much of not obtaining an internship at the time. I figured I would just work at a place locally during the summer to help with college expenses and try again next year so I took up a job as a lifeguard at a local water amusement park around where I live. This is my final day working at said water park, and I can easily say it has been one of the worst jobs I have ever had. Don't get me wrong, I try to keep an optimistic outlook on whatever job I have and put my best foot forward. I realize that every job has bad days and you might not always work fore the most tasteful of people, but I can easily say that working as a lifeguard this summer has been one of the worst experiences I've ever had and has made me appreciate my college education and the importance of finding a REAL job astronomically more. 

So I am heading back to my university in 3 weeks, excited as ever to continue my education and am ready to put in my best effort to obtain a job that I am happy working at. 

Once again, if you have any recommendations for good places to intern for as an undergraduate MIS student (or any undergrad student for that matter) or have had any good experiences working at at internship, please let me and any other college redditors know!

Much appreciation,

Jackie Molasses

**TL;DR:** Worked at a terrible job this summer. Looking for recommendations for good places to intern at in the future for an undergrad college student."
xcc7h,1,2012-07-29,"After thinking really hard about it, I realize one thing: I'm not a little shit anymore.  By this time next year, I'm going to be 20, and starting my junior year of college.  My question to you is this: how much have you guys changed over the years?  ",Sonicdude41,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xcc7h/after_thinking_really_hard_about_it_i_realize_one/,"If there's one thing I've been thinking about my life lately, it has to be this: where has all the ****ing time gone? I remember not too long ago, I was a silly little freshman starting high school. The only things important to me at that times were video games, tech, and many of the first world problems we all encounter on a daily basis.  

Now, I look at myself, and it's hitting me. I'm not a little **** anymore. I start my sophomore year of college in about 3 weeks. By this time next year, I'm going to be a 20 year old, looking for internships at some (hopefully) big name tech companies... and I'll be looking for a place that I can truly call my own down in Austin. I really have looked myself and noticed just how different freshman-year me and current me is, and to me, it's amazing just how much I've changed.  

Partly because of this place and college, I've become... I suppose a bit wiser.  If I'm going through some rough situation, I am now able to think about people who could be going through much worse, and put it in perspective to kinda keep myself going.  I can say that after becoming atheist more than a year ago, I've learned to take many things I see with a grain of salt -- by that, I mean that I'll go out of my way to verify any claim/point/whatever it is that is presented to me, as opposed to just accepting it at face value.  On top of this, I'm finding that, if I work hard enough... I'm capable of whatever it is that I put my mind to, mundane as this sounds.  While these are just a few things that I'm mentioning, I mention them because these changes are the ones that are very important to me, if that makes sense.

I'm really genuinely curious to know if any of you have had the same thoughts cross your mind in any way.  How much have you guys changed over the years?  Are you at all surprised by just how much you've changed?"

We've been going out for about 9 months now, and things have been... well interesting. This is the first relationship I've had that has lasted longer than 3 months. I've had 3 other 'girlfriends' in the past.

We met in college after my ex-girlfriend broke up with me a couple months beforehand. I really missed the feeling of being with someone and having someone cherish me, and I put aside her personality flaws and settled for her.

I moved back to my home state after college just recently and am still dating her. She's very cute, funny, and social - which is why I'm still interested in her. The thing is, I'm not attracted to her physically and.... well... sexually (listening to how she speaks and moans while having sex). She is a really great person and I truly believe she's definitely going to be more successful than even myself professionally.

Right now, our long-distance relationship is pretty annoying to me. She wants to speak with me at all times she is not working, including breaks at work, school, and her internship. Every time I inquire about less-talking over the phone, she gets sad/upset because 'I don't want to talk to her :('.

I feel like she's not the one for me, and I want to break up with her. I've doubted myself about this a long time, but then I realized I had more fun and interesting conversations with her girlfriends than her. She's young and naive, and at this point in my life I really want someone on equal footing with me or having more experience in both professional/personal spheres.

I feel terrible already for saying all those mean things about her, but it's how I feel. Again, I really think she's a great person and I'm just the asshole who just doesn't want to be with her. But here's what is going down soon.

- she's coming to visit me (4 hour flight across the country) in two weeks for a week (already bought the ticket).

- I'm already spent talking with her over the phone, and she always wants to talk and have phone sex (I don't even want it anymore, and have faked it many times).

- She probably will not come live on my side of the country after college (5 months away) because her mother wants her to move in with her after college.

So /r/relationships, here's my question: how do I break up with my girlfriend in the most genuine and sincere way possible? We both have a lot of mutual friends in her state, and I don't want to burn bridges."
xbqlf,4,2012-07-28,"I have been in a perfect relationship for 5 years, but I have developed overwhelmingly strong feelings for someone I have to work closely with--how can I avoid f-ing up these two very important relationships?",thisismythrowaway198,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/xbqlf/i_have_been_in_a_perfect_relationship_for_5_years/,"I have the perfect boyfriend, and I love him very much. But I am a selfish, childish fuck and I need to grow the fuck up. So here goes. 

My boyfriend: My boyfriend has been the absolute most positive force in my life for the past five years, and he and I plan on getting married and spending the rest of our lives together. Our relationship is truly a dream, we never fight and we are on the same page about everything important in life - money, family, career, etc. He is loving, faithful, and more supportive than I could ever imagine of my hopes and aspirations, which he constantly cultivates. He makes me feel like my absolute best self, and everything I have going for me in life right now (a great job, a healthy lifestyle, a positive outlook and big dreams) I trace directly to his incredible influence.  He makes me feel special and loved. We have sex all the time when we are together, but we have been doing the long distance thing for awhile (we have concrete plans to be in the same place and get married within a few years). 

The other guy: this summer, I got a big time finance internship - they just gave me an offer for when I graduate from B-school next year. I have been working long, long hours with one particularly incredible person, who is a few years older than me. He is the guy that I would have fallen for years ago, before I met my boyfriend. He is very different from my boyfriend, but eerily similar to me. I am able to talk to him about topics that are very near and dear to my heart that my boyfriend and I do not have in common (though we have other things in common, and until this summer I've never found it problematic that my bf and I don't share all the same interests.) I have spent significant time at work with this guy and one long afternoon outside of work (nothing happened). This person is not as attractive as my boyfriend, not as interesting, not as good on any level. But he is the first person, in five years, who makes me feel like maybe someone other than my boyfriend could make me very happy for a very long period of time. 

The issue: It makes absolutely zero rational sense for me to even conceive of leaving my boyfriend for this person, but I find myself extraordinarily drawn to him on an emotional and physical level. I wake up thinking about him, I wonder about his whereabouts, I wait for his texts. Basically, I'm infatuated, and it sickens me but also excites me. I have done several things I'm not proud of. I have sought out opportunities to spend time with him outside of work. I have found opportunities to complement him. I have given him one gift, and I bring him coffee and can't seem to stop the urge to feed him and bring him food and stuff. I find reasons to touch him, like brushing something out of his hair, touching his arm when we're talking. It feels very primal, I keep feeling like I want to buy him things and take him places and do things with him. I can't stop thinking about him. I am very ashamed of all of these things, and I realize that they make me a very selfish person. 

I have a tendency to develop unreasonable crushes on men that I spend time with, so, in everyday life, at school, in previous jobs, etc, I take precautions to shield myself from developing feelings for men who are not my boyfriend.  I don't go out without him, generally, and when I do I don't talk to guys or shoot them down way early or talk mostly about my boyfriend. I let men know early and often that I am completely committed to him. But with this person, I can't avoid him because we have to work closely together. The other guy is not a bad person (I wouldn't be attracted to him if he was), so he is not going to make a move on me even though I think he feels we have a special connection too. He does not seek me out to the extent I seek him out, he does not touch me or reciprocate the way I treat him. However, I think this is related to the fact that he has to evaluate me and he has a strong sense of decorum. I am overwhelmed by a desire to talk to the OTHER person about his feelings for me, and I know that the person I should talk to, who deserves my attention and all of my thought is my boyfriend. 

I am having a very hard time reconciling what, on the one hand, is the rational and analytical side of my brain which screams STAND BY YOUR MAN (and don't be a fucking psycho bitch), and the other, psycho bitch hormonal and emotional side of my brain which wants to talk to, spend time with, have sex with and fall in love with this other guy, after breaking up with my boyfriend. 

I am not going to physically cheat on my boyfriend, but this is obviously already a case of emotional infidelity. What can I do to control how I feel and make sure that nobody gets hurt here (including me?)

TL;DR: I have a great boyfriend that I want to marry, but I have developed an intense infatuation for a guy at work I have a lot in common with.  I need advice on things I can actually DO to avoid being a psycho bitch and maturely handle two complex relationships. "

I'm a software engineering intern at the moment, and was thinking of spending some evenings and weekends developing a 2d online game of some sort, similar to MapleStory, but not targeted at such a huge scale. I think it'd be good practice, and something to toy around with when I'm bored. 

Where would you start? I've never worked with any frameworks.. mostly just worked on algorithms and such. Where would you go for documentation / tutorials?

I was thinking of doing this in Java, as I work on a Mac, and want my Windows friends to be in on this too once it comes along.

Thanks so much!

xbo8e,0,2012-07-28,"Police forced SO to take the ambulance by threatening jail time, now she has a $1400 bill. Is there anything we can do?",Jombozeus,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/xbo8e/police_forced_so_to_take_the_ambulance_by/,"My girlfriend (under 21), was intercepted on university campus by police on her way home while heavily intoxicated but not to the point of needing paramedics. The police called the paramedics and demanded that she gets on the stretcher despite her refusal. Then the police immediately threatened to take her to jail if she didn't go.

This is pretty obviously extortion but I know there is no likelihood of suing. Especially because in California, state law allows paramedics to treat a patient under implied consent when the patient is intoxicated.

However, forking out $1400 for a &gt;2 mile ride while being forced to is ridiculous and however we can reduce this amount would be the ideal.

What can we do the challenge the bill? Can she write to the hospital and challenge the amount with a combination of her low income (intern) and the fact that she was forced by a police?

Thanks."
xbnjx,0,2012-07-28,Let me tell you a story about a girl I like to call shoe girl.,instantnom,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/xbnjx/let_me_tell_you_a_story_about_a_girl_i_like_to/,"So I have told this story to several of my friends but I think it is about time that the reddit community hears it.

I had just finished my first year at Georgia Tech and had flown back home to Dallas to participate in a summer intern research position in 2009. One of my close friends for that year (who I shall refer to as Stephen) had just broken up with his girlfriend (who I shall refer to as shoe girl). Stephen and shoe girl had been going out for a year; however, Stephan broke up with her cause he was transferring to UGA next year. Right after they broke up shoe girl turned to me, instantnom, for comfort and remorse. For the next two weeks shoe girl would start to tell me how she has developed “feelings” for me and that she “loved me.” After the second week had ended she told me “that she loved me and wanted me to come visit her in Atlanta” to which I responded “ok.” (Let me just put a note in right here and say that she was and still is very attractive and we had been friends the entire time that Stephan was dating her.) After getting Stephan’s permission to pursue his ex-gf I flew out to Atlanta to what I had hoped and thought would be a weekend of fun. Of course if that would have happened I wouldn’t be telling this story now would I.

After arriving in Atlanta, I met up with shoe girl to go out on our evening date and to hang out. We decided to go to Atlantic Station for dinner due to the fact that there are a lot of things to do. Once arriving at Atlantic Station shoe girl would continue to non-stop text to which I originally found irksome but not a deal breaker. I suggested several places to go eat but she informed me that “she had just left CB’s house where he had cooked her dinner before picking me up.” (CB stands for cock block. I couldn’t think of a better name nor do I remember his real name.) Hearing this I started to worry but was too fucking hungry to care at the moment. During dinner at the local burrito place shoe girl continued to text CB and later asked me if I thought “it was ok for her to date around.” Being that we were on a date my first thoughts were a big hell no but being the giant pussy that I was I responded with a “sure.”

After dinner we decided to go to movies and see the latest big summer blockbuster, Inception; however, shoe girl was too impatient for me to buy the tickets and suggested “that we just go back to my hotel room.” At this point I had to make a decision, watching a movie I can see at another time or sexy times with an extremely attractive female. It was a hard choice but I went with the second option. While we were driving back to my room she told me a story of how she was at a party a week earlier, got drunk, and how one of Stephan’s friends (shall be named Fry)tried to hook up with her.

When we arrived to my room shoe girl continued her constant texting and got a text from Fry explaining how he had just gotten a house in Home Park and if she wanted to come take a look at it. Once again being the giant pussy that I was I agreed that we could go. Once arriving, it was to my surprise that Fry had not in fact purchased a house but was renting a room inside of a house. After doing the usual meet and great thing it was discovered that there was going to be a party there that night.

I’ll skip past the normal party things and go to the pool scene but just note that like most Georgia Tech related parties it was a giant sausage fest. At around 1 am a few geniuses decided that they wanted to fill up their newly purchased inflatable pool and to go swimming in it. It was during this that we all decided to go swimming in our underwear which only confirmed my original beliefs that shoe girl was in fact extremely attractive. About 15 minutes after getting in the pool another guest arrives; however, this guest is no ordinary guest. She is an ex-stripper who still likes to put on a show every now and then. It was at this point that the girls, all three of them, would participate in what was called “bras-off-o’clock.” It was at this point I finally got to lay eyes on her beautiful 34 C breasts; however, the pool water was around 60 degrees so nothing really happened down under.

At around 4 am people started to go to sleep in their respective rooms and it occurred to me that I was in fact trapped there for the night due to the fact that my driver was tipsy and that you do not walk around Home Park at night unless you want to die. Therefore I embraced this fact and we went to Fry’s room to go to sleep. Once arriving to Fry’s room, shoe girl communicated that she would be sleeping in the bed with Fry tonight while I would have to sleep on the floor. I was a little more than upset with these arrangements due to the fact that she had mentioned previously that Fry had tried to hook up with her but yet again being the giant pussy that I was said nothing. Normally you would expect that a host would offer their guest a pillow and/or a blanket yet I was offered nothing. I was stuck in the dog house. Having no pillow I came to the brilliant decision to use my shoes as a pillow. Thus the origin of the name shoe girl.

During the night it got below 60 degrees and I would therefore wake up from my discomfort of not having a blanket or a pillow around every 20 minutes or so; however, one time I was awaken not due to those conditions. It appears that during the night, because it was so cold, Fry and shoe girl decided to warm themselves up by having sex. Unaware that I was awake continued to warm themselves for about the next 20-25 minutes while I lay there not knowing what to do, shell shocked, and also speechless. Once morning arrived it was time for shoe girl to go to work and gave me a ride back to my room. After arriving back to my room she told me that she loved me and that wants to get together again soon. At this point I packed my shit and took the next flight back home.

Shoe girl to this date still will call me every now and then and tell me that she loves me not knowing what I had witnessed.

At this time I would like address a few things to a few people:

Stephen: I can see now why you broke up with her.

Fry: Sorry to disappoint you but she was faking it and your dick is not as big as you think.

Shoe girl: If you are going to say a name during sex make sure it’s the name of the person you are having sex with. His name is Fry not Ryan. On a positive note, you are still probably one of the most attractive female that I have ever seen. Congratulations on your engagement to a man who ironically has the same name as me. Perhaps in the future you, your fiancé, and I can get together and your fiancé and I could switch roles. At least that way if you yell out the wrong name, I would have come to expect it, but I don’t know if your fiancé would take a liking to that.

If the reddit community is interested I have many more stories that I can tell about real life events. Just let me know.

tl;dr: Hot girl says she loves but ends up having sex with another dude when she thought I was asleep in the same room.

xbm63,96,2012-07-28,"Got Robbed, requesting help: West Los Angeles, California (West LA Transit Center, Washington and Fairfax, 9:00 pm, 7/27/2012), Blizzard Entertainment Intern Messenger Bag and other mementos stolen",JadeEyePanda,LosAngeles,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/xbm63/got_robbed_requesting_help_west_los_angeles/,"I don't know what else I can do right now, but I'm praying this might help.  Please share this link if you think it's appropriate.


7/27/2012, approximately 9:00 pm @ the West LA Transit Center (Fairfax and Washington)
I was sitting on one of the bus benches, waiting for my particular Metro bus, coming back from my internship at the wonderful Reverge Labs LLC. Had my Intuos4 Tablet in a cardboard slip, and my Blizzard Entertainment Messenger bag on the floor right next to my feet. I was sketching away, most of my vision concentrating on drawing, until three early 20, late highschool black males walked past while also reaching down to grab my bag away. They started booking it up north on Fairfax avenue, I tried to give chase all the way to Apple, but I knew I wouldn't catch up since they had the surprise on their side. Called in 911, they took a report, and they'll do what they can, understandably, but that was at around 9:40 pm. From what I can remember, the person with the bag was in a maroon sweater, black hair, shortly cropped (not a buzz cut), and one of his other two friends had short dreadlocks and a dark navy blue jacket that night. Exclaimed something like ""Hey man, why are you chasing me? I didn't take your bag."" All of them fairly athletic build, like any decent track athlete or b-ball player. Besides that, no names, nothing. It all happened so fast, and I can't remember any particular facial features, etc.


This is going to be a long shot, and I don't know if the contents of the bag or the bag will end up on ebay or craiglist, or somewhere else anytime soon, but if anyone knows about where the stolen property might be, I'd be incredibly grateful.


Black Cloth Messenger Bag with ""Blizzard Entertainment 2011 Summer Intern"" woven on the front flap. One of the mementos of part of my career dreams, so it holds some importance to the child inside me.

== Contents include == 

-a black Micro B USB cable (Wacom), Intuos4 Grip Pen, Intuos4 Pen Well, Intuos4 Tablet Mouse

-blue pencil case with nondescript pencils, pens, etc in it. Rounded off corners, broken zipper seal, and a fake carbon fiber weave texture

-a black USB thumbdrive, forgot the brand/make &amp; gig size, but on the top it has a liquid crystal display showing Storage Size in 20% increments. Has a black cap.


That's about it. All in all, a loss of around $300 I would suspect (the bag is irreplaceable since they're not sold). My tablet's fine, but without the pen, USB cable, etc, I can't really help make games, do art for games, or maintain a livelihood in that sense. That and it was a gift from my already sacrificial-loving parents, and to all the other digital artists out there, you know how the tablets are priced. The Blizzard bag is and was a memento of a childhood dream half fulfilled when I had the opportunity to do Game Testing over there as a Freshman last year.


If ANYONE know where the stolen property might be and if they can get them back to me, I'd be grateful for your assistance and if the robbers are reading this, may I humbly ask that I just please get everything back? It's hard to lose stuff that has a lot to do with dreams.  Trying my best to forgive you guys, and it's not easy on my heart.

EDIT: I guess as a clear picture, if you do see the bag and/or persons.
--&gt; Call the cops immediately and give locations, descriptions, general direction of movement.   Take pictures if you can, video, even if low fidelity.

xbjvz,1,2012-07-28,question for APRNs/RNs: acupuncturist + nurse practitioner training?,acu_to_NP,nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/xbjvz/question_for_aprnsrns_acupuncturist_nurse/,"Hi there - long time reader, first time poster.  I made a novelty account for this purpose.  I have a career question.  I'm currently in graduate school for traditional Chinese medicine.  One earns an M.S., and then can sit for state/national board exams for a license to practice (the L.Ac).   After that, people typically go into private practice or join a pre-existing practice, or work at a hospital (this last category is pretty rare, but may be growing?)

We do at least 960 hours of clinical training during the 3.5 years it takes to earn the degree.   This involves working in student clinics under clinical supervision, seeing patients at progressively higher levels of autonomy.   We use various acupuncture techniques and Chinese herbal formulas, as well as give lifestyle/dietary advice.  Depending on the state we are in, we can be considered as primary care providers - which is a ton of responsibility.  

I personally don't feel that this is enough clinical experience.  Especially because, in the United States (where I'm located and where I plan to practice), patients will be coming to us as a 'last resort', with complicated conditions and presentations and will have already seen many providers before.  We do a few hundred hours of training in modern biomedicine, including anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology, diagnosis.  But it's basically a joke, compared to what RNs, MDs/DOs, etc. do.  We're expected to understand when we see certain serious conditions so that we can refer out.  

I think the amount of training that acupuncture students do allows for a lot of mediocrity in the field.   Which has a lot of ramifications, of course.  A way to get past this is to do a a ‘residency’ or internship with more senior practitioners.   Another problem is that a significant amount of people don’t have very good business skills, and running a small business eludes them.  It’s hard to get employment statistics for this field - the few that I’ve come across say something like 50-70% of L.Ac’s stop practicing within 5 years of earning the license. 

I do not want to become one of these people.  I love doing clinical medicine, and I see the benefits in our modern medical system.  The wisdom in the tradition I’m studying is also incredible, and I would love to combine the two, somehow.   FYI, I used to work as an EMT, so I have some experience in that field.  I’m really interested in primary care, and want to work in underserved/rural areas.   I would love to have a stable job.  The stability of acupuncture is unknown, as it can take a while to build a successful practice (if you build one at all).  

So, I’m considering enrolling in an entry-level NP program when I’m done in about a year, and I’m curious what people here think of this idea - how feasible does it sound to open up a practice (in a state where NPs can practice autonomously, for example), and do both traditional Chinese and contemporary medicine?  Does it seem like these could complement each other?   How possible would it be to see people in hospitals and refer them to my private practice, for example?  I’ve looked at doing an MD/DO or PA - but I really dig the nursing model, and it seems like the APRN really fills a huge hole that is developing in healthcare.  In addition to primary care, I'm also considering specialties in psych or occupational health, as these sound potentially synergistic as well.  

It would be cool to have a dialog about this.  I’m really keen on hearing what experienced people say.  

Thanks in advance for your comments!

TL; DR:  future-acupuncturist wants more clinical experience/confidence, is considering the NP route.  can these worlds be combined, for the betterment of society and for a stable job? "

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It was a hot day in Bangkok. The kind of hot that makes sweat run down every inch of your almost-completely-exposed skin; the kind of hot that makes it impossible to think of anything other than the next release –the next glass of ice water, the next plunge into an unheated pool. Austin was grateful that today was her day off; any other day and she would have had to walk to work, escaping into her building’s air conditioned lobby just as the sun was rising –the hours before daybreak her only defense against the blood-boiling heat. Even on her days off, it was impossible for Austin to sleep in past sunrise –not even her thick, dark blue curtains could keep the light and heat out, and every day she woke up drenched in sweat. A cold shower had helped her recover that morning, but the relief was only temporary; not two minutes after leaving the cool, white, tiled bathtub, she felt her body’s temperature begin rise again. After five, she began to sweat. By eight a.m., the heat in her apartment was unbearable. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When she had first gotten the internship offer, she had imagined herself in quaint cafés in the city’s center, drinking iced coffee, perfectly styled and made-up, nonchalantly reading all of those books she had never gotten around to. She had done this a few times, but the romance was somewhat diminished by the pit-stains on her flowing tops and now, in the hottest part of summer, she favored the privacy of her building’s small garden –the freedom to wear as little clothing as possible, free from the shameless eyes of the local old men. She technically shared the garden with the three other apartments in her building, but she had never seen anyone else out there, and she had a feeling that aside from her, the garden went largely unappreciated. Its ground was covered in unkempt grass, and small, white flowers peaked out from the cracks in the old stone wall. Austin didn’t know much about her neighbors; she occasionally saw the other tenants, mostly college-aged locals, in the evenings on her way back from work, but had never exchanged more than a short greeting with any of them. After six weeks here, and with no previous knowledge of the language, Austin was just beginning to grasp some simple Thai phrases. She had been able to navigate most of the city with only English, but had gone through great lengths to avoid conversations with the natives. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Austin stepped out into the abandoned garden, water bottle and book in hand, and adjusted the reclining lawn chair to maximize the small remaining patch of shade. She straightened out the beach towel covering the smoldering plastic and carefully laid back. Wearing only tiny jean shorts and a white bikini top, Austin surrendered to the heat. She stretched her tan arms, reaching up towards the cloudless sky, and sighed. Hands back at her sides, she admired the beautiful body in front of her; still soft and sensual, her stomach and legs were showing the positive effects of summer. She hadn’t bothered to look for a gym in Thailand, and running outside in this weather was out of the question, but Austin had never walked so much in her entire life, and her toned tummy glistened in the sun, a bead of sweat trickling downhill towards her bellybutton. If only she had someone with whom to share this new body, she thought, as she picked up her wilted, sun-bleached paperback and flipped to the most recently dog-eared page. For two hours straight, Austin read, pausing only for giant gulps from her bottle and to wipe her damp, strawberry-blonde bangs from her face. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She was captivated by the story she was reading, surprised that the novel, an undisputed classic, could still feel so contemporary and relevant. More so, she was amused to find that, within its long, complicated, plot, lay several explicit sexual encounters –encounters that, far from the modern world of films and pornography, were astoundingly erotic and sexy in their authenticity. Austin could picture the scenes perfectly in her head –the dark, handsome protagonist both pleasuring and being pleasured by the various femme fatale he met on his travels –and Austin’s longing for someone’s touch only intensified. Knowing she was alone, Austin undid the top-button of her shorts with one swift movement, pulled down the scorching, metal zipper, and slid her left hand down between her legs, the slick material of her bikini bottom the only barrier between her and her comparatively pale vulva. There, she paused, enjoying the simplicity of the slight pressure, and lightly began to rub, tickling her clit through the thick material. She closed her eyes slowly, letting her mind run free. Austin knew exactly the pace and pressure that would bring her to climax, but there was no reason to hurry. Pushing aside the material of her bikini bottoms, she slowly explored every inch of her cunt; tugging lightly on her small strip of hair, playing with her delicate folds, occasionally brushing against her soft clit, teasing herself. Soon she felt that familiar urge –the urge to be touched inside, the urge to be filled. Without hesitation, Austin let her hand sink further down between her legs, gently pressing her middle finger against her increasingly wet hole. She increased the pressure, her finger soon overcoming her vagina’s slight resistance, her long finger plunging into her tight, warm pussy. Bending her finger upwards towards her belly-button, Austin found that awesome ridged inch and began to rub –back and forth, alternating pressure, pressing hard against her soft g-spot. 


Suddenly, the dead quiet of the garden was interrupted...

BACKSTORY

Me (f, 24) and A (m, 24) started off as friends over a year ago.  That quickly transformed into a friends-with-benefits situation that we both loved and were having fun with.  Sex, sex, flirting, partying, sex, all that stuff, but technically we were still single and we talked a lot about how we liked it that way.  We have a lot of the same friends, we hang out all the time.

Over time things became more intimate, feelings grew, and we realised what we really had was more similar to an ""open relationship"" (though I don't really love using that term).  We were both fine with that, and every month or so had a conversation to make sure we were both okay with the situation.  Some rules were established (for example, we don't need to tell the other person if anything happens with someone else, unless it's sex, because at that point health is involved.  Another is that if the other person is present, we're with them.  Not trying to get with someone else.).  Over the course of the first 7 months or so, when we started to have this agreement, **neither of us acted on it**.  Neither one of us has so much as kissed someone else this entire time.  So naturally when we've been having these conversations there has always been an understanding that neither of us is 100% sure of how we would feel or act, but ideally both of us would *like* to be okay with it, so we would *try* to be okay with it.  But in the end it would probably be case-by-case, and we both reserved the right to re-assess the situation if we had issues with it.  The main rule was that we had to be honest with each other about our feelings and our desires.

Over the last 3 months or so things have been getting more serious between us.  We're being treated more like a ""couple"" by our friends, and we're acting that way too. But I have enjoyed the way our relationship has been.  Not so much because I can go sleep around or even make out with other people (I have no urge to) but because I'm a social person, I like to flirt, and there's a part of me that really likes that when I say ""I have a boyfriend"", it is entirely up to me to say that.  It is not because I feel an obligation to say so, it is because *I want to*. 

Moving on...

THE EVENTS

At the beginning of the summer I had a temporary internship that lasted about 2 months.  It was a particularly unusual opportunity a lot of people in my field would love to have, and I, along with the 20-or-so other interns that got the job, was really excited.  During the internship, I developed close friendships with 3 people, there were about another 3 or 4 people I could see myself developing close friendships with, and the rest were all people I would at least like to keep in touch with.  I should mention the 3 people I developed close friendships with I sort of knew from before the internship, through working with them in the past.

Jump to the end of the internship.  One of these close friends, J (m, 24) has a party to celebrate.  There's a lot of booze going around.  My boyfriend, A, is busy that night but says he might come by later. People are doing a lot of shots and I end up getting really drunk, along with everyone else.  I've been texting A a bunch, trying to get him to come, and also telling my new friends how great he is, and how we're just newly acknowledging that our relationship is more serious than we had thought at first.  There's a lot of chatting about the other interns and it is revealed J has been having a bit of a romance with one of the girls.  So they're kissing a bit and it's all fun and drunken and good.

More shots.  Eventually A comes but really he's just coming to pick me up because now I'm more drunk than I have been in a looong time.  This is where things get a little hairy.  

Me and A wake up the next morning at his place.  I'm pretty hungover.  I don't remember leaving J's party.  I was too drunk.  I'm regretting it.  When A realises I don't remember, he seems irritated and reveals that something happened last night, and he spent a good portion of the night trying to sleep on the couch but thinking about our relationship.  He tells me that when he got to J's, I was more drunk than he's ever seen me (I agree).  And finally, apparently when we were leaving, J (who A has met a couple times before but doesn't know that well) made a move to kiss me, on my mouth, while A was standing right there.  And apparently I made no effort to stop it.  A ended up shoving J, no kissing occurred, and we left.

This event, which my immediate reaction was to think, ""no big deal"", led A to spend the evening tossing and turning, wondering if I had feelings for J, wanting to go back and fight J, wondering if something had been going on with J for a while.

I apologized to A for my drunkenness, and felt terrible that this happened right in front of him.  Obviously that is a major insult.  I also *really* wished I hadn't blanked on the events in my mind.  

But in all honesty I didn't think J kissing me was that big of a deal (especially since as far as I am concerned, J and I are totally platonic.  Even if he were to have feelings for me of some sort, which I don't think he does, they're feelings that I would squash if it got to a point where I felt like he was changing our friendship in any way).  Sometimes parties get a little affectionate (A and I have been to parties like this in the past, he is no stranger) and it is just friendly.  Also, I was not the person that initiated anything.  Like I say, this is the first time in about 7 months that any form of kissing with other people has taken place.

J also texted me the following day apologizing to me and apologizing to A, and I texted him back just saying that what he had done wasn't okay but I accept his apology.

So, (and I'm trying to wrap this up a little and get to the point) now A hates J.  After this series of events we had many big conversations and eventually it was concluded that an open relationship isn't for us and that we would now be ""closed"".  I however, was not willing to break off ties with J entirely.  I like the guy, and I really *don't* like who I associate myself with to be based on my boyfriend.  A feels that I should just not want to hang out with J of my own volition, because of what happened.

Jump forward about 2 weeks.  J has texted me asking if I want to go see a movie premiere with him and the other 2 close friends from the internship.  I haven't seen them or talked to them since the party (despite being invited to a couple social events).  I feel like the air has cooled a bit, so I accept.  No harm in a movie right? 

That night me and A are going to sleep and I tell him that I'm going, and I say I know he's not going to like it, but I hope he's okay with it and I think he should know.  (To my surprise) it is a big deal, he does not agree with me going, but doesn't want to dictate my actions.  He feels that I don't understand his hurt if I am choosing to go to this movie.  Another couple of big conversations and I end up cancelling the movie plans a few days later.  Not because A demanded that I do so, but because I realise our relationship is obviously still having issues in that area so it is a higher priority to me that that be worked out.  A is happy to know that I cancelled, and immediately things are totally fine again. 

THE MAIN ISSUE:

So now I don't really know what to do.  It's been about another 2 weeks since the movie thing.  I lied to J about why I couldn't go.  I haven't spoken to him since then, and as a result haven't spoken to most of the other interns either because the main way I socialize with them is in groups, and J is almost always there.  He is having another party on Friday, and I would like to go.  Not just because I don't want to completely destroy my friendship with him, but also because I want to see the other people that will be there.

However, I don't want to go if I'm going to feel really guilty for going.  I also don't want to go if I invite A, and he comes, and he just ends up miserable because he has such strong dislike for J. 

So, Reddit, what do you think? Am I being selfish?  How should I tackle this party situation; should I keep J in my life or is it a reasonable sacrifice to cut him off in order to keep my boyfriend happy?  If I do, how should I communicate this to J?  Really any comments you have will give me some perspective.

Thanks!

**TL;DR**
Was in a sort-of ""open"" relationship with BF.  Got too drunk, a male friend tried to kiss me when BF was standing right there.  BF was insulted but also realised we can't be open.  Fine with me, now we are just normal and ""closed"", but I don't really want to break off ties with the friend because the kiss was not a big issue to me.  BF thinks otherwise and this is a problem."

Before everyone says ""read the sidebar!"" I did that and didn't quite find what I was looking for, so here it goes.

I really enjoy living in a city. I love the atmosphere, the people, the craziness, and the lights and crowds. I'm talking ""a few blocks from Times Square."" However, I also love the SF weather, the nicer people here, and the awesome culture. I know SF has a lot to offer, but since I've only been there a few times, it's tough to scope out the best place in which I'd like to live.

I know about the rent. I have a decent enough offer out of college to handle that and I'd probably find roommates so anything under $2000 a month is fine.

What I'm looking for is a place in the middle of it all. I want to be steps away from great restaurants, bars, and quaint coffee shops. I want to be where things are happening. I've seen tons of people talking about the Mission, but everytime I've been there, it seems so distant from the actual ""city part"" of the city. The financial district / Tenderloin seems more what I'm looking for, but I keep hearing that Tenderloin is a really dangerous place (which I'm trying to understand because it looks very bustling).

Anyway, sorry for the random sounding request, but I'm looking for some advice and I really want a great place that's going to keep my mind from wandering back to New York City.

It comes up basically whenever I leave the house and bump into family acquaintances or friendly strangers. They’re always well-meaning so I’d feel awful if I was catty to them, but every time is another blow to my self-esteem, and it really happens constantly. Just this past few months I’ve had people offer me 12 and under discounts, I’ve had someone try to introduce me to his 10 year old daughter (hoping we could play together), and I hit a dreaded triple whammy… when someone asks what grade I’m in, I tell them I’m a junior, and when they (already incredulously) ask at what high school I have to tell them that I’m a junior in college.

The worst part is that though it’s only an eight year difference, it is the difference between an adult and a prepubescent girl. If I were 30 and getting mistaken for a 22 year old I’d probably feel a lot better about it, but right now it’s a constant reminder that I look like a kid. It’s really hard to feel self-confident and attractive when, as a friend of mine once told me “anyone that is attracted to you without really getting to know you first is basically a pedophile”.

I’m especially worried about it because I’m in school for mechanical engineering, which is of course a totally male dominated profession. At my last internship I was really only given filing work and often no work at all, and I can’t help thinking that it’s because many of the folks at the office saw me as totally young and incapable. I’m really terrified about this because even though I know I’m a good engineer, I feel like no one will take me seriously, making interviews more difficult, and I’m worried they’ll pigeonhole me right away when I get new jobs (making it hard to prove my capability and move forward).

Needless to say, I’m sick of all this and I don’t know how to deal with any of it. I don’t know how to respond to these people and I don’t know how to make myself look older. I’m 5’2”, 110 lbs, and I have a seriously young looking face. (Pics for context: http://imgur.com/a/e4ea6) I grew up awkward and nerdy and never learned how to dress for my body type or apply makeup. I’m also way overdue for a haircut and new eyewear, so if anyone has advice, feel free.

I’ m sure other women out there have this problem, so what do you do about it? Needless to say I have tons of horror stories (once my boyfriend, with his arm around my waist, introduced me to his friends…. Only for them to ask if I was his kid sister), so who else wants to share theirs?

**TL;DR: I am 20 but the first impression I give people is that I’m prepubescent, and it sucks. Tell me your “people think I’m way younger than I am” horror stories and also feel free to teach me how to clothe myself.**

On the night before my graduation this past May, my father left a voicemail ""disowning"" me and telling me that he doesn't care if I'm dead or alive. It's abusive, to say the least.

I've been living at home for the summer, in a guest room, tolerating this for the past two months after graduating college. I've also been working remotely, and making money to support basic things for myself financially. I've signed a lease that starts on August 20th. About $150,000 in student loans begin the same day. Where my parents offer to make themselves available to help, they revoke their offer from one day to the next and hold it over my head in a very manipulative way. Because I don't have a license, the $700+ to pay professional movers, or friends who are available to help on moving day, I'm not sure what to do. I've got about 8-10 medium sized boxes to move, and not much else besides that. I'm scared that I'll miss the boat on something I want so badly.

I'm considering bargaining with movers next, and agreeing to pay them once I get to D.C. (and have access to the disbursed loans, even if it eats into my budget). Other than that, do you have any suggestions for what I can possibly do to get unstuck and moved on with (no pun intended) my life? 



Sincerely,

Stressed Like Sisyphus "
xef0c,1,2012-07-30,Had no idea there was a subreddit for this..well here it goes.,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/xef0c/had_no_idea_there_was_a_subreddit_for_thiswell/,"A couple months ago I was on the top of the world. I was about to graduate, had a good internship lined up, had a beautiful girlfriend. Everything soon changed. My girlfriend of a year and a half broke up with me two days after college graduation. It was completely out of the blue. She told me she had been feeling unhappy for awhile, but how could I know as she never told me? She never expressed discontent and never talked to me about it. I was naturally very confused, upset, and pissed off. This was all after I gave her most of my stuff from my house so that she could have it for her apartment at school next year, even had my brother drive two hours in his truck to help me move it there. She also attended my college graduation, if she didn't want to be with me all that time, why did she do those things? I felt very used. We meet the next day for coffee where she proceeds to tell me she doesnt love me anymore. But how does one fall out of love overnight? Pretty hurtful thing to say. Makes me think she doesn't know what love is, as I am her longest relationship and me being 23 and her being 19 (soon to be 20).
Fast forward to a week after the breakup. We hadn't talked or anything but I knew she went to visit our school take her mind off of things. Whats funny is that she all of a sudden became best friends with people of whom I introduced her to. These people were my coworkers and their assorted gfs and friends. I am on facebook. I soon see pictures posted by my buddies gf, in each one her standing next to a certain kid. I freaked, thought fersure something was going to happen between them. Most of the people I talked to about it just said it was coincidence, but I knew. I texted her the next day and said we should talk. 
She comes over and we talk in my car. I tell her about the crazy thought I had, laugh it off as if its rediculous. It turns out I was quite right. She fucked the kid. I go nuts, we had been broken up just under a week and she goes and fucks someone else. Immature little girl. Somehow we get through the conversation, somehow she ends up sleeping over, somehow I'm the one trying to make her feel better after I've made her feel like shit, somehow we have sex. We decide we are going to hangout everynow and then as we were/are bestfriends. I tell her idk if I'll feel the same when we wake up.
Now for some backstory. I went through so much drama and what not because of this girl. Not that she didn't for me or anything but still. I beefed/lost friends because I decided to be with her, yet I stood by her side. Also, she basically ended up living with me the entire relationship. My first roomate didnt care, but the next two did. These kids were really good friends of mine, and one day sat me down to tell me how they didnt like my gf and all this dumb shit. I still told them to fuck off and stood by her. I spent nearly every moment I could with her, not that I necessarily wanted to. Everytime I wanted to do something by myself or hang out with the guys she made a big deal out of it, it was rediculous. She at the time, didnt have many friends, yet I still gave in most of the time and hung out with her.
Back to the present now, we see each other 2 to 3 times a week, she sleeps over at my parents house, we go on dates, have sex, and all that. Things do not seem very different from when we were dating. Yet she is two different people. She states that she doesnt know what she wants. Sometimes she will be very cute and sappy with me, tells me she loves me, misses us, and other times she will be very cold and tell me she doesnt want to get back together. I often get very frustrated and worked up about it all. To the point where I tell her I can't do it anymore, and she wont let me go. Says shes not ready to let me go. 
Point is, I am still in same position. I want to get back with her, but shes so indecisive and two sided she cant make up her mind. I have no idea what to do because I am too sometimes. Sometimes I want to tell her to fuck off and move on while others I want soo badly to be back with her. We still have sex and tell each other we love each other. She still continues to hangout with pretty much my friends. I originally had planned on moving in with her to her apartment next year for a semester. Now those plans are fucked. She is even going on a vacation with some people that I know (including dude she fucked), of whom she claims was a mistake and nothing is gonna happen. I just need to know what to do. I moved back to my parents this summer specifically to be with her. I have no friends here as I am not from here therefore I have no one to talk to about it. Please reddit, any advice?"

xeaoz,1,2012-07-30,Happy without friends? (xpost relationships) ,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xeaoz/happy_without_friends_xpost_relationships/,"I am a 24 year old female and have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (26) for the last 2.5 years. Throughout my life I have always had a best friend, one person that I did almost everything with and was always extremely close with. I had a best friend growing up through high school (who I am still somewhat close with but she lives quite far away so I only see her 1-2 times a year) and then a best friend through college. On top of these best friends I have usually had a pretty standard group of regular friends to go out with etc. Since I started dating my current boyfriend I have lost most of my friendships just due to me not really spending any time with my previous friends.

I know this sounds terrible but please let me explain. Around the time I met my boyfriend I had been graduated from college for about 9 months and had no luck finding a job. I was essentially doing nothing productive with my life and just drinking and going out a lot with my friends. I wasn’t happy with how my life was going but I felt really helpless with the job situation so being around my friends and drinking/smoking just made me feel a lot better, not as lonely. When I met my boyfriend I was feeling pretty bad about my life in general. He was so on track, he had a job and was getting his masters degree. We started casually dating (we were long distance so we would see each other every other weekend or so) and he just seemed so motivated that he made me want to get my shit together. I finally worked on getting a job (not a real career job but something to do and feel like I am making some of my own money). A couple months in to us dating I asked where we were headed with out relationship, he told me he needed me to be more serious about my life (and quit smoking weed) before he could seriously date me. Well, that did it for me. I got more serious about looking for a job, quit smoking and started to make some real moves towards a real life. We started dating seriously and I eventually go accepted into an internship near where he lived. My lease was up where I was living so we decided to move in together (this is all about 9-10 months after we met).

This is the point where I really lost my friends. I moved in with my boyfriend and even though I had friends from college who lived not too far away from where I relocated to I just did not have any interest in hanging out with them. The few times I did I saw myself kind of slipping back into my old habits and even though I am now at a point where I have a very successful career and feel accomplished, I am scared of falling back into the person I was before and losing all the forward momentum I have gained. My boyfriend is somewhat of an introverted person and just never really had a ton of friends, he pretty much hangs out with his brother occasionally and that’s about it. I feel completely fulfilled when we just hang out together and I just don’t feel the need to seek out my friends or find new ones. We have been spending (almost) all our time together (except when we are at work) for almost 2 years now and I am happier than I was when I did have a big group of friends. While we do fight sometimes (of course) it does not seem to be anything outside the realm of any other relationship and we are both perfectly happy staying at home most weekends or going on little trips, neither of us feels the need to go out and be super social.

Before I met my boyfriend I was always someone who had lots of friends and loved being social but it seems as though my priorities have done a 180. I always see in any type of relationship advice that couples need to spend time apart and have friendships outside of their relationship (and I was always a big advocate of this pre my current relationship), is this always the case? Is it possible to have a happy and healthy relationship without spending time away from each other with friends? It just seems like we are breaking one of the biggest relationship rules I seem to see and it doesn’t seem to be causing us any problems at all."

I've been reading the posts and have an idea of what to do to help my chances, but would like some advice on how to do it and if there was more I could to help my chances.

Some background on me:

- Graduated from a state school with an average reputation
- 3.92 GPA
- Math and English major
- Never took probability or statistics class
- Took one online finance class (got an A- but don't think I actually ""learned"" the material)
- Just passed P last weekend on my first try 
- Have taken classes that have used Matlab and Maple, but I never really got a lot of direction on how to use it and never felt particularly competent. 
- I know excel decently, but nothing too in depth, but can usually teach myself from online tutorials
- Don't have internship experience
- I am currently working as a claims representative at a company that works for hospitals in order to get bills processed through insurance companies.
- Variety of unrelated experience: tutoring (college tutoring center and in home tutoring through a tutoring service), TA'd a Psychology course, worked in retail, and served at a restaurant. This list is all the work experience I've had since age 16 pretty much.

What I plan to do:

1. Start studying for FM
2. Take FM in Dec or in Feb if I fail
3. Start studying for either MFE or C for either June or July
4. Learn some programming/excel skills
5. Once I pass MFE or C then start sending resumes out and call in my favors (a relative works for an insurance company but not in actuarial dept and a friend of the family worked two years as an actuary at an insurance companies). Not exactly anything that makes me a shoe in or anything, but definitely could at least get my resume looked at. 

I just have a few questions:

1. What are my chances of ever even finding work as an actuary?

2. Anything I should add to my plan to better my chances?

3. Which is a better choice after FM, MFE or C?

4. What is the best way to learn a programming language/advanced excel skills? I would really prefer not to have to pay for a college course, but if many of you feel it's the only way to learn then I'll do that. Which programming languages will be most useful and attractive to employers? Is there a way to make learning programming less daunting? I have looked a little into programming (nothing at the level of a course on it), but whenever I do it seems so daunting and overwhelming that I feel like I wouldn't be able to pick it up. Once you start learning, does it get less intimidating?


5. For those of you who do tutoring on the side or while looking for work, is freelancing or going through a company better? Right now I make about 24 an hour for tutoring and the company has a pretty easy time finding students. Is there more money to be made just posting an ad on Craigslist? 

TL;DR, Looking for career advice. If you could give me any help one any or all of my questions, I would really appreciate it. Thank you!

xdle7,10,2012-07-30,My friend has been acting very weird lately and no one knows what is wrong with him. Can someone with a knowledge of mental health give me some insight on what could be happening?,throwawaybootymeat,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xdle7/my_friend_has_been_acting_very_weird_lately_and/,"Sorry for the vague title, but I didn't really know how to word what is going on. This is going to be a pretty long post, but I would love some insight as to what might be going on.


So this guy has been my friend since preschool. He has always been well liked, fun to be around, and just an all around good guy. He comes from a good home, got good grades, was good at sports, and seemed to be doing perfectly fine until now. He is 22 and in college, and some very odd things have been happening lately. Me and my friends have been racking our brains trying to figure it out, but it is just too strange to figure out.


I will start in December which is the last time I saw him functioning normally. He was doing very well in school and didn't seem like there was anything bugging him. He partied quite often but it didn't interfere with school at all. Where things start getting odd is around spring break. On the first night around 5, he got drunk and managed to get separated from everyone, and misplaced his phone. No one heard from him until the next afternoon. It looked like something was bothering him and everyone was wondering what it is. He said that he cleaned his bank account out at a strip club (which is true), and then some people let him sleep at their place that night (unconfirmed). After that night, he was still functioning somewhat normally, but still seemed like something was bugging him. He was in this state for about a month and a half, but then things got a lot worse. 

Around the end of the school year, he just seemed brain dead. He would hardly talk, he would stare off into space, and he was extremely anti-social. We would go out to eat, and he would sit at the table and not say anything, and would randomly walk to bar and sit down and not order anything. He would just stare at the tv. And I'm telling you, he used to be the most outgoing and social person I have ever met. But he just became detached from reality. 


When the school year ended, he began a new internship out of state. No one was really in contact with him, except for one mutual acquaintance from high school that was doing an internship at the same place. This girl did not know my friend, but she knew of him and knew who he hung out with. She called me and a couple of my other friends and asked what was wrong with him, because he seemed like he was just ""not all there."" At this point, me and my other friends have talked to our parents asking for advice, and they all suggested we talk to this guy's parents. We took their advice, and they said they had noticed some things too. We left, and within the next hour or so, this guy called his parent's and told them that he was detoxing from painkillers, relapsed, and needed to go to rehab. 


His parents flew to the place he was working and took him to the hospital. At the hospital, they gave him a blood test and a urine test. Both came back negative. They did the test again and got the same results. This was peculiar, but they still checked him into rehab anyways. 


A little over a week into rehab, his parents got a call from the treatment center he was at. They said that he went out for a walk by himself, and came back all cut up and bruised. When they asked him what happened, he told them that he took a large dose of benzos and fell into a bush. The treatment center was baffled that he was able to get drugs in there, and they wanted to see if he brought any other drugs with him. They gave him a hair follicle test, which can detect any drug use in the last 90 days. When they read the results, they were shocked to see that the results came back negative for every single drug they tested for. That is where this is at now. His parents are confused, me and my friends are trying to put the pieces together to have some sort of clarity. What we think is going on is that he has a very deep, dark secret that has been eating at him for a while, and he just completely lost it. So anyone have any idea what could be wrong with him? 


**TL;DR- Friend of mine who used to be very social has become quiet, distant, and seemingly brain dead. It kept getting worse and worse until he claimed to have a drug problem and needed to go to rehab. In rehab, they drug tested him and showed no signs of any drug use in the last 90 days.**

I'll be graduating with a degree in Chemical Engineering this upcoming spring semester. While I had dreams of going to graduate school in Biomedical Engineering, my family's been going through a bit of a rough patch so I've decided to pick up an entyr level engineering position instead and help out in any way I can. The problem here is that I'm an international student.

Up to this point, I have one internship experience (abroad unfortunately) and I'll have about 2.5 years of research experience and a publication under my belt (hopefully, depending on how well this semester works out as far as the project I'm working on goes). While I'll have incredible letters of recommendation, my gpa isn't good (3.3) because of some poor lifestyle choices my sophomore year (namely activities involving leaves). Unfortunately as far as all of this is concerned it seems only important for graduate school and doesn't seem particularly helpful as far as getting a job goes.

While I'm aware of everything I need to do as far as getting a job goes (throwing my resume everywhere, going to job fairs, looking online on cragslist, indeed and monster) does anyone know how difficult it is to get into the job market right now as an international student, especially one with a gpa like mine? There are significantly less employers looking for me unfortunately as an international student. I don't think I would have had a problem searching for a job had I been a US citizen but if there are any international students on here who can help point me in the right direction as far as how to get my foot in the door, I'd really appreciate some help."

I'm reaching out to all of you today because the reality of my situation just hit me, and I'm on the verge of a full-blown panic attack. 

I'm 27, and I work as an intern architect. I make $20 an hour and just can't make ends meet anymore. Here's why:

When I was in college, I stupidly took on heaps of credit card debt on top of student loans. After two years of being unemployed, my finances spiraled out of control and now I can't keep my head above water. I had to rack up more debt to keep myself alive, and now I'm paying for it. I've had to borrow money from friends and family to pay rent/eat/seek medical care, and my inability to pay anyone back has alienated me and I can't get financial help anywhere.

I've been doing my best to track my expenses, and here's what I've got:

Rent: $965
Health Insurance: $215 + $183 for necessary meds
Private Loan: $202
Federal Loan: $165
Credit Cards: $320
Cell Phone: $94
Utilities: $133
Groceries: $200
Public Transportation: $86

Total Expenditures: $2563.00
Monthly Pay: $2432.00

I spend more than I make, and I don't know what to trim. Please help me figure this out.

EDIT: I'm completely floored by the response this has generated. Thank you all so much! 

Per your suggestions, I'm switching to Virgin Mobile for the $35 fee, calling today to get my student loans deferred, and looking into moving to reduce my living expenses! Thanks so much for all of your advice!

xd7fp,9,2012-07-29,Law Student to CS Major? ,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xd7fp/law_student_to_cs_major/,"I'm a 24 year old law student attending a solid school just outside the T14. My grades are above the median, which puts me in a good (not great) place for landing interviews later on. I am currently taking a leave of absence from school to make sure law is for me. I got an unpaid six-month internship at a small law firm doing mostly paralegal work. I hate it. I've disliked studying law my entire first year at school, and now I realize I dislike practicing. It's not that it's too difficult - I just don't enjoy it. I tell myself that if I could do it all over again, I'd go into computer science. The idea of coding and creating a program from nothing appeals to me. Plus, there's a better market for CS grads than JDs. 
Problem is, I've never taken any real math courses in college. I've never taken a programming class. I'll probably need to audit some courses at a community college in basic programming to make sure it's for me. 
My question for you, members of this sub, is this: if I find out I like it, what should my next steps be? I have $40k in debt from my first year of law school and no background in math. Should I go back to school for a BS in Comp Sci? Should I start with an Associate's from a community college? Full time or part time? I'm single with no real obligations other than my debt. Are there any other options for someone in my position who wants to program someday? 
Finally, if I do go back to school, I'm torn between Boston (where I go to law school), Chicago (my friends/family), and Los Angeles (some family/where I'm working now at the unpaid internship). From an employment standpoint, which of these three is the best? Or is that even the right question to ask?
Thanks, all. I could really use some direction. "

the contest ends in another 9 hours, let's help antoine win this bike!

edit: here is the latest from antoine's facebook page:

The story goes like this I first met a Lynskey CX frame Angry Catfish Bicycle and Coffee Bar and attempted to negotiate a price equal to more than 10% of my annual income, nice fellows but also competent in math so they politely declined. So I did what any bike struck Lynskey fan does, I called them to ask about layaway and discounts on past models, and I joined their FB page. For weeks I enjoyed the Lynskey FB friends banter and drooled over their fan photos, admittedly at times I was even envious. I was curious about my chances for finding a frame on craigslist, so I called Lynskey to find out how many Cooper CX bicycles they produced in 2011 (it was less than 300), that day was July 12th moments later I noted on their web page a link to win a Cooper CX... 
The competitor had a 2 week head start and lulled at 169 votes. Since I joined the race he's mounted his bike again and has been drafting off of me. We are approaching 1,000 likes, my lead was 200 yesterday, a false finish revealed that he's holding reserves for the final push. The finish line is now June 1st, it will be noon in his home country and 5 AM here in MN, so please help me sprint to a lead of at least 400 likes tonight by messaging friends with this link: http://www.facebook.com/lynskeyperformance/posts/346794778729064 

On another note the other rider seems like a really nice guy who travels around with an under-appreciated blog. If he wins he promises to dedicate his next blog as he rides around NZ to a nonprofit. His blog mentioned that he broke a Lynskey Mt Bike frame in a race so he must be a fellow avid cyclist ergo a good fellow. His link (the link of my competition) if you should so decide to like it is: http://www.facebook.com/lynskeyperformance/posts/299045600192076 Note he is not related to Lynskey purveyors of fine bicycles despite his last name."

xgmso,5,2012-07-31,Three weeks in...,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/xgmso/three_weeks_in/,"After three weeks of not masturbating or watching porn I've experienced the following.

I'm calmer now, I feel like I've got a good argumentation for doing this, while before I was a bit unsure whether it was a good thing to try and I just felt bad every time I masturbated. I feel like I've received a cognitive sediment.

The first two weeks I didn't really experience any physiological changes. I just paid more attention to my body in terms of fatigue and making sure I slept enough. The third week I started feeling some itching down there, I got the feeling that my penis was getting bored (it actually itches hehe). I discovered the IAMA reddits from pornstars and I started reading every one of them. This really allowed me to put porn into context and increase my respect for pornstars. I especially like the testimonies about sex in personal relationships (both from male and female pornstars, and their partners). That world is much less promiscuous then I had expected and many actors appear to treat it very professional. It helped me because I was able to dissociate these women's acting on screen from how they truly are. I also discovered what pron lacked and why I would never find it in there, as much as I would like to. Although I took a risk here (could've turned me into smiley like snap) it really helped me view porn for what it is, and clearly dissociate it from what I want!

I don't know what will happen in the coming days and weeks, but I welcome it. I also started talking to this girl who was my intern for a while, and with whom I never felt so comfortable. Even though she's got a boyfriend I really don't care about that, she'll just have to turn me down. I don't think I would've ever tackled such a situation like this in the past. Must be more self-confidence...   "

xgg92,0,2012-07-31,"The well has run dry, Dear Eliza, Eliza! (Where are the jobs, employers?)",MrHacks,stljobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/stljobs/comments/xgg92/the_well_has_run_dry_dear_eliza_eliza_where_are/,"The title comes from an old children's song from my youth.

At any rate, despite the deluge of the weekly traveling carnivals this month (especially Dice and MBE), the well really has run dry.  It's even worse if you are part of a job development program where you are by contract suppost to come up with at least three job leads per week.

You know things are getting really bad when you go to your preferred job category on Craigslist and seeing as how today is July 31st, there are still jobs from earily June and Late May on the first page.

Local employers need to know that posting a job lead on Craigslist is FREE in the St. Louis market.  In places like New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Chicago, there is a fee. But in smaller markets like St. Louis, employers are not charged anything.

I'm verily disgusted at this point as to the amount of internships being posted on SimplyHired, CareerBuilder, Monster, and all the other sites Indeed.com aggregates jobs from.  I mean, really?

Companies have dropped the ball here. There's a hurry-up-and-wait attitude going on where they want EXPERIENCED interns. ""We want someone with 5+ years experience. We're not going to pay them anything. We're not going to train them, they'll have to pay for that. We're not going to hire them until they pay for training at which afterwards we'll be wishy-washy about hiring new applicants.""  These are the jobs you neec to stay away from.

If employers aren't committed to hire anyone and the job developer is breathing down your neck to coerce you to work at a McJob when you are trying to move on to the next step after college, it really really isn't you.

Unless you had plans on a corner office in Malibu and making millions of dollars per minute (which if you are, post some jobs and share the wealth), you probably have some reasonable expectations.  Those just be having a steady job that pays the bills and feeds the kids.

Right now, the job market is an arid wasteland.

I don't know, perhaps we need to start shaking down companies for jobs, especially the ones that promise jobs on their website when your goal at the job fair is to find work on the spot, especially after getting all dressed up in clothes you can't afford, finding a printer cartridge you can't afford for a printer that probably doesn't work, to meet some folks who are not committed to meeting you after driving in the car you are barely making payments on.

As unemployed people, we must take a stand at this point. We can't wait for someone to start hiring after the next presidential election and we sure as hell won't stand for people who stop hiring over a healthcare bill or some other law or regulation that ensures employers get off their asses and hire someone.

If employers want to play politics with jobs, they should quit the business they are doing (and we do mean quit, non of this Romney ""emeritus"" crap, I mean put the company out of business) and run for Congress.  Eventually they'll learn a hard lesson that they may be a great business person but they don't know a damn thing about how to represent people in a government.  So go ahead and get it out of your system, all the John Brunners, David Spences, and especially ED MARTINS.

When the election is over for you and your unemployed, we're not going to let you take your job back until we see you eat some crow and call people in for job interviews.

The well has run dry. The summer is getting too hot. And the unemployed are really thirsty and tired of being offered water from the toilet.

Let's tell these guys at the job fair on Friday that TOMORROW IS TOO LATE!

I'm thinking of calling for a sitdown strike at the convention center for everyone who leaves empty handed and has not found work within the past month.  It's time to get the attention of the employers. "

xgcai,1,2012-07-31,New Job,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/xgcai/new_job/,"I am starting my first job at 55k a year. 
My job is 10min away from my parents house.
I am allowed to live in my parents house for 2 years while I make some money. 

**Current Status**

 * I have no debt 
 * receiving ~6.5k$ from my parents 
 * I have had a credit card for 1 year and paid it off each month only going to ~1/3 of its limit each month.
 * Have used car that is completely paid for  
 * On parents health insurance till 26(I have to pay the deductibles)

**Expenses if live with parents**

* 1/3 of the utilities 
* 1/3 of the groceries my parents buy(this is what I will be eating)
* Car insurance &amp; gas
* 1/4 of the phone bill(on family plan)


I might get another job offer where my gf goes school for ~75k. This job is in the city so a higher cost of living.  I would be able to live in my gf's apartment till December(when she graduates) for $242 rent plus 1/4 utilities. My gf has ~$10k in student loans that her parents said they were going to pay for until now.  We plan on getting married as soon as both of us have jobs. GF currently works in retail for minimum wage and $90/month on food stamps. 

I would like to help my gf out on her last semester to focus on her grades and getting a job, instead of working retail. I told her try to get a part time internship for work experience(paid or unpaid). I would like to give her enough money to pay for her share of the rent ($242 rent plus 1/4 utilities if i live there or $362 plus 1/3 utilities if I dont live with her). I would like to also give her enough money to do one fun thing a month (~$20).  

We both plan on going back to school in ~2 years to get our MBA and would like to start saving for that.

**Questions**

* Is giving her this much money doable? smart?
* Which job would be better from a financial situation since higher cost of living plus having to pay rent?
* Should I start saving to pay off her loans(no interest till 6 months out of school)?
* What type of savings accounts, bank accounts, retirement plans should I set up?
* How much money should I be putting where?
* My parents are buying a new car for themselves and are extremely good at paying the bills on time and don't have a shortage of money. Is there anything I could do, like co sign to help increase my credit score?"

xgah4,0,2012-07-31,guy who i dated for a month disappeared. should i initiate contact to ask what happened?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xgah4/guy_who_i_dated_for_a_month_disappeared_should_i/,"stats

me: 25 years old virgin female not waiting till marriage but until i find myself a healthy loving mutually fulfilling relationship with a great thoughtful guy.  working as a part time intern. muslim background but lived in the u.s for 10 years now.

him. 23 year old grad student also working as an intern at the same company. southern white preppy background with no previous history of dating someone ""brown"".

background:
so i met this guy through a mutual friend about a month and a half ago at an after work happy hour. i was in a relationship at the time and didn't think much of it when he casually said that i was ""a lovely pakistani girl"" and asked me for my number so he could ask me to hang out with him and our other friends. we did have a good conversation and i recall finding myself intrigued that even though he was a rich sheltered white preppy kid, he was passionate about the middle east and spoke farsi and arabic. i love intellectually curious people and certainly thought he was the kind of person i'd like to keep in my friendship circle.

two weeks later i was still reeling from my bf breaking up with me and met up with my friends for a farewell happy hour for an intern who was leaving for a new job. he was there and arrives late and finds a seat next to me.  we got to talking and in our drunken-ness flirt mildly back and forth. after a couple hours later everyone else leaves except for our mutual friend and his girlfriend and the boy and i. we decided to take the party to his apartment. once there he serves us wine and puts on amazing music and we sit back and hang out. sometime during the night he starts telling me how beautiful he thinks i am. i don't think much of it seeing as how he was piss drunk, and just laugh it off. he keeps telling me how gorgeous and beautiful i am. and just came on so strong. i was flattered and was very attracted to him as well but didn't indulge him too much. around midnight i tried i realized it was too late to metro home and he asks us to crash at his place. he gets me a pair of his pjs to change into seeing as how my work clothes were very uncomfy. i slip into his pjs and crawl onto his bed with a headache and wanting to sleep. sometime during the evening i find him curled up next to me and he starts kissing my neck...it feels great but i recall that he has a long distance gf. and pull back and tell him to stop.  he says that he isn't into his gf and she makes him so miserable. i say he should break up with him then. he says he wants to but he is so scared to hurt her and how it sucks breaking up with her. he tries to kiss me and i push him away. he says im beautiful and i say if he thinks so he should break up with his gf wine me and dine me and then he would even have a chance to kiss me. he stares at me and goes ""you're a good one aren't you?""

i turn around and fall asleep. in the morning the rest of us sneak out leaving him alone since he was deep asleep. the week that follows i recall being charmed and thinking he was sexy and wishing he was single. mid week our mutual friend IMs me to tell me that the boy broke up with his gf. i was horrified but he said it had nothing to do with me and was a long time coming. meeting me made him realize there were other women out there. a couple days later i get a text from the boy asking me if id be free to meet him for dinner/drinks after work.  i figure...whats the harm?

we meet for drinks/food. he is SO nervous. it is pretty evident he hasnt officially been on a ""date"" for a very long time. we have a pretty fun time and he regales me with stories about his crazy stunts from college. i find his boyish sense of mischief endearing and his intelligence mesmerizing.

needless to say we continue hanging out and after work. either getting drinks and/or dinner and then coming to his place to make out and cuddle. for fourth of july he hosts a party and invites me and says i should get to know his sister.i was nervous since it is WAAYYYY tooo soon for an official family meet but then was surprised how casual it was. 

a couple days later. he got sick and i cancelled our plans to watch star wars and insisted i drop off some soup. when i got to his apartment he was a bit aloof and more distant than usual.i was a bit put off but didn't want to jump to any conclusions. the day after he texts me saying it was very sweet of me to bring by soup. the following monday i texted him asking if he was free to hang out for a while that evening. he said he has some food at home and will be cooking. i go over and he prepares this lovely plate of bbq chicken with wine and hors d'oeuvres and cookies for dessert. it was pretty unexpected and i made sure to thank him for going all out. i slept over that night and in the morning he asked me to help him pick out his suit for work. after he insisted i stay as long as i like and shouldn't rush out with him. i browsed job boards on his laptop and munched on a pop tart before leaving two hours later. he texted me later that evening thanking me for the ""sweet"" thank you note i left on his table.

the week before he had asked if i wanted to go to the portrait gallery this weds after work. so come tuesday evening i text him to tell him that the gallery will be closed by the time we get around.he says he is on the phone and that it's ""lame"" that its closed. no mention of changing plans or canceling them.

weds evening i email him at work about if he still wants to hang out and do something else. he says he has had a bad day and was planning to just go home but i was welcome to join him. i get a bit irked at him canceling plans without having consulted/told me and say its okay and that we can reschedule. i do feel embarrassed and hurt for having been blown off so thoughtlessly.if i hadnt emailed him to inquire...would he have just left for home without letting me know plans were cancelled? i run into him in the lobby after and actually tell him that it wasnt cool that he blew me off last minute. he seemed aloof ""oh? you want to go to the gallery? lets go to the gallery!"" i was like...""weren't you listening? the gallery is closed"" and then i just say ""forget it. you're fine. its okay"" and say good bye and leave. 

i expect an apology text/call that evening seeing as how i was upset. but i dont get any. he doesnt contact me on friday either. when i ask him to get coffee at work he comes with but is pretty distant and aloof and makes no mention of future plans or apologizes for weds. 

sat afternoon i call him to ask whats up but he doesnt respond. i then call sunday but get no response either. i text him saying "" hi havent heard from you lately so just wanted to ask if you were okay"". he says ""sorry couldnt answer. having lunch with my folks. im ok how're you?"" i text ""oh thats good to know. im great."" he texts back ""good""

monday morning we run into each other at the printer. he makes a comment about my hair and then i ask if he is mad at me since i havent heard from him. he says ""no. why would i be mad at you? we're good"" and then says he has to go to the bathroom and says ""See you around the office"" without making any indication of hanging out.

at this point i stop contacting him and realize he isnt going to text or call or come by my desk to initiate a date. its been three weeks now since the initial cancellation of plans on weds and im not sure if i should pop by his desk to ask to meet up and ask him what happened.


what did i do wrong? did he lose interest or does he think i lost interest or am mad at him for being too tired to hang out? im so confused and any insight would be so helpful

xgafc,9,2012-07-31,Is there any way that I can feasibly date this guy without losing my friend? ,vikram13,AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/xgafc/is_there_any_way_that_i_can_feasibly_date_this/,"Hi r/AskWomen! I have gotten myself into a bit of a situation and am not sure how to proceed. And I apologize for the length of this post.

Background: I'm a 21F at uni, I have had only one LTR, which was through high school and beginning of college, and have now been single for almost 3 years.

I only have a few very good friends, one of whom is a few years older than me and is in grad school. Her name is Abby. Abby and my older sister Shania and I are all good friends. Abby has made some pretty cool new friends in grad school, one of which is a guy named Peter. At first, Shania told me that she thought Peter and I would be great together, we have many of the same interests, both goal-driven, fun, etc. So one night Abby and I go over to Peter's to play some video games. There are a few other people there but it's a pretty small get together, so Peter and I really get to chat and get to know each other. Things start to get flirty, but before anything serious, Abby says its time to go and we go back to my apartment.

Peter and I talk a little bit here and there but with finals we're all pressed for time. After finals, I come back to my apartment to find Shania, Abby, Peter and one of his friends drinking and playing board games. I join in and am having some fun when Shania starts texting me saying Peter and I are a no go because Abby likes Peter. I am obviously dissapointed but decide to lay off any claim because I want my friend to be happy. Everyone ends up pretty smashed and passing out around my apartment. When I get drunk, I often start compulsively cleaning my place. So I start clearing up and Peter, who's still awake, keeps talking to me and helping me out. Finally, he starts tickling me, one thing leads to another, and we end up making out on my kitchen floor. I ran to my room later and he slept on the couch.

Next morning, I had to work so I left early. I was very confused as I was obviously excited that a guy I liked had kissed me but also guilt that I now knew my friend Abby liked him. Well, that night we were all going to a big party over at Peter's. I knew that I should tell Abby what happened. But I didn't. She came over to pregame with us before and I just couldn't get the words. I'm a cowardly chicken shit, I know, but I didn't.

So we head over to Peter's (mind you, I have no pre-conceived intention of hooking up with Peter). I meet a lot of Abby's new grad school friends and have a generally great time. After a couple of hours of drinking, Shania comes over, looking slightly peeved, and saying that she's taking Abby home. Drunk me didn't catch on and and said ok, see you tomorrow! Night went on, I ended up staying over at Peter's.

Next morning I head home and the shame of what I did hits me. I pulled such a shitty move on my friend. But before I could talk to her about it, she moved home for the summer. Peter wanted to continue talking, but I wanted to talk to Abby first. So then I moved home, Abby, Shania and I are all from the same town. We were all so busy with internships, and my mom got married, that I didn't get to talk to her for a month. By that time, I assumed Peter had moved on. Abby and I talked, I apologized profusely, explaining what a shit friend I had been and we moved on. She said that she hadn't been in love with him but that it was more of a curious crush, thinking maybe something could happen later down the line.

Fast forward two months. I have a few weeks before I head back to school when I get a text from Peter. He says that I should come up to school early for a weekend. I'm a bit surprised as we hadn't talked in two-three months.

So, what can I do? I still like Peter and I think he may still like me. But I don't want to hurt Abby again, she is one of the few good friends I have.

TL:DR: Female friend introduces me to new male friend. Develop crush for said friend. Find out female friend has crush for male friend. Hook up with male friend anyway. Make up with female friend. Now what?"

xg29b,4,2012-07-31,Putting current courses on resume,Applesmack101,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xg29b/putting_current_courses_on_resume/,"Hi,

I will be applying for a winter internship/co-op during the fall while also taking courses. I'm wondering whether I can include the subjects and material covered in these courses on my resume. The problem is that although I do not know the material very well right now, I will know it by the time I begin the internship. However, I also don't want the interviewer to start grilling me on these subjects since after all I will be still currently learning them. The reason I want to include them is because I want a job in those areas (low-level/embedded software) rather than another web-dev job.

How can I include material I am currently learning on my resume?
Do 3rd year co-op/intern interviewers generally ask hardcore coding questions and will they grill me on this material?

Edit: Can I also include a personal project (I am making a video game over summer) even if it is not yet complete and may not be complete by the end of the interview?"

I am having a really hard time thinking in ladder logic and could use some help or advice. I know what I need to make the machine do, but it is frustrating not being able to speak it's language.

I need the machine to:

1.Turn off the emergency stop
2.Turn the on/off switch
3.These two actions should make a wheel containing parts rotate
4.A sensor will activate telling it has rotated successfully
5.When the sensor comes on, a stamper should come down and brand the part.
6.Then the stamper resets.
7.Finally the wheel resets.
8.Everything repeats.
I need to have some kind of safety built in that will stop the program if the wheel does not function properly. If it does not rotate and the sensor does not come, it should stop and NOT stamp.

tl;dr: I'm trying to make a good impression at work but they threw this new software at me and I am drowning. I have asked for help and they keep encouraging me to 'figure it out' with no guidance. Please help me!

edit: I am studying Mechanical Engineering but my boss has given me this programming assignment. I am tying my best to wrap my mind around it, but I am having a lot of trouble thinking in ladder logic.

xg07g,8,2012-07-31,What should I do outside of my computer science courses?,Vesper123,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xg07g/what_should_i_do_outside_of_my_computer_science/,"I'm going to be a transfer student at my state school this fall. 48 of my credits transferred from my old school.

I am switching majors from biology to computer science and to actually complete a computer science major, I only need 68 more credits, which is very doable if I utilize my summer sessions and take 5 semesters.

My questions:

1. Once I get to school this semester, what should I be doing besides studying? What extra curricular activities will help my job prospects in the field of computer science?

2. I know I won't have enough experience with computer science by the end of Fall 2012-Spring 2013 because I'm just starting out. Would I apply for internships for the summer after the Fall 2013-Spring 2014 year?

How can I increase my chances of actually landing an internship? 

I've heard from a lot of people that without an internship, my CS degree is worth as much as an art history degree to some extent."
xfyrj,38,2012-07-31,A testimony shaken,Zuggy,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/xfyrj/a_testimony_shaken/,"Just a little something I wanted to share.

I've been out for a little over 4 years now (celebrated 4 years in May) and the other day I was with my sister (who's still active) and we saw my old Elder's Quorum President in the store. It's been a long time since I saw him last, probably a year or so, and in the past he would come up and we'd have a good chat about what was going on in each other's lives. This time though he just said a quick hello and sort of scurried off.

I asked my sister what was up with him and she told me when I quit the EQP told her I would be back soon. I would lose the spirit, my blessings and be miserable and that I would return, repent and carry on. She said as time went on my life got better outside the church, that he could tell from our talks that I was doing great and much happier out of the church than in the church. On the flip side he has stagnated in life, he's 28, still living at home, has no real direction in life, his goal of finding a wife has continued to fail, his only major accomplishment has been going on a mission while I've won national awards in my field of study and had a couple prestigious internships.

She said she thinks I shook his testimony and doesn't want anything to do with me now because I represent the biggest trial of his faith.

I don't really know if I feel proud or if I feel bad for him. Mostly I would just like to talk to him to see if I could inspire him to move forward in life, not anything church related. He was a good friend to me and fought hard to try to get me to come back. Although at the time it was annoying that he couldn't respect my decision to leave, I do know he only did it because he genuinely cared about me.

Anyway just a little something I thought I'd share from my post-mormon adventures."

xfh2d,0,2012-07-30,Is my becoming friend a douchebag or am I over-reacting? ,weedledum,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xfh2d/is_my_becoming_friend_a_douchebag_or_am_i/,"Hello my fellow redditors,



One of my friends from high school went up to college the same college as me (coincidence) so we decided to room together during our 2nd year with 2 other people that we know. At the beginning of the year my friend (lets call him Sugar Sparkles from now on) would like to do talk to us all of the time and make plans with us. We got along perfectly. However, the 3 of us were not exactly happy with Sugar Sparkles because during freshmen year he planned on living with the track team he was a part of (before they kicked him off the lease) so he came to us at the last minute. I see this as his back-up plan. Then when we were looking for houses for our Junior year he decided to sign a lease with someone from his dorm from Freshmen year. Okay, whatever, we were expecting this. I mean he really didn't want to live with us the first time, right? Anyways this other person (lets call them Jackal...his facial bone structure is identical to one) came to one of our parties. Cool, I'm always down to meeting new people. Well, Jackal, invites a whole bunch of random ass people to our party (not cool, should ask the host first) then he proceeds to go to the fridge when he is drunk and eats all of the food. This is where I am starting to dislike him.



Fast-forward to spring quarter, Sugar Sparkles has proceeded to go out every Thursday, Friday and Saturday with Jackal (I like going out too but holy crap I do have priorities). I had this huge physiology exam on Friday (they were going out Thursday night) and Jackal brings 2 of his other friends. Okay, whatever, I dislike him but as long as Jackal and Sugar Sparkles are not too loud it is okay. Well, of course the music gets blasting so me and my other roommates put our earphones in to muffle the noise. They leave, finally at 11:30! Great! I did the usual where I texted Sugar Sparkles to call me if I am not awake he is too drunk to walk home and I will pick him up (I do this every time my friends go out). Wake up the next morning there is a mother fucking beer can that was opened purposely to be shoved into our toilet. Then there was piss in it too. So, Jackal or one of his friends must of done it. This is where I went from disliking him to me thinking he is the biggest douchebag around. 




Well, now I think Jackal is rubbing too much on Sugar Sparkles. The last 7 months Sugar Sparkles only wants to hangout with me when there is absolutely nothing else going on or nobody else can hangout. Then, he just keeps talking about how awesome Jackal is (all of Sugar Sparkle's stories involves Jackal. Every. Single. One) and how he can't wait to live with him next year and his 2 other friends. Gee, thanks. I invited Sugar Sparkles to go to lunch with me today (this is kinda where I drew the last straw). So, he came to the restaurant. I tried to talk to him but he barely responded. He is leaving for his internship tomorrow. I got him a Starbucks Gift Card (he is going to need the coffee) and a good luck card for his internship.




So redditors, I come to you. I really do like Sugar Sparkles and he has been a great friend to me in the past but I'm honestly just fed up putting all of the effort in to this relationship with barely any effort on his part. Even worse, I just feel like being a back-up friend is the biggest insult you can give to someone. I don't know if I should write a long letter and stick it with the card of all the things that Sugar Sparkles has done to piss me off recently (by writing a letter I can form everything I need to write, correct details and all of the other wrong this he has done to me and our other roommates) or if I should tell him to his face how much I have started to grown to hate him (where I risk offending him the most, possibly). I really want to stay good friends with him like in the past if at all possible but he really needs to put in the effort. Or am I just over-reacting/jealous that he has made a lot of new friends recently? I really do want him to be happy but not at the sake of my happiness too. Any advice on how to save this friendship if possible or what should I do? Also, does anyone know an assassin/ninja to take care of Jackal?



Sorry that is so long but I felt like I needed to put in a lot of details. Thank you very much reddit :) "

(x-post from r/sysadmin)",joe772,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/xfcl7/network_engineers_of_reddit_am_i_going_about_all/,"Hi. I'm currently going into my junior year of college, in an IT program. I'm doing a double concentration in Networking and Security with a minor in Business Administration. By the time I graduate, I should have:

* CCENT/CCNA/CCNP
* Security+
* RHCSA RHEL5/ RHCE RHEL6
* IPv6 Silver Forum Seal
* 1 Microsoft Cert (Not sure which one)


I will also have had 1 semester minimum of required internship, as well as any other internships/coops that I can get. On top of all of that, I am in the top 5% of my class, consistent Dean's List, as well as founder/president of one of the east coast's top eSports clubs. 

I was just curious, do you think I will be in a good position when I graduate? I know that experience is a really big factor in everything, but just going off my degree, the certs I'll have, and the expected internship experience, how do you think I will be? Any chance someone might possibly know a round-about number for a starting salary?

I look forward to being able to contribute more into this subreddit soon!
