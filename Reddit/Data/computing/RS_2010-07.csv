 The problem is I was suppose to be in the academy twice now, and twice it fell through due to state budget cuts (I live in New York).  I have a new born and I am living at my moms house (I'm 23) with my girlfriend because were saving money to get on our feet (and my mom loves her grandson).  I need to make this police offer thing happen and I am sick of them telling me ""maybe next year"".  I know its not their fault but I need to move on and start my career. 

So any police officers who browse reddit, my questions to you are where do you work? and how did you get in?  is your dept hiring? do you know of any departments hiring? or do you know of any departments with a fast hiring process? as most of them take almost a year to complete."

I thought he was ""the one.""  We both love each other, but he says I need to ""find myself"" first ... he says I needed to be more independent.  He brought this up a while ago when I was really getting clingy, and he even said I made a lot of progress since then, but I don't know.

I know I'm supposed to move on now, or at least move on long enough to ""find myself"" or whatever, but I just feel so lost and confused.  No one's ever broken up with me before, so I've never felt this feeling of helplessness.  I didn't have any problems with him, he just had problems with me, which makes me feel so worthless and retarded knowing I was solely responsible for the demise of the relationship ... that's probably not true, but it just feels that way.

I'm interning in a different city for the summer than most of my friends, so it's not like I can hang out with them every day, and they're really not the comforting type anyway ... mostly guys, and we don't really have a talk-things-out kind of friendship.

I don't know.  I feel stupid for letting this relationship go sour and not realizing when I was messing up.  I don't know how to get over him.  And he's all I can think about, and I can't concentrate at my internship or anything.  I don't know how to deal with this kind of thing.  

I think it's time for ice cream.  In the meantime, any advice, 2x?"

cndat,1,2010-07-08,Dear reddit: I have to interview a movie director this week. I've never done an interview. Can you help me think of some intriguing questions to ask him?,starving_artisan,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cndat/dear_reddit_i_have_to_interview_a_movie_director/,"My boss at my internship just sort of threw this task on me this week. I'm an intern - limited to filing, shredding, and restocking toilet paper. What am I supposed to know about conducting interviews? Well, I hope to do a great job - maybe I'll end up getting paid at some point, but I'm totally stuck as to what sort of questions to ask this guy.

The movie is called *Restrepo*. Basically these camera guys followed around US soldiers in Afghanistan while they were in combat. Here's what the press release says about it:


Restrepo, a feature-length documentary that chronicles the deployment of a platoon of U.S. soldiers inAfghanistan's Korengal Valley. The movie focuses on a remote 15-man outpost, ""Restrepo,"" named after a platoon medic who was killed in action. It was considered one of the most dangerous postings in the U.S. military. This is an entirely experiential film: the cameras never leave the valley; there are no interviews with generals or diplomats. The only goal is to make viewers feel as if they have just been through a 94-minute deployment. This is war, full stop. The conclusions are up to you.

 
DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT
The war in Afghanistan has become highly politicized, but soldiers rarely take part in that discussion. Our intention was to capture the experience of combat, boredom and fear through the eyes of the soldiers themselves. Their lives were our lives: we did not sit down with their families, we did not interview Afghans, we did not explore geopolitical debates. Soldiers are living and fighting and dying at remote outposts in Afghanistan in conditions that few Americans back home can imagine. Their experiences are important to understand, regardless of one’s political beliefs. Beliefs can be a way to avoid looking at reality. This is reality.


Starting in June 2007, Tim Hetherington and Sebastian Junger dug in with the men of Second Platoon, making a total of ten trips to the Korengal on assignment for Vanity Fair Magazine and ABC News. Each trip started with a helicopter flight into the main firebase in the valley and then a two-hour foot patrol out to Restrepo. There was no running water at Restrepo, no internet, no phone communication, and for a while, there was no electricity or heat; it was essentially just sandbags and ammo. Some days the outpost was attacked three or four times from distances as close as fifty yards. Hetherington and Junger – sometimes working together, sometimes alone – did everything the soldiers did except pull guard duty and shoot back during firefights. They slept alongside the soldiers, ate with them, survived the boredom and the heat and the cold and the flies with them, went on patrol with them, and eventually came to be considered virtually part of the platoon. By the end of the deployment, they had shot a total of 150 hours of combat, boredom, humor, terror, and daily life at the outpost.

 
Conditions for filmmaking couldn’t have been harsher. The surrounding mountains rose to a height of 10,000 feet – all of which was traversed on foot. Long operations meant carrying enough camera batteries to last a week or more, on top of the fifty or so pounds of gear required on even ordinary patrols. Cameras got smashed into rocks, clogged with dirt and hit with shell cartridges during firefights. Men were killed and wounded during filming, so there was a constant issue of when it was OK to turn on the cameras and when it was not. Only the filmmakers’ close relationship to the men of the platoon allowed them to keep shooting in situations where other journalists might have been told to stop. Three months after the end of the deployment, Hetherington and Junger traveled to Vicenza, Italy, where the unit is based. They used two Veri-Cams, a full light and sound package, and two cameramen to conduct in-depth interviews with their main characters. These interviews – initially considered a kind of glue for the verité, and a way to avoid outside narration – wound up being some of the most powerful and affecting material of the entire project. The soldiers were able to allow themselves a level of emotion and introspection that is simply not possible in combat.



Sorry if that's a lot (it is). I've thought of looking over other interviews of journalists stationed in the Middle East and mimicking their interviews, at least for a start. But I know all you reddit people are awesome and might have some good ideas."

You guys really are a great community. 

Here's my story: I started working on a website just for my own entertainment and fun while I was on an internship in college.  A year later I ended up finding links to it on iambored.com, blogs, and forums.  People actually liked it! So I put more work into it (on the side of course on top of school and now a full-time job).  

Basically it uses Last.FM feeds to help you find and listen to new artists that you may like.  It allows you to explore an interactive web of related artists.  I finally set it up with Amazon and iTunes affiliate links back in March or so.  So far I've made $1.55 [Picture of the check](http://imgur.com/Ox0a0.gif). So it works! It gets on average about 170-1,000 hits a day (depending on blog posts or reviews, but usually max 300 hits). I think it just needs more attention and to be honest I'm barely able to cover the hosting fees, let alone pay for expensive advertising campaigns. If you happen to already buy music through iTunes/Amazon please use my site to do so if you find it useful!

I would also LOVE feedback, constructive criticism, ANYTHING! I know the UI could be improved I'm just not sure how yet. ::nervous inhale:: So without further ado, I present to you, [MusicRoamer](http://www.musicroamer.com). Thanks in advance for even reading if you did.

ALSO! Try the konami code on it :)

**TL;DR.** I am 90k in school loan debt and I really believe my website has a chance.  Please reddit for the love of god try it out and comment!  

**UPDATE:** Thank you all so much for the feedback and for sending my site to friends/significant others/family! I've gotten almost 150 hits just from reddit in 5 hours. I will be hard at work trying to make all of your recommended changes. I seriously appreciate it, you guys are awesome!

cnjr4,0,2010-07-08,I just got fired...,justgotletgo,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cnjr4/i_just_got_fired/,"Basically since orientation it seems my manager had it out for me.

My ex-company requires new hires to complete some online training courses but since I was an intern and my internship wasn't going to last until the due date of the courses I made a **joke** about how I wouldn't need to do them. My manager was sitting at my table. I completed those courses within 2 weeks of starting and none of the other interns have done so, atleast as of this past Monday. She brought the joke up in the meeting, and when I heard that given as reason, I just looked at her and was thinking WTF?!?!? and she just looked at me and does the shoulder raise. Can't really describe what she did but it seemed she purposefully worded it in a way as to detract from my work. 

They complained about my attendance. Some of it was truth but most of it was either lies or half-truths said in a fashion to make it look bad. For example, I told my manager that one morning I need to go pick up my granddad and dad from the airport but told the supervisor that my dad picked him up and I have to go pick him up from the airport. I later realized I phrased that pretty badly and when I couldn't find my supervisor through phone, email, or visiting her office to offer a clarification, I told my manager instead. I asked her to relay this information to my supervisor but she did not. That incident was brought up in the meeting. There is a whole list of other stuff like this and if anyone actually reads this and wants more, I'll tell them in an edit.

What I really want to know however is that does anyone know if it is the law to give an intern (full-time) two week notice or can they just terminate me on the spot?

I actually made a few comments to some other interns that I was either going to be fired or quit because my boss has it out for me. I said this maybe 2 weeks ago.

**tl;dr:** Can a company legally terminate a full-time intern without 2 weeks notice?"

Rent for me alone (I have 5 other roommates in this 3-bedroom thing) is $750/mo. for a furnished apartment, which comes out to $9000 for a whole year, $7500 for the time I plan to stay (I'm hoping to find someone else to take over the contract for the summer). I signed the lease a few months ago, but they mentioned that I could find someone to replace me on the lease at any time. I don't move in until September. I asked my parents twice if they were fine with paying for it, with me covering all the utilities and food with my own money.

Earlier, I was completely fine about staying at this place, but now I'm thinking I'd be chipping away at my parents' finances too much (we're middle-class). Part of me keeps feeling like I'm acting like some type of selfish entitlement brat by just letting them foot the bill and not looking back. 

On one hand, I feel perfectly fine about commuting to school for yet another year, even though everyone keeps throwing hypotheticals at me such as ""Well, what if you want to take a girl back to your place? Oh, wait..."" . Learning how to live on my own isn't really an issue here, since I'm in an apartment for an internship this summer.

So I'm curious, Reddit. What do you think?

tl;dr I signed the lease for an allegedly expensive apartment being paid for by my parents, who're okay with footing the bill. Am I a selfish prick?


Update: I am now trying to find someone to replace me on the list, and if time permits, hopefully find a cheaper place I can afford on my own. Thanks again."

So for a little background, I’m 22, an engineering student currently on an internship in one of the bigger cities in the states. I’m only here for the summer before I head back to school. 

Anyway, July 4th, rolled around and I ended up meeting three great ladies at the bar. We all hit it off and hung out a lot last week. I noticed right off the bat that one of the girls (lets call her Betty) wanted to be more than friends, and that was confirmed when she came over along on Thursday. After the initial awkward dust settled, she started to flirt over the top and eventually full on made a move. After a decent make out session, I pulled back and suggested this might be a bad idea. When asked why, I proceeded to tell her all my faults – I’m only around for 2 months, just looking for a fun time, definitely don’t want a girl friend, known to be notorious for one night stands, think a lot with my dick, etc, etc. After some initial hesitation on her part, she decides she wants to have sex with me anyway, and at this point I’m way too horny to argue any further against my pecker. We had sex. Rinse. Repeat.

The entire group continues to hang out on the weekend (Betty and her friend + me and my buddy from back home), and we hit a few bars. Chick comes on to me again, we go for round 2. However, at this point, things were not looking so peachy for me. She seemed to be getting clingy and whatever I said on Thursday seemed to have gone in one ear and out the other.

Come monday we all go for a concert at the local watering hole. I'm double fisting beer and having a great time. Through out the night I kept mentioning to her and her friends how I love being single, joked around about cheating, etc,etc.

Later on in the night as the band is packing up, this hot little thing (lets call her Veronica) comes over and strikes up a conversation. She is obviously flirting hard, and I can't help myself, and flirt back. End up finding out that shes from Russia, and since I approach my conquests like I do a game of Risk, I was immediately intrigued.

This is where it gets juicy. A lot more alcohol is involved, resulting in a lot more flirting. My buddy later tells me that Betty was giving everybody dagger eyes, and was not pleased with what was going on in front of her. Knowledge I didn't process in my drunken haze. I start getting a lot more touchy, feely and am actively hitting on Veronica. I'm pretty sure at one point i told the girl that ""I wish you were a cell phone, cause I want to work a number on that ass..."" (I know, I have no clue why I get laid either...)

We end up making out on a now completely empty dance floor. Betty comes out of nowhere and says ""You are a fucking asshole! You can fucking lose my number."" To which I, for an unknown reason, decide to respond to with hysterical laughter while my friend and her friend restrain her as she wants to take a swing at me.

I take Veronica aside, diffuse the situation, make out some more, get her number and book it out the bar. 

On my arrival home, I promtly try to fix things by trying to send an email saying the following. The only reason it didn't go through, is cause the room mate wrsetled the computer out of my hands:

Dear Betty

I'm sorry about last night. The alcohol is definitely my cryptonite. While I shouldn't have done what I did, its not like you didn't know who I was. I mentioned on multiple occasion that I was an asshole, a bad boyfriend, ________, ________ (feel free to replace the blanks with whatever expletives you want). But I never lied to you about who I was. I'm sorry you had to see that (I regret that happening in front of you) but when I'm drunk my true personality comes out.

Like I mentioned on Thursday (before we did the nasty, which was pretty fucking amazing), I hope we don't regret this. And I really hope we can still be friends.

You are truly an amazing individual.


Also apparently, at some point in the night she sent me a message saying ""you are disgusting. I've never felt so embarassed in my life"", to which I responded ""its hard forgetting your number when you keep texting me""

So now wise old Reddit, how do I fix this? I've gone through various scenarios in my head but all dont end well... Would like to still be friends with the group..."
cpc22,1,2010-07-14,"RE: Dillon Cossey, ""Columbine wannabe""",Condawg,WTF,https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/cpc22/re_dillon_cossey_columbine_wannabe/,"A friend of mine recently told me the story of a local boy (of whom she is friends with the mother) who, a few years back, at the ripe age of 14, was arrested for plots of obliterating students in his school.

His name is Dillon Cossey. Here's the basic story...

He's a really big dude. Because of this, he was bullied at school. The school eventually called his mother, Michelle, and asked her to remove her son from the *(public)* school, because his presence there was not conducive to him nor the school itself.

His mother removed him. She had him schooled over the internet. He made friends with a kid named Lou Bennett. Lou and Dillon got together and boiled up a plot to take down the school. They had no means to do this, but they acquired floor plans and plotted out where they would place bombs to take it down. It was a sick fantasy, but it **was** just a fantasy; just two kids having their own weird kind of fun.

Well, one day they got in a fight. Lou went home and presented all of the plans to his father, exclaiming ""Look at what Dillon's been planning."" His father alerted the authorities and the next morning, Dillon was awoken by several police cars waiting to take him into custody.

My friend had been in school the planned day of the attack. She had an internship, and as such, left school at 12:00. As she prepared to leave, it went into full lock-down, with the school being surrounded by around 25 police cars and having helicopters flying overhead. Fox News even reported that a kid had been shot. (Big surprise, eh?)

None of the students (or *teachers*) were informed of the situation. Mass panic in the building. Eventually, my friend got out (and was allowed to pass by an officer who chalked her up as no threat (mind you, even the officers had no idea what was happening inside, at all)). 

So, jumping back to Dillon. He was arrested and sent to juvie until he's 21. This was two years ago, and he was 14 at the time. The judge told his (incredibly religious) mother that it was a ""devious act of god that allowed [her] to bare children.""

The mother was also arrested for six months for having a weapon licensed in her name, although her husband was not allowed anywhere near guns. (She kept the handgun at a friend's house, in a safe. The judge was out to fuck this family over, and did so very effectively.)

The news outlets went nuts. Reports flew around, saying that aforementioned Lou Bennett was a ""hero"" for reporting Dillon to authorities, and that Dillon had planned a ""columbine-style shooting"" at the school, which was, of course, a complete fabrication, considering the fact that he had ""planned"" (in fairytale land) to blow it up, without any means whatsoever to carry out his plans. 

Some media outlets said that Michelle had purchased several guns for her son. Some even [quote her](http://www.weirduniverse.net/blog/comments/dillon_cossey/), saying that she purchased him a rifle to ""help his self-esteem,"" when she had never purchased a rifle, ever.  

Lou was met by George Bush in Philadelphia, to reward him for his ""heroic"" actions. Motherfucker got his hand shaken by the president.

Well, in the later months, this Lou kid robbed the fuck out of Dillon's vacant room. Stole his airsoft guns, his video games (of which he had a shit-ton), as well as other shit. He sold it at school. Eventually he got caught, at which point George W. Bush looked like even *more* of a dumbass.

But he never got busted or even got recognized as a kid who helped plan the ""attack"" that Dillon got buttfucked for. Media outlets completely blew the story wide open with outright fabrications and nothing but lies. This has made me even more aware of how fucked up the media in this fucking country is, as well as the judicial system. I'm not going to defend Dillon; I feel that his punishment was far too severe for actions that he *hadn't* done or actually planned on **actually** doing, but they did completely fuck over his mother (who is, from what I hear, one of the nicest women you'll ever meet).

So, if you've heard about this story (it was apparently hugely talked about everywhere, but I hadn't heard of it at the time), be informed that everything you've heard is complete and utter bullshit. No story I've read even mentions bombs; they try to make an advantage of him by saying that he wanted to impersonate the Columbine shooters, when this is incredibly and utterly false."

I am a CS major, and since it's summertime, I am working as an intern for an educational research group at my local university. Specifically, I am working on building a virtual campus in Second Life for them. They also hired two co workers: one who is a very good coder, Paul, and an upcoming freshmen, Chris. Finally, there is our supervisor, Samantha. She is for the most part a ""hands off supervisor"". She gives us broad goals, and we come up with and build specific things. It doesn't matter how we get things completed, so long as we're making progress.

Chris has no programming experience, and sometimes feels a little overwhelmed because the scripting language can get complicated, and we're always scripting. So I let him borrow an intro to java textbook I got during my freshmen year, and have been nagging him to read through it

Lately, I have taken to just work at home. It's completely fine with my supervisor, and she even suggested it to me, but I still feel a little guilty not taking the commute in everyday, while Paul and Chris sit in the office

Today was going well until a few hours in, when I these messages in Second Life from Samantha:

[10:42] Gabe Dao: bye


The whole conversation was really weird. 15 minutes later, I get a message from Chris, about how Samantha is all mad that he's wasting time reading up on java. Apparently it was my fault, in some way. So I get ready to drive down to the office and resolve this, when I get an email from Paul titled: A Lovely Conversation. And it struck me.

Paul had access to Samantha's account.

And I was going to bring in cookies for a birthday party that didn't exist.

cqptb,40,2010-07-17,Late at work,fermion72,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cqptb/late_at_work/,"I'm back in engineering graduate school, and this summer I landed a great internship at a big tech company in the Northeast.  The company is located in a giant, oddly shaped building off of a minor highway, forty-five minutes or so outside of a large city.  It's relatively rural, in other words, surrounded by forest on three sides, with a large parking lot that winds down to the road.  As I said, the building has a strange shape -- it's mostly square, but there is one corner which forms a ""V,"" and my cubicle happens to be right in the upper corner of one side of the V, such that I (and my cubemates -- we might have a corner-cube with windows, but there are three of us in here!) look out one of the large windows more or less directly into the windows in the other side of the V.  For some reason, that part of the building is vacant (I think the plan is to expand over there), and all that I can see is a couple of chairs and a fold-up table propped next to one of the windows.  It's a pretty big open space altogether.

Now, I used to be a high school teacher, and as it turns out I was asked if I could teach summer school in the same city where I'm working (it was a strange coincidence that I'm in town, actually).  Because of my full-time job, I declined the offer, but the school was in a bind and desperately needed a substitute teacher for one week, and I asked my boss if I could take the mornings off for one week and come into work late.  He said that was fine, as long as I worked a full 40-hour week, meaning I'd be in the office until 8 or 9pm each day that I taught.  I figured that I could handle 13-hour days for a week, so I decided to do it.  So, last Monday, I taught in the morning, and arrived at work at about 1pm.

The first couple of days of my evening work-week were pretty typical.  The office was bustling until about 5:30pm, at which time people started to trickle out of the office.  Most of the lights stayed on, but they must be on some sort of timer, because at about 7pm about half of the lights went out, and the office definitely seemed more deserted, and it had that ghost-town feel to it.  But, I had my work to do, and I didn't really notice.  I finished up about 8:30pm, turned off my computer, and headed down to my car, which I parked about half-way across the large parking lot.

Wednesday night, though, things got a bit strange.  First of all, more lights than normal went off at 7pm, and there were probably only about twenty percent of the lights on.  I definitely noticed, but didn't worry about it, and I didn't really mind working in the semi-dark.  As I went to leave that night, I went to open the door into the main hallway (it's got a sensor that unlocks it when you walk up), but it didn't open automatically.  I had to manually press a switch that unlocked the door.  Again, no worries -- maybe the sensor was on the same switch as the darkened lights.  I walked down the hall and down the main staircase, out the front door, and then into the parking lot, over to my car, which was alone in the center of the lot.  It was dark out, but the moon was shining, and the car glistened in the moonlight.  The car happened to be facing towards the building, and as I got into my car to leave, I happened to look back at the building, and I noticed that the empty room on the other side of the V had the lights on.  I thought this was odd, as I would have thought I would have noticed it from my darkened office right next to it.  I didn't really think too much of it, though, and I turned on the radio and went my way.

Thursday night, almost all of the lights went out at 7pm.  I began to think this was strange, being in my giant building all alone with the lights out, and I did start to get a bit creeped out.  I jumped when the A/C fan went on at one point, and I began to hear what I thought were steps along the cubes next to me.  I also thought I heard someone typing on the computer in the cube directly on the opposite side of where I sit.  I figured I was just tired, from the long days and all the work.  At about 8pm, I was sitting at my desk when I noticed out of the corner of my eye that the lights in the empty room had suddenly gone on.  As I swung my head over to look, they immediately went off, but I thought that I had seen a tall figure standing in the room, facing me from the window (which is about 15 feet from my window).  I got a cold shiver straight down my spine, and I decided that I'd worked enough for the day.  I packed up and got ready to leave.  I made my way (in the dark) towards the door but of course the automatic switch on the door didn't work again. Unfortunately, neither did the manual switch.  I panicked a bit, but then noticed an exit sign all the way down the other end of the hall, and I made my way towards it.  I ended up at another stairway (lighted, thankfully) and I went downstairs and found another exit out of the building.  It was a darker night, and I quickly made my way to my car, jumped in and tore out of the parking lot.

Friday night (last night) was my last day with the crazy schedule.  All afternoon I kept thinking about what might happen after everyone else had left, and I was already nervous by about 6:30pm.  At 7pm, the entire building went dark; the only light came from my computer monitor, and it gave my cube an eerie glow.  I could barely see to type, and I jumped at every little sound.  Again, I thought I heard typing, and there seemed to be more steps next to my cube.  I didn't dare leave the cube, but I started to plan my escape, wondering what was really going on.  By 7:30pm I had had enough, but just then I heard tapping on the window next to me (towards the empty office).  I almost had a heart attack, until I realized that it was just rain -- a storm had quickly blown in, and it was pouring out.  I took a deep breath, and finished putting my stuff away.  As I clicked off the computer monitor and stood up (leaving me in complete darkness), there was a tremendous bolt of lightning outside.  I turned to look, facing the empty office, and there was another huge lightning bolt.  The entire office next door was lit up.  And in each of the five windows stood a figure, arms at his sides, staring directly back at me.  I screamed and it was, of course, instantly dark again.  I totally panicked, grabbed my bag and went running for the door.  Amazingly, it opened with the manual switch, but the door to the stairway I normally took was locked--I didn't even know you could lock stairway doors.  I didn't know what I was going to do and then I noticed that there was a lighted exit sign down a different hallway, one which I had never been down.  As I started running towards the exit sign I realized -- I was running in the same direction as the empty office.  I stopped dead in my tracks, and didn't know what to do.  I decided to go for it, and I bolted towards the sign, which was like a glowing lighthouse -- the only thing I could see.  Just as I passed what must have been the doors to the empty office, the doors flew open, and I got knocked sideways, like I'd been hit by a train.  I careened into the wall, but somehow I managed to keep running.  I didn't dare look behind me, but somehow kept running for the stairs.  The next thing I knew, I was down the stairs and outside, into the thunderstorm.  I rushed to my car, fumbled with my keys and lept into it, driving as fast as I could out of the lot, towards home.

I didn't sleep much last night, but this morning as I was watching TV while eating breakfast, I saw a news report that said there had been a tornado that had gone through the town where I work.  I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw my building--they were showing the corner V and you could see that the empty office had been blown to smithereens.  I haven't talked to anyone from work yet today, but I'm definitely glad that my crazy week is over.

cr08i,24,2010-07-18,My Internet startup nightmare story,mexicatl,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/cr08i/my_internet_startup_nightmare_story/,"Six months ago, I had a couple of free weeks before leaving on vacation when I saw an ad on the university website put up by dotcom company looking for someone to do data entry. I show up the next day and they explain that the job was to put sample content on the website. I spend the next few hours hacking an interface into their back office and creating a database of content from the web to upload. At the end of the day, I explain that I can automate the process and instead of it taking two people two weeks, I can have it done in a couple of days.

The CEO was impressed even though the solution seemed rather obvious. I finish the job and I start helping them out with other things. I rewrite their terrible English and Spanish copy, write up a basic marketing strategy and give feedback on the website. I start understanding the business model and to see its potential. I'm also duly impressed by their big name partners but notice the CEO knows next to nothing about computers or the Internet.

So a week before leaving, I ask the CEO if he's looking to hire. I tell him that they need someone like me who has startup experience, having worked at a few already and owning equity in all of them. He tells me that all they're looking for is interns, so I tell him that I understand given that the website is about to launch and that I was willing to accept a short ""internship"", maybe some stock options and a basic stipend to pay for my expenses. He agrees and says he'll draw up a contract.

So I start work, seven days a week. I work during my vacation, developing new partners and searching for marketing firms. He showers me with compliments and sends out an email to his partners and investors saying I am the new Marketing Manager. Awesome I think.

I get back and keep the same pace. I'm work every day until 10-11pm. I review operations completely and keep developing the partner network. Mid-March, I get bumped to Director of Business Development. I start getting results, but negotiations promise to take months.

End of March, the CEO announces there is no more money, out of nearly a million Swiss francs initial investment two years ago, and that salaries would not be paid. People quit, leaving just the CEO, his assistant and me. At this point, I am managing most the operational aspects of the firm while they look for funding. I never get a contract, not even an NDA.

Potential investors come and go, but nobody invests. Our developers and some service providers start freezing our accounts, but we continue more or less getting by operationally. I spend hours everyday in emergency meetings. Late May, the CEO cedes 1% of the company to me, but still no salaries. He starts complaining of having no money. Morale continues dropping.

End of June arrives and there's still no funding, so I inform the CEO and the Board that I am leaving. I explain that my savings have been used up and I have no other choice, even if I am a shareholder. A Rolls-Royce driving board member/investor advances my back salaries and a few thousand more for operations at the last moment though and my financial situation now stabilized, I continue working.

To cut costs, we leave our offices and start working from home. He fires the assistant. I am now the only employee aside from the CEO. He continually complains of being broke, accusing me of having money saved up and even hinting to me and the board that he's going to kill himself. He seems less and less stable. I continue working.

Then last Wednesday, I get a CCed email from him to the board, accusing me of working on the side and no longer being implicated in the company. I instantly deny it, explaining I'm still working nearly 12 hours a day. I show them the results. I go for a walk to calm down and when I get back he's left a message on my phone repeating his accusation and a couple of emails threatening to quit. The emails continue into the next day.

I send out an email the next day stating I can't work in these conditions and that I am stopping my current collaboration immediately. I offer to continue working if they can propose a reasonable a mandate with a minimal budget and well-defined scope.

That was last week. So far nothing but silence. I have no clue what's going on and I don't really care anymore. A real shame. I think it is the first startup I've worked for that is not gonna make it. I just wish I had been hired a year ago, back when they had money, when saving it would have been possible.

So, any other startup nightmare stories? :)

**TL;DR** Worked my way up from temp to employee #1 in startup that had nearly a million Swiss francs in initial investment and worldwide partners in six months. CEO mismanaged capital, went batshit crazy and I left.

crudi,28,2010-07-20,Who is Jennifer Soares?,Prop19Warrior,prop19,https://www.reddit.com/r/prop19/comments/crudi/who_is_jennifer_soares/,"A line of argument I have seen gaining more traction over the last few days is being peddled by an attorney named Jennifer Soares.  Her arguments can be found on many of the No on 19 blogs and repeated in many comment sections even here on reddit.  Here are a couple of examples...

http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/content/2010/06/05/Why-You-Should-Vote-YES-California-Control-Tax-Cannabis-Initiative#comment-29899

http://votetaxcannabis2010.blogspot.com/2010/07/why-pro-pot-activists-oppose-2010-tax.html?showComment=1279437960986#c3869748808779970903

Here is her being referenced in our comments: 
http://www.reddit.com/r/Marijuana/comments/cpwp7/have_you_been_wondering_exactly_how_theyre_going/c0ukytl

I want to be clear that I think she is entitled to her opinion.  Everyone is and as a lawyer of course she can offer her opinion as a lawyer.  However, I want people to understand who she is and her background before running around and citing her as an expert.

The first thing to know about Ms. Soares is her background.  First, she graduated law school from *University of the Pacific* in 2009.  That's not a typo, she graduated law school last year.  She attended undergrad from 2002 - 2005 at UCal Davis.  The math on that is correct as well, she finished her BA in 3.3 years.  A point she seems to be very proud of.  

Before graduating she was an intern in the public defenders office.  

Why does her background matter?  Because she is offering opinions of legal theory and future interpretations.  She gets very defensive if you challenge her credentials and says things like...

""I simply claimed that 3 years of schooling and 8 months of practice gave me ample time to see the effect of prohibition and poorly written laws in the judicial system.""

I disagree.  The judicial decisions that matter are going to happen on an appellate level, not the trial court level.  She is not an appellate lawyer, she is a trial court lawyer.  

The second thing that is important to know about Ms. Soares is what she does now.  Currently according to her LinkedIn page she is working for herself.  Her line of work is medical marijuana.  Some items from LinkedIn:

-Law office specializing in medical cannabis and criminal defense representation.
""
Medical cannabis representation:
- drafting and filing corporation documents
- act as agent for service processes as well as agent for neighborhood complaints as required by many city ordinances
- draft, file, and represent clients in obtaining seller's permits, business licenses, and board of equalization permits
- represent clients during lease and/or employment negotiations
- representation of patients fighting city and/or county ordinances that limit access to medication
- legal training for employees of collectives/dispensaries
- mock raid training""

This screams conflict of interest.  If Prop 19 passes her business will be impacted.  With real legalization, many if not most of the people using the medical marijuana system in Cali will stop.  This means less need for her services.  

[LinkedIn Screencap](http://i.imgur.com/RpTrb.png)

tldr: Jennifer Soares is neither experienced nor objective enough for people to take seriously.  Stop feeding the troll who just wants to keep her payday coming.

**Edit 1:** You may also notice from her LinkedIn page that she is ""Chief Legal Counsel"" for VibeNation Multimedia.  A quick look into them shows the owner is Susan Soares.  Either that's a remarkable coinciedence or their is some nepotism going on.

Also, here is the website for vibenation media... http://www.vibenationmultimedia.com/

**Edit 2:** [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/prop19/comments/crudi/who_is_jennifer_soares/c0urww0) is a comment from someone who says they went to school with her, along with their opinions on prop 19.

Fall semester this past school year I was in Production 2. The next semester I wanted to get into an Immersion class where I would be making commercials for downtown businesses in the city, so I had to talk to the head of the project (also my advisor) about it and she asked me to bring her my reel.

I showed her what was I thought was the best thing on it, and she in so many words told me it wasn't very good, and that I should take Production 2 and try again. Maybe I just took that too hard.

I haven't done any internships because me/my family is far from loaded and I have to work in the summer to be able to afford school.

I have a friend who just this year got his shit together and moved out to Arizona, where he's already landing work on legit short film shoots and going to a school where the profs have worked on real features.

I feel like I'm already way behind most of my classmates because I haven't done an internship and I can't get into any of the classes for people that are more skilled. I don't think I'm any good, I feel like I've wasted my college education on a pipe dream, and I'm wishing I would've just gone to school for generic shit so I could've landed some crappy office job after college. I am pretty depressed that I am just going to spend the rest of my life working in the factory I currently work at as a summer job.

Feels like all I have to look forward to is alcoholism.

Am I just being stupid?

TL;DR I feel like I suck and I've wasted my time in college and I'm not going to amount to anything in life."
cs69a,9,2010-07-21,I have made the biggest mistake of my life,halluz,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cs69a/i_have_made_the_biggest_mistake_of_my_life/,"I have been reading Reddit for a long time but this is my first post so.. go easy.

The short story is this: I dated my dream girl in college.  We dated for 2.5 years then I broke up with her as I was moving across the country for 3 months to do an internship.  In short, that was the biggest mistake of my life (breaking up with her, not the internship).  Fast forward 2 months to today: we're talking pretty frequently and for whatever reason she still loves me.  I'm still at my internship and I will be coming home in about a month.  Only in the past couple of days, however, did I truly realize what I had done to her when I broke up with her, and how truly incredible it is that she is still talking to me, and even more than that, saying that she still loves me.  

Before you all post ""you're an idiot for breaking up with her"" or ""you're stupid you deserve what you get"", I want to agree with those statements.  It was easily the worst decision I have ever made in my life, and I was unaware how much I took her for granted and how stupid I was being at the time.  I can't believe I couldn't see how much she loved and cared for me, and how blinded I was by my own selfish thoughts.  I've been battling with this whole situation in my mind all summer but only recently have I been able to really see it from her angle and know how terrible and selfish I have been.

I don't understand why she is still talking to me or how she could still love me after I have broken her heart, but she does, and I feel absolutely wretched for doing that to her, and I do still love her too.  Here's where the situation gets a little sticky.  Her dad absolutely hates me now.  He didn't like me before, but now he completely hates me, and for good reason.  He won't listen to anything she has said to him about us and refuses to be rational.  This leads to my two-part question:

How can I show her that I am genuinely sorry for what I did and that I feel absolutely terrible and I do love her in a way that isn't contrived or cliche, and **(more of the main question I seek to Ask Reddit), How do I deal with her dad?**

TL;DR: I broke up with my girlfriend, which was a mistake and now she still loves me but her dad hates me.  How do I deal with him?"
ct521,6,2010-07-24,"Alright, Fittit, I've got three weeks.  Let's do this.",andon,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ct521/alright_fittit_ive_got_three_weeks_lets_do_this/,"I've got three weeks until my girlfriend gets back from Lebanon.  She's been gone all summer visiting her brother and working on an internship, while I've been here trying to renovate the house and renovate myself before she gets back.    Here's the rub:  

I'm 5'11""-6' tall (depending on who's measuring,) I weigh (as of this afternoon,) 153.5lbs., and my body fat percentage is around 15.5% according to my Weight Watchers ConAIR scale (I'm not doing Weight Watchers, but it seemed like the best scale, unless anyone has any other suggestions - which I'm completely open to.)  If my scale is to be believed, I've lost somewhere around 14lbs. since the beginning of the summer, mainly through going to the gym at least three times a week, cycling, running, and eating less overall (summer has that effect on me.)  

I've also been a martial arts instructor (I have a black belt, but I haven't taught in a while,) and I used to skateboard religiously back in the day, so I've always kept fairly fit, or at least tried to.  As of recent I've worked up to running a full 5k at a time, usually in about 25 minutes or so.  I do body weight exercises (pull-ups, chin-ups, dips, etc.,) as well as squats and a few other things depending what I want to do.  Blah blah blah, here's my question:  

If I'm looking to drop to about or slightly below 10% body fat in the next three weeks, what's the best way to go about doing so, if it's even realistically possible?  Depending on my body fat percentage daily, that means anywhere from about 8-10lbs of fat that needs to be lost.  I should mention that I try and keep abreast of fitness literature, read /r/fitness daily, etc. as much as possible and so I know there is a difference between weight loss and fat loss, so I'm trying to approach this from all sides.  I also know that this is - given that the stars align - fairly realistic if I commit to it.  

So, what's the best way to do this?  Low carb/ketosis seems to be the most obvious choice, but I'm open to all options.  Should I up my 5k runs from three times daily to five or so times a week, while keeping my weight training at three days a week?  I'm fairly well built  (at least to where I'm happy,) so cutting I guess would be priority number one, I suppose.  

The best advice will be strictly adhered to, and I will update weekly (every Friday until the 13th, when she gets back.)  

[Here's me](http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs196.snc4/38163_633588736371_44011957_35595907_3334305_n.jpg).

Give me your best, /r/fittit, and thanks for reading this rambling.  

**TL;DR** I'm 5'11""-6', weigh 153.5 and have a body fat percentage of around 15.5% (if my scale is to be believed.)  How do I cut down to 10% or less body fat in three weeks?  This means losing roughly 8-10lbs.

**EDIT:** I am not dead set on losing this exact amount, etc.  I just want to know what I could/should do in the next three or so weeks to get closer to that goal.  Some pictures were also added [here](http://i.imgur.com/qCCfn.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/VnVWo.jpg).  

Also, the low/no carb/ketosis route seems to be the most likely way - thus far - to do this.  With that in mind, I need an exit strategy.  How do I go from two to three weeks of this regimen back to maintenance (for example,) without yo-yoing back to where I am now?  Any advice is greatly appreciated."
ctdx8,0,2010-07-24,JUST YOUR OVERLY FRIENDLY OPPORTUNISTIC ASSHOLE.,Ruthlesswords,writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/ctdx8/just_your_overly_friendly_opportunistic_asshole/,"It was the hottest summer on record for NYC, or so Al Roker told me in between awkward back-and-forth shout-a-logues with overenthusiastic tourists. Yet, there was no way I could walk out the door in shorts. I was deformed. Hideous. The masses would recoil in fear at the sight of my gnawed legs.

Bed bugs.



Until somewhere around the 20th bite, I was unaware that bed bugs actually existed outside of the common mantra for tucking children in at night:

""Good night, sleep tight, don't let the bed bugs bite!""

I'd like to know: what sick person decided that this was an appropriate part of their child's night time routine?

""Good night, sleep tight, don't let the flesh-shredding, blood-sucking parasites that are crawling all over your mattress latch onto that vulnerable, snoring bag of hemoglobin, otherwise known as your body, tonight!""

Scratching yet?

I was. My nightly routine as an intern was to come back to Brooklyn after a long workday, sweating through my jeans, strip naked in the bathroom and scratch like a flea-ridden mutt for twenty minutes while sobbing incoherently over the phone to Andrew about how I'd just have to sleep in the tub tonight because rubber-banding my socks over my pants and sleeping on an air mattress sealed with a plastic zipper bag in the middle of the kitchen was still no defense against these thirsty. mother. fucking. bugs.

The two girls who subleased the apartment to my roommates and me bragged about how they'd gotten all of their furnishings at a great price: For free! From the oh-so-sterile curbs of our Brooklyn neighborhood!

""You'd be amazed at what people throw out!"" they gushed after we'd already paid and signed on the dotted line.

'Amazed' wasn't the adjective I had in mind as I piled my entire wardrobe into the dryer to burn off any existing parasites before storing it all in garbage bags, which I would live out of for the remainder of my summer internship.

It hadn't taken more than one or two Google searches to find out that the apartment contained bed bugs.

During my search, I learned of the mind-fuckingly disturbing characteristics of the bed bug.

Here are some fun facts:

1. Bed bugs typically live in--you guessed it--BEDS!, but also infiltrate other furniture.
2. They feast on blood, first anesthetizing their victims with their spit, then sucking out life juice to their hearts' content.
3. They are dark red/ brown in color because they're full of your blood.
4. They communicate to other bedbugs through the use of pheromones: ""Hey guys, this twit passed out drunk and won't be waking for another 12 hours! Open bar to raid! Dibs on the aorta!""
5. When temperatures are colder, some bedbugs can survive for up to a year without eating. A year. I can't survive for more than 2 hours without tossing food to my gullet monster.
6. Bed bugs molt out of their skin at least 6 times before reaching fertile adult hood. Fucking. Sick.
7. Shells of their bodies, as well as their iron-laden blood poop, sink into your mattress, creating a visible brown line on the side: one of the clearest indications of infestation...aside from tiny blood smears on your sheets...yum.
8. Male bedbugs impregnate female bedbugs NOT by gentle woo'ing and tender love-making, but rather by stabbing them in the torso with razor sharp genitalia and depositing semen. ""You want kids? I'll give you kids... Ahhhhhhh! I. AM. SPARTACUUUUUUS!""
9. There has been a resurgence of bedbugs in NYC since gene mutations promoted the flourishing of pesticide-resistant bedbugs. This means that many can survive a bath of toxic chemicals as though it was nothing more than an aggressive facial.
10. One of the only surefire ways to kill bedbugs is to expose them to heat that's 115°F for no shorter than 7 minutes. (Aka--putting your clothes in the dryer...hence living out of sealed garbage bags.)
11. Because of international travelers from countries with less-expansive health department regulations, these little creatures are often stowaways and are making increasing visits to many Big City, USA hotels. They only ever come with one-way tickets.

In summary, bed bugs are hideous, opportunistic, impermeable assholes that make it their business to feast on the most vulnerable subjects: sleeping humans. And there's not a whole lot you can do to stop them.

That's how the psychosis sets in. By the 3rd month of being feasted on every night and waking up every morning with 20 new bites, I was losing my mind. The exterminators had been in an out with no results, pest bombs had no effect, I had spent weeks obsessively drying my clothes and thereby only having a handful that still fit, and Andrew had begun, weeks prior, to expect a phone call around the same time every day from his hyperventilating girlfriend. My body was riddled with old bite wounds and new bite marks. My legs were so ravaged, it took the better part of a year for the scars to fade.

The bedbug: a tiny creature with the immense capability of upsetting some primal balance within. It's a humbling and downright fucking miserable experience. I was lucky to escape the situation in one piece (minus a few hundred flesh nibblets), but it's instilled in me a paranoia of hotel floors, old mattresses and any piece of furniture salvaged from the curb.

I think my parents would be ok with me coming out. When I was 16 my dad gave me a talk about how one of his friends was gay and did not come out untill he was 30 and it ruined his life. Never had any other conversations about it with him.

Anyway, I've been a severe closet case. I really enjoy thinking about guys and girls. I realized a few weeks ago that I am indeed bisexual. I've always been effeminate. Sex with girls is great, but I've noticed I lust for intelligence within men. Does anyone else feel this way?

Anyway, I attend a university and I'm afriad that my coming out would negatily affect how people treat me. I'm in an engineering dicipline program in a smaller community. Also I graduate next year. I have an internship and I'm also concerned how I should approach this situation. It's a smaller town (20,000 people or so) and word gets around here. I'm not ashamed of who I am anymore, which is something that has made me feel better than ever.

I take a deep breath as the nerdy recruiter skims over my resume. I'm standing in a gym of my university for a career fair, hoping to get an internship for the summer.

He purses his lips to the side. ""I see here you know a little about Linux. What's your preferred distribution?""

""That's a tough decision, really. I've tried Slackware, openSUSE, different flavors of Debian and Ubuntu."" I scratch my freshly-shaven chin. ""Of all of them, I would definitely say I prefer Ubuntu. The ease of setup and out-of-the-box functionality allows me to focus on more important things, like working on my projects.""

His jaw twitches. ""Okay. Thanks for the resume and your interest. We'll give you a call later on.""

He smiles; I smile. I shake his hand, and walk away.

Six months later and no phone calls. I accept an internship with a different company, developing a web application for IE6, using ActiveX to connect to an Access DB client-side.To a point, I'm unhappy.

If a potential employer asks what your favorite Linux distribution is, should you be worried?

**TL;DR:**

Recruiter: ""Favorite Linux?""

Me: ""Ubuntu.""

Recruiter: ""Have a nice day.""

Did I do something wrong?

I love civil engineering but I'm running into a problem as my grad course date start draws nearer.  I'm going to be at college for 5 years no matter what to get my bachelors and by that time, if I stay on my current path, will have about 21 credits of 30 of a master's degree done (or I could take a semester off and just get bachelor's).  That is great and all, but I'm really unsure what I want to do after college.  While working for a top-notch firm and all that *is* appealing, I have so many other interests in so many things.  I feel as though getting a master's right away is smart, but I believe I would feel a significant amount of guilt **not** using it and going to work right away.  Additionally, the excess debt that the last year or year and half might cause me is also unattractive if I were to *not* use my degree.  My original plan before I started college was to work hard for a degree as a backup plan while pursuing things like music and other endeavors (like every other student probably).  I find that with the pressures of getting internships (which I do have, over a years worth) and making connections, I'm getting channeled more and more into a career right away out of college. 

This is pure madness right? I'm supposed to be grateful for my good fortune yeah?  I am though, believe me.  I switched from EE and have had everything fall in my favor seemingly with CE.

cuhdr,2,2010-07-27,Take an internship position even with a degree?  (Software/web development),f0xmulder,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cuhdr/take_an_internship_position_even_with_a_degree/,"I'll try to be as succinct as possible:

I graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering in May.  I currently live in Michigan but have been looking to move elsewhere because of the ridiculously bad job outlook here.  I've had a phone interview with a company in California a few weeks ago but they decided to ""hire internally"".  

There is a company about 10 minutes from my apartment that has an internship in web development/software engineering and I easily meet all of the requirements and the work seems genuinely interesting.  I'm confident enough in my resume and interviewing skills that if I get a call, I could get the job.  

This isn't a money issue but a practicality issue for me.  I'm getting to the point where I'm worried that I won't find a ""real"" job soon (I currently work for slightly above minimum wage position with near full-time hours) and that I should just get all of the directly related work experience that I can get (though I do have some from a self-started company, but I don't know how convincing that looks on a resume).  

A big part of the decision for me is the fact that my apartment lease ends in a little less than a month and if I don't find anything in that time, I'll move in with my parents to save money on rent.

If you were in my shoes, would you try for an internship, especially with it being in my neighborhood?  Furthermore, if I could get an internship across the country, should I go for it, even with the hike in moving and living costs?  At least here, I can fall back on moving back in with my parents if things turn really sour but if I moved across the country I'd probably be locked in a lease, somewhat frantic, having lost a lot of money due to moving.

Maybe this sounds like a silly question, but I guess I just don't know how realistic my chances are of getting a job.  I don't want to have taken an internship and then realized that I should have gotten a job offer somewhere had I just stuck it out a little longer.

Thanks!



tl;dr: Take an internship even though I have a degree just for some relevant work experience?"
cuoux,1,2010-07-28,"I'm stuck with a gym inadequately equipped for squats, deadlifts and power cleans until October... should I follow the weight machine program they gave me or try alternative free weight exercises?",Mordisquitos,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/cuoux/im_stuck_with_a_gym_inadequately_equipped_for/,"Long story short, I'm slightly overweight (1.75 m, 85 kg / 5 ft 9 in, 187 pounds) but not too unfit. I'm doing a summer internship in a different city and I joined the gym just below my workplace for convenience. The trainers gave me a pretty vanilla program, mostly consisting of Nautilus-style machines and some cardio to improve my general fitness.

However, that was before I decided to do free weights following the Starting Strength beginners program.

Now I've decided to do free weights, you could say I'm appalled at the weights section: there's no rack (only a Smith machine), no platform, no bumper plates, no standard height plates... and hardly enough floor space to do anything outside of a bench or the Smith machine. There's even a sign saying _""Please do not move the benches""_, so making some room would, in principle, be out of the question.

I'm certainly going to check out other gyms in the area but from what I've seen I very much doubt they'll be any better.

Anyway, it seems like if I don't find a gym with a decent weights section, my options are:

+ Continue the machine program they gave me until the end of September and join a decent gym when I get home. At least I'll lose some weight.

+ Start a weird version of Starting Strength with no proper squat or power clean, and probably no deadlift either. Can I replace these with dumbbell variations? Is _starting_ squats with a Smith Machine worse than doing no squats at all?

Just for the record, buying my own equipment is out of the question for the time being.

Thanks for the attention! If you would like any more details don't hesitate to ask."

I am writing in response on Company Name department Co-op position (Engineering Co-op ####). I believe that I have most requirements necessary for the job opening. I am interested in an engineering position this upcoming fall (after August 21 2010).


I currently am junior at the University of ########### and enrolled as a Mechanical Engineer student. I have completed the basic mechanical engineering classes (statics, dynamics, mechanics of material, science of material, fluids mechanics and thermodynamics). I have also taken three classes of drafting and computer aided design and engineering. Part of my degree has also made me take electrical and manufacturing classes. One of the larger aspects of the University ###########’s curriculum is that students get hands on experience and testing during laboratories. 


On my previews co-op I work with my mentor and CEO (of ###########) to design, develop and manufacture a “Load Limiter”. I have also worked with in a team of students and also work by myself. I am skill in two 3D CAD programs (AutoCAD Inventor and Dassault CATIA). I understand mechanical and electrical diagrams and I am capable of machining and wiring/soldering electrical component. 


I am a self-problem solver. During my free time I has develop my electronics, microcontrollers, and programing skills to develop an all-around engineering knowledge. My computer skills are higher than average and I am capable of picking up a new engineering drafting or 3D modeling software within a couple of days. I am specially skill with CATIA and AutoCAD inventor, but I have previously used Solidworks and Pro/E. 


I have worked both in an office environment and a machine shop environment. I understand all the aspects of designing, developing, manufacturing during my co-op and internships. Working in both the office and in a machine shop has given me better all-around knowledge of what is possible for a machinist to do and what engineer designer can produce. I also have great organizing and efficient work skills. 


I have attached my resume for your assessment. I would appreciate having the chance of talking with you about my chances of getting employed. I thank you for your time and would look forward to and opportunity of talking to you about a internship job this Fall 2010. 


Sincerely,
