Seeing as I did not do much during my intermission(nary?) period (Summers) in High School except Sleep, Eat, Play, and Lurk. I'm looking to go above and beyond in College!

My major is International Business and Global Management/International Relations with it all falling into a Pre-Law 
Track. However I'm still undecided. =)


I'm looking at internships and non-profit organizations and not necessarily volunteer organizations either.
 
(I also never do for-profit organizations if I could do a non-profit and Never Ever affiliate myself with a religious organization.)

E.G. NOLS, Americorps, Pathways (can't do Peace Corps). http://ylamerica.org/ Something akin to that.


TL;DR So r/College what are some good Non-Profit Non-Religious-Affiliated Summer Programs/Leadership Programs or even Programs in general that are hiding under my nose?

1hgh3g,5,2013-07-01,"There, it's off my chest. Finally.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hgh3g/there_its_off_my_chest_finally/,"So this is my story, it may not be great, exciting, or full of adventure like most other stories. But it's mine.

It all really fell apart way to early. I had the usual perils of any overweight child i'd guess, the mean comments, the awkward stares, getting thrown stuff after, good times. I won't say my childhood was ""bad"" in that sense, mom and dad seemed like they cared about my well being, fed me, clothed me, i had my own room. Really a painfully ordinary childhood to be honest, but there was always something. Something to get me down, to ruin my day, to make me rue my very existence. I never really thought anything about it, just chalked it up to whatever bad thing that happened the most recent. I would hit the proverbial wall, get (what at that point i just regarded as) ""super sad"" shut myself in for a couple of days, have some good cries and be no worse for the wear. For years this is how things was done, i didn't really have many friends but i have always had a close-nit group of acquaintances i held higher then the rest of the people i knew. Don't get me wrong these where, and some still are my very best friends in existence and i would gladly lay down my life to save each and every one of them. But as well as i know them, none of them really KNOWS me. I have been a shitty friend to each of them, never opening up, never really being fully myself. Always being happy and positive has been my gimmick, it has also been my bane. This is the story of a young adult starting to see life for what it is. 


First of all i was basically born overweight, i have no memories of not intensely hating the way i look. This naturally led to me having to go trough days and days of verbal abuse in all elements of school. Then add to the mix, concentration issues and a pinch of dyslexia and you really have yourself a winner in the boned for school department. I have never gotten officially diagnosed wit either ADD or ADHD, but i'm pretty sure my attention span should have lasted longer than 5 minutes at any given time. Now, as i have cried, shriek and shouted before, I think i  was 11 or 12 the first time i really got my first depression. I remember it somewhat well. I was in a large room full of people, I think it was band practice. When something happened, i'm no longer entirely sure what caused this oh so embarrassing scene, but i had a big fight with i believe my mother. With ended in me trying to strangle myself with my bare hands in the middle of the room. In front of everyone screaming "" I don't want to live anymore. Please just let me die."" Now this is not a thing a child should say or even think for that matter. I think that is when i let my darkness start to take control. Since then i have had what feels like a fist-sized black hole right inside of my plexus. Constantly trying to implode me, suck in and devour whatever feeling that tries to surface. Dictating my every move, feeling and mood my darkness slowly started to consume me.

It would be easy for me to blame my parents for dropping the ball, they seemed like they loved my brother more. Always giving inn to his demands and requests on a whim, giving him money, encouraging him in sports and school. Both of which he did exponentially better than me. I felt overlooked, even neglected to some point. they were aware of my presence to be sure and i have to think that they had my best interest in mind. But they never engaged me in anything, if i wanted to talk about something or there was something on my mind or bothering me i always had to come to them, make them listen to to me. Force them even. What initially tipped me of in my theories of being the less ""valued"" son was when my brother had a breakdown of his own and moved in with my sister. Immediately my old folks was all over him, showering him in therapy options and late night talks. I cannot deny the feeling of despair that followed, and the questions my feeble young mind could not find the answers to; why was he getting help and not me? How do they not see that i am struggling when they see right through him?  Why am i less loved? All those questions only had one answer graspable by me, they should have stopped at one. They regret that i exist. I have always had an inferiority complex regarding my older brother and you might say that it makes my opinion biased, but that is how i felt and to some degree still do as he is in fact more successful and in touch with our parents than i am. But i'm not going to do that, i won't blame them for problems i had that i would not share to save my own life, how should they have known? 

I have never been a ""normal"" child. I never liked sports, I have had no more than 5 friends at any given time and i was mostly shut into my own head dealing with my feelings to make sure nothing but happiness and bliss made it to the surface for the world to see. I don't remember why it was this way, why i immediately choose to hide my negative feelings. Denying them, even denouncing their very existence, but it seemed to be working. I got less picked on in school, my friends at the time actually seemed genuinely happy to spend time with me. Then i turned 15 and had my first drink, oh boy did that turn my world around. I now had access to a magical brew that could release me from the crushing shackles of self-control. And if i slipped and accidentally let on that i wasn't doing so good i could just blame it on the alcohol and everyone would be like ""yeah, i guess you where pretty shitfaced last night."" This eventually led me to hide even more. Now i didn't want to feel at all and worked hard devising a mental shield that would protect me from any and all feelings. Sadly, i succeeded. My darkness had finally instated itself as my core believes.

This went on until i was 17, when i met my first serious girlfriend.  We enjoyed the same things, rather she was enjoying the things i pretended to enjoy. She to was kinda fat and friendless so for the first time in my life i met someone i could relate to, i even tried opening up, telling her of my childhood perils and my inability to feel certain things like joy and happiness. She understood, told me she to had psychological issues and that we should stick together and try to fix one another. Turns out she had way more issues than i had and the relationship i had bet all my marbles on was slowly turning abusive and bad. The first year was all fine an dandy i got laid for the first time, i had someone to talk to, relate to. I had someone i could help with my previous experiences. I was doing ok for the first time in years. We bonded and i eventually felt loved by her i even loved her back. Then things got sour, we started arguing more and more. Well, not exactly. She argued and i pretended to listen and understand these feelings she described that i knew nothing about. One particular night we had a huge quarrel ending in she showing me really how fucked up she really was when she locked herself in the bathroom and took a razor to her arm while shouting trough the door about how i did this to her, how i drove her to self-mutilation. Was it my fault? Maybe, i don't really remember much of that night. But this might have been the first time my inability to empathize had consequences on the people around me, the people i supposedly loved. That is when i started faking it. Every feeling, mood and action became a game, a game i was already to good at playing. We talked about what had happened, hashed it out real good so we could move on, be stronger and love each other for ever and ever until the end of times. What followed was as far from love you could get. The abuse continued somewhat less intense, every time we had an argument she would threaten to cut herself, she was begging me not to make her do this. Not to make her hurt herself more, like it was my choice. The only thing i found that worked is total and utter silence. Only sounds i would make in these brawls was ok, yes and i'm sorry. 
It went on like that for half a year ish i belive untill she rang me up one day and broke up. And i felt nothing, not even a sliver of emotion, not sadness, not relief that it was over, no happines. Nothing. That's when i had my first dangerous breakdown. Enraged by my self inflicted inability to feel anything at all i took a knife to my arm, not to kill myself, but to inflict pain. 46 cuts later and it had ran it's course leaving me with a room full of blood and a arm not fit for human viewing. Fun summer wearing nothing but sleeves. I wore bandages the first days, i remember people asking if i was all right and what had happened to my arm. I just feed them some bullshit story about how the fan-belt on a car i was working on snapped and lashed up my arm. And they bought it. Now i had a reason for my scars, but no reason to make any more.
A week later she rang me again going on and on about how she was wrong and how sorry she was for what she had done. Like the sucker i was i got roped in again. I was imprisoned by the thought that this was it, this was my one shot at love and if this wouldn't work nothing would. I would be alone forever. Naturally the abuse continued. The self mutilation went on depending on my degree of despair at any given moment. But i always cut the same spot, opening old wounds again and again not to get caught. I remember my mother asking me one summer night what had happened to my arm, and in an act of insanity or clarity not really sure i told her i did it because i was bored and couldn't sleep. When my mother responded ""oh"" and went on with her business i knew i all hope was gone, who would listen if not my own mother? Nobody cared.

Then the army came calling. Where i'm from military duty is mandatory  for all able bodied men after the age of 18 so when i got drafted it wasn't much i could do about it. But hey, it would get me far, far away from my mentally abusive girlfriend at the time. Army was great i met allot of people, people that could have been my friends if i let them. Of course at this point i had mastered my game of no feels so i all indid was fake and i cared about these people so i stopped myself from leading them on, dont let ppl close to you and they don't get hurt when you shut down. It was win, win. I thought 6 months into my service i found the strength to leave her. I broke up with my girlfriend of two years by text. This off course left me emotionally barren and self loathing  like never before.
I never really considered suicide to be an option until i was discharged from the army, at least when i was there i had some sort of purpose. I had thought of it to be sure, fantasized about it even. But never really committing to it  thinking it had to get better, how could it possibly get any worse? Then i got home to find out i had been properly boned by the firm that supposedly was going to give me an internship when i was done in the army. Basically leaving me with a useless education. It was a long and painful spiral deep down into a dark abyss of my mind i have sworn never to revisit. I came up with an ingenious plan to end my life. And for the first time i really committed to the though of killing myself. I was even looking forward to the sweet relief death would bring with it. I consider myself above averagely clever so i knew a conventional suicide with a note explaining this was my choice and no one is to blame would only leave blame and heartache in my wake. So i decided to re-enlist in the army. Re-enlist as a professional soldier going to Afghanistan to clear mines and ied's as a combat engineer. Only to get myself killed. This would have left my family with a generous check from the government, no cost in funeral services and an image of their son that died a hero defending freedom. Maybe even a sense of pride for their son, the screw-up. Not a cowardly suicide. I sent my application and started exercising to meet the physical requirements. 2 weeks later and i got a letter in return telling me the army would let me try out as a soldier. I was so close to my goal of ending this miserable excuse of an existence. Then i went for one last hurrah at a festival and met the love of my life. 

Maybe to be continued. The next part is still to fresh to write about without me ending up in fetal position around a whisky bottle"
1hgfee,17,2013-07-01,Not quite sure what I'm doing wrong here...,[deleted],GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1hgfee/not_quite_sure_what_im_doing_wrong_here/,"Before I begin, I will state that I am currently employed, but I'm seeking a job with better pay and to try and better my credentials. Essentially, I'm at a dead end job in my field where I cannot move up the ladder, and I'm barely making ends meet financially. 

That being said, I've been with my company for three years, and I have a degree in my field along with internship and volunteer experience. My previous job was at a retail establishment I worked at for 8+ years. My degree is in education, but given the area I'm in, it is loaded with individuals with education degrees (there are seven colleges within an hour drive of where I live which all have education programs). I'm trying to utilize my degree in alternate methods (technical writing, corporate training, etc, etc). 

I've been religiously writing resumes, CV's, checking Monster, LinkedIn, and Craigslist daily, and I've lost count of the number of applications in total I've sent to locations (definitely more than 20-30+ in a month time span recently). I've had one call back, but my gut told me something shady was going on with it (it was a job I found through Craigslist) so I didn't go in for the interview. The other response was an e-mail from a company stating that I wasn't going to be considered for an interview, and two weeks later saw the position freshly posted on Monster. 

I'm not quite sure what I'm doing wrong. I've taken a huge amount of advice from resume building websites, articles, etc, when crafting my resume (it's basic look is what I used to get my current gig). Each of my cover letters is catered to whomever I'm applying for, etc, etc. The only two things I can possibly think of is first the company I work for I've found out doesn't have as great a reputation as I thought when I accepted the job. In networking, I've met a number of people whose first reaction to where I work is, ""I'm sorry"" and then they spout a slew of negative things about my company. And the second is that a recent company policy prevents supervisors from giving references, they are merely allowed to state if someone works there or not. 

I'm not quite sure what I'm doing wrong, but if anyone has some insight, or things I'm possibly missing, it'd be a great help!"
1hg9y0,0,2013-07-01,My boyfriend [21/m] and I's [19/f] 3 1/2 year relationship went from perfect to on the rocks again out of no where,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hg9y0/my_boyfriend_21m_and_is_19f_3_12_year/,"My boyfriend and I have been on and off for about 3 1/2 years now.  We were apart for almost 6 months, dated other people, and have been steadily back together for almost 5 months now.  One of the biggest things that used to upset me about our relationship was the amount of affection he showed me and the amount of time he wanted to spend with me.  Once we got back together again, everything was absolutely perfect.  Both of us were extremely happy, he was giving me most of his free time and doing everything he possibly good to be the best boyfriend. We had no problems.

About a month ago he got an internship with a big accounting firm and I was so happy for him.  The internship lasts until the end of July so he is half way done.  I did not expect him to make such a close group of friends and to be spending so much of his time with them (both males and females).  I got very jealous about one of the girls there and still am a little, I trust him completely but my jealousy got the best of me and I overreacted multiple times and flipped out on him making him upset.  He is now afraid to tell me things because he thinks i will start a fight and get very upset.  Lately, everything has been different with us, no cute texts or dates, we are barely talking  because he is so busy with work and his friends and it upsets me greatly at how little I am now seeing him.  He goes to school in Connecticut so this summer is very important to me for time we can spend together.

In the beginning of the summer, he told me how important time with me was and that he would pick me over anyone.  I know he has a lot of people to see now and little time to split it but i feel less important lately.  He recently suggested a break until his internship is over but i DO NOT want to do that I just want things back to normal which is what I have tried doing.  He has barely been talking to me and when he does it feels more like im talking to a friend.  He fought so hard to get me back but seems very preoccupied with this internship now instead of me. 

I need to know if i am overreacting/if this break would be a bad or good idea.  I really just want my happy fun relationship back with my boyfriend, he is the love of my life and I know we can get through anything. It just seems like literally in the matter of 3-4 days everything changed drastically and I am left upset and worried. Please help.

As sort of a preface, I’ll say hi. You may remember me as the one that nearly [shit themself](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1doky4/tifu_by_being_a_dumb_shit_and_overloading_on_poop/) from a combination of a metric asston (pun? No pun? Relevant unit of measurement?) of Fiber One bars, laxative, and lactose goodness. As an update on that, I’m obviously still living and my intestines didn’t leak out my ass. I consider this a good thing. However, it took 7 days for my bowels to move those bars through me, and when it finally happened I discovered the mystery behind the creation of Stonehenge. I shat a monolithic fiber block so big I could not hardly push it out, so dense it would not dissolve with multiple flushes and so heavy it took two hands to lift. I understand the miracle of childbirth, but I digress. On to bigger and better fucks 

**Background**

This is all relevant I promise. I’m going to keep it as concise as possible so it doesn’t get *too* long. It’s just an unfortunate collection of events transpiring to create a much larger monstrous escapade of upfuckery. A rendezpoo, if you will. 

I.

So I work at a healthcare type company, let’s call it Joobly Goop. Now I’ve been working in Joobly Goop’s IT department for a few years now. I’m a pretty good worker. I know saying that is generally not a good worker thing to do, but I get all my work done, don’t dick around, stay late to finish projects, and help whenever I can. Sometimes I even remember to restock the cokes in the fridge. I have no issues to record. Until now. 

II. 

I have had on and off clam infections for about 7 weeks now. I have had swamp-poon for so long that I’m almost expecting a dragonsnake to lunge out at my face, grab me and make me disappear up my own vagina every time I bend over. Anyway, I just started taking my most recent antibiotic, Metronidazole, which is specifically for lower abdominal infections.  It also is specifically for ripping through my stomach, intestines, hopes and dreams. I have always been sensitive to all types of antibiotics, but this particular kind is like getting butthumped in reverse. 

III. 

Over the course of this spring, they hired this new intern guy. For the sake of privacy I’ll call him Wonderchild, because I secretly already do. Now this guy is a proper asshat. He is the rhinestoned and floral scented sombrero of asshats, because for some reason he’s so fabulous and his shit just don’t stink. This guy comes in at 9 and leaves at 3, taking an hour for lunch in between. Plus, he’s never around his desk when you need him. This isn’t why he’s an asshat, but it certainly contributes. 

IV. 

I got moved teams recently, to help pick up some of what mine now is doing. It’s not bad, except I wasn’t too knowledgeable on their particular scent of IS. No big deal. I integrated pretty well, was pretty quiet etc. But this time I stuck out like an awkward pubescent boner through athletic shorts. I was the turd that streaked the perfectly bleached tighty-whities of the corporate office. 


**The Convergeance** 

On to the main act. The best of the best of the worst of my life, lightly frosted with shit and dusted with crushed dignity. So the company I work for manages hospitals. Each hospital has a couple servers in the data center for bills, patient records, e-mail, et al. 

I never work with virtualization. I was used to set-ups, but not maintenance. So a lot of these servers have virtualized partitions for some of the services (I still don’t fully understand this, make note that this is only my 4th week on this team). You have to use software to manage them. So my job was to run patches on this one cluster of servers that belongs to some hospital somewhere in [Redacted]. 

So I’m sitting here running patches while Wonderchild is supposed to be looking over my shoulder, since, even though he’s an intern, no one wants to fuck with my training and just gave it to him to supervise me. However, he wasn’t supervising, because this tampon of a man chucked deuces right after I started and did his famous vanishing act. The fucker is harder to find than Houdini and I was half expecting to pull him out of my pocket. Mistake #1. 

So I’m basically sitting there, minding my business. I start a new patch and it’s like ’13 hours left’. Damn patch, you thirsty. So I leave it to its devices in the virtual center while I work on something else. I’m typing away when my stomach decides to offer its opinion on the matter with a *squeeeeeee*.  “Hm, that was weird.” 

Keep typing. Then the next sound I heard resonating through my poop chute was only what I think translates from Stomachese to something like “HEY CUNTFUNGUS, DID I FUCKING STUTTER?” because it was a low tone, a husky roll of a noise, like the trills on a snare being replicated by Barry White’s vibrato, only much much less pleasant because it quickly escalated into a “WOOOOOOHHHHHHH” kind of like a boat horn. I knew I had to get the fuck out of there and down the hall to the bathroom.  One problem, I'm not supposed to leave the servers up if I'm not working on them and no one else is around to watch them. So I paused the patches and locked my computer, very determined not to soil my freshly dry-cleaned work pants, and galloped on air to all the way to the restroom. Mistake #2

The assplosion was intense. Sweat beading down my forehead. I was in legitimate pain. I felt like I was holding my ass’s hair back while it puked after a regretful night. And in between pukes it would try and reassure me like “it’s ok honey I think I’m almost d-“ *BLEEEH*. I felt sorry for the person that came to use the restroom as well, because it was quickly becoming noxious in there. So much so that I considered notifying the Environmental Protection Agency.  When I emerged, my manager looked concernicus, but whatever, he's a manager something probably happened because something always happens. There’s always some TweedleTwat that is like “hurrduurrr” and fucks something up. 

But then the rest of my team was scurrying around like ""what the shit omg"" like someone just put a puppy down right in front of them or something. So I was now curious. I walked up and asked one of them what was wrong and he said in a very exasperated tone, “Operations in [Redacted] went black.”

Oh fuck me gently with a chainsaw. What I said was, “Oh no, that’s not good.” What I was thinking was ""oh my fucking shit what did I do"". I tried not to look too conspicuous as I pretty much lunged myself at my computer and unlocked it. When I finally saw what had happened I almost shit myself a SECOND time. 

Instead of pausing the patches, in my haste I disabled the cluster completely. And since they were mid-patch, the drives got corrupted. When the dust settled and we all got busy working on how to actually FIX the issue, my manager just looked at me and shook his head. 

I was that TweedleTwat. I fucked up. 

**TL;DR** Maybe I should work in business. 

Edit: Before anyone asks, I didn't kill anyone. They have paper copies of patient records. "
1hg34v,36,2013-07-01,Thank you to Riot and all NA LCS players and casters for an amazing weekend!,porcupineracetrack,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1hg34v/thank_you_to_riot_and_all_na_lcs_players_and/,"MLG Anaheim was my first LAN event, and it was amazing. I've only been playing for about a year, but ever since I watched the Season 2 Worlds I've wanted to attend live. Watching LCS every week made me wish for an NA audience, and this weekend it was granted! Everyone involved went above and beyond expectations for the fans.

Players: Thank you for spending every spare moment offstage with us. You were constantly signing autographs, taking pictures, and even just chatting with fans. I was amazed by how accessible everyone was, and how much you seemed to enjoy the interaction. Shout out to Dyrus- even though I didn't meet you, I was especially impressed by your patience. You had a huge line of people waiting for you, and you expertly moved them to a better location and met with each one. In addition players- you worked your asses off and gave us some of the best games I've ever seen. 

A special thanks to Complexity, whom I met after their well-fought loss to FXO. Most people were asking for photos/autographs after wins, but I happened to get you after a defeat. You were still smiling, joking, and were such all-around awesome people. I can't wait to see you guys play again!

Casters: You also earned your paychecks this weekend. You looked a little strange walking around in suits amidst a sea of Teemo and Rammus hats, but damn did you make it look good. Your energy was incredible, and you kept a crowd of thousands pumped for 3 days, which is not an easy task. Thank you Riv, Jatt, Kobe, Phreak, and guest-star Optimus Tom.

Riot: Have you seen what havoc you have wrought upon the world? It was great to see Riot employees and interns followed around like celebrities, and kudos to thinking up great questions for skin codes. Ryze himself even made an appearance: posing for pics, signing autographs, and offering career advice to those who asked. If this is the current state of League as an e-sport, I can't wait to see what the future holds.

A final thank you to all my fellow Summoners, for being incredible people this weekend. You were kind and hilarious, and it was so much fun to sit with you and talk League. See you all on the Rift!

I'm here today to talk to you about not dropping your laptop.

So the same user from ""What did I Just telll you..."" came to my cube this morning after the move with her laptop.  She has it on the select boot device screen.  Only the Optical Drive and Network adapter are listed.  So I power it down and boot to internal Hard Drive diag.  Of course the diagnostic couldn't run because the hard drive was thoroughly deceased.  Having enough to tell me what needs to happen I directed the user to go to our actual help desk room (which I don't sit at on Mondays) to obtain a loaner laptop as I don't keep them in my cube.  The user just stands there staring at me.  So again I said ""I don't keep any loaners down here you'll have to go up stairs.""  The user then says ""There's only one lady up there.""

To give you some background, my Front Line support team consists of myself, an Intern, a contract sysadmin, and a full time Graduate.  The Graduate is the lady.  She still has a bit to learn, but that's why we're rotating her through the different IT groups before she gets a permanent seat.

Anyway, the user had absolutely 0 confidence in my graduate's ability to get the issue fixed.  The user kept constantly asking for me, unfortunately my Monday mornings are packed full of conducting IT orientations which is why I'm not in the hot-seat on Mondays.

Still though, it's depressing that even a female user has no faith in a female IT admin to fix her issue.

tl;dr Female user doesn't want help from female IT admin.  Apparently I'm also mommy, daddy, teddy bear, and binky all rolled into one."

1hfyl5,78,2013-07-01,"F/5'10/28, from 215 to 180...and now losing motivation!",viceadvice,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1hfyl5/f51028_from_215_to_180and_now_losing_motivation/,"Hi everyone!

This is my first time posting. I have been chubby and fat my entire life, until I went to college and started to make better eating choices and exercise. I still yo-yo'd as I navigated the stressors of college and internships.

During grad school, I packed on another 10 or so pounds, officially reaching my highest weight of 219. It wasn't until a year later, when my boyfriend of 6 years unceremoniously dumped me, that I felt motivated to go back to the gym.

I started working out pretty much daily for a year. I went from 219 to 185, mostly through spinning, elliptical and circuit training. I then hit a plateau for a few months. I bounced back by working more intensely, doing high intensity intervals, completing the Insanity program, and training with a personal training for 10 weeks. I went from 185 to 177. My ideal weight is somewhere between 170-175.

Here are a few before and after photos: http://imgur.com/a/nryCQ

For the last few months, however, I've noticed I've become very lazy. I'm making sloppy food decisions, I skip the gym more often than not (not because I don't have time but because I want to sleep-in!) and my ill-thought plan to minimize my bulky leg muscles by not cycling or doing strength training for awhile has made my body untoned and unshapely. I used to love working out and I was very disciplined. Now I feel lethargic and unmotivated.

I have felt pretty bad about myself these last few months. I've only put on maybe 7 pounds (I'm about 182 now), but that's not the part that bothers me: being lazier, flabbier and less fit than I used to be is what really makes me upset. There's no good reason for it, either. I have all the knowledge, time and resources to get fit again. So why am I not doing it?

I guess what I need is a pep talk, and someone to give feedback on my plan. I plan to start being more mindful of what I eat, and cut out extraneous noshing and snacking. I think if I return to high intensity interval work (e.g. sprint intervals on the treadmill) and add back some strength training instead of just endurance cardio, I can start to see results. I'm worried about gaining back (in my opinion) unattractive leg muscles but I don't like my legs as they are now, either. Maybe I will just never have skinny legs; it's probably not in my genes to be lithe or thin.

Thanks for listening, really! Any advice, encouragement or help you can give would be so appreciated. It would be nice just to hear that other people have these ups and downs, but that you can pull yourself out of a down.

TL;DR: I want to get back on track with my weight loss!"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[I suspect you come across a lot of political nuance in your work.  I don't really understand who is opposing marijuana legalization anymore.  The libertarian slant on both sides in America seem to be for it.  Who is the major force behind prohibition these days?  The corporate prison lobby?  The church?  anyone else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catt2p2?context=5)|Our opponents vary.  Demographically, we get the least support among conservatives, Republicans and people over the age of 65, although the polls indicate that support for marijuana and other drug policy reform is growing rapidly even among those groups.
 |With marijuana legalization, the prison guard unions and private prison corporations have not really been all that involved in opposing our efforts.  It's more the police chiefs who get bent out of shape on this issue.  The prison industrial interests are most active in opposing our efforts to reduce incarceration of people arrested for low level drug offenses.  They killed us when we tried to reform California's prison system back in 2008 with Prop 5.
 |But, I'll tell you, our most forceful and duplicitous opponents are the prosecutors, and for them it's not really about $$$ but about power - their inter-personal power in the criminal justice system, their power to coerce people to inform on friends and family members, their desire for the power that comes from winning higher political office, and so on.  And they often oppose everything -- not just marijuana legalization, but needle exchange programs to reduce AIDS, and Good Samaritan laws to reduce OD fatalities, and alternatives to incarceration.  It's remarkable how uncountable prosecutors have become in our American system of (in(justice)!
[Are there any politicians currently in office who you think really do care about the interests of the people and put that first, instead of worrying more about public image and political considerations? If so, who?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catry0v?context=5)|Yes I do.  When it comes to drug policy, most of the gutsy folks are in state legislatures, but as for members of Congress, keep your eye on Steve Cohen from TN, Beto O'Rourke from El Paso, Hakeem Jeffries from NYC, Jared Polis from Co, Earl Blumenauer from OR and most of the others who have been willing to step out on marijuana reform and prison reform etc.  Quite frankly I also think that Nancy Pelosi has provided relatively good leadership on our issues.
[Is it dangerous to publicly promote the legalization and regulations of drugs? Are there any threats from criminal organisations, who don't want to lose their market?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/cats7qc?context=5)|I don't think it's dangerous, especially in the US, and I have not seen fellow reformers even in Mexico get threatened by drug traffickers for our sort of advocacy.
 |I must admit I used to worry a little more about folks in law enforcement coming after me -- especially back in the late 80s and early 90s when I was just starting to speak out, and only a few years earlier had had a security clearance and had been interviewing DEA and other federal police agents all over the world.  But nothing happened back then, and I don't see it happening now.
 |I guess the interesting question will be when legalization starts to become a real possibility in Mexico and people start fighting over who will get the profits from legal marijuana.  But at least until then I think we're OK.
[, you are a hero. Question: Do you suggest championing ""jury nullification"" to the masses? Or is that just not going to end the drug war machinery?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catt87c?context=5)|Yes it is a very good idea to make more people aware of the jury nullification  option.  While it admittedly has an ugly history with all white juries in the Jim Crow South using it to acquit people accused of lynching and other race-based crimes, I believe it is used primarily these days by jurors who think the current drug laws are unjust and even unnecessary.  More people need to know about this option, and to exercise this right when they get called to serve on a jury.
 |I think Steve Silverman and Flex Your Rights, who did that excellent video on how not to get arrested when you're stopped by the police, has something in the works on this issue, which should be excellent.
[Do you believe that drug use would increase, decrease, or stay the same if the bans were lifted?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catsfav?context=5)|Much depends on how one removes the ban.  The best evidence shows that removing the penalties on possession of small amounts for personal use, while keeping in place the prohibitions on production and sale, has no impact on levels of consumption.  But it does reduce the number of people being arrested, reduces the harms of illicit drug use, and allows addiction to be treated as a health issue rather than a criminal justice issue.
 |With respect to legalization of marijuana, my best guess is that we will see some increase in the number of consumers because it will be easier to obtain and probably less expensive than it is now.  But I think the increase will happen not so much among young people -- who already have incredibly easy access to marijuana -- and more among older people who find they prefer it to alcohol or pharmaceuticals.
 |As for the other drugs, take a look at what the Europeans have done with prescribing pharmaceutical heroin to people who have been addicted to street heroin.  There you see no overall increases in use -- in fact, quite the opposite.
[Ethan,](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/cats151?context=5)|It's easiest with marijuana -- and basically involves making the historical comparison to alcohol Prohibition.  That whether one likes marijuana or hates it, the fact of the matter is that marijuana prohibition works no better than alcohol Prohibition did, and is generating many of the same sorts of negative consequences that Prohibition did back then. I can tell you from our research in doing marijuana reform efforts that the two arguments that appeal most strongly to people who are on the fence about legalizing marijuana are 1) better to allow the police to focus on real crime than to keep wasting time and resources arresting young people for marijuana; and 2) that it would far better for state and local governments to regulate and tax marijuana than to effectively leave the ""regulation"" and profits to organized and unorganized criminals. My principal personal motivation for doing what I do has more to do with seeing this issue as one of human rights, but I find that is not the sort of argument that appeals to most people in the middle on this.
[I run into this problem a lot. I feel as though my views are solid and backed with evidence but any time I try to explain it to someone , the idea of regulating dangerous drugs sounds so ludicrous that anyone in a discussion seems to react with gut feelings and not following through with logic. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/cats151?context=5)| 
[What country's drug policy model, or hypothesized model do you think would be ideal for the States?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catswsv?context=5)|I think the first country to provide a model was The Netherlands, which introduced the quasi-legal regulation of retail sale of cannabis through the ""coffee shop"" system with substantial success back in the late 70s and early 80s; and which also was just about the first to introduce needle exchange and other harm reduction programs to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS by and among injecting drug users thirty years ago.
 |The second model is Switzerland, which really took the lead twenty years ago in creating heroin maintenance programs to reduce the health and public safety problems associated with illegal heroin use in street drug markets. That model has now been adapted in Germany, Denmark, The Netherlands, the UK and to some extent in other countries as well, not least because it has proven so effective in reducing not just the health harms associated with heroin, but also drug related arrests and crime as well as criminal justice costs.
 |The third model is Portugal, which I describe elsewhere in this AMA. If you want to know more take a look at the academic analysis published a couple of years ago in the British Journal of Criminology by Alex Stevens and Caitlin Hughes.
 |Finally, when it comes to marijuana policy the fact of the matter is that the United States has really emerged as the global leader - obviously not at the level of the federal government, but very much so at the level of civil society and state government. That said, keep you eye on Uruguay, as I said elsewhere in this AMA.
[New synthetic drugs are all the rage nowadays. These compounds are generally available for years before they can be made illegal and there's literally hundreds that become available each year, it would seem this is an especially hot area on the prohibition debate. Often these carry greater risks than traditional illicits. What is your tact when discussing these in the context of prohibition over the entire spectrum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catsg8q?context=5)|The key is keeping our eyes focused on safety -- making sure that people, especially younger people, who use these substances don't get hurt.  i am proud that last month DPA co-hosted, for the first time, the annual international club health conference, which was held for the first time in the US.
 |I am really struck by what New Zealand is trying to do.  Synthetic drug use is a big issue there, and the government is now moving forward with a bill to allow synthetic recreational drugs to go thru an approval process much like the process that other drugs go through.  That means that a drug used primarily for recreational purposes will have a chance of being legally approved and regulated, just like other drugs, if it can establish its safety margin.  This could well be in effect by the fall.
[Ethan, I appreciate your time.  Do you think it would expedite the process of ending federal cannabis prohibition if a midwest state like Missouri was to pass a legalization initiative?  T ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catstag?context=5)|Absolutely, yes. Midwest or even more so in the South, where Missouri sort of is.
[What are your thoughts on the ""Three Strikes"" laws concerning drug cases? Thanks for the AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/cats9dc?context=5)|I was delighted that DPA was able to help with the ballot initiative in California last November -- Prop 36 -- that reformed the notorious 3 strikes law in that state, and that won with more than 2/3 of the vote.  Now the challenge is getting the law implemented effectively and passing similar sorts of laws in other states.   
[Have you ever done drugs? Remember BE HONEST!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/cats1ld?context=5)|Yes, and you can read about it in Rolling Stone's recent profile of me ([Link to www.rollingstone.com](http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/ethan-nadelmann-the-real-drug-czar-20130606) and also in the interview that came out yesterday in The Fix ([Link to www.thefix.com](http://www.thefix.com/content/ethan-nadelmann-drug-policy91855).)
[1\) Are there people that helped enforce drug laws, or even write them, that are now opposed to them and working to change them?  2\) As a student without much money or power, how can I get involved?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catsqze?context=5)|Re 1), take a look at the organization, LEAP, which is doing great work organizing mostly former law enforcement officers who now oppose drug prohibition.
[How do you answer to claims that marijuana is a gateway drug or is as harmful as harder drugs? I know there are some studies disproving these claims but none, to my knowledge, officially funded by the government.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catsq2n?context=5)|Actually there are lots of government studies and government funded commissions that establish that marijuana is not a gateway drug and is in fact less harmful than many other drugs, including the legal ones. Take a look, for instance, at the National Academies of Sciences report on medical marijuana back in the late 1990s, which said clearly that there is no evidence for the gateway effect of marijuana. MY view on the gateway theory is that it is an ounce of truth embedded in a pound of bullshit. On the one hand most people who use heroin or cocaine tried marijuana first, but it's also the case that they tried alcohol and cigarettes first as well. On the other hand, the vast majority of people who use marijuana never go on to use cocaine or heroin or methamphetamine or even to get in trouble with marijuana. That's why my old friend Lynn Zimmer once said that trying to prevent heroin addiction by focusing on marijuana use is like trying to reduce motorcycle fatalities by discouraging bicycle riding.
[Does Drug Pollicy Alliance promote any kind of drug policy reform outside the U.S? Do you have plans to create an office in Latin America? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catscmm?context=5)|Yes, we're doing more and more work throughout the Americas.  I've been quite deeply involved in Canada over the years, advising the past four mayors of Vancouver, testifying before the Canadian Senate and now doing everything I can to bring attention to the atrocious drug policies of the Harper govt.
 |I and DPA have also been deeply involved with the Latin American and Global Drug Policy Commissions, co-chaired by former presidents Cardoso, Gaviria and Zedillo, helping advise and publicize their work.  And last year I had a chance to meet directly with Colombian president Santos, Guatemalan president Perez Molina and Mexican president Calderon, the first two of whom are remarkable allies in calling for new drug policies, and even Calderon was interesting on the issue.
 |But what I am most excited about right now is the marijuana legalization effort in Uruguay, where President Mujica is leading the effort and I have a colleague working fulltime in Montevideo trying to help local activists as well as allies in government.  Stay tuned for news from there.  There's a good chance that Uruguay could become the first country in the world to legalize marijuana -- and the race is on among Colorado, Washington State and Uruguay as to who will be first to actually create a legal regulatory system for cannabis 
[What do you propose is the best approach to changing the way our current prison system in the US is handled? I feel getting the government to reform our current prison will be next to impossible seeing as its a great money maker for the government and also a great form of population control. What steps would you suggest be taken to change the current system, other than just putting drug offenders in rehabilitation programs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catrzwl?context=5)|Drug policy reform is the cutting edge of prison reform.  That means, of course, taking marijuana out of the criminal justice system.  That cuts drug arrests in half, from roughly 1.5 million to half that, and it also keeps all sorts of people on parole and probation from getting pushed into jail or prison because they refuse to stop using.
 |The other important step is ending the criminalization, at least of possession, of all drugs -- more or less what Portugal has done with great success over the past twelve years.  Roughly three-fourths of all drug arrests are for nothing more than possession, and altho most of them do not land up on state and federal prison, they do land up in local jails, and often can land up in prisons for failing drug tests.
 |Of course there's also the challenge of getting rid of mandatory minimum sentences that send people to prison for inhumane amounts of time, and effectively give all the power over sentencing to prosecutors.
 |What we need as a country to do is declare as our objective that America's rate of incarceration should be at the global average, not in the global lead.
[Hi, Thank you for being here! I follow DPA and it's work closely and I'm looking forward to the debate today. My question is about individual activism. I regularly write my representatives regarding this issue and participate in community events when able. Where would you direct someone who wants to become more active in this movement? Is there a specific career path/degree program/etc. that you would recommend? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catsk5q?context=5)|No one career path is optimal.  The key is to learn everything you can about the issue, and to work on becoming an ever more effective advocate, and to acquire the sorts of skills that every advocacy organization needs -- could be legal, financial, communications, public policy, fundraising, etc.  And keep your eye on dpa's website drugpolicy.org and the websites of other drug policy reform organizations for job and internship possibilities.
 |And do everything you can to come to the biennial international drug policy reform conference, which will be in Denver this year, Oct. 23-26.  www.reformconference.org.
[Ethan love your work, it's very inspiring. Are you planning on coming to Australia in 2013?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catsgo6?context=5)|No plans right now, altho the folks in nimbin tried to get me to come recently for their annual event.  I did go in late 2010, and did a speaking tour of Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra and Brisbane, meeting with parliamentarians, activists, and many others.  There's some good reform efforts underway; if you're interested, contact Dr. Alex Wodak in Sydney; and check out LEAP in Australia.
[When Cannabis is legalized in a state, do individuals with cannabis-related criminal charges get any sort of retroactive pardons/forgiveness?  Sorry if I've worded this poorly, I can't Lawyer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catt6tu?context=5)|I don't think there are any retroactive provisions in the WA or CO laws but I have heard that many prosecutors in those states are in effect implementing the law in a retroactive fashion, deciding not to prosecute people who were arrested before the law was passed. 
[What would be your key points for legalization of marijuana in the debate.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/cats6ga?context=5)|You should watch at 10:20 MT when I debate Asa Hutchinson at the Aspen Ideas Festival on this very topic:  [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D05OI982hUY)

I wanted to get an idea of what I could do to make the best of my education. I had a few questions regarding CS/general advice regarding the major:

- I've been spending most of my time learning Python and Java. The first few classes are taught in Java and I figured it'd be a good idea to get a head start. Additionally, I've been trying to work with the terminal on my Mac most of the time. I'm assuming familiarity with Linux is really important.
I'm also considering doing a minor in Math. If any of you double majored in Math or minored in it; do you think it has been beneficial?

- Side Projects: I've started some side projects and have some more ideas, and I don't know if they're great, but whatever I choose to make- should I put it on github? I'm learning, and obviously the stuff I build won't be amazing, but effort counts for something, right? Additionally, what should I do if I want to contribute to open source projects (I know Python has some cool libraries I'm interested in)? I'm at a total loss here.

- Summer Internships: I'd like to get a job for the summer after my freshman year. I'll only have taken 2-3 CS courses by then. I'm not sure how to apply for jobs if I have neither experience nor too much knowledge. If I can demonstrate some skills though side projects, will that be a solid substitute for the time being? Any other advice will be helpful...

- Lastly, does the school's rep matter a lot? I know UMass isn't well known like Stanford/MIT/Cornell/Michigan, it's not ranked very high overall as school (90 something according to US News), but it does really well in graduate school rankings for CS (#20). Would it be worth it to transfer to a higher ranked school for more prospects (like Cornell or Michigan)?

- Any other advice would be greatly appreciated!"

A little background. I'm 17, and in desperate need of a job. You could call me ""The family computer-whiz"" because I'm the one everybody I know goes to whenever something goes wrong with any electronic devices. I'm not ultra hard-core knowledgeable about computers, but I know most of my stuff. I've built my PC, done basic tech support for family members and people around town, and even had an ""Training Internship"" at a local, now out-of-business repair shop. (I use quotes because the people running the joint were distant family members, and were basically using me to get 3 months of unpaid labor, but that's another story.)

My problem is that there's still a lot of things that I don't know. I don't know how servers work, I don't know what a rootkit is, I know nothing about networking other than how to hook up a modem/router, there's quite a few things about actual support that I don't know about.

1heonc,689,2013-07-01,"Maggie, My Ham Housemate: The Routine",WakeUpMaggie_FPS,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1heonc/maggie_my_ham_housemate_the_routine/,"In which you learn about [Maggie's](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1he8ax/maggie_my_ham_housemate_the_beginning/) day-to-day life as the Queen of Sheba. 

Everyone in the house worked part or full time jobs. Everyone but Maggie. And on top of our work, 4/5 of us were studying for grad school exams (guess who wasn't). Sasha had a clerical job at a dinky office nearby, 9 to 5, and would then lock herself in her room for two hours or so and prep for her exam. Andrew worked part time at a grocery store, and then had a shitty internship at doctor's office, so he studied whenever he had a moment.   Me and John were studying for the same exam. Because I worked most afternoons/nights bartending, and John worked security almost every night till about 2, we would study from midmorning till whenever we finished. 

It's kind of obvious we had a pretty rigid schedule. If you interrupted Sasha for anything less then an anthrax outbreak during ""locked door, book open time"", you would be shived. Same went for me and John. Our test was in October, and as soon as June hit, we went full out. We knew if we could get good scores the first time, we could live the rest of our year as care-free, underemployed young people with years of crushing grad school ahead. 

Maggie would wake up somewhere between 2 and 3 pm. She'd move from her bedroom into the kitchen, microwave some atrocity, and roll into the living room and almost immediately park her ass on the couch. Every. Day. You'd know when she'd gotten up because her bed would croak like a man being beaten with a crowbar under the brooklyn bridge. She'd bought the worst spring mattress, and it added to the noise.Then you'd hear the moan of  a couple floor boards, a door slam, then the shower running. Not long after came the violent belting out of several Beatles songs I can't bear to listen to anymore. She absolutely, positively, LOVED the beatles. I'm talking giant posters and general distain for all other music. Now i'm a fan of them, they're great. But I also like other music, god damn it. If I played anything different, I'd get a passive aggressive email (EMAIL) from the other room asking me to wear headphones. If she heard the Beatles, that was an immediate invitation to your room to her. (She also fucked up our Rock Band 2 sessions something awful. She would insist on playing with us, DEMAND to be on vocals, but then quit halfway through a song. Who fucking DOES that?). Sorry, sidetracked. 

All she did was watch television, bitch and moan about the heat, and tumblr the day away on the sofa. She made her mommy buy an air conditioner for the living room that we couldn't afford the electrical payments on. Her mom gave her money for that too. It was great, i guess, but I mean we couldn't use the living room anyway because Maggie was ALWAYS there. Three weeks in, we realized we needed to reclaim it. We didn't spend a lot of time watching tv, so we pushed her favorite couch, dubbed the ""recliner of sweat stain"" into the corner , moved the tv all the way down, then positioned the beat up love seat and big chairs around the coffee table. We could still hear her watching Tru Blood, but… whatever.

There were two things she got up for. Food, obviously,was the first. She would eat constantly. I'll explain our food situation in the next story, it's a long deal. She would just eat left overs from horrible take out food and SO MUCH CAKE. She would buy it or make it herself, whatever she had to do. Her mom put so much money into her account. I went to the ATM for her once (lol, once. a million times), she would give me $20 to do it(I honestly don't think she left the house more then 3 times a week, on DIRE necessities), and there was well over 2,000 dollars in that account for FOOD. JUST FOOD. As a broke bitch, I nearly fainted. Despite that shit, she would routinely eat our leftovers, snacks, drinks, whatever wasn't green, or healthy for you in the least.

Her second hobby was harassing us. She was first and foremost obsessed with John and I's friendship. We'd been friends since I hit the guy who was trying to steal his pokemon cards, over the head with my lunchbox in the fourth grade. We were tight. We also might be the same person, in two different bodies. It took her a while to figure out we weren't actually dating then. And when that happened… that's also another story for a different time. But in the beginning, she'd like to drop by John's room while we were both trying to study and ask us asinine questions. Maggie was, would always be, HAD to be the smartest. This extended to looking over our shoulders at practice tests, and trying to ""help us"". She would ""help us"" until John or I would stare at her in fury until she left

Maggie was also fascinated and mock disgusted by mine and Sasha's habit of maintaining basic hygiene. She called us ""barbies"" and other things that were clearly defensive answers to the fact she only ever wore sweatshirts, big shirts, and pajama pants. Obviously self conscious. Sasha and I invited her shopping, to workouts, to shows, but the only invitations she would accept would be the ones with food and no shoe requirements. John and Andrew had guy friends over all the time, and she behaved so rudely to them, like she just knew in their heads they were fat shaming. She was, and I bet in my bones, a TiTP subscriber, as well as a feminist when it came to brushing her hair. She didn't need to look good for some ""scummy jock dude"". I don't think she'd actually ever had a functional, reciprocated relationship. When she did ""go for it"", ugh….I'll tell you more stories about that later. We would of felt bad if she hadn't acted like she owned the place.

There was one awful fight when Sasha and I were going to bachelorette party, and the theme was something stupid and slutty (as you do). We got all sleazed up presented to a living room of friends, and one large sweat lump in the corner. We looked about as good as two athletic 21 year old chicks look, and everyone was wolf whistling and acting a fool. This was about a month after we'd moved in, and I'd been seeing a guy, on and off (mostly off), who made some silly joke about ""cleaning up good"" and grabbed my ass. We heard a snort from the greasy side of the room followed by silence as we stared. Maggie looked up and says ""Well, when looking like a doll is all you do all day, you better be good at it"". Fucking WHAT? John asked her how her Ph D in Big Bang Theory reruns was going and she shut up. 

That was always her sore spot. She was Ms. Lit Major, and she knew fucking EVERYTHING about books. I'm pretty sure she thought owning them was about as good as reading them. Every other field of study was ""soul-less"". But when we tried to put her on the spot, she got ugly. More ugly than usual. I got into a discussion about F. Scott Fitzgerald with her, which ended in her screaming i knew nothing about literature because I asked her what other book she liked by her ""favorite author"", besides fucking The Great Gatsby. Classic. 

She was always in bed by 3 or 4 am, then blasting various audiobooks until one of us banged on her door so loud she woke up, and turned it off. Did she think  those work in her sleep? Who knows, it's a mystery.

1hennd,3,2013-07-01,A new outlook on life - 90 day report,yatri_the_traveller,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1hennd/a_new_outlook_on_life_90_day_report/,"I am a 22 year old graduate student (male). I started NoFap on April 1, when I was at one of the lowest moments in my life. I was looking for summer internships and had been rejected by almost 10 companies. For most of these companies, I would clear all the interview rounds except for the last one. Nothing seemed to go my way. Even my grades in the winter semester were poor. I figured out that my fapping problem was one of the reasons behind my failures. I used to feel guilty and pathetic after fapping. It made me feel low and less confident. Although I was not addicted to PMO, I realized that complete abstinence was required to get my life back on track.

Like everyone, first few weeks were difficult, but things started to ease out later. Luckily, I landed an summer internship. Though this intern is not at forbes listed company (like the ones where I had previously applied), it helps me stay busy during summer. These past 90 days have instilled a new sense of confidence in me. I have started to feel good about myself. During this period, I have had a few wet dreams, but I didn't reset my counter as it was involuntary discharge. I was also having the problem of random erections in office which was embarrassing. I don't know if it is related to the NoFap challenge. Did anyone else face this problem? 

Now that things look bright for me, common sense says that I should continue this practice of NoFap. I want to complete one year of NoFap. Meanwhile, with this renewed vigor, I have started preparing for my interviews again for full time job. I am confident that this time, I will make it to a company of my choice.

tl;dr - Don't wait for PMO to become an addiction and then start NoFap. NoFap challenge should be taken by anyone who wants to experience the benefits it offers.

PS: I want to thank CalvinKandH and other people of this community for answering queries in the IRC Chat and providing a continuous source of motivation. Keep up the good work!"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[So how close to reality are most Crime Investigator shows? Not at all close right? Or if not what is one that you find pretty close to reality?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catip9z?context=5)|A lot of crime scene shows take a substantial amount of creative license when it comes to the forensic sciences.  There are a few things they tend to get right, but we most definitely don't all drive hummers, look like models, or get DNA results back in under an hour.
[Do you think shows should have some sort of disclosure in the show/credits that say they are not 100% accurate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/cau7732?context=5)|That would be a nice thing to have.  However, people are still going to assume that a lot of what they see on TV is factual.  Especially since it is based loosely on true science.
[Do murders evolve like everything else? What I'm asking is now days when you have shows like CSI regardless of their creative license they still have made forensic evidence mainstream. Do you find... cleaner crime scenes now? Do you think criminals are taking more precautions and cleaning up after themselves better after these rise in forensic crime dramas? Thanks for the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catj428?context=5)|I think a lot of criminals watch TV shows as well, but there are techniques we are capable of that they may not know about.  I don't really think in the whole scope of scenes that we are seeing much difference.
[What's the coolest technique you use that we wouldn't normally know about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catktex?context=5)|Touch DNA.  We can get DNA off of sweat, fingerprints, hair (without roots), all sorts of fun stuff.
[Could you or someone else please ellaborate on how this is done? Especially the hair without a root, wouldn't that just contain proteins?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catyqpi?context=5)|Hair still contains cells, while historically hair without the root has been very very difficult to generate complete DNA profiles from, advances in forensic science have yielded results from hair without the root.
[How many gallons of semen have you seen smeared on walls and floors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catisw4?context=5)|No comment. (A lot, especially hotel rooms.)
[ what would be the strangest item you found some on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catiwt2?context=5)|That's an interesting question.  Depends on your definition of strange, worse has to be small children's underwear.  Never an enjoyable experience.
[Have you ever found anything written in semen on a hotel wall?  Any names or treasure maps?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkpmv?context=5)|The map to Jimmy Hoffa.
[That makes me sad. Poor little kids. I hope you don't find things like that often.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkbhl?context=5)|Unfortunately, it happens more often than I'd like.
[So...more often than never? And if it never happened then you wouldn't be able to like that it never happened because you'd lack the experience to like.  Sorry that sentence just bugs me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catl1my?context=5)|Sorry, I've answered a lot of questions tonight.
[How much schooling have you had? Whats the grosses thing you've encountered? Have you ever made a mistake that cost the case? Have you ever had a serial killer case? What about a child murder? Hows the smells? Can you refuse to work a case? Whats your favorite genera of movie and favorite food?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkd3x?context=5)|B.S. in Chem. 2 week decomp. pulled out of a river. Nope. Nope. Nope. Not too bad once you get used to it. I'm not sure, never have though. Comedy and Sushi.
[Are your one-liners as cringe-worthy as Horartio's?  Or do they.  (•_•\)  ( •_•\)&gt;⌐■-■  (⌐■_■\)  Murder. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkpbb?context=5)|Mine are usually pretty lame.
[Has a crime scene ever actively scared you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjfjj?context=5)|Scenes were the suspect is still at large, or gang-related scenes can be scary in the fact that retaliation can happen at the police while we are there.  There have been instances (not in our agency) where drive-by shootings have happened at the scene with gang-related crimes.
[Yeah that's kind of what I was thinking of.. Wasn't sure if that was solely something that happened on TV. So --excuse me if its a dumb question -- are you technically a part of the police? And have you ever been in actual danger?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjmcx?context=5)|I am non-commissioned, so I am technically a civilian.  I do no carry a gun or a badge.  I am an employee of a law enforcement agency though.  To my knowledge, I have not personally been in danger.
[ still I will be living vicariously through you during this AMA while I am stuck here in the cornfields. Thanks, OP!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catl2xl?context=5)|Thanks for growing corn for me to eat.
[Police are civilians as well, even the ones with guns, as they are not a branch of the military.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catlw94?context=5)|That is true.  In terms of what I was talking about was commissioned officer (or in our case deputy) vs. non-commissioned (civilian) deputy.
[What has been the worst crime scene you have been to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catise4?context=5)|Execution-style murder, or a fire-death scene.
[How can I commit murder and get away with it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catipjx?context=5)|Figure out a way to not leave a trace that you were at the crime scene or had no contact with the victim.  There is a theory that forensic science is based off of that states, ""Every contact leaves a trace.""  It has held up for 100 years, good luck with that.
[Surely there are times when you aren't satisfied with the evidence you got at the crime scene though, and can't convict right? TV shows (you're prob sick of hearing about them\) make it seem like you catch every one every time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catlex8?context=5)|Many times there can always be more evidence.  We don't always catch the suspect.
[Of course, even this is a trace. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catzgwr?context=5)|Yep.
[Have you ever investigated a scene, presented the undeniable evidence to the court, yet they still decided against your findings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catir94?context=5)|Yes.  The only thing we can testify to is the evidence and our role with it.  There may have been other factors in the case caused court to rule otherwise, i.e.  validity of search warrants, probable cause issues, etc.
[That's gotta annoy you. Providing undeniable, undisputable proof that someone committed a crime, but the court throws it away. I know it bugs me when someone throws away all my hard work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/cativ04?context=5)|Yes it can be annoying, but there is a reason the criminal justice system exists.  I am a firm believer that it is better that 100 guilty men go free than one innocent man be convicted.
[Aka do all the dirty work, while someone (prosecutor\) else writes the narrative to fill in the story?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catzf5g?context=5)|Not necessarily, we write reports of our findings and our opinions based on the facts presented.  There is a possibility of prosecutors not using our findings, but juries like to see CSI findings.
[What if there were 101 possible suspects in the rape and murder of a loved one? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjx4f?context=5)|Then you try to get the right person.
[How have shows like the CSI franchise changed the courtroom setting? I've heard that now a lot of juries assume there will be a lot of forensic evidence. Has this affected any of the trials you've been involved in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/cau3uhv?context=5)|People on juries now do seem to think that we can find forensic evidence on everything, when in fact that might not be the case.  I've addressed this question a few times in this post I think.  If you can't find it then let me know and I'll try to answer.
[Have you seen the show ""Dexter""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjpbk?context=5)|Love that show. I have a special interest in bloodspatter analysis (not bloodsplatter, that term makes people in our industry crazy) so I get a special kick out of it. When people ask me about my job I like to say I'm like Dexter, but without the killing people.
[Follow up question: Do you think you would be able to find evidence that leads to catching Dexter by now? I can't believe he's still a free man.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/caty5dw?context=5)|I'm sure there is evidence out there.  I haven't seen past season 4 of Dexter but from what I've seen, he never is in the same place, and few people even know where the scene of his killings are.  That would make it tough to investigate.
[Do cops dislike you? Do you stroll into a crime scene and flash your badge like.. I'm CSI, Bitch!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catj8z8?context=5)|No, we have a very good working relationship with our agency.  We are under the jurisdiction of our Criminal Investigation (detectives)  so we see many of them on a daily basis.  We also have a very good working relationship with our coroner's office.  Many people don't realize that a body belongs to the coroner once it is found, because of our good relationship, they allow us to complete our scene investigation before they will touch and remove the body to help us out.
[What's the funniest situation you've ever found at a scene?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catiuns?context=5)|Woman tied to a bed.  She asked her boyfriend to tie her up and then left her there.  Neighbor heard her screaming for help 2 hours later and called the police.
[So was there anything for you to do there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjjp6?context=5)|Nope, but it was pretty funny.
[I thought they only called you guys after the police determined there was a crime scene? Just wondering why you would even be involved with that one..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/cau3xqt?context=5)|Most times that is the case.  We aren't involved a lot with this scene, but we did a little bit with it.
[What is your education background?  what kind of schooling and experience do you have/did you need to do what you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjk8w?context=5)|I have a B.S. in Chemistry and I'm beginning my M.S. in Forensic Science through the University of Florida Distance Learning program soon.  I've been at the job for a little under 2 years.  With what I do, they were looking for someone that had a background in the hard sciences, the rest of it can be taught.  I do the majority of the drug analysis for our agency, so the Chemistry degree definitely helped.
[Hardshell or softshell tacos?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/cativ2w?context=5)|Softshell, hardshell hurts the roof of my mouth.
[Have you ever danced with the devil under the pale moonlight?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/cativ2w?context=5)|If by devil you mean my ex-girlfriend then yes.
[Have you ever witnessed someone at the scene or in the lab screw up, ruin evidence, and cover up their mistake? Do you know of this happening elsewhere? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjl2g?context=5)|I've witnessed plenty of screw ups.  Hell I've done it myself, nobody is perfect.  We just have to document what happened in our reports and what we did from there, that is pretty much all we can do.  When you try to cover up a mistake is where you get into BIG trouble with Brady issues and such.
[What is the hardest part of your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catisuq?context=5)|Having to disconnect emotionally from the things we bear witness to on a daily basis while still remaining mentally connected.  Having to think like a suspect and use that knowledge to help solve a case can be difficult.  Few people understand the things law enforcement, military, and paramedics/EMS have to see all the time.
[As an EMT who had a bad day thank you for recognizing that we actually see bad shit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkso5?context=5)|I have a great respect for what you guys do.  I was a boy scout and had to do mock scenes quite a bit, and have had to use that training in real life (car accidents).  
[How do you disconnect emotionally?  I can see how this would be one of the most difficult sides of the job - you see the worst that people do.  How do you keep your faith in humanity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/caunza8?context=5)|I work with good people and see the good side of humanity as well.  You just have to find your shut-off switch and flip it when bad things come along.
[Does psychology play a role in this process? Is there a forensic psychologist present during the investigation? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjpom?context=5)|In what process?  I am responsible for physical evidence, I don't get involved with all that other voodoo.  But seriously, with the type of work I do, one would not be necessary.
[What's the weirdest thing you've ever found on a crime scene?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catitmo?context=5)|Old (80's) man's anal lube gallon sized bottle.
[Was it relevant to the case? Or just a random jug of anal lube that was not connected to the case at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkjam?context=5)|The girl he brought home said he tried to rape her, so she shot him.  Kind of relevant?  I'm not sure.
[I mean, I guess. What I really meant was was it actually used and/or marked as evidence, or just an odd discovery while you were there?  Sorry, I worded my question pretty horribly the first time lol.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkpb6?context=5)|It was collected as evidence.  Although, we collect a lot of things from homicide scenes.
[If a murderer collected lint from a public laundromat and spread it all over the crime scene, how would that affect your investigation?  Edit: er, I just got put on some sort of list, didn't I? :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkrt3?context=5)|It would definitely throw a wrench in things.  It would be collected as evidence for sure, but I'd hope that there would be other items of evidentiary value present at the scene that would help point at someone.  Fingerprints, blood, hair, saliva, etc.  Hope that helps, would be interesting though.
[What's the dumbest thing you've ever seen a perp do to get caught?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjunf?context=5)|We had a guy burg a store while it was closed and try to run when he saw the police coming.  He broke his leg stepping off a curb, so when the officers pulled up he was sitting on the curb surrounded with money and bleeding.
[That is pretty funny.  Why did CSI get called out to that scene though?  Isn't it pretty cut and dried at that point?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catk0hu?context=5)|There were 3 other places he had already robbed, we processed them anyway.
[What is the most fucked up, and most emotional thing you have ever seen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catk685?context=5)|Kid was hunting with his friend, propped his shotgun against the truck while loading up, it started to slip and he grabbed it, shooting his buddy in the head.
[Who are you? who, who, who, who?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjnac?context=5)|Suey13?
[Do epithelials count as DNA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjjj4?context=5)|Yes, the newer DNA analysis techniques can even get DNA off sweat.
[Is there ANY possible way I could kill someone and get away with it in this day and age? I'm only asking for a friend who wants me to kill his wife.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjx8a?context=5)|Probably.  If he tries really hard, and is lucky.
[What is the pay like? What is starting pay vs. experienced pay?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catk2dy?context=5)|I do pretty well for the living expenses of the area I'm in.  My starting pay was $40,000/year.
[This was already asked. What TV Shows or Movies most accurately depict what you do? What is your favorite thing to do for recreation and or leisure? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catj7jb?context=5)|That is a great question, unfortunately I don't get to watch a lot of the shows, but I have quite a few queued in Netflix to watch eventually.  The original CSI: Las Vegas did a pretty good job in the early years before it got a little far fetched.  I do scene work and lab work, many agencies have different people for each job.  However, I do not carry a gun or interview suspects.
 |As for recreation and leisure, I enjoy reading and I have been doing martial arts for many years.
[Does the portrayal of your career in the CSI tv series as being an exciting, case solved every week, sort of thing annoy you? I've heard a huge amount of man hours can go into investigating with no guarantee of success. It would annoy me, but im not sure why.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catirqq?context=5)|It doesn't annoy me, makes us seem much cooler than we actually are.  There have definitely been some cases I've put a lot of man-hours into.
[Seen any X-files type things at your crime scenes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catk23z?context=5)|Nope, just x-files DVDs.
[What's the saddest thing you've seen while on the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkx5f?context=5)|I go into people's houses on what is usually the worst day of their lives.  That is pretty sad.
[Thanks for the AMA! I was thinking of doing this when i become older. Would you recommend it? Also what are some pros and cons of the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catl0jp?context=5)|I would recommend it if you can handle the gore of it and have an interest and strong attention to detail.  As to the pros and cons, if you read through the AMA there is quite a bit of detail.  Thanks for the post!
[I know a person that is finalizing everything to get this kind of job. Any tips for her when she gets it. Stuff to do and not do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkwzg?context=5)|Leave work at work, don't take it home with you.
[Do you have to dress with coveralls in crime scenes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjf4s?context=5)|Depends on the scene.  If there is a possibility that DNA evidence will play an important role, then we will wear Tyvek suits (the white bunny suits that you see on tv).
[Haha Yeah, I wore one on a school play in which I was a CSI. So, explain, in which cases would DNA possibly play an important role?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjoy8?context=5)|DNA can play an important role in many different kinds of cases.  It can definitively prove that someone was somewhere, which can be hard to prove otherwise. 
[What did you go to college for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkknh?context=5)|Chemistry, and the free t-shirts.
[How does it feel when you successfully catch someone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catk049?context=5)|Best part of my job.
[When you put sunglasses on, does this happen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catku0q?context=5)|All the time.
[Thanks for being here! I am interested in becoming a Crime Scene Investigator and was wondering how you feel about your job? Is it a difficult job to have and do you regret it at times? Does it hinder your everyday feelings towards things? Cheers!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catksm8?context=5)|It hasn't hindered my feelings toward things, but I have pretty tough skin.  Part of being able to do my job is being able to filter my job from my home life.  I don't regret it for anything, I get to help solve crimes!
[What do you do on a slow day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catl11y?context=5)|Catch up on paperwork.  There is always paperwork.
[Do you work with a blood-spatter analyst?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catl4n8?context=5)|I have training in Bloodspatter analysis.  I do it myself.  There is a very qualified individual out of Washington State that is VERY good too.
[Have you ever had a case in which you had to, say, check the reflection off of the eye of the victim's photo using the freeze frame from a security camera? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkhf4?context=5)|Nope, if you have a video software program that can do that you might be able to sell it to the FBI for a lot of money.
[Can you tell us more about this? security footage is sold to the fbi? any footage or only ones with crimes? do you just give them the original tapes or copies? etc (interesting\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/cau7j5g?context=5)|What I meant was that if you have software than can enhance security camera footage like that, you could probably make a lot of money off it.  There is a TON of dramatic license taken in terms of video enhancement.
[I'm a highschooler and I'm interested in entering this field and have a few questions. What would be a decent major in college? How does one get started?  What's the ""ladder"" look like to get up to a CSI? Is the pay decent? Not asking for your salary but maybe a ballpark. Thanks :\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catl6tj?context=5)|I think I've answered this one a few times.  If you read through everything I'm sure you'll get your answer.  Sorry I can't help you here.
[I work at a police department and have a pretty good understanding of real world physics, forensics, police procedure, etc and at this point my suspension of reality is too high to watch shows like CSI  for the most part. Do you experience something similar? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkpnw?context=5)|They are comedies to me.  I watch them to get a good laugh.  Thank you for your service.
[Does 'The Who' ever start randomly playing while you are putting on sunglasses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catktr3?context=5)|All the time.  Sometimes I think of walking into work with speakers playing that around me.
[What's the best way to get rid of a body?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkn6s?context=5)|Pig farm is what the movies say.
[What made you want to go into crime scene investigating? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catj4uy?context=5)|It is something that I have always had an interest in.  It may have initially evolved from watching the TV shows actually, the same ones that I now laugh at.
[Is there really always seminal fluid everywhere like on TV? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catl4a1?context=5)|Not always.  Tends to be a fair amount in hotel rooms though, beware.
[Is it hard to enjoy yourself on vacation knowing that? :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/cauo0ql?context=5)|Not really, just take a blacklight with you on vacation and show things to the manager of the hotel.  Free upgrades. :)
[Does it frighten you how jaded you can become to things that should terrify you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catk0ur?context=5)|Good question.  It really does sometimes.  People who are around death and other normally terrifying things (Police, EMTs, Doctors, etc.) develop a condition called ""Gallow's Humor""  where we try to make light of certain situations my turning to joking about it.  Really weirds normal people out.
[I am planning to go into investigative psychology.  Do you happen to have any sort of advice or resources that would be helpful?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkffq?context=5)|Do internships if at all possible.  Yes you will probably be getting a lot of coffee for people, but it will make you seem more committed.  No pun intended.
[Well, assuming were friends, me having hairs at his/her house wouldn't be proof. I could pull my car in the garage, so no one would see me moving the body from the house to my car, and well, there isn't much more to go on besides that. :p.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjqwx?context=5)|I haven't seen all the evidence of the case.  It sounds like a terrible situation where people made some unfortunate decisions and bad things happened.  With so few witnesses it will be hard to know what will happen.
[I do have another side question for you. What is your opinion on the Treyvon Martin case? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjqwx?context=5)|Plus, I haven't been following it all that closely.  
[Where should someone go to see about an internship? the local police department?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/caubydj?context=5)|Police Departments, Sheriff, if you are near a big city you might check out federal agencies as well.
[So if i just go to the local police department and say ""hey i was interested in doing an internship for crime scene investigation, can you tell me who to talk to?"" would work? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/cauxjzb?context=5)|That's definitely a good way to start.
[How likely is it that our DNA is stored in a database somewhere? Do you need to collect DNA from a suspect directly to match it to the crime scene? What if a person just randomly killed a complete stranger with no other witnesses or cameras etc. and happened to have a hair on the victim, would they be able to track them down? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catki02?context=5)|There has to be a sample to match the DNA to.  A lot of times we may not have the suspect DNA on file, but if there is enough probable cause, a judge can grant a search warrant to collect a blood or saliva sample from the suspect in a case.
[Is it true that DNA can't be taken from hair if the bulb isn't intact? That's what I was told when I was little, don't know if techniques have advanced since then. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjuwo?context=5)|Hair strands contain mitochondrial DNA, or mDNA.  It can be used, but it only provides a maternal match to the person being tested.  So if the police think they know who they are searching for and have an mDNA sample, if possible they can get a sample from the mother and match the person, or their sibling.
[What was the most difficult crime you had to solve?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkdk4?context=5)|The REALLY involved ones I don't work by myself.  All of our CSIs work together on those ones.  But, we have had a few homicides that were tricky. 
[What percent of crimes you've worked on go unsolved?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkwve?context=5)|I think I answered this already.  Sorry.
[Do you focus in any particular aspect of the investigation? I tend to regard Dexter and Breaking Bad as two of the more ""realistic"" crime centric shows.  In your experience, are the forensic aspects of these shows, particularly Dexter, even remotely realistic or just what tv audiences have come to accept as fact?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkrku?context=5)|I haven't actually seen as much Dexter as I'd like to, but I have seen quite a bit of Breaking Bad since one of the actors is from my hometown.  The bloodspatter aspect of Dexter is pretty spot on from what I've seen though.
[I used to watch Forensic Files with my roommate all the time.  I loved the show, but he said he was scared after watching it.  While forensics can help point evidence to a suspect, framing someone seems that much easier.  One episode, for example, a guy got convicted for the murder of his wife.  His hair and footprint was found at the scene, as well as a leaf of a unique tree in his truck bed.  He was convicted, of course.  But what if there was a ""friend"" that grabbed a few stray hairs in the bathroom, took an old pair of his shoes, and chucked a leaf in his truck bed?  Imagine all these innocent people going to jail because the evidence against them is so verifiable scientifically.  What are your thoughts on that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkxcl?context=5)|Many, many times physical evidence is not the only thing that a conviction goes off of.  Unfortunately there have been instances where the wrong people have gone to jail, but in terms of my job I just make sure that I do my job to the best of my abilities and provide it to the detectives and prosecutors.
[Where do cases with the least amount of evidence usually occur? (Rural?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catk5p1?context=5)|I'm not sure about the least amount of evidence.  All (most) crime scenes are pretty different.  Just being able to notice what is and what isn't evidence is the hard part a lot of the time.
[Do you ever feel burn out from your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catk5p1?context=5)|Nope, no burnout for me.
[Did you do well in science to get this job or was it more of a ""trained-on-the-job""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkyc8?context=5)|Nothing medical school level, but I did pretty well.  There is a lot of ""On the job training"" though.
[What about amish places? do they send cops/csi there ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/cau7h4m?context=5)|I'm not sure.  I live in the Northwest, not a lot of Amish here.
[Thoughts on shows like CSI and all of that? Is any of that true? Seems like not but would like to hear your opinions. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkhah?context=5)|I think I answered this one already, sorry.  There are some things they do that are pretty accurate, but still a lot of dramatic license is taken.  I don't chase the bad guys with a gun.
[Have you ever looked at evidence or analysis from older cases that would not be accepted by todays standards? What is an example?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catl4qd?context=5)|I haven't, sorry.
[What is the first instinct of what to look for at a crime scene? Is there any one thing that could tip the scales one way or another if you see it early on in the investigation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catk6c3?context=5)|When we first get to a scene we try to take it all it, then break it down from there.  Drugs, guns, money, and alcohol are usually pretty big clues though. 
[About how many hours a week do you work? Do you have regular hours, or is it mostly on call?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catk2pa?context=5)|I have regular 8-5 hours, with a rotating on-call schedule where I'm on-call for a week.  In fact, I'm on-call now.
[Off the top of your head, what percent of the time is there jizz found at a crime scene?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkhen?context=5)|Depends on the scene.  Sex crimes probably 90%.  Home burglaries maybe 1%?
[How often does an agent (from any government crime-related agency\) ""go rogue"" and get involved in a major crime?  Certain TV shows make it seem like it happens every other day.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catj6sw?context=5)|The only time I've been witness to it was the drug analyst from Massachusetts that got busted about a year ago.  Other than that I don't think it is a very common occurrence.
[What is the most inconvenient or unique scene you've had to attend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catknmd?context=5)|Guy shot himself after a police chase that ended on the side of the road.  It was -10 F  outside.  Brrr.
[What is a normal day for you like? What do you do specifically?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkfl6?context=5)|I do a lot of evidence processing in our lab. Looking for fingerprints on items that have been submitted by our officers. I also am responsible for the majority of drug analysis for our office, mostly marijuana, meth, and cocaine. When we are called out to scenes we do all the processing and evidence collection there as well.
[Is your home spot clean? no finger prints/dust? ;\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/cau7i38?context=5)|No spot clean by any means.  Being a bachelor I try to keep it tidy, just in case.
[Have you read any Jeffrey reaver books; specifically the Lincoln rhyme series? I wonder if the things he describes in forensics are as accurate as he makes them seem.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catl379?context=5)|I have not, sorry.
[How unrealistic/realistic are the shows such as CSI: Miami, and all the other CSI's?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/caupsul?context=5)|Pretty unrealistic in general.  There are some things they get right though.
[So how much has the genetics field impacted working at a crime scene? I'm studying genetics right now, and this interests me. Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catk3i1?context=5)|DNA evidence deals mostly with the genetics aspect of CSI work.  Most of the newer techniques deal with mDNA and how we are able to get profiles are suspects that we were not able to before.
[Don't know if you've answered this but, how exactly did you get in like what does it take? And what inspired you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catku9v?context=5)|Helping serve my community is what inspired me.  I never really had a desire to serve in the military, but this is my own way of giving back.

1heh4m,3,2013-06-30,"[For Hire] Filmmaker seeking associate producer, production coordinator, or editor position.",JoeSki42,SanDiegoJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanDiegoJobs/comments/1heh4m/for_hire_filmmaker_seeking_associate_producer/,"Greetings

My name is Joseph and I am a graduate of the BFA film production program at the University of Central Florida. Utilizing a background in sales I have made it my goal to make the dreams of my colleagues and clients come true in the most literal way I know how – by helping to bring their films to life.
            
As a producer, I have created economical sales packages to entice the interest of local actors to participate as extras, with perks ranging from free professional modeling photos to free hair and cosmetic makeovers with to no additional cost to the production.  As an editor, I have experience in cutting together films, documentary styled shorts, and promotional trailers in addition to helping out other professionals with color correction, equalizing sound levels, and with the creation of soundscapes.    
              
I have directed films with as many as 70 people involved and have gained invaluable knowledge under “The Last of the Mohicans” prop master Vern Crofoot while serving as an intern on a professional film set.  At UCF I was trained by industry professionals such as Barry Sandler, Ula Stoeckl, and Jesse Wolfe in all manners of production.

I currently reside in Orlando, Florida.  However, both my girlfriend and I are looking to relocate. 

I believe I could of great service to your company and would love to have an opportunity to discuss with you any ideas for the position you may have available.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

My name is Joseph and I am a graduate of the BFA film production program at the University of Central Florida. Utilizing a background in sales I have made it my goal to make the dreams of my colleagues and clients come true in the most literal way I know how – by helping to bring their films to life.
            
As a producer, I have created economical sales packages to entice the interest of local actors to participate as extras, with perks ranging from free professional modeling photos to free hair and cosmetic makeovers with to no additional cost to the production.  As an editor, I have experience in cutting together films, documentary styled shorts, and promotional trailers in addition to helping out other professionals with color correction, equalizing sound levels, and with the creation of soundscapes.    
              
I have directed films with as many as 70 people involved and have gained invaluable knowledge under “The Last of the Mohicans” prop master Vern Crofoot while serving as an intern on a professional film set.  At UCF I was trained by industry professionals such as Barry Sandler, Ula Stoeckl, and Jesse Wolfe in all manners of production.

I currently reside in Orlando, Florida.  However, both my girlfriend and I are looking to relocate.  

I believe I could of great service to your company and would love to have an opportunity to discuss with you any ideas for the position you may have available.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

1heapr,3,2013-06-30,How to build self-esteem?,[deleted],askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1heapr/how_to_build_selfesteem/,"[This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1hd96i/do_you_ever_feel_like_youre_not_good_enough_in_a/) reminded me of myself a bit.

I'm hesitant to step into the dating pool because what's happened before is that I think whomever I'm interested in is much more successful, intelligent, funny, kind, and attractive than me. I'd say I'm pretty average across the board and it just feels like I'd be offering nothing to the other guy.

This is also holding me back in my career. I get really anxious during interviews and I am able to recognize that I severely mess up, but I haven't been able to get past it. It's not for lack of trying or inability to get an interview. I've done dozens of interviews over the past several months and have even made it to final round in close to 10 of those but I always, always get rejected in the end. That just pushes me deeper into this cycle of thinking how incapable I am. It's so frustrating because I know I have to keep interviewing to actually get a job, it just ends up making me more anxious the more I do.

To make it that much more frustrating, I think a lot of the problem is being perpetually surrounded my people who are so much more successful and happier than me. All of my friends are still in school but working with top companies for the summer, and most are in a relationship. I graduated a year early but now am stuck at an internship making less than what I earned in high school. I know I shouldn't, but it's impossible to *not* compare myself to my friends when they're all doing so much better than me when it comes to careers and relationships.

I know this post sounds whiny, but I'm really looking for ways to build my self-esteem and self-confidence to be able to land that job and feel comfortable enough to date.

**TL;DR** I always feel like I hit a wall when it comes to dating and my career because of a severe lack of self-esteem. What are some actionable things you have done or can recommend to help improve self confidence?"

My name is Joseph and I am a graduate of the BFA film production program at the University of Central Florida. Utilizing a background in sales I have made it my goal to make the dreams of my colleagues and clients come true in the most literal way I know how – by helping to bring their films to life.
            
As a producer, I have created economical sales packages to entice the interest of local actors to participate as extras, with perks ranging from free professional modeling photos to free hair and cosmetic makeovers with to no additional cost to the production.  As an editor, I have experience in cutting together films, documentary styled shorts, and promotional trailers in addition to helping out other professionals with color correction, equalizing sound levels, and with the creation of soundscapes.    
              
I have directed films with as many as 70 people involved and have gained invaluable knowledge under “The Last of the Mohicans” prop master Vern Crofoot while serving as an intern on a professional film set.  At UCF I was trained by industry professionals such as Barry Sandler, Ula Stoeckl, and Jesse Wolfe in all manners of production.

I currently reside in Orlando, Florida.  However, both my girlfriend and I are looking to relocate.  

I believe I could of great service to your company and would love to have an opportunity to discuss with you any ideas for the position you may have available.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

I just began learning VBA in Excel because of a short-term internship I'm doing. I've been doing well but I've hit a roadblock and need a little boost. I don't have sample code to offer cause it's all at the office, but basically I run it and it adds a new worksheet with the name like ""Updated List"" and puts some information in there that it grabs from another worksheet, but then when i try to run it again it gives me an error because there is already a worksheet with the name ""Updated List"". I tried googling the problem and have come across some answers but I couldn't get any of them to work. I know its hard without sample code, but if anyone knows of a solution to where it might just make a new one named ""Updated List 2"" or any other ways around it I would much appreciate it!"

Any 300$ PC or smartphone could easily outspeed my current electronic abacus. I'm willing to spend more than double that on a new PC. My absolute maximum budget is [€700](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=convert+700+EUR+to+USD&amp;dataset=) ($908), preferably less. I'm about to pull the trigger on this one but I'd love to get some feedback before actually buying anything :)

The PC will mainly be used for gaming (Minecraft, Skyrim, WoW) and some music work (Ableton, FL).

Huh, you sneaky US citizens can snatch some seriously good discounts... but in return I can get an awesome Sharkoon case and you can't. :P I'm doing an internship at a local PC shop right now and we often build with these cases, they are sturdy and easy to work with.

I'll look for better prices later. PCPartPicker Germany doesn't have many stores right now so I still have to do some manual search.

---

Since I'd like to keep some cash for unexpected expenses I plan to buy more stuff later. I'm used to bad graphics so I can endure some more weeks, that means the video card isn't top priority - I'd much rather get a new monitor because mine is a 17'' 1024x768 TFT and I need more screen real estate. The video card will probably be something along the lines of GTX 660. Any thoughts on which card I should get? (Should be nVidia because I often use Linux, nVidia has much better Linux drivers than AMD)

Maybe I should also get an SSD - I could still afford a 120GB drive and I'd rather do it now than later so I don't have to install OSes on an HDD first and then reinstall on an SSD. I really want one because they are *fast*. I'm not too sure though.

I chose the 3570K because I plan to overclock in the future. The boxed fan is good enough for now - my current PC produces tornado sounds so anything is more silent. Will buy a better fan and OC later.

Oh, and before anyone asks - I actually need a DVD drive and I need a new one because mine are all IDE.

I still have Windows 7 so I won't buy W8 to keep the price low.

1hisno,1,2013-07-02,I'[m] 22 with a great [22f] but I feel like my insecurities are causing issues.,StupidlyIrrational,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hisno/im_22_with_a_great_22f_but_i_feel_like_my/,"Hey everyone,

Haven't been back here for a while and probably need to give a brief history so there is some context to my current situation. I last left off from my first serious relationship from 18-20 ending with my heart being broken, her cheating on me, and just being overall devastated (This all stems from a partial LDR). I went through a summer depressed, lost twenty pounds, but finally emerged on the other side when I went back to university (my junior year). 

I slowly built my confidence back up and around late-October I met a really wonderful girl (call her G). G is a senior and graduated in May 2013.  So G and I slowly built up our relationship and everything has been absolutely great until June-ish (1 month ago). Now, since she graduated, she went back home (~2 hours away from me, and will be going back to higher ed ~40 minutes away from me in August), and the distance seems like it is taking its toll on me again (growing fears/insecurities).

I'm having is that I feel like I'm distancing myself away from her because I feel as though I'm afraid I'm going to be hurt again. I know in my head that I shouldn't have any thing to worry about because this girl is great and is NOTHING like my ex but I feel as though I've been so far cut down that some of my insecurities pop up.

They make me feel not confident and weak as an individual. When I met G I was really confident and really happy, and now I'm afraid to appear anything but that (Partially because I know G is a very independent person and has often stated how she enjoys how I have my own friends and we can spend time apart w/o being super attached/needy). I guess to put it, I'm afraid/worried of being unconfident and weak so much so that I am thereby being unconfident/weak.

On a related note, my ex had constantly ridiculed my sexual ability in the end stages of the relationship (i.e going through the motions of sex etc.) and it eventually led to p.e^* (sex &lt;2-4 minutes) with her. This past weekend was the first time while getting intimate I couldn't stop thinking about cumming and performance and lasted about &lt;~4 minutes each time. It seemed unsatisfactory for me and I *think* her (we regularly went at it 1-2x a day for 15+ minutes at least). This also makes me feel unconfident and brings back up the insecurities I faced in my previous relationship.

I should also note that I am currently working a stressful internship ~50-60 hrs a week, away from all my friends at school and home (don't really get to see any of them), and feel pretty alienated in my department in my internship (only intern in my department, don't get to see the other interns that much). Perhaps Stress has something to do with all this? Or even the amount of free time after work?

Also I did speak to G about some of the things bothering me and she was very supportive (didn't talk about the two pump chump ordeal) but talked about how an LDR hurt me in the past in a very general sense.

**tl;dr** Old insecurities are popping back up, facing recent performance issues, feeling insecure when I should be secure. Could be from stress? Could be from excessive free time after work? Don't know what to do or think to remedy this situation.


Thanks for reading guys.

1hisem,2,2013-07-02,"Win, win, win!",koryisma,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1hisem/win_win_win/,"I think I am a testament to how people with ADHD need to love what they do and then, sometimes, they can be unstoppable. 

First of all, I haven't started grad school yet, so I know that I'll probably eventually get bored and burnout on that eventually. I'm just trying to stay positive and focus on small wins. 

I've always wanted to go into international education. I was able to do it for two years while abroad and it was my favorite job ever. Unfortunately, in order to make a career of it, you pretty much need to have experience in a university office and a MA. 

Long story short: for the last two years, I have been in a job that sucks the life out of me. To make things worse, the processes I have to do are in direct contradiction to how I think. I have deadlines for every little thing. There are processes that involve multiple steps to get them done (when one won't work, it's easy for me to say ""I'll do it later"" and never do it.). 

This job is what finally pushed me to get diagnosed for ADHD. This job has stolen my voice and made me feel like shit about myself. I've never been in trouble so much at work. I've never been so bad at a job. The shit of it is that there are some things I excel at-- and some things that take me so out of my comfort zone that I don't even know where to start. It's caused anxiety, stress, nightmares, etc. 

Well. I finally just said screw it and applied to grad school at the last minute. It was a lot of WORK to apply, a lot of doing things that I didn't want to or that are challenging for me with ADHD, but because I WANTED it, I was able to do it. 

And now? I am working it. I've applied for 4 internships and have found 5-6 more. I KILLED it at an interview-- really nailed it. I met up with someone who just graduated and picked her brain. I've met with professors (not in the department, but people I have connections to) to ask them the best way to make grad school work. I have the parking pass-mad-scramble-date on my google calendar and haven't missed it yet! 

And I am working it. Because I love it. I've found my voice again. I've found something I am confident in. I am building up my confidence in myself again. I don't feel like as much shit about myself right now because I feel like I can be good at this. 

Again-- lesson learned. Do what you love. Do what you are passionate about. Do what makes you come alive. I hope and pray and am sending good thoughts to myself that things will fall into place because I will hustle to make it happen! :) "

1hifcd,4,2013-07-02,Went to Costco yesterday. Few questions.,aristocrat_user,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1hifcd/went_to_costco_yesterday_few_questions/,"I went mainly for meat shopping and here is what I found - 

1. Frozen chicken breasts were 2.199/lb. These were the least priced chicken breast. The fresh chicken breasts were &gt;3/lb. Also I checked out chciken in safeway, Fred Meyer , they dont carry frozen chciken breasts and their fresh chicken is always 2.5/lb. So did I get a good deal here with Costco? what other avenues should I try for getting Chicken breast below 2/lb? When do the stores usually have BOGO? Middle of the week? which stores should I try in specific? Any advise would be greatly beneficial for a struggling intern. Also if I get a whole chicken will I still get the same amount of breast meat at a lower price?

2. Pork. What is the cheapest cut of pork? I found some 2.5$/lb pork tenderloins chops. What is a good way to get pork for cheap. I have not investigated the prices of pork in Safeway and Ferd Meyer.

3. Salmon. Damn Damn Pricey! At 9.99/lb, I don't think I can afford Salmon :( Where do you guys get something like salmon? I crave for it but I really have trouble making ends meet. So I guess salmon is out of question. 

Thank you /r/Frugal

1hidgv,134,2013-07-02,"Turns out my f buddy had a girlfriend the entire time, should I tell her about her scumbag bf?",thesidedish_,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hidgv/turns_out_my_f_buddy_had_a_girlfriend_the_entire/,"It's been 5 months now since I'd been seeing this guy, we'll call him J.  We had one mutual friend on fb when he messaged me and things just took off from there.  He wanted to meet and we exchanged numbers.  

In late Janurary we began messaging and texting on a daily basis.  I was a little reluctant at first because I had ended my engagement with my bf of 7 years in October and I was still a little nervous about seeing anyone. 

I fell for J right away, and I started feeling anxiety because of the excitement of a new guy and at the same time I was nervous about actually moving on.  What would my fiance say, my parents, my friends, his family?  In a matter of weeks I lost 12 lbs and I was completely head over heels for J.  He was the polar opposite of my fiance, tall, charming, talkative, and confident.  

We went to dinner for our first date and I was very timid and nervous, but it went well.  As we continued to talk, he kept pointing out how he felt I had no interest in him since I was so reserved.  It was to the point where I wouldn't answer his calls because I was so nervous.  I explained to him that I was not up for games and I was afraid of getting hurt.  I made it clear to him that I really liked him and my feelings for him frightened me. My fiance was the ONLY man in my life for 7 years and we were planning our wedding, naturally I wasn't ready for a new relationship.  

Valentine's Day came along and I was pleasantly surprised when he asked to take me on a second date, which he canceled that evening with a half ass excuse.  This is when I should've ran but I chose to give him the benefit of the doubt.  Every morning he'd text me cute little messages and he'd continue throughout the day.  Initially I was ok with just texting because I wanted to take it slow.  I was weary as to why he didn't push for more, but I convinced myself that if he wasn't interested in me he'd just stop looking for me period.  

In a span of several weeks we went on two more dates, and it was on our fourth date that we started messing around.  I told him that it didn't feel right because we weren't official and we wouldn't really see each other often and it made me feel slutty.  Again my mistake, nothing changed we continued with texting everyday and after our fifth date we went over to his place and had sex. After that, that's all it became.  He would text me everyday with pics of himself, his friends, dinner, or whatever it was he was doing.  Again, I told myself he's just a bachelor and he's having fun.  He'd make plans with me for real dates then he'd bail or cancel.  Yet, I convinced myself that since he looked for me everyday, he did like me.  Even though it hurt my self-esteem, if sex was the only way I'd get to see him I continued to stick around.  I did make it clear to him that since he didn’t want to take it further with me, he had to be honest.  If he got serious with anyone or started dating, I could no longer see him.  He always assured me that he was happy with what we had and that he barely had time for me, much less a gf.
It’s now been 5 months of this and last week I finally mustered up the courage to cut it off.  It hurt that he was totally ok with it, but why would I want someone who doesn’t want me?  I’d been doing really well getting over him, not even stalking his fb page anymore hehe.  Until yesterday, he shared a link and he had a comment that said “I love you!” from a girl I’d previously questioned him about and he’d said she was nobody, just a friend.  I was determined to find out once and for all if he just didn’t like me, or if there was someone else all along.  I found her instagram and it was there that I saw it all .  Even though I suspected it, I was still lied to and it hurt like hell.  He’s been with her for 10 months, and seeing me for 5, she’s so in love with him it makes me sick.  

Obviously, I never meant anything to him.  I should have kept what was left of my dignity and put my foot down a long time ago, but I couldn’t.  Me giving up was perfect timing for him because apparently she’s been out of state for an internship and gets back in a week.  He still doesn’t know that I know.  The question is should I tell her what a piece of shit bf she has?  Or is it not my place since I never meant anything to him?

TL;DR: I was someone’s f buddy for 5 months, turns out he has a girlfriend of 10 months.  Should I tell her about him cheating or should I just confront him and walk away? 

edit: ****UPDATE (somewhat)  I asked her for her email through instagram and she replied but I haven't mustered up the courage to tell her.  I'm sitting here staring at the long email I typed out for her.  Last night he had the audacity to text me at 2 am, I didn't reply.  This morning I told him I knew about her and I called him out on it, the principle is that he knew I would've never messed around with him if I knew he had someone else.  He said he knew lately I'd been asking around about him and that since last week when I told him I wanted nothing from him, he respected that and that I should do the same.  He said he's sorry for what he did, and that she's not his gf and I don't understand their relationship, for me to stay out of it.  I know for a fact that they are not in an open relationship, and the comments and pictures on her instagram say it all.  I'm 26 and I'm an elementary teacher, I have a decent reputation and my biggest mistake has been this idiot.  I feel she should know he's a cheater but I'm truly embarrassed to be caught up in this.  I'm afraid to open up this can of worms, I'm afraid people will find out and I'm afraid he'll harass me about it.  "
1hi80z,0,2013-07-02,A New Outlook on the Dietary Value of Fast Food,stikshift,Health,https://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/1hi80z/a_new_outlook_on_the_dietary_value_of_fast_food/,"Let me start off with a little frame of reference...

Currently I'm working two jobs this summer; a 40-hour-a-week internship and a part time lifeguarding job at a health club. Occasionally, after working a full day at the internship, I'll pick up a few hours at the pool to generate a little spending money. On those days I'll sometimes skip lunch and just pick up dinner somewhere on my way between the two jobs.

Where I work is in the heart of North Jersey, a very dense suburban area. There are few major highways around, with the exception of a couple interstates, so restaurants are fairly scarce; there's a supermarket, a few small local places and a couple fast food joints, but that's pretty much it.

Yesterday I chose to take some hours at the pool after work, so I figured 'hey, why don't I treat myself and get something from Burger King?' I don't normally eat fast food that often when I'm home and when I do it's normally a late-night snack kind of thing. Anyway, I decided on a Carolina Whopper meal just to try it, and it was pretty good! Basically it's just a regular Whopper with some bacon and barbecue sauce, but it was different. So I eat it real quick and I head over to the pool to work. By the time I arrive, I find I'm hungry again, but I just kinda ignore it, thinking it probably hasn't hit my stomach yet.

About two and a half hours into my shift, I start feeling very tired. I was losing focus while I was on stand (kind of dangerous for a lifeguard to be doing) and I was yawning excessively, about two or three times a minute. I get rotated off and head to the break room, and as soon as I sit down I completely crash. I felt dizzy and nauseous, unable to stand up without falling back down and I'm shaking uncontrollably. Luckily I realized what was happening; I was going into hypoglycemic shock. I remembered that earlier I had thrown an apple juice box into the fridge (I don't know whose it was) so I stumbled to the fridge and downed it. Within five minutes I felt better and continued working. After my shift, I came home, at a proper dinner and went to bed and I feel great today.

It took me a while to realize what had happened. There's no history of diabetes in my bloodline and I eat a relatively balanced diet, so I ruled that out. Then I thought back to what I had eaten. The Whopper. That's it. My body hadn't actually digested it. Instead, it just moved it along in my digestive tract without actually using it for energy. But why would it do that? Is there something in the burger that alerts my body not to digest it? If there's no real nutritional value in the food, how to people eat it regularly and still survive?

I've never been anti-fast food, in fact I support the industry because of all the technological advances it has come up with concerning food preservation and transportation. Like I mentioned earlier, I don't normally eat fast food as a ""meal"" because I understand the health risks involved of eating it regularly, but how can Big Food cut so many corners to the point that their food provides little to no sustenance? I've always been interested in joining the food processing industry and employing better processes to improve the nutritional value of processed foods, and this only intrigues me further.

TL;DR - Had super low blood sugar because a Whopper has no nutritional value"

1hhxvs,7,2013-07-02,Moving in with a roommate after 2 years of living alone. Halp?,PartTimeNerd,introvert,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/1hhxvs/moving_in_with_a_roommate_after_2_years_of_living/,"Sorry in advance for the large wall of text.

So basically, I'm going to be moving in with a friend come August to try and cut some bills. Right now I live alone in a studio and I love it. Only problem is I lost my job in March and well, paying $720 for rent, adding utilities and my student loans... It's a bit much. The only thing is I've come to love it. I did have a 3 month stint with another roommate, but it was different. I was just filling a gap where his old roommate left after she graduated college, then we were going to re-up the lease. (that backfired in so many ways...  but anyway...) This time I'm going full in with my friend (and parents as co-signers). I also lived with 5 other girls in college for 3 out of the 4 years I was there. So I haven't had issues with living with people before. Hell, it's not even like we'd be sharing a room. It's a 2 bedroom condo. 

Last night it started to hit me that I'm actually moving soon. I have to start packing again (I've moved 3 times in the last 2 years) and my times of solitude are coming to an end. My anxiety and introversion are making my imagination run wild. I had dreams of people breaking in through the back glass sliding door. It's a small plot with a bunch of condos in a relatively out of the way area... The place we're probably going to end up with is out of the way from where I've been living, though. It's a bout 30 minutes north west of where I currently am. I think I've just become attached to the place and the area and don't want to leave. I want some kind of consistency. (Also I just started taking awesome drum lessons and don't want a giant commute for that. It's my one thing for myself right now.)

So /r/Introvert, I'm in need of some kind words and maybe some advice on how to learn to live with a roommate again. I can't just say ""you know, I'd like to live by myself"" because she's currently doing an internship out of state and will have no place to go once it's finished other than moving in with me and I'm the one that offered the suggestion months ago.

1hhpz1,6,2013-07-02,(x-post from cscareerquestions) Graduating top of my class in a 3rd-world country. DESPERATE for relocation.,[deleted],IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/1hhpz1/xpost_from_cscareerquestions_graduating_top_of_my/,"Link to original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1hf557/graduating_top_of_my_class_in_a_3rdworld_country/

So I'm 20 years old and live in the Philippines right now (Filipino Citizen) and I don't see any bright future if I stay here. Fresh grad Software Developers here are paid something around U.S. $450-$700 per month if converted, so I am really desperate to relocate to any country that on average pays fresh grads competitively. The problem is relocation is rarely offered for fresh grads. It makes sense for them though, if they can hire a student who lives just down the street, why bother hiring one living hundreds of kilometers away?

Now, I am not saying that I am a very very good Software Developer, but when I graduate this March 2014, I will be the only one to graduate with honors (Magna Cum Laude). There are no other Computer Science students that will graduate Summa or regular Cum Laude. Experience-wise, I had my internship already and was able to work on a real-world project for a medium-sized company where I experienced activities like code reviews, stand-up meetings, using git to actually collaborate, even learning new languages and frameworks and implementing something in it in a short amount of time.
I have my own Android App at the Google Play store with around 20,000 downloads and a 4.9-star rating. Also, I have made some simple games on mobile and desktop platforms. Lastly, I am VERY active in my local developer groups, even winning several hackathons. I'm planning to start heavily contributing to open source projects before I graduate as well since I got a lot of advice regarding that. I'm aware I'm not the best, far from it actually, but I think of myself as notable.

I didn't mention all this to boast, but so that you guys can judge me if you think I am competitive as a fresh grad on a global level (you can be as harsh as you like, I will take it). If you think I am indeed competitive, what advice or insights can you give regarding my predicament of being constrained to the Philippines right after I graduate?"

*We switch backstage to Troy Stone and Jim the Gaucho in front of an RWF banner. They look thrilled.*  
 
Dawson: Troy, tonight you face Will Blaade in a huge contest. Are you ready?
 
Stone: Ready? Are you kidding? This is gong to be a breeze.  
 
Gaucho: We're rolllllllin' over the Congregation!  
 
Dawson: Hey...where's Roy.  
 
Stone: He said he had to leave early. Not sure what's up. Let's go, Jim.  
 
*Troy and Jim head to the right of the screen.*  
 
Dawson: Back to you, John.

Laurie: The following Contest is scheduled for one fall…

Andrews:  This should be interesting to say the least.

Slam:  Yeah Troy Stone is going to get the crud kicked out of him.

Andrews:  You can’t seriously…

The arena goes dark as Last Ride of the Day by Nightwish screams across the arena and out steps Jim the Gaucho doing his best Jimmy Hart impersonation, gyrating and screaming the praises of Troy Stone who follows him out to a huge pop that warps into a EGG! PLANT! Chant.  Jim’s obvious disappointment wipes away every bit of his enthusiasm and he walks slowly behind Troy to the ring.

Laurie:  Troy Stone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Andrews:  You’re seriously rooting for William Blaade?

Slam:  I’ll root for anyone who’s in Blaade’s  situation, Stone and the Foundation have been sticking their noses in the business of Joey Knight and Damien Mitchell and the Blaade Brothers are just protecting their own.

Laurie:  And introducing next, representing the Congregation of the Unseen….

The arena goes dark and a gregorian chant fills the arena, Damien Mitchell steps out and is immediately flanked by the brothers in their matching porcelain masks.  They make their way slowly to the ring where William tears his hood and mask of and runs up the stairs, leaning over the ropes pointing at Troy.

Andrews:    These three are just bullies.  If you don’t toe their line then the will beat you into it.

Slam:  I don’t normally compliment you but that was a great turn of phrase.

Andrews:  Thank you.

The ref barely has time to ring the bell as William Blaade sprints across the ring and connects with a punch the drops Troy, Troy rolls over and gets up only to be knocked down again by another lariat, he rolls up again and connects with a dropkick to counter another lariat!
Andrews:  That is called ring presence, Rodney!

Slam:  He got some tremendous air off that dropkick.

William shakes it off and reverses Troy’s Irish whip and attempts to connect with a big boot that Troy slides under scrambling back and hitting Blaade with a chop block before the big man can turn around.

Andrews:  Quick thinking by Troy, Blaade was going to kick his head off!

Slam:  Don’t be so dramatic.

Outside Jim has strayed too close to Corey who turns fist raised and ready to hit Gaucho, who flinches and jumps back.  Back in the ring, Troy has William and is working on the leg with kicks and elbows.  William rolls out towards his brother and Damien and is protected for a moment with Troy standing in the ring stopping short at the ropes.  

Andrews:  Look at the big man run.

Slam:  Run?  It’s a tactical retreat.

Troy and Corey get into a shouting match as Troy stands above, suddenly William reaches out and drags Troy out of the ring and to the floor outside where the larger Blaade brother starts reigning blows at Troy’s head, Gaucho runs over but finds himself blocked by both Corey and Damien.  William pulls Troy to his feet and rams him into the apron.

Slam:  Look at that- William is a monster.

Andrews:  Underhanded I think.

Slam:  How so, neither Corey nor Damien are getting involved except to deny outside help from the old Parmigiana there.

Andrews:  You---you’re  right.

Rolling Troy into the ring and sliding William again pulls Troy to his feet and sends him into the ropes catching Troy on the rebound with a powerslam!  William hooks the leg 

1..

2…

Troy kicks out!

Slam:  Powerslam! 

Andrews:  He got all of that and somehow Troy still managed to kick out!

Troy is slow to his feet and William forces him into the corner with a series of punches and lifts Troy to the top turnbuckle following to the second rope trying to lift Troy into a fireman’s carry but Troy scrambles over and counters with a sunset flip powerbomb.  He runs over for the pin.

1.. 2…Kick out

Andrews:  Another fantastic move by Troy.

Slam:  But how much longer will he be able to stay just ahead of William Blaade?

Blaade and Troy get up slowly and meet with a flurry of punches Troy gets off a kick to the stomach before hitting the ropes and taking off with a cross body that William catches, he hoists Troy onto his shoulders, spinning once before bringing him down into a backbreaker and sliding him over for the pin.

1…

Andrews:  He calls that the… Smashville Express number 2! 

2….

Slam:  That is a lot of force.

3!!

Slam:  I wonder if it’s like the Jecht Shot?

Andrews:  What?

The referee is shoed away by Mitchell who raises William’s hand.   Troy stands to find himself surrounded by the Congregation and alone, when Gaucho slides in the ring with a chair.  The three men step back and undeterred move in to attack, when Roy Firestone and Joey Knight come sliding in the ring following a sprint down the ramp.

Slam:  Remember in the world of wrestling your friends matter.

Andrews:  Joey Knight and Roy Firestone to the rescue!

All six men and a Gaucho stand in the ring before the Congregation leave quietly when the ref and security break them up.

Andrews: We’re going to head to a quick commercial while this mess gets cleaned up, and then it’s time for James Lafontaine to take on Number One Contender RJ Supernova! Don’t go away!

*Another commercial for Santa with Muscles 2 plays*

Slam: Aaaaaand we’re back! Get ready for an interesting match-up here tonight!

Laurie: The following contest is scheduled for one fall! Introducing first, from Buffalo, New York and fighting out of San Luis Obispo, California, the Sunshien Superman, RJ Supernovaaaaaaaaa!

*Holly Wood the Cracked by Coheed and Cambria comes blaring over the PA as fan-favorite RJ Supernova comes running down the ramp to a mass cheer from the RWF audience. He slides into the ring effortlessly and pops up and onto a turnbuckle where he raises his hands to the crowd, who pop big even here in Canada for California’s favorite adopted son. He hits the opposite turnbuckle and repeats the gesture to another set of cheers and whistles. Hopping down with a smile, RJ takes his corner*

Laurie: And his opponent, from New Haven, Connecticut but currently based in Hurtsville as an intern, the Highborn Hammer, Jaaaames Laaaafontaaaaaaine!

*The arena grows quiet for a moment and the lights dim. Suddenly incongruously familiar music plays and The Foiler comes down the ramp on a bicycle (an EVIL bicycle), dressed in black sweats and an orange sweater with a towel slung over his shoulders. Jogging along about a half-dozen strides behind is James Lafontaine, wearing a pink sweatsuit. The Foiler rides down to ringside and stops, telling James ‘Join the Nintendo Fun Club today!’. Lafontaine gives him a puzzled look that is matched only by the other puzzled look, when he heads through the ropes and his sweatsuit disappears in a mild purple smoke, leaving James thankfully in his usual ring gear. The Foiler gets off his bicycle and sits himself at the announcer’s table*

Andrews: We don’t have you scheduled for guest commentator!

The Foiler: That is accurate.

*DINGDINGDING*

*As the bell rings, both RJ Supernova and James Lafontaine begin the feeling-out process. They circle, but it becomes clear neither has a significant mobility advantage. After a few probing feints from both men, RJ moves in for a collar-and-elbow, immediately pressing his small size advantage and backing up Lafontaine to the corner slowly. As they near it, James suddenly breaks the tie-up and drops, hitting a leg scissor that forces Supernova to fall forward where his chin hits the second turnbuckle. He quickly regains his bearing and turns on one knee to meet James, who is ready and waiting with a boot to the chest that leaves RJ flat on his back. He jumps up for an elbow drop, but meets the mat as Supernova rolls out of the way and onto the apron. Timing Lafontaine expertly, Supernova slingshots into the ring and hooks James’ neck, flipping over behind him to complete the Slingshot Blockbuster!*

Andrews: That, folks is why RJ Supernova is the Number One Contender!

*Supernova drops and hooks the near leg for a pinfall attempt, but Lafontaine is up with only a 1-count. Rolling upright quickly, Lafontaine sends an unexpected kick to Supernova’s shin and follows immediately with a wicked uppercut. A short step back while Supernova is turned around sets up the Superkick, and Supernova’s head snaps back with the impact!*

Andrews: Clever combination from James Lafontaine.

Slam: More clever than your commentary!

The Foiler: Ahahaha! Slick, but it won’t even things up on its own. Supernova’s size and strength advantages are minimal and Lafontaine is every bit as quick as he is.

Slam: Not as quick as Senor Tigre, I’d wager.

Andrews: Brown-noser.

The Foiler: Nobody’s as fast as Tigre, aha, nobody in the world. What Jimmy out there needs to do is take away one of Supernova’s weapons, damage a limb, that sort of thing. Supernova has a big experience advantage here, so Lafontaine needs to take away something else. 

*Lafontaine falls forward, hooking RJ’s legs in a Prawn hold for a pinfall of his own. The ref drops and counts once, but RJ locks up James with a wristlock and uses his legs to roll him off to the side.  Supernova stands, with Lafontaine on the mat, wrist bent painfully while Supernova wrenches on it methodically. He steps over the arm and increases the pressure, and Lafontaine’s face shows the pain he is suffering*

Andrews: And again the sunshine Superman one-ups his competition!

The Foiler: Do you believe that could be anywhere near as painful as what I put Lafontaine through? Pain can be feared, and to an extent ignored. Or pain can be accepted, even embraced. 

*The pained look on his face slowly turning to one of calm, James Lafontaine plants his free hand on the ground and pulls his legs up, shifting his weight and executing a one-armed headstand before bringing his feet down towards his head, reversing the twisting of the arm by Supernova. Now standing, Lafontaine uses his free hand to counter further with a standing armbar on RJ. He brings an elbow down across the shoulder of the Number One Contender and pulls him towards the rope.  A kick to the ribs stuns the California native and James Lafontaine steps to the second rope and plants a foot on the top rope, pushing off and extending his legs in mid-air. He gets a foot under the restrained arm of Supernova and another under his chin as he descends, landing on his back and simultaneously wrenching Supernova’s shoulder and cracking his jaw to an amazed pop from the crowd*

The Foiler: Oooh, I like that one! Looks like something sank in back in Hurtsville, ahaha!

Andrews: Well, he’s still got a long way to go.

The Foiler: Supernova isn’t insurmountable. That blue blood of his has got a little bit of purple in it now.

Slam: I don’t want to know how literal that is. Still, that was an amazing move!

The Foiler: He calls that one the ‘Upper Crust’. Well, according to me he does.

*Stalking RJ as he struggles to his feet, James winds back for a big right hand, but RJ’s instincts kick in and he dodges, countering with the Side Effect! Supernova rubs his wounded shoulder as he gets up again, then runs for the ropes and springboards up into a masterful Lionsault! He hooks a leg for another pin attempt and the ref begins to make the count, but Lafontaine is able to shake him off at 2*

The Foiler: Hard to hold a man down with one arm, eh? Aha!

Andrews: You could show the Number One Contender a little respect.

The Foiler: Why start now?

Slam: I know! The nerve of this guy, amiright, Foiler?

The Foiler: It’s *The* Foiler.

*Staring at the ref, RJ Supernova is visibly frustrated by the resilience of James Lafontaine. He gets up and catches James with a punch to the ribs with his good hand, then slips behind and grabs Lafontaine’s wrists. He crosses them over his opponents chest in a Straightjacket hold and tires to hoist Lafontaine up on his shoulder, but the damage already inflicted is making it hard. Lafontaine begins to twist and struggle, but Supernova cuts that short with a headbutt to the back of the skull. GHrittinghis teeth, RJ hefts James up onto his shoulder, then twists and extends a knee, bringing him down in sickening fashion with his specialty, the Straightjacket Backbreaker!*

Andrews: Say hello to the next RWF Champion, boys!

Slam: Did you really just say that?

The Foiler: Did he just call me ‘boy’? How do you feel about, ahaha, eggplants, John?

Andrews: Eep… and RJ Supernova goes for a pinning combination!

*Conveniently, Supernova does go for the pin, attempting a lateral press on the pain-wracked form of James Lafontaine. The ref makes the count, but again Lafontaine kicks out at 2.5! Supernova winces as he is pushed backwards and his weakened wing takes the brunt of his weight, and the look of intensity in his eyes is somewhere between unbridled focus and unhinged mania, with a definite dose of agony*

Andrews: Another kick-out! The damage has been done by Lafontaine, and at the very least it’s buying him some time.

Slam:  All that sunshine must have fired RJ’s pea-brain, because he’s fading fast and refuses to acknowledge it.

Andrews: That’s the fighting spirit of RJ Supernova!

The Foiler: It’s the fighting spirit of an idiot, ahaha! He needs to compensate for the injury, not pretend it will go away. He’s brave, but so are a lot of dead men. Survivors know how to think on their feet.

*His face reddening and contorted in murderous rage, RJ sends a kick to the gut of Lafontaine and bends him forward for a standing head scissor, looking for what appears to be a Powerbomb. He holds his good arm up high, drawing strength from the electric crowd much in the way King Kong draws strength from power lines in the seminal 1963 classic, King Kong vs Godzilla. Somehow, Supernova reaches down deep and finds the strength to lift James Lafontaine up onto his shoulders… and then James spins around, seated atop RJ’s shoulders like an Electric Chair hold. He puts a brutal and precise pointed elbow strike to the weakened shoulder area, staggering RJ, and another pair of shots cause Supernova to lose his balance and fall to a seated position*

Slam: Lafontaine’s really rubbing salt in that wound! I’m loving this!

Andrews: You just want Supernova to look bad!

The Foiler: Oh, come now. RJ can handle that all on his own, ahahaha!

*Still on RJ’s shoulders, James puts his feet in front of RJ’s arms and uses one to stomp his belly, causing him to double up as the wind is knocked out of him. Lafontaine reaches out and hooks Supernova’s nearest leg, stretching it painfully while using his full body weight on the restrained neck and shoulders of RJ. The former King of California is locked up with no place to go, and after a few tense moments in the nearly-inescapable hold RJ Supernova is forced to tap out*

*DINGDINGDING*

Andrews: What an upset that was! James Lafontaine has just defeated Number One Contender and longtime RWF star RJ Supernova! This is nearly unprecedented!

Slam: And the finish! Beautifully executed Stump Puller, a little tribute to the recently deceased Matt Borne. Love him or hate him, James Lafontaine is a class act. And his sister is freaking hot.

The Foiler: Right on both counts, Roddy, ahaha!

*On the entrance ramp, Mr. Saito appears.*  
 
Andrews: Woah! Mr. Saito is a member of the RWF Board. What could this be?  
 
Saito: Mister… Supernova? Indeed. I have just completed a meeting with rest of the Board and I hate to waste time, so I will get right to the point. You are scheduled for an RWF Championship match at Gold Rush?  
 
*RJ Supernova shakes his head yes.*  
 
Slam: No surprise here.  
 
Saito: That match have special referee...Ricardo Sacramento.  
 
*RJ Supernova looks stunned as Mr. Saito bows and heads back to the back silently.*  
 
Andrews: This is incredible! RJ Supernova gets his world title shot, but his former partner will be the referee?  
 
Slam: The deck is stacked against the #1 contender. There's no way Christopher Steel doesn't win that match.  
 
Andrews: RJ Supernova is more determined than ever right now. Don't count him out, Rodney.

1hh82r,1,2013-07-02,Did anyone read the Bob Lawblaw's Law Blog Dog Law article?,beleriand,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hh82r/did_anyone_read_the_bob_lawblaws_law_blog_dog_law/,"Seriously though.  About three years ago, I moved to Florida because my girlfriend of 5-6 years, at the time, had the opportunity to intern as a chef at a prestigious resort.  Now, I didn't want to move, but she didn't give me any choice.  She didn't want to talk about it.  She was moving to Florida, no matter what.  She didn't even bother to ask how I felt about it, and she'd get upset when I would suggest she stay in our home town.  It was take it or leave it, except she didn't even have the courtesy to lay it out that clearly.  Well, it was a pretty simple decision, I just moved.  But, I work from home, and she was working 80-100 hours a week in the ridiculous chef industry.  She gave it up after less than a year, by the way.  She gave it up completely.  So, that's how important it was to her.  Anyway, it was one of those retirement communities, full of old people, so it was hard to meet people, and there was nothing to do.  I was lonely as fuck.  I'm not exaggerating, she really worked 80-100 hours a week.

So, I got a dog.  I picked her out.  I picked her up from the pound, and drove her home.  I even told my ex ""It's really important that this dog likes me.""  I told her that several times.  So, for a year, all I did was take care of this dog, Rowen.  I played with her, took her for long ass walks.  I took her to the dog park every day because I literally had nothing else to do.

Now, when we moved back home.  There was a period of a few months when my ex didn't have a job, and took care of Rowen along with me.  She did a lot of intense training, on a really long leash so that Rowen could learn to be off leash.  But, that ended, and my ex started working 60-80 hours a week again at some stupid dead-end job because she's a workaholic and can't say ""no"" to her bosses.  Well, I was back to taking care of Rowen most of the time.

To cut this short before it gets out-of-hand, we had Rowen for 3 years.  I spent much more time with her than my ex did, but somehow she convinced herself that Rowen was her dog.  We broke up after 9 years together, and she just didn't want to talk about it.  I was forced to move somewhere where I couldn't have two dogs.  We had two dogs.  I got Freya, who we had for a year.  Then, my ex packed her bags and moved to a different state.  This all happened really quickly.  Too quickly for me to get a handle on what was going on.  I was devastated by the break up, and my ex just completely severed communication, immediately.  And, the thing is, as long as she feels fine about things, it doesn't matter how another person feels.  In her head, Rowen was hers because she had spent that time training her.  I don't know if she's just incapable of imagining how much time I spent with Rowen, or if she just doesn't care.  And, I kept telling her that she was stealing my dog and she'd just get pissed.  She said something like:  ""would you really take her?""  Like, because I couldn't take her at the time, that justified her taking her and moving out of state.

So, I want my dog back, but I feel like she probably had her registered in her name.  What can I do?  What's legal?  I feel like my only option is to just sneak up, grab Rowen, and get the fuck out of Kentucky.

**TL;DR: I feel like my ex stole my dog.  She moved to a different state.  She probably registered the dog in her name in that state.   I want my dog back.  What can I do to get the dog back?**"

My dad spends most of his time at his wife's house (6 hours away, and that's a whole different story) so he doesn't bother to keep the fastest internet (important in a minute). I am working as an engineering intern; however, my boss is traveling around right now getting jobs for the firm all around the country, so I mostly work at home on my laptop and desktop simultaneously. 

My brother is an avid League of Legends player. He works in the morning, usually 8-12. And I usually work though the day while keeping odd hours, anywhen from 10-6 or sometimes even 12-9. When he gets home he expects me to immediately get of the internet so he can play his game, while I am in the office downstairs, getting paid. 

He always yells down to me to get off so he can play. Sometimes he texts my from across the house to yell at me. I can't help but use bandwidth for my JOB but he doesn't understand that. He thinks I didn't earn my internship and that I couldn't possibly be working all day. I feel like when I'm using the wifi to work, it's totally reasonable that he should either deal with it or find something else to do. How can I get him to understand that my work warrants more bandwidth than his online gaming?


TL;DR My brother yells at me for sucking up bandwidth when I'm working so he can play League of Legends."
1hgryt,0,2013-07-01,Germany --&gt; USA,[deleted],IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/1hgryt/germany_usa/,"Hello,
I want to move to the US sometime. It's not going to be in the next years, because I want to study here, but I want to prepare as soon as possible. I probably will study computer science at a university of applied science. I don't know yet if I'm just going to do a bachlor or a master as well. I start university in two years if I don't fail my exams.

I have this dream since 8th grade and it helped me through a difficult time of my life. 

I informed myself over the years and know some requirements. I either have the option to go into the lottery or through a hb1 visa. I have relatives over in the USA, but they are just my greatcousins (if something like this exists), so no options there. Over the years I read an awful lot about how hard it is and it's always a big bummer, because I then think I'm never going to make it.

When I study I want to try to get an internship in the US, just to get a feel and stuff. Or should I attend a college for one year abroad?

Any advice? Any info you need, feel free to ask!

I hope my grammar is alright."

BR -&gt; ?,[deleted],IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/1hgovw/and_there_he_stood_at_the_crossroad_called_life_br/,"Hey people of reddit, I have been lurking around here for some time and by chance discovered this subreddit and decided to register and to give it a try, so this is my first post (be kind =]).

Lately I have been thinking of trying to work abroad. I'm aiming at countries where english is the main language or one of the most common, since this is the second language I know most (first being brazilian portuguese). I can handle myself in English interactions, but I'm not nearly as good as it is desirable (as you'll see in some errors you'll find in this text),  although I think I could improve very fast if it was needed of me to speak it every day. Also I wouldn't mind learning a new language. I don't have any other citizenship than brazilian, so I guess this limits my options.

I am a 22yo(turn 23 this year) male and in the end of this year or half of the next year I'll be graduating as a bachelor in Computer Science. I'll graduate with an average score of 9.1 of 10 (not THAT impressive) assuming I don't screw up in the few remaining disciplines.

Currently I'm working as a web developer in a small company. Working with PHP,HTML, CSS, Jquery, Oracle, SQL, MySQL and Zend Framework. To be honest this is my first full-time job (I have been there for almost two and a half years), I did some internships before this one, but as you can see I'm not very experienced.

I'm looking at countries that have a high human development index where you can lead a pretty decent life in general and have better opportunities. I work with IT so it has to have a good job market in that field. 
I'd like to go to Australia, Canada or the USA, but I really don't know much about how hard it is for foreigners to be able to live and work in these countries and if it is possible to find some job as soon as I get there (I have some money saved up, around 11k USD, but I think that wouldn't last much).

I have no criminal convictions, not even a speeding ticket.

I come here to ask you if it's possible to nurture such dream or if I'm not wasting my time overthinking about this. 
Also I'd like to know which skills and knowledge do you think I should develop and hone if I want to go work abroad in those countries I mentioned before. You can also suggest other countries where you think a person with my profile would fit. 

Any advices, suggestions and information on the subject are welcome. 
Thanks in advance.


*PS: I'm really sorry for this wall of text, after I started typing things got crazy, but if you reached here know that I'm already grateful even if you don't comment.*

1hlnai,0,2013-07-03,Does he (25M) like me (21F)? (Warning: this is super long.),[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hlnai/does_he_25m_like_me_21f_warning_this_is_super_long/,"Over three years ago, I acquired the services of a college essay editor when I was a senior in high school disappointed with the outcome of my college application process. 

May 2010: 
- I was busy studying for A-levels at the time we started corresponding (mid-May 2010, right around the time he graduated from his Ivy), had a lot going on in my life before graduation, and the short of it is that I was unavailable to answer his emails due to my schedule.  
- Weird coincidence 1: I saw him in a motorboat with a few of his friends over the Memorial Day holiday whilst I was kayaking.  I knew upon seeing him that it was him, given that I’d looked at his picture at the start of our conversations; I don’t know if he knew it was me because he didn’t smile at me or acknowledge my presence beyond staring at me. 
June 2010:
-I was busy moving out of my boarding school and back into my parent’s house as well as preparing for my Indian debutante party + Indian dance graduation, so I was unable to respond to any of his emails.  He became a bit clingy at this point, which is understandable; I was working on my essays to the best of my ability.
July - August 2010:
- I was abroad for an internship and began submitting my essays for him to review. 
- I had gotten over a crush on another guy around August and began crushing hard on him around this time.  We were flirting quite a bit over the editing interface.
- Annoying 1: Presumably, B told the company owner that he needed more money to continue editing my work even when the word count and amount of recycled material I’d used from other essays to put into different essays indicated otherwise.  I complied with the request immediately.
September 2010:
- I started college and continued working with him on my essays.  I think I mostly responded immediately after getting them.
- Weird coincidence 2: I saw him in a car leaving a garage not far from my dorm twice, first around the second week of school and second around the fourth week of school.  The first time, he checked me out when I looked absolutely awful in sweatpants and a t-shirt; the second time, I ran into a pole whilst on my bike due to being so overwhelmed when his eyes were on me.  
- Weird coincidence 3: A detail from one of my Columbia essays appeared on the sidewalk near my dorm: there was no way that a pin from my favourite New York museum could have ended up at my large Midwestern school had it not been deliberately placed.  I found it quite flattering, though I’m unsure whether he placed it or someone who happened to be from New York who visited that museum and retrieved that particular colour of pin dropped it so close to my dorm.

October – November 2010:
- Annoying incident 2: B went distant for a few days when the company owner said I had to pay more money for going over the word count for editing one of my other essays.  
- Weird coincidence 4: I mentioned in one of our correspondences and in a copy of my resume that I’d be presenting at a forum in San Francisco on such and such date.  He showed up to this forum, walking by my presentation and looking at me before looking away.  The likelihood that he would have been at the forum out of curiosity otherwise is impossible; he was supposed to be living in Los Angeles at the time and the discipline I was focused on is different from his academic and extracurricular interests.
-Weird coincidence 5: In a separate correspondence, I told him that I’d be going to a premed conference in Providence, RI on a different weekend.  I saw him in line at a party I’d been invited to at Brown, which is weird given that he graduated from college that spring and wouldn’t have been there had I not said something.  It was just weird, though in strange way it made me feel liked (even though I was starting to crush on a different guy during that time).
- Embarrassing incident he may or may not have been aware of: I friend requested him on Facebook when scrolling through his pictures and then deactivated my account 50 minutes later after I discovered I couldn’t reverse the friend request.  

December 2010:
- With 90% of my essays done in early December, I realised that I had a term paper due in a short time frame that I had previously thought was due the week of finals.  I asked the company owner if B might be able to edit a term paper on a short deadline (all-nighter), and B said he would.  I stayed up all night and B got around 2-3 hours of sleep to help me meet the deadline of 11:30 am.  The fact that he went out of his way for me and woke up so early to make my essay a jumbling Red Bull mess into something clear, coherent, and nice sounding endeared me to him.  I really fell for him.
- A few days later, as we neared completion of my final transfer app essays, he disappeared for like 2-3 days.  When he came back with the final edits, he said that he’d been busy preparing for the LSAT and therefore couldn't get back to me immediately.
- We finished my final transfer app essays around mid-December and he didn’t take any of the money I’d posted to my account until the very end of our correspondence when he could’ve taken it at the beginning, like he did in the first batch of essays; I took this as an indication that he liked me since it wouldn’t have made sense for him to do this unless the money wasn’t really a big deal to him.  I was so sad about ending our correspondence since he had basically been the light of my life and I loved hearing from him each day, so I was cold and dismissive when it was time to part.  I was just a complete bitch and I regret acting so childish when I should’ve been more appreciative for how much he’d helped me. He responded politely, wishing me “good luck,” though I must say that I saw his saying that as mildly condescending given my reading of The Catcher in the Rye.  
January 2011:
- Around NYE, I started missing him like crazy and realised that I hadn’t finished one of the personal statement sections for my Harvard app.  I wrote him a really long letter on the editing interface asking if he might look at the stuff I’d worked on and he didn’t respond.  Instead of hearing from him, I heard from the company owner who talked about B’s concern for “time” and that I’d used up my previous word count.  I presumed that B had written the company owner, said that he didn’t have the time to edit another one of my essays, and just dropped me. The company owner then asked me for more money with a small 10% discount and after spending, like, four grand on everything thus far I didn’t feel like asking my parents for more money.  So I told the company owner that I’d work on the Harvard app by myself and see what I could do.  I didn’t hear from B again.
- In February 2011, I saw that his Facebook picture changed form a single shot to a picture with a very pretty girl holding some sort of beer bottle.  We weren’t friends, but he was searchable and I sometimes liked looking at his pictures.  I promise I’m not a creep.  I will say, however, that I was so heartbroken after seeing the photo that I started dating and began something of a downwards spiral not long after that: I kissed a guy I knew from English without him being my boyfriend and started staying out late at a lot of dance clubs, sometimes even kissing strangers. 
April 2011:
- Decisions were rolling in and I ended up getting in several good schools; the company owner was definitely in the loop about everything.  After my first acceptance, I wrote B an email thanking him for helping me with the process and he didn’t respond.
- I kept spiralling out of control with the dance partying.  I ended up falling head over heels for a frat guy I made out with and dry humped at a party who basically broke my heart and left me after I told him I wouldn’t give him my virginity.  My grades fell.
June 2011:
- I didn’t get off the waitlist at Harvard but I got into several other good Ivies, including Brown, Penn, and Cornell.  Because I was dealing with heartbreak over the frat guy I kissed and struggling to stay motivated, I decided to not transfer out of my current school and to instead try to get into Harvard again the following year.  I figured that another year of extracurricular activities would boost my application and make me a better candidate.
- I told the company owner of my decision to stay at my current school, mentioning that I’d be back for personal statement and resume editing in December 2011.  My presumption is that the company owner relayed this to B. 
September 2011:
- I ended up deciding to transfer at the last minute to a school abroad. 
October 2011:
- I wrote to the company owner saying that I’d transferred after all and wouldn’t need more editing services until med school apps.  I asked for some advice about course selection and that was it.
November 2011:
- According to his Facebook profile that I lurked on, B had moved to Boston around this time.
- Weird coincidence 6: I saw him walking his dog around my new school’s campus.  I pretended like I didn’t know who he was but it was obvious by our eye contact that there were significant feelings.
March 2012:
- I’d signed up for a very public twitter account and tweeted the details of my 20th birthday information.  If B were following my account without actually following me, he’d have seen the bucket list and party details.  Anyway, after finishing dinner with some friends at a really nice restaurant, my best friend and I went to the ritziest nightclub in the city. 
- Weird coincidence 7: I saw him and a friend at the nightclub my friend and I were at.  I was dancing rather provocatively, had grown my hair from its previously short length, and looked quite pretty in a tight-fitting dress.  He stared at me from across the club for at least thirty something minutes with his lips slightly parted and his eyes focused mainly on my face.  I looked back at him and didn’t quite smile because I was hung up on another guy at the time and because B doesn’t really give me butterflies/paranoia like other guys do—it’s more of a calm, relaxing sort of thing with him.  Anyway, I loved his eyes on me and was quite tipsy, so I started lifting up my dress and dancing on a table like those popular girls you see on TV.  He seemed to like it, but he wasn’t really looking at my body too much—like, he looked at my legs quickly when I lifted up my dress but he seemed more focused on my face.   Sadly, despite the eye contact and my obvious indicators of interest, he didn’t approach me or talk to me, so my friend and I started dancing with other guys.
October 2012:
- Given that I didn’t want to go back abroad and that I didn’t want to go back to my first college, I had officially transferred to a different college that was a downgrade rankings-wise from other schools I’d gotten into but that made me happier than the other prospects I had.
- Weird coincidence 8: I saw him after a campus class day parade.  He looked at me with these adorable puppy dog eyes until I returned to look at him, and then he started looking down.

November 2012:
- Weird coincidence 9: The political campaign team he was working/interning/doing whatever on randomly decided to give free transportation to the college republicans from my school and a few neighbouring schools.  I also found a flyer for the event under my dorm room door, though nobody else on my hall received the flyer.  Upon going to the event in the VIP section for volunteers and workers, I saw B there looking amazing in this gorgeous suit and tie.  Unfortunately, I was nervous and didn’t know what the hell to do, so I first stared at him gap-mouthed and wide-eyed for a few seconds until he looked down and to his left before I essentially semi-lost my cool and power-walked away with my arms crossed. 

December 2012:
- Weird coincidence 10: On NYE, I was depressed after the guy I was in a long-distance, unofficial relationship with/sort of in love with wasn’t returning any of my requests to kiss over the phone and basically ignoring me; the idea of yet another NYE without a kiss was just heartbreaking.  So I left the orchestra gala filled with old people I was at and started looking desperately downtown for a party to go to so I could kiss a stranger.  While wandering across the street from where the cab driver dropped me off around 11:45 pm, I saw B outside of a posh bar in my collegetown looking out into space right before the ball was about to drop.  Immediately after seeing him, I tried to get into the bar he was at but couldn’t because I wasn’t of age (20 at the time) and couldn’t bribe the bouncer.  
January 2013
- Weird coincidence 11: After the ball had dropped, I returned back to the orchestra gala and decided to dance with the 30-something gay guy sitting at my table.  B somehow got into the event and watched me dance with this other guy for maybe twenty minutes, but when I stopped dancing B was gone.
February – July 2013:
- Weird coincidences 12 and beyond: I see him around and he smiles at me but he never approaches me.  Sometimes I get really nervous when he does this and I act cold and/or run away, other times I look at him wistfully and wish he’d just approach me, and still others I wonder if he doesn’t think I’m pretty enough to talk to.  
So, redditors, what do you guys think?  Does he like me?  How can I get him to approach me if he makes me so nervous and if I can’t think straight beyond looking into his eyes whenever we’re around each other?"

I have taken classes at Olympic College and UW. I have some work experience, but I do not have much in the tech field. I have worked on various open-source projects (mostly on github and bitbucket). Recently I have been using js to port a game to browsers using html5's canvas and websockets. Aside from this, I have worked on projects using C#, Java, C/C++, LAMP stack, and others. I am completely willing to learn a new technology as well.

1hlg5t,29,2013-07-03,You want NoFap benefits!?!?! HERE ARE YOUR MOTHERFUCKING NOFAP BENEFITS!!!!!!,Naival,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1hlg5t/you_want_nofap_benefits_here_are_your/,"It literally started the moment I left my apartment this morning for work.  I had a note on my door to see the landlord last night, and all night, I was worried that something was wrong with the lease, or that neighbors complained (especially the thought of them complaining about overhearing porn), etc.

Nope.  None of that.  The landlord was asked by a female tenant in the building about me, when she saw me paying the rent yesterday.  Am I interested, was why she wanted me to stop by the office.

It gets better.

I go to work, and am dreading it, because this new internship that I'm working at has a boss who is a real tightass.  Nothing is ever good enough for him, and he's always judging.  But that comes later.

In the meantime, the sexy temp receptionist--who made a point to introduce herself to me and shake my hand, all coy and shy and awkward, the other day--made an obvious attempt to get my attention, and from there, I couldn't pry myself out of her office, as she was latching onto a conversation with me that ended up going on for half an hour.  Several hours later, I heard her call me into her office, but I showed up there faster than she expected, and it was just in time to see her applying lip gloss for me, before offering to send my resumé to her headhunter.  She never wears lip gloss.  It was clearly for me.  I think she also fancied her hair up too.

At the same time, I'm playing text game with two women on my phone: one is a sexy older Asian chick who is a social worker at the home I'm working at, who I struck up a conversation with on the fly last week (while doing NoFap, which is the reason why I even bothered), and the other, X, is a girl I've fooled around with plenty of times, but has lately been on a holier-than-thou act.

In two hours, I had Asian Fantasy ask me for lunch on Friday, calling me a ""pretty young thing,"" and X followed up shortly with an acceptance of my offer to massage the soreness out of her legs and ass (she just took up a boot camp, and was complaining about the resulting soreness).

It gets better.

The meeting with the boss?  Nailed it.  I was so on top of shit, I kept surprising myself.  I've never--not in 20 years of school, not at any other job, etc--been that on top of my game and knowledgeable about what I was presenting, or funny in my presentation.  The boss that I work directly under, who knows me as the shy, timid, apologetic, and withdrawn person I was when I first began a few weeks ago, was taken back.

And that's what happens when you give NoFap a shot.  I will also mention--as I did in another positive post from a previous NoFap trial run--that every single man on this forum who is not working out must begin working out.  I am wholeheartedly convinced that half my confidence comes from the fact that I'm finally muscular enough that I'm happy with the way I look, and women like muscles.  There's no two ways about it.

Oh yeah: I also turned down plenty of oral sex, and probably some regular sex, last night, with a girl who I used to chase (and fooled around with on the last NoFap run), but am not really interested in anymore.  When I tried to politely excuse myself from the offer, she started up with her female bullshit, telling me that she has plenty of other opportunities, but NoFap made me aggressive, and I shot back at her that I did too (and I did), and the combination of assuredness and lack of care for missing out on sex snapped her ass right in line.  Right the fuck in line.

TL;DR - From moments after I left the house today, up until just minutes ago, having returned from work, I set up girl after girl after girl for future rendezvouses with (with sexual activity a guarantee with some, and very probable with others)--with some of them literally falling into my lap--and only good things happened work-wise and personal-wise (I didn't mention other things that really turned out well, from personal standpoints).

Thank you, NoFap.  As George Costanza once said: ""This is no longer a way of life for me; this is my religion."""

First some background information. I'm doing an internship in a big company. The internship went quite well and at the end of 3/5 months they already offered me a job for after around 36k/year (which is normal here in France for a junior). I'll be working as a C# developer (windows mobile 6.5) in the beginning (to finish the project im working on) and later on probably with every thing into the mobile world, android, windows 8, iOS etc. and SAP as well (Sybase Unwired Platform and other SAP modules).

I have another option which is offering me 38k/year, and they do mostly work in Finance, Bancs and also Media. I'll go there as a .NET developer (might do ASP.NEt and Javascript on client side probably, angularJS etc.).

The first one is a very big company (69 000 people)  and the second one 300 people. 

The first one respects emplyers less and the second one more.

I've heard from employers here that SAP pays really well (in less than 5 years of experience you go to 50k/year if you are good).

I wanted to know your idea on this, your suggestions, and what should i be lookin in the first job.

Background information: the payments are in euros :)

Thanks"

I've never asked the internet for advice before so I really don't know where to begin. I figured I would dive right in.

My boyfriend recently left for a 3 month internship on the other side of the country. While I feel happiness for him, I also feel resentful. I have become extremely passive aggressive and I don't know how to change. I am spending more than a thousand dollars just to see him for 2 days this Summer. I feel foolish for ordering nonrefundable tickets. I now have a constant complex that he is not doing enough for me. The time zone difference makes it difficult to even speak. I feel like he is not trying. I want to be supportive, I want to be understanding, I want to be mature but my own insecurities and narrow-mindedness hinders that. 

We've fallen into a cycle of constantly fighting. We will have one great day or two, then something he does will provoke me. When I am irrational, I spew horrible things out at him. Saying horrible things to him gives me satisfaction because I feel it closes a gap. He never fights back, nor does he ever become angry. I feel this just encourages my anger more and more.

Reddit. I feel like I am becoming a monster. When I am rational, I realize how horrible I being. Please teach me to become open-minded. Please help me accept reality and abandon my passive-aggressive ways. Please show me how to stop victimizing myself and be mature about this."

I was hoping to find something here on how to learn more about BI, and I found a few good posts, but I am hoping to get some more specific answers.

I currently intern at a large specialty automotive corporation, and we use DB2 for our data warehouse, Cognos for reporting, and for ETL we use Infosphere Datastage tool from IBM.

Does anyone have any resources/sites/books based on the knowledge above that would be beneficial for me? According to my mentor, we use dimensional modeling for the warehouse and while I have taken a databases class, we didn't really get into too much details on it due to time constraints.

I am especially looking for something that can really teach me Datastage as it seems that the teaching materials is somewhat lacking for Infosphere datastage tool.

Any help, advice or suggestions is greatly appreciated as I want to get the most out of my internship as possible."

I grew up Christian. I also grew up abused. My parents justified their treatment of me with the bible (ex: spare the rod, spoil the child), and truly believed that children should be seen and not heard.

I'm 21 now, but I never had a normal life growing up. And I still don't have one today.

I'm a junior in college, I've never traveled anywhere outside of my country. Never been to a real club before. Never been to concert. Never been on a date. Virgin, etc.

It's like I missed my adolescence or something. I just recently got diagnosed with an unknown (as of now) autoimmune disease, which leaves me bed ridden. So even if I *wanted* to do the things above, I certainly can't now.

Now, at this point, you're probably wondering why this is addressed to God.

It doesn't matter if God is there or not, but if he IS there, here is my question to him.

1. How could you let this happen?


When I was younger, I clung to the church. I was truly convinced that ""everything happened for a reason"" and if I just kept believing and doing my part, one day, I would have the life I wanted. One day, I would be *normal*.

Here is that one day, and I'm still a fucking freak. All my friends are meeting the loves of their lives, traveling all over the world, taking part in great internships, and I can't do any of that. I saved up money to travel this summer, and ended up having to use it all on medicine.

When the fuck is life going to smile on me? Haven't I suffered enough?

I know that people say happiness comes from within, and maybe it does, but most people I know base their happiness on good things happening to them. I'm tired of being so ""zen"". I want something good to actually happen to me. I don't want to have to pretend I like living my life anymore, because I don't. Most people who've said to me ""Decide to be happy, and good things will follow"" haven't had to suffer for years. When can I stop faking it, because I've yet to see good, concrete things follow. I don't want to change my perspective anymore, I want actual good things to happen.

Back to God. You knew my life was in the shitter growing up. Where was my saving grace, because it sure as hell wasn't you. Where was that one thing or one person that made it all worth it?

I am just so JEALOUS of everybody who can truly believe that ""everything happens for a reason"" or ""it gets better"" because in their experience that is true. It is not true in my experience.

I am tired of having to try so hard in the face of everything sucking. Now, that's not to say that I haven't had good weeks in my life, where I got good grades, or got a gift, or things just went generally well. 

But the fact is, that's about it. ""Life is good"" is not the motto. It's more like ""Life is okay, and a lot of the time it is hard.""

I just want to be normal and happy, and it seems like it's just not in the cards for me no matter how positive I am, nor how many actual concrete steps I take. Please note, regardless of my (former) belief in God, I never sat back and wished for things to happen to me. I worked for change in my life (hence me saving for months to go abroad over the summer, but then having to use the money on medicine). Still, shit goes wrong.

I know stuff goes wrong in everybody's life. But it seems like an awful lot goes wrong in mine, and it is not tempered by good stuff.

I've been told that my illness may be psychosomatic, and I guess that's very possible. But then, I'm really fucked, I guess, because my shitty ass life is apparently going nowhere.

1hkw24,12,2013-07-03,"Started QA internship, got bored quickly, got told to have a day off and check in the day after tomorrow",thatchaplin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1hkw24/started_qa_internship_got_bored_quickly_got_told/,"Hi Reddit,

The first three days of my internship leaves me puzzled. 

Formerly I was a lawyer, but I decided that I want a career switch and slightly more than a year ago, I started learning IT-related stuff (mainly coding). On Monday, I started a QA internship with the twist, that they expect me to continue working after doing a two month long internship. Just like any new employee, I am encouraged to order a PC to work on, paid by the company.

However, the wierd thing about my internship is that for the first three weeks of my internship, there are no testers in the office who could guide me. Some of them are on vacation and others are at clients' offices. And the programmers are too busy to make me feel included. The theme is, that there are no projects where they need a dedicated tester and they really don't seem to have time to bring me in projects for the sake of just letting me do something. 

I am told, that I should read about testing and the internal documents for the first three weeks. Well, before the internship started, I did read literature provided by the company and kind of got the idea, what testing is all about. Now, I just want to get my hands dirty.

So when today an administrative worker asked me, how was I doing, I told her, that I feel lonely and abandoned. She asks me what do I expect from third day at the office. I'm like... umm, if I were at home, I'd be coding hobby projects and this kind of internship is not fulfilling any of my personal goals. So we agree, that I go home and she discusses my issue with the programmers. I have not yet arrived at home, when the phone rings and I am told to show up on Friday.

Is my kind of grumpiness acceptable? Is the company's way of handling my internship acceptable? edit: ""reasonable"" seems to be a better word to use in either question.

tl;dr: Started internship with the promise of being hired by the company, found out, that for the first three weeks there is no one to guide me and nothing to do.

EDIT: Big thanks to all who responded. I enjoyed the discussion very much. On Friday, I will confidently walk into the office, see what they have me do, and just test like there was no tomorrow. "

1hkjla,9,2013-07-03,Brand recognition of internship,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1hkjla/brand_recognition_of_internship/,"I'm doing a Master's in computer science at a good public school in the US. I'm not American and I don't have any previous experience working in the software industry. My undergrad many years (8) ago was in Electrical Engineering. I'm currently doing a 6-month internship at a software consultancy. I'm working on Enterprise Java applications and Spring. At the end of the six months, I have the option to extend my internship for another (maximum) of 6 months (Internationals are not recommended to do more than 12 months of internships as it takes away from the amount of time we could potentially work here *after* graduation).

I'm currently debating whether to extend the internship for only *3* months and then try to get another internship with one of the big names (MS, Amazon, Google, VMWare), all of which recruit from my uni, for the 3 months of the Summer of 2014 (thereby hitting the limit of 12 months). This is slightly risky because there's no guarantee that I'll get into one of these big firms whereas the company I'm working at now has pretty much told me I can stay on for six months if I want to). So, I'm wondering how important the brand recognition of the internship company is. If it doesn't make too much of a difference, I'd rather stick with the known than risk the unknown. What do you guys think?

For anyone wondering why I'm doing a year of internships:

A. No past industry experience in software

B. The money's good

C. I'm doing online courses for my program at the same time.

I also have the option of doing a research-heavy independent study course with a professor in my uni in Summer 14 instead of doing an internship (I'm thinking data mining because I find it interesting and it has industry applications). I'm not sure I'm research material though and I sure as hell don't want to end up in academia."

Can someone help?",MikeNashFlash,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hk6tf/me23m_interested_in_19f_but_getting_mixed_signals/,"So, I met this girl at a dancing class in early May. The class goes to the pub afterward and we talked for a while, walked her home, it was all good. The next week we went for a walk along the waterfront (I live in a city with it's own docks), it was pretty romantic! So, she expressed interest in seeing me but we're both students and she didn't want to meet up until after her exams had finished, and she asked me how long I was staying in the city for after the exam period. Two weeks. Same as her, works out pretty well.


So we texted back and forth sporadically here and there, (there was also a time she phoned me just for a chat and we ended up talking for about 2 horus) and the end of exam period rolls around and she texts me pretty much immediately after her last exam asking me if I want to go out, but I can't because I still have exams. I ask her if she wants to go out Saturday but she says she can't. Sunday? She can't. Monday? She's not sure. This had gone on for a couple of days so I eventually thought, fuck it, I'll just phone her. So, I phoned her to organise solid plans and she sort of reluctantly agreed to go out on monday night with me.


The date on monday night went fantastic, we played pool and joked around with each other, then went for a drink. At one point in the night she says she wants to play a game. I say ""sure, what kind of game?"". She says chess, and she suggests going back to her place to ""play chess"". Sure thing. On the walk back though I think she got cold feet and she decided she wasn't ok with it so I hugged her and left.


Then, I was trying to organise plans with her and it was ridiculously difficult! In the end I managed to get her to agree to seeing me on the next Tuesday (8 days after the last date), and I would come round and make her pizza and cookies (I used to work at a pizzeria and on our last date she said I should make her some at some point).


So, I get to her house and she's wearing a really sexy dress. She wants to impress me. We make the pizza, it's really tasty and eventually she gets tired and wants to go to bed, she invites me in, long story short, things got sexual but she didn't want to take it very far since she's a virgin. We fall asleep with my arms around her. In the morning thigns get sexual again, and then we get up, have a lazy day watching youtube videos, listening to music, making the cookies we didn't make last night. We go out for dinner together, and she's having a really good time. We get back to her place, I ask her if she's free before Sunday (when I leave) and she says no, she'll be too busy seeing friends and reading books (I'm thinking ""you'd rather read a book than see me....?""). I ask if she would be interested in coming and visiting me for a couple of days while I'm doing an internship in another part of the country (about 3 hrs away) since I'll have my own place. She expresses interest but she's not sure what she'll say to her parents.


So, that's pretty much it. When we meet we have a really good time and all but she seems reluctant to meet for some reason. I want her to come visit me because I know we would both have a really awesome time, and it would be a lot of fun, but I predict that if I text her asking her to come visit, she'll pull some crap on me like ""aaah I'm too busy seeing friends"" even though I know she's not doing anything important for the next month.


Now, the reason I *think* she's behaving this way is because she recently came out of a 10 month relationship and I don't think she's quite over her ex. This doesn't bother me, since I'm not looking for anything serious, but I think she is reluctant to meet with me because she still has feelings for him, even though she has a lot of fun when she sees me. 


What do you guys think I should do? Any advice as to how to approach asking her to visit me? Should I bring up the fact I think she's not over her ex? 


------------------------------


tl;dr: Interested in a girl who has a lot of fun when she's with me, but she might be hung up on her ex. Looking for advice as to how to go about arranging plans with her.

I have come a long way. I'm going to school to be a chef. I never knew what I wanted to be before I found my place in the kitchen, and now I can't imagine myself anywhere else. I had one kitchen in mind that I really wanted to work at more than anywhere else and I worked hard to achieve my dream. I secured an internship there and it started about a week ago. I'm so excited to have a chance to prove myself. We even had a meeting this morning and the chef liked my idea for a new course. Well, I had been up since 4 a.m. worrying about the meeting. So by 7 pm tonight I was all ready very tired and my shift was no where near over. (This is an unpaid internship too, at a fine dining restaurant.) There is a friendly dishwasher there who always cheers me up. I don't really speak much spanish and he doesn't speak english but we would joke and laugh and he would always get me to smile. Well, today was a slow day so I was up in the upstairs running the expediting system on the computer and everyone else was in the kitchen downstairs and in the dining room downstairs. The dishwasher came up and started grabbing me and kissing my neck. I feel really uncomfortable when he gets touchy like that and I just nervously laughed it off to the best of my ability. But then he decided to grab my ass and tits. I told him to back off and he did, but now I feel really uncomfortable around him. Well yeah, for fucks sake I know this is a tough field. And I get that its not a fair balance of men and women in the culinary world. But this is so shitty and it makes me mad that for all my hard work I just have to accept getting molested. I have been raped on a previous occasion by a boy in my lithography class, who i had gone out of my way to try to help, which made me go from an A+ award winning student artist to a drop out. I feel like no matter where I go there is this shape shifting monster following me. No matter what I do to make myself unattractive, getting fat, saying I only am interested in women, men just want to rape and molest me. I feel really alone and if I talk to my family about it or my job about it they probably will just think I am seeking attention. I'm not going to let sexual fucking abuse take another one of my dreams from me and kill it before I can realize it. I want to work in this kitchen. I am going to work in this kitchen. If every day I have to kick this dude off of me then I will because I am stronger than that. But it hurts. It hurts so much and I feel so alone."

I am attending a 4 year University and I am an English major. I am financially bound by my parents but it's a very sticky situation. My parents are highly sensitive to me trying to be independent which caused me to be kicked out for a week at the beginning of the summer with no money. My point is that they are very extreme in their discipline which is why I need help.
I do not have my license and I have been trying to get it. I have not taken the test yet because my mom wants to buy me this $100 program that shows you the route to the test and then sends me off to the test. However she keeps saying she doesn't have the money and ignores me when I say that the $100 program is not necessary. 
This summer I have found it useless to apply to internships because my parents find it inconvenient for them to take me to the locations of these internships. (No matter where they are it is inconvenient)
I have been spending my summer in my room trying to fill out scholarships but I just can't take it anymore. I have told them that I want to get a job and my mother says no and to appreciate being with the family. Note that they are at work the entire week. I can't stand it anymore I just can't. I calmly tried to explain my dilemma to my mother today and she ended up yelling at me so I walked away. 
Once again, I am an English major and knowing that it's difficult to get a decent job out of college without experience causes me to fear that I am going to have to move back in with my parents. I feel like I'm in a trap and it's hard for me to see any open doors right now. I would like to move out but I do not want to cause anymore family problems.

1hjdvj,2,2013-07-02,Help with classroom management!,[deleted],Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1hjdvj/help_with_classroom_management/,"Hi everyone. I sought out this subreddit to get some advice for a teaching job that I have this summer. I'm 18 years old, an art student in college, I am teaching art class for 3rd through 6th graders at an academic summer camp. I'm relatively new to teaching -- most of my experience comes from an internship with a young childrens' Art Camp last summer, but the experience doesn't translate well as the circumstances are very different.

It's especially difficult for my situation because I'm teaching 6 different classes in one day, and for only 25 minutes at a time. Art class is more of a break for the teachers than anything else. I can't really ask for the students to bring any special materials and mostly have to stick to pencil, paper, and whatever they may have on hand. It's hard for me to remember everyone's names or really get to know them, and I also don't have much I can use as consequences like sitting in quiet, taking away time to draw, etc as I have limited time already. I can try to plan some more open-ended projects so the students can tailor it to their own interests, but some of them seem to only be interested in drawing guns and violence... For more academic lessons, like figure drawing, I try to make it fun by making it a group-based class, and having students model their own poses for each other, but I'm not sure how interesting the material actually is to them.

I think my biggest issue is having enough presence to have everyone in a given class be willing to quiet down and listen to me -- I'm finding myself having to constantly shout for everyone's attention and getting certain students to be quiet. Clapping sequences sometimes work with the younger students but not the older ones. I'm thinking part of it might be that I'm a much younger teacher than they're used to and am more like a sibling than an adult relative to their ages. And there are also certain students, mostly in the younger classes, that constantly try to test my patience, talking back, avoiding the lesson, and being generally uncooperative.

Besides the generally rambunctious younger kids and the generally mean and eager-to-bully older kids, some problem students that stand out are:

* A group of three 4th grade boys intent on putting no or very little effort into learning the materials I teach, drawing inappropriate things like guns or fat classmates, questioning my instructions, saying ""no"" when I ask them to do things. There isn't much I can threaten them with besides making them sit away from their friends, or perhaps giving them a ""time out"" in a corner by themselves (but there isn't really anything stopping them from joining back in if I am busy with another student).
* A 5th grader who is very vocal about his dissatisfaction with having to have art class, groaning aloud and trying to make inappropriate jokes when I try to give lessons. I might have to talk with him one on one in the hallway if he keeps this up.
* Very excitable 6th grade boys who just love being obnoxious, though aren't directly disrespectful to me. A 6th grade girl in the same class who is intent on insulting as many boys as she can.

I would appreciate any advice on what to do and strategies I can take to efficiently quiet a class down, without losing my voice. I'm thinking I might pick random days to bring candy or some sort of treat to class (fruit snacks?) to give to the well-behaved children unannounced at the end of class, and just tell the troublemakers too bad. I don't want to antagonize anyone but I also don't want to stand to be bullied and pushed around by my students. Thanks in advance!

*Edit to add that I have been teaching for about a week so far. This session of camp lasts for another 3 weeks, then another session starts for a full 4 weeks."

Second try at this subreddit so here we go:

Lately I have been thinking of working abroad. I'm aiming at countries where english is the main language or one of the most common, since this is the second language I know most (first being brazilian portuguese). I can handle myself in English interactions, but I'm not nearly as good as it is desirable (as you'll see in some errors you'll find in this text), although I think I could improve very fast if it was needed of me to speak it every day. Also I wouldn't mind learning a new language. I don't have any other citizenship than brazilian, so I guess this limits my options.

I am a 22yo(turn 23 this year) male and in the end of this year or half of the next year I'll be graduating as a bachelor in Computer Science. I'll graduate with an average score of 9.1 of 10 (not that impressive, specially because my university isn't one of the prestigious ones that are recognized all over the world) assuming I don't screw up in the few remaining disciplines.

I study programming since I was 16, I took a technical course having 1.5 years of duration and at the same time I was going to highschool. I don't consider myself a very good programmer yet, but I really try hard to improve myself.

Currently I'm working as a web developer in a small company. Working with PHP,HTML, CSS, Jquery, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL and Zend Framework. To be honest this is my first full-time job (I have been there for almost two and a half years), I did some internships before this one, but as you can see I'm not very experienced.

I'm looking at countries that have a high human development index where you can lead a pretty decent life in general and have better opportunities. I work with IT so it has to have a good job market in that field. 

I'd like to go to any of the following: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, USA and also considering somewhere in the Europe.
But I really don't know much about how hard it is for foreigners to find work in these countries and if it is possible to find some job, preferably in my area of work. I have some money saved up, around 11k USD, but I think that wouldn't last much so I'd need to find a job a short time after arriving.
I expect to study more in the target country to better qualify myself. Looking for permanent stay in the long run.

I have no criminal convictions, not even a speeding ticket.

I come here to ask you if it's possible to keep this idea in mind and try to turn it into reality or if I'm not wasting my time overthinking about this. 
Also I'd like to know which skills and knowledge do you think I should develop and hone if I want to go work abroad in those countries I mentioned before. You can also suggest other countries where you think a person with my profile would fit.
Any advices, suggestions and information on the subject are welcome.

1hnv3o,0,2013-07-04,I'm having second thoughts about mechanical/automotive engineering. Looking for real advice on how to proceed with my life.,[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1hnv3o/im_having_second_thoughts_about/,"Firstly I want to start out by saying a lot of what I am going to say may be unfair stereotypes but that's why I'm here in the first place. 

I just did one year at a community college with mechanical engineering as my major. I was sure I wanted to do it when I started a year ago but I'm turning 19 later this month and feel like I've matured a whole lot in this last year. I'm also starting to get doubts about whether I want to be sitting at a desk for the rest of my professional life. 

So my first year started off successful with almost straight A's but it had a lot of gen eds. My second semester I failed my calculus 1 class and that has strongly discouraged me. I am going to retake it and should get a B if not an A because I understood all the major concepts but the little rules and exceptions to the concepts threw me off. So I want to know how important calculus and high level mathematics in general is. I also took a drafting class which I greatly enjoyed especially working with autocad. But I don't want to be making autocad models of Camry transmission casings for the next 40 years. I say that because I am very passionate about cars and would want to go into automotive engineering. I have moderate experience working on cars and know how most everything works. And I'm am just astonished by the amount of engineering put into great hyper cars by Pagani or Koenigsegg. So how hard would it be to secure a job like that here in the us or an English speaking job in Europe? Or maybe how hard would it be to pair up with a successful racing team? Because an applied desk job like that I wouldn't have much of a problem with. 

Also I was thinking of maybe doing the same thing with software or computer engineering if there are more opportunities in that field seeing as how that won't ever see a decline in jobs if everyone switches to hybrid/ electric cars or some other alternative fuel. 

I don't know I'm glad I decided to go to community college and save some money instead of thinking about changing majors at a 40k school or such. I want to transfer after another year at cc though and maybe go to Detroit where there would be internship opportunities but a good school here in California (to avoid out of state costs) would also be ok if there are good internship opportunities. What would a mechanical/automotive engineer recommend? I am going to talk to my counselor soon and see what they have to say but they don't know experience in the field like some of you guys do. 

I'm sure even though this is long I'm missing a lot of information so feel free to ask me. I just want to see how many engineers actually found an interesting job that they love going to everyday.

1hnuu4,14,2013-07-04,Open thread for those who want this to grow into something really large.,EvilFriends89,restorethefourth,https://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1hnuu4/open_thread_for_those_who_want_this_to_grow_into/,"Hello everyone.  I was at the Philadelphia Restore the Fourth rally and had a good time.  I was extremely surprised by the amount ""first timers"" who attended the rally.  It is extremely encouraging, and IMO it reminds me of the beginning of Occupy with amount fresh blood getting involved politically.  

Let me explain a quick background before I want to open up for a friendly debate.  In Pennsylvania, I was an intern in Harrisburg working on public education issues and I'm involved with fracktivism and Occupy.  I see that each of those areas deserve to have their own tactics and strategies to achieve their goals.   So here are some questions for debate:

1) With the impacts surveillance has on activists across broad political spectrums and causes, should we become an apolitical that accepts people from the far left to the far right?  

2) If groups or interests like Freedomworks or MoveOn.Org or the Kochs or Geroge Soros tried to insert themselves into something like this how should we respond?  

3) How should we hold protest actions?  Do we want to stand on sidewalks and hold demonstrations?  Do we want to become an advocacy group?  Do we want to wreak havoc against our legislators at Town Hall meetings?  Do we want to try more radical non-violent civil disobedience actions that would shut down federal buildings or stores of companies who have participated in these spying programs?

Those are my three questions, and as someone who has been involved in progressive activism and grassroots organizing for the past 5 years those are some concerns.  They're concerns because we have a golden opportunity to funnel a lot of energy at something tangible and it's going to take an extremely diverse group of people to actually do something.  And speaking from experience with organizing an ""occupy"" group on the most minute level, we've always had MoveOn members and other groups trying to co-opt the group.  

I'm not trying to pit liberals vs conservatives or progressives against libertarians because with a total surveillance state, the activism we conduct won't matter. 

Thank You and debate on!"
1hnqz2,2,2013-07-04,Need advice for workout routines,piliyestela,bodyweightfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1hnqz2/need_advice_for_workout_routines/,"Hi guys. I am a 21 years old man, 5'5 and 132 lbs (not sure about these because I am not really acquainted with US units so I converted them from Internet.But for the one units I use everyday, it would be like 164 cm, 60 kg)
 I once already was working out at a gym but it was during my exchange year and as I had to leave the country, I couldn't carry on. I already have had routines for specific days of the week determined by a coach for 4-5 months. 

But right now it is difficult to go to a gym and I can't find any at the current place I'm living in. So I have bought some accessories, not expensive ones but some I think might help me attain my goal . The main purpose for me working out is to be more or less ""thin but defined"".To explain this, i would like not to be too skinny nor to gain too much muscles. I would like for example have six-packs but not too developed pecs (which I know I wouldn't develop that much anyways due to the fact I don't own that many accessories and don't intend to weight-lift).My case is not really specific but as reading the FAQ, I couldn't really answer all my questions so I decided to post them here.

The thing is that I am not overweight. If I wear casual clothes, nothing sticks out. But I think I arrived at the point I still have the last persistent small amount of fat on the belly, on pecs and under the neck which are the spots where I lose fat last. I wanted to have advices on how to efficiently organize my workouts so I don't only waste my efforts without any change at the end.

PART 1: ACCESSORIES AND AVAILABLE TIME

I have in my apartment:

*Elliptical trainer

*Ab-Roller

*Abs Bench

*Pull-Up Bar

I also have a bike I use everyday to go to my internship which I am having everyday between 9:00-12:30 a.m and 2:00-05:30 p.m from monday to friday. So I take 10 mn for the one way trip and the same for the way back. As I do this twice a day, I am basically 40 mn on my bike daily and I am trying to apply constant effort all way through (even if I know it is a discontinued effort and might not mean a lot).

I just began to use the elliptical trainer the beginning of this week to getting used before really having the advices of people who are involved in working out. So on the monitor of the elliptical (not sure if informations are reliable), it is written that in 15mn which is the time I decided just for the moment, I lose on it 350 calories and ""run"" 3.4 miles (5,5 km). 

So I would like to know if I would have to increase the amount of time I spend on the elliptical daily and how often should I use it combined with the fact I use my bike as transportation mean (maybe not relevant).

According to the accessories i own, I would like to take advice from you guys about types of exercises I might have to perform and a general routine I might follow. And one of the things bothering me is that the elliptical trainer is really loud, while the dividing walls and the floor are really thin so I'm wondering if I might be bothering the neighbors in the building. So if you guys would advise me to do some exercises in the morning, these would have to be exercises I might be doing quietly (e.g. Push-Ups,...).

PART 2: DIET

*Usually in my fridge, I have yogurts with sliced fruits inside (or not) and also all different kind of dessert creams (coconut, chocolate, caramel,...). I take one at the end of each meal I have at home.

*I decided to drink only water some 4-5 months ago even if I still can drink soft drinks from time to time and usually buy fruit juices at the supermarket maybe once every two weeks.

*I usually feel nauseous for the rest of the morning when having breakfast, so the only type of breakfast I can bear is a cup of cold milk with cereals, accompanied by little breads with fried eggs inside and Tabasco on the top (kind of fancy I know), so that's why I don't usually take breakfast but I can make efforts on this one

*Most of the time I eat rice accompanied by some kind of meat (pork, chicken,... etc.,but not really fond of beef) or fish with tomatoes and onions Sometimes I pour caramel, honey on it but not that often.I can also add beans or even mushrooms.

*I eat merguez or chipolatas at least once a week with tomatoes and onions, always with rice.

*I also eat Fajitas let's say once every two weeks.

*Tried to begin to eat salads with only mozarella

*I really like sushis and even learned to make them at home so when I feel like it I prepare some for me

*I also eat sausages with beans (red or white + rice)

*I rarely prepare some dishes like coconut chicken or sweet and sour meals because of the work involved but I enjoy having them from time to time.

*I pour Tabasco on almost all my meals except on those I flag as incompatible with (which is unusual)

I know my diet is a complete mess but I know that if I work on it I can get it straight. So I would like to ask your advices on the frequency I might be allowed to consume each of the mentioned meals and which I should stop eating or avoid as possible to not waste my efforts. If you could also advise me some meals I might add to my diet in order to achieve what I intend to do.

I also would like to know the intervals i might have to respect between workouts and meals.

I think I gave a lot of information and maybe a lot of irrelevant ones but if any of you could give some advices, any help is much appreciated.

Thanks in advance."
1hnq9x,64,2013-07-04,"I have many acquaintances, but I am a fringe member of all of the social circles in my life. Worse, I am unsure of my interests, and I don't particularly care.",shaymin492,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1hnq9x/i_have_many_acquaintances_but_i_am_a_fringe/,"I am in my mid-twenties and I have been living at home in the suburbs of a large city since graduation. I have been working at a very diverse scientific institution in said large city (~2,000 employees and many volunteers) for just over three years now (I've worked my way up from an intern in one department to a part-time employee in a different department).  
  
Anyway, I have many acquaintances, not only from work, but also from those who have gravitated to this city from my old high school and college. I even have some 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cousins nearby.  
  
I often see my social circles from work at work-hosted events and I socialize with them and catch up with them and maybe even go out to bars with them afterwards. There are a handful of people from school/family/work that I have one-on-one coffee or lunch with every couple of months to catch up. I will, once a year or so, get invited to bachelor parties or weddings and meet the extended networks of these friends (some living far away, some relatively close by).  
  
At all of these events, I feel that I am very sociable. I constantly get compliments on the way that I dress. Some people are very impressed with how many people I say hello to at the bigger events (""You know so many people; how popular you must be!""). A girl that I had met who was associated with a bachelor party that I was at recently was shocked, *shocked*, to hear that I was single (I chose not to mention that I haven't been on a date in 4 years). I take the time to chat with as many people around me as I can at these events, and there is definitely a mutual enjoyment of company.  
  
Something is missing, though. I don't have any co-workers to eat lunch with or whose office I am compelled to drop by on a regular basis to see what's going on (or vice versa). I don't have anyone to call on the weekends to suggest we go out and do any of the countless activities in our city. I don't feel like I fill in any appreciable social role in any of the circles that I interact with.  
  
I *think* the reason is that I don't know what areas of knowledge or culture I am passionate about, or what hobbies I want to do on a regular basis. I *say* I like certain things. Take hiking for example. I always *say* that I'm interested in taking a walk up a mountain or exploring a national park, but I haven't actually done that in a long time, and no one has invited me out to do so. I don't particularly care, though; do I actually enjoy it, then? Same with photography (which I *say* I love pairing with hiking). Well, aside from Instagram snapshots from my daily life (which garner plenty of likes and comments from everyone), I haven't done much of that, either. Maybe I just like the *idea* of these things. Nonetheless, the role of these and other hobbies play in my life hasn't been much more than me talking to people about how I enjoy and want to do these things. My lack of interest is, I think, causing me to [secretly want nothing to do with culture at all](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ2w6L4YHnI&amp;t=132)! I think everyone who sees me as some sort of social mastermind would be surprised to hear that, though.  
  
I was compelled to write this after failing to suss out any group to hang out with for the 4th of July. I've been sitting at home in the suburbs all day listening to music, and watching tennis and baseball (and the hot-dog eating contest, of course). I will undoubtedly play down the fact that I didn't leave the house with my acquaintances, of course (like on Saturday, when I will be having coffee and catching up with someone who I haven't seen since January).  
  
I don't think there was a question there. What should I do in order to gain interests and/or form closer friendships like I see among my peers at work/in life?  
  
Happy 4th, everyone!"
1hnbgo,0,2013-07-04,[22m] Thoughts of giving my ex of 3.5 years a second chance?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hnbgo/22m_thoughts_of_giving_my_ex_of_35_years_a_second/,"Going to try to keep this short.

I was three and a half years into a relationship with a beautiful girl who I got along with better than anybody I have ever met in my life. She was my everything, and I meant the world to her. People always said we were Lily and Marshall.

I was busy with school, work and had gotten arrested for something that has the possibility that I will do a little jail time depending on what happens in court (but probably wont). It was a non-violent crime, something similar to a 'guilty by association thing'. Anyways, I was working really, really hard to get a good internship and good grades in school so that I would be able to pay for the lawyer fees etc and it would never be a struggle for us. I completely overworked myself, and I became way too busy and had no time with her. We lived together and I would routinely tell her to go away because I was busy -- always doing homework or at work or studying, or just needing time to do nothing alone.

She took this as that I was not attracted to her anymore and fell out of love with her, and got huge self esteem problems. She became bulimic and started drinking heavily. On a trip to another city with a friend, she ended up completely drunk and topless in another guys bed and made out with him, but then 'realized what was happening' and left and called me and told me right then and there. I didn't speak to her for the rest of her trip there, but once she got back, I could see how hurt she was and that she really didn't mean any harm, so I tried to work through it with her. Anyways, she kept talking to that guy from the other state, so I told her to get out, because that's not alright. She said it was because she was so amazed that somebody could find her attractive and she did it for that reason, because I wasn't giving it to her.

We broke up and she moved out, but insisted that her end game was that we would end up back together once she got her confidence back. I hated every second of that, but I broke up with her, so what could I do? She dated other guys and slept with one many times (pretty much moving in with him) while we were broken up, and so I finally decided to start dating too. I met a girl who is very beautiful and we get along well, and she's been my girlfriend about two months. 

The past month or so, my ex has been trying to get me back, but I completely resisted because I knew that she hurt me a lot by betraying me and sleeping with another guy even when we were broken up. That being said, she means the world to me, and if things could possibly work out with her, I would choose her over anybody else I have ever met or thought about meeting. She's apparently stopped drinking and she is eating healthy and keeping it down again. It seems her confidence issues are fixed and she really did just want to go try to work on that...but who knows?

The problem is that now I have a girlfriend. If I didn't have one, I would have no issue saying ""We both want this, why not at least give it a try"". But I do care about the new girlfriend, but I'm not sure if she is long term material...I have fun with her, but I am already beginning to find myself fantasizing about running away with my ex.

Does my ex deserve another shot? Would I be an idiot for going back to her? "

Sitting here on the damn computer, slouching like a fucking idiot, doing nothing. Chapped, unattractive lips, but you're too lazy to get up and get the chapstick. Your parents are great people, but you feel they wouldn't understand the depression that plagues your mind. Cheer up, they say, when they see sadness in your eyes. That's all they really know about you, cause you're normally a happy guy. You gotta do well in college and have a great life, but you signed up for one online college course this summer because you're a dumbass who didn't get an internship like the majority of your friends. You're fucked up. You're a third child who would have made your parents so much better financially off if you didn't exist. Now because of your laziness (which they are commenting on) they're gonna have a hard time retiring. You go to the gym but you haven't seen any sign of improvement cause you're crap. Go do something. Better yet, just stop existing.

That's the inside of my mind when I'm depressed. And I've been having depression episodes more frequently than I used to. I don't think about suicide, but just the thought of...not existing. I don't know what to do.

I don't think it's as bad as needing medication, because it's not something that's consistent. I'm a genuinely a friendly guy a big portion of the time. I'm mentally unwell.

I just needed to finally get this off my chest."
1hmktj,1,2013-07-04,35 w/o career - push through anyways or start over?,jata1978,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hmktj/35_wo_career_push_through_anyways_or_start_over/,"(ok, this is gonna be complicated, since there probably are no ""good"" solutions, just less bad ones... )

i'm in my mid-30s, have finished a masters degree in communications 7 years ago, and got stuck while trying to get a phd. 7 years ago, i got offers from IBM and top companies (had some great internships during my studies). Since then, i've worked part-time for a pr agency/in marketing to finance my phd, but there have been no great achievements to sell to prospective employers in those years. The phd was a great miscalculation on my part, i got lost in a million interesting theoretical detours, and am still as far away from finishing as i was in the beginning. Before someone feels compelled to add it, i know how that looks to possible employers (in general, i've sobered up about my prospects in the last months. So please, give me tough talk if you feel like it, but I've probably said the same to myself quite a few times). 

So there are two options: The first one is, quit the phd (and try finishing it on the weekends) and start the career that should've begun 7 years ago. The thing is, where i live anyone can apply for a pr job (regardless of what they studied), so the salaries ain't great, the competition is insane, and there way to few real advancement opportunities (cause there are so many people in the pipeline). Realistically, i feel like I've got a talent for PR, but it's not like i'm Neo. 

And option 2: I've recently started to learn coding, and it comes to me pretty easily (logical/abstract thinking was never really hard for me). So, since I didn't get anywhere with my first career, i wonder whether i should just scrap it and start again, study computer science and focus all my energy on learning to code, thus acquiring skills that aren't as ubiquitous as PR skills. I'd be 40 when i'd finish my studies, so i don't expect to get crazy rich (like i said, i'm pretty down to earth about my prospects). I'd be studying with people half my age, working for people ten years younger... would be pretty humbling. I've never coded before, because i never thought about it - there was always something else to do, and i seriously overestimated the difficulty (now that i've taken the first steps, i'd say there are parts that are crazy difficult, but others that are just like math, difficult but manageable). 

So let's say i'm equally talented at PR and Coding. Do i continue down the path i'm on, just cause i got a degree, even if the career doesn't look so good? Or do i start over without having started at my first one, in a career that looks more promising? I'm not adverse to working my ass off, i just don't like to waste more of my time - which i kinda feel like i would if i got a entry-level job at some PR agency - just getting to a point where i can shine (and then advance to better positions) would take 2-3 years, with meagre pay. And since i've coded, i know that it can be tedious, but if my next years and decades are gonna be filled with tedious, humbling and hard work, I somehow feel like i should choose the career that pays better, offers better advancement opportunities and less competition. It's not about passion, i've found i'm passionate about both for different reasons.

1hmclc,27,2013-07-04,"I think my Mormon next-door neighbors might be attempting to convert me to Mormonism (or... something) while my parents are gone...? Is this realistic, or is this behavior they don't realize looks really suspicious from an outsider's perspective?",rand_throwaway_acc,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1hmclc/i_think_my_mormon_nextdoor_neighbors_might_be/,"(TLDR at bottom)

So my family is gone for a week due to unforeseeable schedule conflicts, while I stay at home alone for my HS summer internship.  My neighbors have always been ridiculously nice, wonderful people, (as seems to be the pattern with Mormons I've seen so far) even if a little... kooky, I guess you could say.

Before this week, they knew about it (the internship) in advance, (we're pretty close, actually) and they kindly offered to have me over to celebrate with them on the 4th of July.

However, on the 2nd, (yesterday in my timezone) they invited me over for dinner by surprise.  There wasn't really any notice, they simply said hello and invited me over to dinner.  And I was happy to accept, because really, they're a great bunch of people. (and they always have great food, too!)

I have to admit, I was definitely caught by surprise a second time when I saw three Mormon missionaries standing in the dining room to greet me.  I will also admit I'm terribly ignorant about Mormonism compared to someone who practices it, and alarm bells went off in my head immediately.

They were, of course, very nice people, just like my neighbors, and we had some interesting discussions.  I maintained a genial attitude, and didn't bring up the unusualness of missionaries randomly happening to be in their house when I came over. (they didn't really comment about it either, honestly) Later in the dinner, however, the talk got significantly religious.

They [read out of the Book of Mormon](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/24.17?lang=eng#16), and we had a lengthy discussion about what it meant and how significant it was, along with a few other things.  Later they mentioned the ""second coming"" in passing with a nod, like it was this logical thing that was going to happen in their lifetimes.  The conversation through about 1/2 the dinner, I would say, was Mormonism-related.  I remember at least one of them talking about how Mormonism ""saved"" them and turned their life around, or something like that, and talking about how amazingly glad he was that he converted to Mormonism.

Naturally, I evaluated the situation and balanced my (paranoid) suspicions with rational thinking.  I really, really didn't want to offend my neighbors.  They're really great people, honestly.  But at the same time, what was happening was *really weird*.  I don't think the missionaries knew my neighbors extremely well, and maybe not each other extremely well either, from the way they were talking.  Anyway, in the end, everything seemed to turn out normal, but the missionaries seemed to imply they were coming back on the 4th to celebrate, and possibly more.

Of course, the 4th just *happens* to be the day I'm coming over to celebrate with my neighbors.

Now honestly, what I expect to hear from this thread is I'm just being really paranoid, but am I?  I'm honestly just a little worried about this.  I'll be quick to admit I don't really understand Mormon culture well at all either, so I have no idea if this happens or not.  I suspected I'd probably sound like an idiot, so I made this throwaway account.

Anyway, my question is, am I just being crazy?  Is this normal?  My most-likely-scenario is they don't really realize the possible implications, or... something.  I don't know.  They wouldn't be really doing this, right?


**TL;DR:**  Surprise dinner from my Mormon neighbors while I'm home alone with missionaries in uniform+badge talking to me deeply about religion and setting up future dates to meet my neighbors where I'm coincidentally there as well, explain to me if this is something, please?  Am I being an idiot?

EDIT: They just invited me over to dinner, I'll be leaving in about 5 minutes just as last time.  Wish me luck, friends.  Sun hasn't even set yet... I might be there for a while.

EDIT 2:  Oh wow!  The missionaries weren't there, and conversation was decidedly non-religious.  So it WAS just coincidental behavior.  I'm glad to be proven wrong.  I'll probably be over for fireworks later, though.  My theory is the missionaries might have been the ones instigating the religion stuff in the conversation earlier, (and may have even been the ones who invited me over) and my neighbors simply went with it.  Anyway, if any funny business happens, I'll let you guys know.  Thanks!

EDIT 3:  I heard fireworks at my neighbors' house, so I decided to go outside and watch for a minute or two.  I heard many voices in the backyard, but I could have sworn I heard the laugh of one of the missionaries.  Needless to say, in my mind I went ""abort, abort"" and decided to go running for a while instead of sticking around to find out (and/or receive a visit from them)."
1hm6u7,5,2013-07-04,"Finishing my internship and the Company want me, how do I negotiate salary without them walking away from the deal? (just finished school and have zero experience in job interview)",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1hm6u7/finishing_my_internship_and_the_company_want_me/,"So here is the story, I'm an intern in this firm (kinda of big and renowed firm), my internship end soon and the HR manager + one the firm bosses told they want me to stay and work for them after my internship.

I'd very much like to work in there because they have lot of interesting project and is well renowed (can serve later in the CV), the only problem is they don't pay much (I know this from my co-worker who I became friend with and know what they pay everybody for their first contract).

So I'd like to try and discuss the possibility to have a better salary but I fear they will back away if I do that... and the problem is that the boss who want me is not the one I will be negotiating with, actually the boss that discuss the contract is kinda of hard negotiator (lot of experience in keeping the company expenses low) and this is making me nervous.

My interview is happening soon and I made a list of stuff that can play for me and against me :

Positive stuff that I can use as an argument:

-They are the one who told me they want me to stay (it's rare here, most people ask to stay and most of them are refused)

-I worked on a lot of the on-going project so I'm already able to start reworking on them as soon as a new phase start.

-I know how to use a lot more of software than my co-worker and have showed that during my internship, (I also learned everything by myself and always want to learn more, maybe I should tell them that?).

-The company is switching to a new software as a base for work and they are paying formation for their employees, I on the other hand know how to use this software already so they don't have to form me (The problem is that I didn't work with this software during the internship so they can doubt about my competence with this software)

-I can communicate in 5 languages (it can be usefull in our job but not that much)


Negative stuff that can play against me :

-Apart from internship I don't have professional experience (I'm young and just finishing school).

-There is a lot of unemployed people looking for job in our industry.

-A lot of people want a chance to work for our firm and accept any type of contract and the bosses know that and know that the employees knows that (so if you don't like something there is always people ready to replace you).

-I'm a foreigner so the administrative procedure is a lot heavier, (this is how I know they really want me for now but can discourge them if I ask for too much).



Anyway sorry for the wall of text and my english, if you guys can offer me some advice I'll be really grateful, I will post an update to tell you how it went."

I have had two internships in accounting, one at a medium sized regional firm doing auditing, and another at a private government company. I hated both of these internships. I felt like the auditing internship was extremely boring, and all I did was copy work papers and did things that made absolutely no sense to me. With my private internship I worked as an auditor of cost reports and this was terribly boring as well.

I will be graduating in December with my degree and will be like 5 classes short of being able to sit for the CPA. I am trying to decide if I should stick with the CPA route and get my Masters in Accounting or perhaps go for another Masters degree. A school close to me offers a Masters degree in Computer Forensics and Security Management and another offers a Masters in Enterprise Consulting (MIS based) and both of these seem like something interesting. I am really leaning towards doing something in Advisory &amp; Consulting or perhaps Forensic Accounting.

Right now, I am searching for an internship and am finding it quite hard to find one that is in Advisory or something that is not Audit or Tax. Do you guys think it would be best to perhaps search for an internship at a Big 4, regional, or small local firm doing a little bit of everything? And regarding the degree do you guys think it would be best to go for the MACC or the Masters in Computers? I'm just in a weird position and I am not sure really what to do.

1hpqh3,10,2013-07-05,Feeling very lost after an interesting turn of events regarding school,comradewilson,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1hpqh3/feeling_very_lost_after_an_interesting_turn_of/,"Long story, going to try and shorten it. 

I am a student living in San Francisco. Two days ago it was announced that following this school year the college I am attending, a two year university, will be losing its accreditation. I have a minimum of 1 1/2 years left before I can transfer, so you can see where the problem begins. 

Currently my school is the only option within San Francisco, as far as I know. There are other two year schools but they usually have their students transfer to my college and then to a four year after that. 

I am somewhat hesitant to transfer to another two year institution and lose my current progress, but not totally turned away by the idea or sure that I WOULD lose the progress. That is just a worst case scenario. 

My current school still has the option to appeal the loss of accreditation and I will be working hard with everyone at my school to make sure that we stay open and I can avoid all of this. However, I'm making a contingency plan.

If my school were to close, would it be practical, with enough experience, to begin working internships in San Francisco instead of transferring to an out-of-city school? I'm willing and eager to self-teach programming and would prefer to not have to restart my college education. The problems that I've heard on this subreddit, concerning no degree, is that it will probably bite me in the ass somewhere down the line. 

Working internships while transitioning into a job at any of the companies would be a dream, but I understand that it may not be practical or the best option. I am willing to hear other opinions/suggestions/experiences similar to this before deciding and I still have an entire year before the school (possibly) closes. 

Thank you for your time and apologies if all of this was slightly incoherent.

edit: going to add my experience since I figured someone might ask. I'm currently self-teaching Python and am decent with it. Last semester I took and into to C++ and struggled, but am moving on and hope to understand it much better this coming semester. I'd like to teach myself Java soon after I finish Python and get a better grip on C++."

-The first one is that I bought a motorcycle when I was making good money on a finance/credit card and then I lost my job, forcing me into a repossession. I have never paid anything after the repo and I know I owe more than 6k but I will never be able to pay it. I've completely given up on it and I'm sure my credit is shit now.
-The second is that I was unemployed for almost 2 years and decided to try college. I used student loans to support myself while I got my 2 year degree. I started my 4 degree but I have been trying to avoid more debt by working since I'm now employed. I'm $24,00 in debt from this.

My dilemma is that I do not want to get in anymore debt. The amount I owe right now might be manageable to pay back if I had to start now, but anymore and I will be in trouble. The other issue is that I cannot go to school full time. My school has a health insurance requirement where if you take more than 2 classes they automatically charge your for health insurance. I cannot afford this nor do I want to go into debt for it. So my two options with school are 1: Continue going part time and take 2-3 years to finish. Also adding who knows how much debt. 2: Try and pay for health insurance with loans, go full time, and go into significantly more debt to support myself as I will not be able to work as much as I do now. I'm guessing at least $10,000 more to finish. 

I'm pursuing a Computer Information Systems degree. I don't really know how valuable this is and I don't even really know what kind of jobs I should look for with this degree. I've been looking for internships but I don't know what to look for except just anything that says ""entry level"". I don't know if this degree will pay off in the long run, so far all I've learned is how to use Excel and Access.

If I quit going to school I will have to start paying back my loans within a few months. They are asking for around $200 a month, maybe more. I probably could afford this but I will have to cut back. And this will be for at least the next 10 years. I have two jobs right now, both part time. I could work more at one of them but I am not very happy working there. I have been looking for something new. It's customer service so.. it gets frustrating. 

I really just do not know what to do. I wish I had never gone to school because I feel like it's a scam that will never pay off. Now I'm nearly 25k in debt with nothing to show. I feel obligated to continue college because I'm afraid of paying back my loans, which up until recently, I haven't made enough to even afford. I really need some advice. Thanks."

I'll throw the need help at the top. 

I am in Florida, from what I have researched, infidelity isn't taken into account if there aren't kids and they didn't blow money on the mistress. 
Would what he done, even count? (online cheating)
In your opinion, would I need a lawyer if I were asking for alimony. 

(((the story)))

We were high-school sweethearts online and he moved to Florida to be with me. There was a bunch of cheating physically on his part while we were apart, so I asked for a probationary period of at least 6 months together physically before I wanted to tie the knot. We had some minor fights on some minor online flirting, but in the end got married. 

Our plan was to get him through college and into a good job so I could start college. Trying to make this short, so lets just say that about two years ago ( 5 years into the marriage) I found out that while in school, and his internship, he had been having online relationships with girls for over THREE darn years. I couldn't locate any actual conversations, but there were photos of girls saying "" I love you (my exes name) "" On them, so I knew that on an emotional level it was pretty serious with one of them. I contacted another who was horrified to have found out about him being married as he had said he was going to see her!

Needless to say, I packed and left. ... and four months later I decided to take him back. I let him know that taking him back was no guarantee that I'd stay, but that I would really try. 

Over the past two years things just... broke down. I will admit, I was not perfect, I was hurt, I was distrustful. I went a little wild... not horribly so, just dabbled in some things. The big fight was, he knew I was bi, I had a conversation with him about letting me sleep with a girl. Things escalated with said girl, while he was running somewhere ... he walked in. To him, the first girl was cheating. I guess I can see his point, but it's something that we discussed that would eventually happen. He was upset he wasn't there and I didn't ask explicitly to do it with this one girl at that exact time. ( tons of ""rules"" on this subject that constantly changed to his whims... so it was impossible to do anything right when it came to that)

The breakdown was when he was taking all this and consistently throwing it in my face. Any little thing I did wrong made me a horrible person. His past didn't matter anymore, and I was just basically crap. For the last 6 months of our marriage I wasn't home. I didn't sleep with anyone, I just stayed at friends. I couldn't stand the verbal abuse, I still couldn't trust him. I was still finding suspicious things on his computers... ect. 

Things came to a head shortly after our 7 year anniversary.  I tried to take my own life. I know now that was irrational and stupid, but being called every name in the book, and knowing that if I did leave him I'd have nothing really got to me. I worked full time in a job so stressful that I was throwing up at work ( think big banks and robo-signing, i hated it) to put him through 5 years of school. I worked big banking when we moved back to my hometown too because he was underpaid in his job. I pushed him to apply to his current job, and when he got job and, the income boost we needed for me to start school, I left my good paying job to go to school as per or original marriage plans. I just completed my first semester when I  decided I needed to leave. 

I have already contacted my old boss, there is a hiring freeze. I cannot get my old job back. I have been applying EVERYWHERE banking, part time, mcdonalds... ect... and I just got a minimum wage job that my first week I got a whopping 9 hours. I am still plugging job apps in my spare time and trying to keep my GPA. 

I did meet someone 2 or so weeks after I left. We spoke for two weeks, and decided to start dating. (kinda stupid in retrospect, but  I'm still with him) My ex, at the same time I met my so (before we were dating, just in talking phase) told me he slept with a girl.... and he was thinking of moving her in. This girl had a rep, and I advised him accordingly, and he said he knew about her, but really it's just screwing. (his words not mine) In the end he called me crying saying she had a  bf he didn't know about...  

Here's the kicker, I didn't sleep with my S.O for a while. However, since I'm in a ""relationship"" my ex is throwing it in my face constantly even now. His quotes is "" I don't care who I fucked, at least im not emotionally invested, that makes you look bad""  I tried to reason he was emotionally invested if he called me crying, but he brushes that off as being hurt by me and it spilling over to his doing her. All I can be is baffled at how I am a horrible person when he was the first to sleep with someone and was going to move her in! He said he meet a girl last week, he wouldn't give me the name, but said she was amazing..(sometimes we are on pretty decent terms) by remembering where he was ( out of town) I recalled my friend was out of town in the same place. Hes moved her into the apartment but both are denying a relationship. Actually, she moved in about three weeks ago (we've been apart two months) but both kept it hidden.... I only found out when she posted pictres online of her ""dual monitor set up"" and I noticed it was my old apartment and MY monitor that I told him if he really needed $$ to sell, and if not I'd like it back............Still he's berating me for being in a relationship. It's horrible. 

In all of this, he can afford all the bills. I have asked him to cover me till I get on my feet. I am sincerely trying. It's hard. Jobs don't grow on trees and I'm grasping at anything. I am not above any job, and I will scrub toilets at a diarrhea factory if it paid my bills, and got me away from having to beg him to cover me. It's so emotionally draining, luckily our obligations are nearly split down the middle. However, anytime he gets mad at me for ""being a bitch"" or whatever reason he wants to come up with that day... Im cut off. My mother paid our shared cell plan for 3 years of our marriage. We took it over, and now my ex, who's on that plan tells me he's getting his own line and canceling his....... that he just upgraded. ( huge fees) 

I want to ask for alimony.... I feel that 1/5th of his pay would not hurt him... and it's not all of what he's paying now. It would enable me some breathing room to get bills paid, because at this point, i'm wanting to drop out of school due to the stress of this. I want to get a lawyer ( he claims to have one, but I haven't seen proof) but with this job, and this pay, there is NO WAY I can afford the filing fee and an attorney... cheapest I have found is 550 for everything except filing, and filing is mid 400's. Any leftover student loan money is used for food and gas, while he is out partying all the time and taking trips out of town to go to clubs. 

I am at sch a loss. I put up with his crap with hopes of faking it till we made it. OR at the minimum get me through school, I threw away my job at his promise he'd cover me (pre-divorce) and now I am still dealing with the emotional abuse that was part of the reason I left, yet i'm financially obligated to treat him with respect at all times, or go through a week of not knowing if he will cover me till he messages me expecting an apology for something he claims I said in some kind of wrong way. .... 90% of or conversations are through text, and he claims every text I send is dirty, rude or demeaning even just a ""do yo still have me for my car payment?""

I don't know if i can afford a lawyer... i know im going to lose my car, and my phone. I don't even know if it's worth it to hire someone, but I need and honestly think I deserve alimony... even if it's short term until I get out of school. I don't see why I have to accrue massive student loans for  living money when the only reason he has what he has is because I worked to put him through school, and pushed him to apply to his current job. 

Man, this is long and rambling... and im sorry. I hope that i kept the misspellings to the minimum and included all relevant info. Thank yo so much if yo read this far.

I applied to and was accepted onto a Masters' program in IT at my university, and really want to get into this field. The course claims to be designed to give people without a background in IT a solid grounding.

However, views from objective outsiders are always welcome. Do you think that 1 year of intensive lectures and a development project is enough to be able to gain the knowledge to secure a job or internship in this sector?

The uni I've been offered the place at is ranked in the UK top 5 for comp sci, and I also spoke to the professor who leads the course, who told me that if I take 2 modules in advanced programming and algorithms, there is the potential to transfer to MSc Software Development. Would this be a worthwhile move to improve employability? I can link the course if anyone wishes.

I had started to tire of bioscience in my final couple of years and realised that it wasn't where I wanted to spend my life working, although I stuck it so I would still have a decent first degree.

I applied to and was accepted onto a Masters' program in IT at my university, and really want to get into this field.  The course claims to be designed to give people without a background in IT a solid grounding.

However, views from objective outsiders are always welcome. Do you think that 1 year of intensive lectures and a development project is enough to be able to gain the knowledge to secure a job or internship in this sector?

Edit: The uni I've been offered the place at is ranked in the UK top 5 for comp sci

Edit 2: I also spoke to the professor who leads the course, who told me that if I take 2 modules in advanced programming and algorithms, there is the potential to transfer to MSc Software Development. Would this be a worthwhile move to improve employability? I can link the course if anyone wishes."

 I apologize in advance if I'm all over the place. 


 I'm finishing my Computer Science degree at the end of the year. My courses were mainly focused on software developpement and building applications, which just really isn't my bag. I've since decided that I wanted to go down the networking path!
 


 Since my course barely offers any relevent classes (Unless SQL and PHP count?) I've taken it upon myself to get certified on my spare time. I've been having fun studying for the CCNA, and then I have my sights set on the MCSA (Server 2008).



 Am I going for the right Certs? SHOULD I be going for certs, or will I be looked down upon because I have 'paper' certs? If not, what certs should I get? 



 **TLDR**

Finishing CompSci in one year, doing CCNA + MCSA at same time. Yay or Nay? Why? Note that I have an internship that the school can help me find."
1hnyuf,8,2013-07-04,Just wrote this Cover Letter. I'm putting in for a position that is expected to have more experience than I have but I know I am perfect for it. Would love some feedback on my Cover Letter. Thanks!,_Lloyd_,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1hnyuf/just_wrote_this_cover_letter_im_putting_in_for_a/,"Dear Hiring Agent,

I have never seen a job posting that had me as instantly excited as your posting for an External Affairs Representative. It was as if every line was tailored for me, and that I was tailored for your needs. I fell in love with the 'Company Name' culture &amp; way during my first internship with the company and jumped at the first opportunity to begin a career with 'Company Name.' While my current position, Title of Position, is an excellent job, I have been waiting eagerly for a position that would better leverage my skills, aptitude, and drive to maximize my value for 'Company Name;' I am confident this is the role to do just that.

While I must address that I only have one year of experience with 'Company Name,' I ask that you will not rule me out just yet. As you can see from my resume I have been polishing myself for this type of role. 

First, my education has me positioned perfectly to hit the ground running as 'Comany Name's' External Affairs Representative. With two Bachelor’s degrees, in Political Science, and Peace, War, &amp; Defense, I thoroughly understand the intricate interworking of government, public policy, and our valued customers, as well as the communications necessary to bring these stakeholders together for the best interest of everyone involved. Being fresh out of school, working multiple internships, as well as beginning a full time career with 'Company Name' has allowed me to sharpen my personal and professional networking skills that are invaluable in a role of this caliber; I fully understand the importance of creating lasting relationships and know how to leverage these relationships to represent 'Company Name' in the best possible light.

My abilities to research, investigate, and inform myself on important issues quickly and effectively have been honed throughout my time at the University of North Carolina. These are powerful tools when advising community officials and leaders on constantly changing problems and concerns.  As well as practicing how to inform myself I have been given unique opportunities to share my knowledge which has allowed me  extensive practice conveying ideas in concise and easily understandable terms; a crucial asset when building positive public perception. 

Spending my time with 'Company Name' on the Nuclear side has given me a inimitable opportunity to witness just how important public perception and stakeholder’s opinions can be for the operation of the utility. I have witnessed firsthand just how misunderstood the industry can be and have used various opportunities to advocate for the nuclear industry. 

My internships with 'Company Name' and 'other gov't agency' provided notable experiences working through mock disasters (storms, radiological releases, terrorist attacks, etc) and the importance of all stakeholders coming together for these events to be properly mitigated. These opportunities also put me in front of Senior Staff on a multitude of occasions briefing them on events, explaining complex scenarios, and training them on updates or new programs; situations I am comfortable and confident in.

With the company searching for places to save money around every corner I think I provide an excellent opportunity to fill this role with a capable, motivated individual full of fresh ideas at a lower price than someone with your preferred five years with 'Company Name.'

I thank you for the opportunity to display some of my skills and experiences with you and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss further the strengths I can bring to the role. I am confident you will not be disappointed. Thank you, once again.

Most Respectfully,

My Name"

I thought to myself ""Well, I'll just take these full time jobs, and then I'll go to full time college at an online college as well"". However, I'd gotten quite a bit of negative feedback about that plan from my family, so I decided that I would let the ""big dogs"" of the tech industry help me out a little bit. I sent out emails to recruiters at apple and microsoft (I also meant to send one to google, sony, and facebook) regarding my dilemma. I didn't get a response back from apple, but I got one from a microsoft recruiter (which helped solve my crisis a bit), and he suggested I take a look at their internship program (which I'd of course already seen before and took very much into consideration applying). I sent him a few questions that I had from looking over it once again as a now high school graduate, and recently got his response to his questions.

My question: Can I capitalize on this in a way that will significantly help my chances of being admitted to their internship program (such as forming a strong relationship with the recruiter) ? If so, what are some actions I can take, ideas/tips you all have?

Thank you!"

I started smoking two years ago when I transfered to a new university. Previously, i had been playing very high level sports and never wanted to damage my lungs with any sort of smoke. I eventually moved onto a new school to focus on my academics, where I stopped playing my sport. 

Now, I have always been a very type A person--I thrive in high-stress environments as well as situations where I can be social with large groups of people. I was introduced to weed while pledging my fraternity, and my life was instantly changed. 

I discovered that pot allowed me to completely relax myself. After a long day of studying and doing work for my internships, MJ and a movie or video game was the perfect way to relax. For the first year, I couldn't smoke in my room because my roomate had a medical condition that made him extremely sensitive to smoke and of course I respected that. So I would smoke maybe 2-3 times a week with friends, or occasionally I would go on a walk and have a joint. 

The next year, I lived in an apartment complex that had my bestfriends and fellow smokers next door. We all had difficult class schedules w/ early classes, so going out drinking at the fraternity during the week became less frequent, and lazy nights with our bong and interesting conversations became the new norm. Weed was still the reward for finishing a day of work at this point.

Than one day, I was doing the preliminary research for a big research paper. I was struggling to connect the literature I had found, but I still had a few weeks until it was due so I called it a night and met my friends for our ""midnight coffee chats."" when I came back to my room, I noticed I forgot to put away my notes. Well, as I was putting them away, I connected the dots on my research! It was fantastic, finding out that I had a new midset in which I could look at my work. 

That eventually led to me writing papers high, and I was getting some of my best grades ever. I was now convinced that this herb was the most wonderful thing in the world. So now, I was smoking before everything. Parties, research sessions, essay writing, and other homework. 

Eventually, however, I realized that being high was my new norm. I never went to class high, but as soon as I was done for the day I was smoking, with or without my friends. Most of the time, I wouldn't even want to be high; it was just done out of reflex and habit. 

I slowly realized that I was losing every edge that I previously had in my professional life. I was still social, but only with my pot smoking friends. I would want to go to parties, but only if i knew there would be other smokers there. I was very happy in my little bubble of work, weed, and relaxation but I was not doing anything to get ahead. 

At this same time, I realized that most of my dream jobs would require a government clearance. This meant going beyond just passing a drug test, because of my frequency of use technically put me in the category of habitual user. That was a real gut wrencher, knowing that I was technically defined as an addict by the government that i desperately want to work for.

I had a week blowout where I was high 24/7, and than I stopped cold turkey 6 days ago. I am very motivated at this point, and very happy that I can put myself back down the path that I want to take in life. Going back to school will bring back old triggers, but I have already talked to most of my smoking buddies and they are extremely supportive. In fact, my roomate next year is also quitting. 

I am not unhappy with the last two years of smoking, even the last year where i became a heavy user. That being said, I know that I will not be smoking for a very long time because of my career goals. 

Like I said, i am 6 days sober. I definitely still have urges, but I believe that I can overcome this. I look forward to a day when I retire in a mountain cabin and maybe start toking. But for now, my reality has to be one without weed. "

1hreat,0,2013-07-06,Advice for college students from a fresh graduate! AKA how I easily found a job,intern2employee,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1hreat/advice_for_college_students_from_a_fresh_graduate/,"**TLDR: Network.**

Just graduated with a business degree from a no-name state university.  My GPA was neither good nor bad.  I didn't work nearly as hard as many of my classmates. 

When I started my job search in April, I was terrified that I wouldn't find a job because of all the horror stories I've heard here. Also, I live in a state that [ranks top 5 for WORST unemployment](http://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm). 

But by the end of June, I got multiple job offers and interview invites (I also got a handful of rejections, but you take the good with the bad).  Meanwhile, a lot of my classmates are struggling to find a job or can only find part-time, temp, or contract work.  And I suspect that I am getting paid significantly more than most of the them.

So what did I do differently in college that my more hard-working classmates didn't do? *Network.*

I occasionally sent emails to professors and TAs who I took classes with.  Some of them didn't respond so I left them alone. A few, I kept a pretty good relationship with. When I started looking for a job, I leveraged those connections to help find job openings.

I did a co-op/internship (required by my school). I'm glad I was required to do it because I was able to make more connections from the inside. The company extended an offer when I graduated, but I eventually declined.

I went to club meetings.  This actually didn't help that much even though business club meetings were almost always networking events.  Too much ""competition"" so I couldn't develop a meaningful relationship with anybody except upper-classmates.

I went to professional meetups.  This was tremendously helpful and ultimately the most fruitful. Particularly the tech meetups. Even though I'm not a computer science major, I figured the tech industry was almost always hiring, so I figured, why not.

Alumni association was a bust. At least at my school. No leads there.

If I had to do it over again, I would probably skip the club meetings and spend more of my efforts with professors and meetups.  I think one internship is enough, but more couldn't hurt. But really, you never know which professional relationship could come up with a lead.

So I hope this helps."

So here is the story, I'm an intern in this firm (kinda of big and renowed firm), my internship end soon and the HR manager + one the firm bosses told they want me to stay and work for them after my internship.

I'd very much like to work in there because they have lot of interesting project and is well renowed (can serve later in the CV), the only problem is they don't pay much (I know this from my co-workers who I became friend with and know what they pay everybody for their first contract).

So I'd like to try and discuss the possibility to have a better salary but I fear they will back away if I do that... and the problem is that the boss who want me is not the one I will be negotiating with, actually the boss that discuss the contract is kinda of hard negotiator (lot of experience in keeping the company expenses low) and this is making me nervous.

My interview is happening soon and I made a list of stuff that can play for me and against me :

Positive stuff that I can use as an argument:

-They are the one who told me they want me to stay (it's rare here, most people ask to stay and most of them are refused)

-I worked on a lot of the on-going project so I'm already able to start reworking on them as soon as a new phase start.

-I know how to use a lot more of software than my co-worker and have showed that during my internship, (I also learned everything by myself and always want to learn more, maybe I should tell them that?).

-The company is switching to a new software as a base for work and they are paying formation for their employees, I on the other hand know how to use this software already so they don't have to form me (The problem is that I didn't work with this software during the internship so they can doubt about my competence with this software)

-I can communicate in 5 languages (it can be usefull in our job but not that much)

Negative stuff that can play against me :

-Apart from internship I don't have professional experience (I'm young and just finishing school).

-There is a lot of unemployed people looking for job in our industry.

-A lot of people want a chance to work for our firm and accept any type of contract and the bosses know that and know that the employees knows that (so if you don't like something there is always people ready to replace you).

-I'm a foreigner so the administrative procedure is a lot heavier, (this is how I know they really want me for now but can discourge them if I ask for too much).

Anyway sorry for the wall of text and my english, if you guys can offer me some advice I'll be really grateful, I will post an update to tell you how it went.

1hqkje,0,2013-07-06,[24/m] Might have gotten myself into the friendzone [22/f],[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hqkje/24m_might_have_gotten_myself_into_the_friendzone/,"5 weeks ago, I met a girl from out of state who was starting as a summer intern (different group, same company). I liked her from the get-go, and as she was new to the area I took it upon myself to introduce her to the region and city.

First, I took her and some other girls out paddling. We spent the entire day together, and at several points I felt like she was passively flirting: inviting me to sit next to her, maintaining close physical distance, etc. When I dropped them all off, she came forward, thanked me for showing them around, and gave me a hug.

The next weekend, we spent the day exploring local areas and having dinner together. She strongly insisted she pay her share, but afterwards we chilled at my place and she revealed her geeky side, which just made me even more interested in her and again, she seemed to sit very close to me and make a lot of eye contact. When I dropped her back off at her place, she told me she had a great time and gave me another hug. This was not officially a date - other people were involved, but they backed out so it just ended up being the two of us.

Now on the 4th of July, I invited her over to my place. We spent an hour or two at the pool, then moved to the hot tub. I tried moving close to her to see how she'd respond, and while she didn't back away, she didn't exactly replicate to get any closer either. We then watched some TV together, and she patted for me to sit next to her, but the same thing happened. 

Later we went to a coworker's for bbq and fireworks. We were standing next to each other as they went off, when my coworker came by and asked me if I was still seeing my girlfriend; the answer was no, as we had broken up a year ago, but I didn't get into details. She didn't say anything, but I did notice that she was texting some male friends throughout the night (she never mentioned having a boyfriend), so I asked her if there was a special guy friend at home. She said there were a few guys that were interested in her, but she really just saw them as friends, and that she enjoys hanging out with guys mostly so she can have nerdy friends to be with. She then asked me if I had any relationships right now, and I told her no; she then said that she was sure I'd find the right person for me, since I was such a nice person.

My heart dropped when she said that. I tried to play it cool; I told her that I could see why she was so popular with the guys and that I didn't blame them for going after her, but the ""FRIENDZONE!"" alert in my head kept going off. She hugged me again when I dropped her off. When I asked her about the lunch/movie/museum trip that we had planned for tomorrow, she agreed but said she had forgotten about it, and asked to have it moved later so she could go exercising and sleep in a bit. Overall it just didn't sound as enthusiastic as before.

Now I know she's leaving in about 4 weeks, but most interns come back (and she graduates next year). I know she's hesitant to come as a full timer because she's very close to her family, but at the same time she said if she were to live anywhere else, it would be here. I guess in my head I thought that if we had something, she'd be willing to come back and we could maybe continue where we left off, but perhaps that's just wishful thinking. 

She's honestly everything I've wanted in a girl and I thought we had a connection, but maybe she either a) just isn't interested or b) is interested but wants to stay with her family more...all I know is I've fallen hard for her, and could use some advice.

Thank you all in advance!

I know my story isn't bad. Things could have gone a million times worse, but somehow I'm skating by. I just want to be happy.

Me: 

grew up in the midwest, poor family relations, went to the south for college. Did well, but never really felt like I fit in. Went for my master's in my home state (still far from home, but cheap), finished it, but it nearly fucking killed me. I went a full year without any social interaction out of class. I would go to school, go home, sometimes get drunk, wake up the next morning, and rush to get everything done at the last second before I had to turn it in. Worked an internship with a great company between undergrad and grad, loved it. A few months ago interviewed with the company in another group. Got the job offer, was told it would pay X amount, got the official offer call a week later saying the offer was for 5k less than X amount. Confused, scared, not at all sure of what to do. Plenty to live off of, but took bad advice. Asked for more time to think- originally 24 hours, asked for a week. Offer rescinded, no chance to accept at rate offered beforehand. Downward spiral, class, home, drunk, wakeup, homework, class. No soul. 3 months gone.

1.5 months unemployment, living with girlfriend (in Southeast US). Amazing, wonderful, beyond a doubt saves life. Finally get job offer in Southwest US. Should be happy, should be greatful. Job going well. Girlfriend moving to follow me. But don't remember how to live like I'm not wearing a mask. Every instinct in my body wants to work, home, drunk, wakeup, work.

How do I soul?"
1hq5dl,6,2013-07-05,From IT Recruiter to IT Professional?,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hq5dl/from_it_recruiter_to_it_professional/,"Hey folks,

I've posted here infrequently before, and I'm back again for some guidance and tough love. 

**Background**

Graduated this may with a degree in Political Science, minors in Economics and Computer Science. I left school a year shy of finishing my BS in Computer Science because, well, I ran out of money and the ability to borrow more. During school I worked remotely through a campus program doing QA work for one of the big guys, writing and running test scripts for hardware automation. Despite this, I had no luck finding an IT job so before graduation, I took a job as an IT recruiter in a fairly active market where companies struggle more than in larger areas to attract talent. However, there are some pretty large, prestigious enterprise-level shops here.

**Fast forward three months**

While I enjoy my job, I'd ultimately like to be on a close-knit development team in an agile environment where I can meet my love of programming and personality need to interact heavily with other people. I'm confident that I won't be here in a year or two and I've recently been considering enrolling at a technical college for an AAS in software engineering. The only reason I see this as a viable option is because the program they are offering is the #1 skill-set in my area, where my fiancee and I would like to remain long term. The program itself is heavily rooted in the .NET framework, with a lot of C# coursework as well as niche courses in ASP.NET, SQL, and some web technologies (PHP and JS, primarily). Based on my experiences recruiting IT talent, this is the exact skill-set that companies here are seeking.

**So, what?**

I guess first, I'd like to know if anyone else has taken a similar path, BA first and then a technical AAS? If not, what is the realistic viability of this as a means to finding a full-time development job? Unfortunately, I learn far better in a classroom setting where I can collaborate with my peers on software projects than sitting at home alone trying to watch YouTube videos. I still do some hobbyist programming in my spare time though, mostly in Java. 

Also, what kind of success can one expect using referrals and ""cold-calling"" to land an internship at a large company? I have a pretty decent network of folks I've met in my current role and I'm confident that I could at least hit some leads, as companies will train up the right candidate.

Finally, if anyone has any advice on what the best way to pursue this goal without putting a neon sign over my desk that says ""I'm out in 12-24 months,"" that would be helpful.


PS: I'm sorry for all the dog shit recruiters y'all have no doubt been hounded by your entire careers. I promise we don't all suck.

1hq0ix,3,2013-07-05,"Me [19F] with my SO [19M] of 1.5 years, I fell out of love but I still want friendship...help!",thegirlwiththebagel,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hq0ix/me_19f_with_my_so_19m_of_15_years_i_fell_out_of/,"Hello there....sorry in advance for all this writing...

So, me and my boyfriend were very close friends before we starting dating, all with the same tight-knit group of mutual friends. After I experienced a bad breakup and was an emotional wreck, we started seeing each other as more than friends and became very serious. I loved him more than I thought possible, and every second was bliss. Then we tried long distance during the first year of college.

Here's the thing. I've never honestly had a long point in time where I was just single. I always felt like I needed someone for some reason. After the bad breakup with my first *serious* boyfriend, I don't believe I gave myself enough time to truly get over him before I jumped into a second serious relationship. 

Now, during my first year of college, I gained confidence I never had before. I made great friends, did well in school, and felt comfortable just being on my own. During that time, I think subconsciously I realized that I couldn't love my SO in the same way I had before, because I had changed into someone that really needed time to do things for myself and to better my future, like take internships, do service trips, study abroad! My SO, on the other hand, is the opposite, in which he sees a future of just us, basically where we can't go abroad unless we both go to the same place.

So to conclude this rambling, I need to stop this, because I can't keep pretending everything is okay; it's not only painful for me, but it isn't fair to him to ignore the truth. But, I don't know how. I don't want to ruin our group of friends because I love them all so much, and most importantly, I don't want to hurt him as I was hurt when I was broken up with. I care about him too much to let him out of my life completely. 

How do I express do him that I still care about him, but I can't be in a romantic relationship at this point in my life without hurting him like I know it will hurt?

TL;DR: I'm emotionally unavailable, and I don't know how to express this to him without being a horrible person/making him hate me. I can't do it anymore, I need advice badly. "

Check out previous posts for details on [setting your career goal](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1giewv/breaking_into_game_design_part_1_find_your/), [building your portfolio](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1gsj06/breaking_into_game_design_part_2_build_your/) and [learning how to sell your experiences](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1h6bzh/breaking_into_game_design_part_3_learn_to_sell/).*

Now that I’m devoting my energies to [Enhanced Wars](http://www.enhancedwars.com), I do not see nearly the quantity of resumes as when I was part of the hiring process at BioWare’s San Francisco office. But I still review the occasional resume for someone who has reached out on Reddit or forums, or for a former colleague asking me to pass it on to someone in my network. If you have read my earlier post about [how to build your portfolio](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1gsj06/breaking_into_game_design_part_2_build_your/), you should have plenty of meaningful material to put on your resume even if you are trying to land your first full time job (or internship) in game design. But learning how to write that resume is a skill unto itself.

**The 4 hurdles**

Before writing a resume, it is important to understand the purpose of the document beyond the high level goal of getting hired. A resume passes through many hands and must be targeted at a number of different audiences within a single team or organization. For the purposes of this post, imagine that you are applying for a job at a larger company like EA or Ubisoft that will have a dedicated HR department. Although each studio’s processes are different, the general principles outlined below will be a rough guide regardless of if you are trying to join the Battlefield 4 team or a 3 man start up like [Quarter Spiral](http://quarterspiral.com) making its first hire.

When you apply for a job your resume will be screened by someone on the HR side. This person has probably had a conversation with the hiring manager or members of the team about what they are looking for in the position and in team members in general. This screener probably does not have hands on game development experience and will be reviewing you at a “keyword” level. If you look like a good prospect, the screener may call you up to verify your potential, or may pass you directly on to the hiring manager to ask “would you like to phone screen this person?” This is your first hurdle.

The next step will be convincing the hiring manager (who is probably your prospective boss) that you are worth talking to. She will review your resume and [portfolio](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1gsj06/breaking_into_game_design_part_2_build_your/) to determine if your skills match the position. She will almost definitely look at your LinkedIn profile, and if you have any common contacts may do preliminary checkups on you. Assuming you seem like a good prospect, she will set up a phone interview. This is your second hurdle.

Once you get on the phone, your resume will frame the conversation with the person on the other end. She will likely ask a mixture of questions about your experiences, as well as hypothetical questions about various job scenarios, to get a feel for your working style and thought processes. You may have one phone interview or several, depending on geography, seniority of position and dev team process.

All steps up till now have been fairly low cost for the company, but from here on out it will get more expensive. In the phone interview your resume must help guide a conversation that convinces the interviewer you are worth bringing in for a half to full day worth of interviews. This may or may not involve flying you in and putting you up in hotel depending on geography. In-person interviews will definitely involve diverting the attention of a number of team members which is very expensive from a development perspective. Convincing the interviewer she should bring you in to the studio for a full interview is the third hurdle.

Once you get to the studio, you will interview a range people on the team. This will probably include the hiring manager who was the first to phone screen you, peers of hers in leadership roles in other departments, people on the team who report to her and potentially the people she reports to. In most instances these interviewers will have spent 5 minutes or less looking at your resume and portfolio before stepping in to the room. It is safe to assume that they have not read the job description you are applying for. It is likely that these interviewers will simply pick a bullet point or position on your resume and ask you to tell them about it.

This series of interviews are to determine if you are the right candidate for the job. The team is trying to determine not only if you have the skills and experience to fulfill the role, but also if your personality and temperament will be a good fit for the team. If you have the skills to do the job but no one wants to work with you because of the attitude you give off in the interview, you will not get the job. This is the fourth hurdle.

In all these instances, your resume guides a conversation with an interviewer who has varying degrees of knowledge about you, the position you are trying to fill, the team and the project. The resume is a conversation starter.

**The razor**

Your goal with a resume is to have a single page which frames a conversation around why you are the best candidate for the job. There is no need to clutter it with details of summer jobs in unrelated industries, leadership positions in social clubs from college or lists of obscure programming languages you kind of used for one semester. With each element you put on the resume you should consider if you can talk about it in a meaningful way. If not, cut it.

For instance, in college I wrote electronic music. I had a DJ show on the college radio. I was the co-president of the swing dance club. One time I (technically) opened for the Black Eyed Peas. If I was applying for a job as a designer at Harmonix, all of these are valid points that help me explain my lifelong love of music and why I am the right mixture of designer and musician for their studio. If I am applying as a multiplayer systems designer on the [Enhanced Wars](http://www.enhancedwars.com) team, these points are meaningless.

In my opinion, you need your name and contact information, a link to your portfolio site and possibly social presence like twitter, a section on education and a section on work. Everything else is optional.

**Hero stories**

If you read my last post [on selling yourself](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1h6bzh/breaking_into_game_design_part_3_learn_to_sell/), you should already have a good idea of the content of your resume. Assuming you are trying to get your first full time game job, you may not have “job titles” or company roles to list. But you should have a number of pieces of tangible design work you can list and explain your role on.

Instead of grouping bullet points by job, group them by project or course. Each “job” should have two to three bullet points that highlight a different hero story about your experience. For instance, in college I made a game called Refuse of Space that won a game design competition. If I was applying for my first job, I would list Refuse of Space and dates worked on it as though it were a job on my resume, then include one bullet point highlighting its award and one highlighting that I did all the design, programming and art myself. If I were to rewrite my resume today, I do not think this project would be included in my one pager.

**Avoid title inflation**

A common effect I have seen on resumes for those early in a career (and one I have been guilty of in the past) is title inflation. On one hand, there is nothing to say that you cannot list yourself as Executive Producer of your semester long game project that resulted in an unpolished demo. On the other hand, when a hiring manager works somewhere like Electronic Arts – with Executive Producers like Casey Hudson who is responsible for all things Mass Effect – it is hard to take this title seriously and may count against you.

Instead of giving yourself lofty titles (or multiple titles per project) go with a more humble approach. Instead of Executive Producer just say Team Lead. Instead of Lead Designer just say Designer. Being aware of the size of your team and the scope of your role within it will go much further than a flashy but ultimately overblown title.  

**Miscellaneous sections**

Depending on the online template you started with, you may feel the need to include a mission statement, skills section, hobbies &amp; interests, coursework or some other type of section on your resume. In my opinion, more is not always better and you should take a minimalist approach when it comes to your resume. Go back to your razor: is this something you want to be asked about? Does it allow for you to discuss a unique aspect of your past and why you are an ideal candidate? If not, cut it.

When it comes to a mission statement, I generally advise against them. Unless your mission statement is tailored for the specific job you are applying for, it is probably meaningless. The fact that you want to use your wide range of skills to create compelling experiences for players was implied when you sent in your resume.

For skills, do not list them unless you can intelligently answer a question about them. I know I used to list Fortran and Lua on my resume because of some college coursework. If anyone had asked me a meaningful question about either language while I was interviewing, it would have tanked me as a candidate. Remember that the goal of your resume is to frame a positive conversation about yourself, so avoid anything that will detract from the overall impression that you are the best possible candidate for a specific role.

**The cover letter**

I am a bit torn on cover letters. Speaking from my experience on hiring teams, I can comfortably say that a cover letter has never meaningfully impacted my decision on a candidate. But even if I expect that no one on the other end is reading your cover letter, I still believe it is worth writing.

Part of applying for a job is applying for that specific job, and not just any job with the word designer in the title. So writing a cover letter (or intro email) will force you to take your abstract resume and weave a compelling story about why you are the right candidate for a specific job with a specific company.

With that in mind, I believe it is a worthwhile exercise to write a two to three paragraph “cover letter” style email tailored specifically for each job you apply for.

**Exotic portfolios**

Since you are a game designer you are likely compelled to create an exotic portfolio or resume. You might think it is a good idea to create a 3d level in Unity that is itself the resume. This is not a good or bad idea, it is an interesting one. If you can build an exotic portfolio that actually goes above and beyond a piece of paper to show why you deserve a job, then by all means go ahead. But too often these exotic portfolios detract from your application. Only invest in an exotic presentation of your resume if it is truly impressive to a professional game designer.

If you take all this into account when crafting your resume, you will likely jump over the first few hurdles and land several interviews. I will cover preparation for these interviews in my next article in the series."

After working as a softprog temp, I was getting fed up with them not offering me a full-time job, and the commute was 2 hours. So I accepted a job at a local hospital in my hometown as a software applications programmer.

I currently make 31,000/yr and live in California.

After seeing many of my less qualified techie friends get jobs at 3X as much, I started questioning my employment.

How do I go about changing this? I know this is a very stupid question, but I just really need some advice. Our HR department has set up a very strict promotion schedule (7% a year) which defuses the opportunity to ask for a raise.

Help a fellow techie out?

Current job duties include: Interfacing/implementing new hardware with existing network, program scripts and handshakes between said interfaces, designing and implementing new applications/interfaces to meet doctor's requests, maintain EMR translators and communications between said interfaces.

And with grave detail [f on f tryst]",[deleted],gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/1ht4o4/in_response_to_all_those_go_on_comments_ive_ever/,"I am 36, female. This happened 17 years ago.  Here's a recollection of the one and only tryst I had with another woman...and my best friend.  I will be going into explicit detail...probably so much so as to be able to relive some of the moments as I recall them up from memory.  I will be happy to answer any questions -- ask away or just enjoy the read, FWIW...





Jenn and I were always very flirtatious -- with guys...and with each other. But not so with any other girls. There was just a chemistry between us. We both knew it but never acted upon it.





Jenn has so many great attributes that I still love about her, even though I haven't seen her in 17 years. Physically: she has long blonde hair (like me), a petite frame at 5' 3"" (also like me), she has an amazing body with a tiny waist and feminine hourglass hips, has a killer smile and can convey an entire conversation with just her eyes.  Her looks make me wet alone, and how she uses those eyes...how she peers through them.  Oh, and she has FANTASTIC breasts. I was always in awe of them. I loved seeing her in her bikini when we would sit around her pool. She would lay out for hours and I loved staring at her and those womanly breasts and tiny waist from behind my sunglasses. I think she always knew I was checking her out...as she seemed to coyly play it up, for my enjoyment. Her boobs have got to be cup size C or D. Mine are a small A (IF that) which is probably why I loved hers so much (since I felt like mine never 'came in'...and I still feel that way).  





She's overtly sexual in nature. In that 'Marilyn Monroe' sort of way...she just oozes sex. I love the match in prowess that I found in her.  She was the kind of girl that you would assume was very promiscuous, because of how sexual she came off. But, she wasn't and I liked that shyness about her.





Emotionally: I loved her attitude and her personality.  She was warm and kind and funny and has a great laugh. She also had a realness or depth to her friendship that always felt genuine. But she's also moody and a little bitchy/snotty at times. I love that too. In fact, it draws me to her more than a person that only sees rainbows and sunshine and goodness in every person they meet. (It comes off shallow.) But not Jenn. Much like in a ""Miss Piggy sort of way"" where you know she can be moody and temperamental but it draws you in even more...wanting to win her over, pull her out, and break through that temperamental moody shell of an attitude, when it appeared. I liked the challenge. Personality-wise, we just clicked symbiotically.





The summer after freshman year took her to Denver on an internship for the summer.  I don't know how it came about, but she was going to be living in an apartment out there (out on her own for the first time) and I was going to go with her. The summer was going to be a blast.  





She went out first and got an apartment and started her internship and I joined her a few weeks later. When I got to Denver, I unpacked my suitcase in her studio apartment and quickly found a job waitressing. I had a car payment to make...my newfound adult responsibilities to yield to. She would work, I would work, and we would have fun just being buds in our off hours. We would go shopping, to the movies, trek the mall scoping out hot guys...all the usual best friend stuff. I loved it. And so did she. She loved having me out there and my attention I gave to her. 






My favorite part was her studio apartment. Having no luxury of another room or even a den, we shared her bed...A full-sized black fouton which was low to the ground and instantly felt more intimate.  I secretly loved that. I had no ""agenda"", per se, but after years of being drawn to her, I was ecstatic to be by her side at night. Night after night.





It was after I had been there for only a few days when the change in our relationship was about to take place.  That summer was unusually hot or maybe we just weren't used to that dry heat. One night was almost unbearable and she didn't have A/C. We went to bed, turned off the lights, opened the windows, and laid there. It was hot. I was hot. She was hot. We were both getting sweaty.  So the covers come off. Now we are laying side by side without the tacit barrier of even just a thin sheet separating us. We were both in skimpy nightgowns. I remember navy/white polka dots for her while I was in a hot pink short number she gave me a few years earlier.  (Which I still have, by the way.)  But it was still too much on our bodies.  I don't remember which of us did it first, but after a few minutes, our clothes came off...in the name of getting cooler, of course. I think I initiated it by taking mine off first. Naturally, I said something to blame it on the heat, but secretly, my mind was racing with the possibility of how this could naturally progress and unfold.





Delicately, I tossed and turned like I couldn't get comfortable. Probably to spark conversation with her and signal I was not yet asleep (far from it). I remember her being more still. She was probably nervous. Anxious, but nervous. Nothing like this was ever mentioned between us before so we were in uncharted territories, testing the boundaries of our friendship.





I remember finally settling into a ""comfortable"" position -- facing her, laying on my side. And then there they were. Her enormous breasts glowing in the moonlight that was shining through the open window. I remember simply staring at them, like a 13 year old boy glimpsing at his first porno mag.  It took me what felt like an hour to finally muster the courage to say something to her. I asked her if I could touch them. She softly said, ""yes.""  So I did. I touched them. I caressed them. I squeezed them. I had never felt anything like them. No part of my own body had that texture. Her skin was smooth like a cross between satin and velvet. And they were soft.  Soft when I pushed them in, soft when I gently squeezed them, and had an alluring weight when I moved them. It seemed like they were filled with feathers from angels' wings. It was glorious. 





Then I made the next move. I sat up for a better vantage point and to be able to use both hands. I sat beside her and she softly moaned when I touched her. Her breathing started to get slightly deeper. I instantly knew this was an experience in which we both felt a great internal release that had been building over the years as illicit sexual tension. I caressed her breasts and moved to her torso. Gently rubbing her stomach and chest and encircling her breasts from nipple to side boob.  I enjoyed every portion of them.  Then I slowly lowered myself to kiss her body. I started around her neck and slowly moved down her décolletage.





I moved over her body cautiously -- giving her ample time to stop me at any point along the way.  I softly kissed my way back up from her stomach to her neck and lingered near her ear before slowly approaching her face. I asked her if this was ok and she responded, ""yes, but don't kiss me on the lips. Those are the only parts off limits."" -- A sure fire defense mechanism, a-la the movie Pretty Woman. 




I longed to kiss her lips but totally respected her boundary. So, I worked my way south, pausing again to admire and spend time on her fantastic boobs. I kissed them, nibbled her nipples and gently sucked on different sections with my mouth. When I got close to her navel, I rubbed my hands on her stomach and down the outside of her thighs, returning upwards and teasing her on her inner thighs. I reached for her panties and slowly slid them down.  I could feel their wetness on my wrists as I took them off, which excited me even more.  I could hardly contain the excitement within me but was sure to go slow and enjoy each moment of a scenario that may never have the chance to play out again.





I lowered my lips to the mound between her legs and softly kissed her there. I breathed warmly as I passed over her clit and vulva, passing them by in absolute torture. I kissed her thighs, spread her legs apart with both hands, and lowered myself into position.  There I lay, rubbing her stomach, caressing her legs, softly kissing everywhere but THERE and gently breathing on her to silently announce I had arrived. She was moaning slightly and gently writhing. I descended my mouth to her clit and slipped out my tongue and took it into my mouth and ever so slightly sucked it and licked it. It was smooth and firm, erect with a tiny salute to pleasure. 





The sensation was surreal -- unlike anything I had ever felt on my mouth and uniquely distinct even to this day.  It didn't smell like mine but it was still 100% womanly. I was intrigued and my interest piqued even more. I moved my tongue around further and explored each fold and each lip. Her wetness mixed in my mouth. Even the juices were silky and I loved the taste of her.  I kissed and licked and nipped and then set in for a rhythm. I applied pressure to all the places I personally liked and consistently licked up and down.  I went faster and faster as her moaning increased and her breathing changed to a pant.  I alternated from time to time between a wide, flat tongue and a stiff flicker.  Then she started to cum. Her legs started to tense and she started to flinch and twitch. I burrowed in while her thighs pressed against my ears then she tightened and shook and relaxed all at once in an exhausted release.





I sat beside her lightly caressing her body and then asked her if that was ok...if she liked that. She said, ""yes, absolutely"" and that she was ""insanely tired from it all.""  It was probably 3 am and we both had to work early in the morning.  I pulled myself back up to my pillow and laid beside her and we both drifted off to sleep. "

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Could you briefly explain what the illness does and what those rods are doing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/cax7zot?context=5)|The easy to understand version of this is: my chest cavity would not grow, and over time, my organs would be crushed to death by the rib cage. The rods are serving as prosthetic ribs, and the doctors would expand them as my body grew, growing my rib cage and chest cavity.
[So I assume most of the surgeries were to expand the rods? It looks like they have notches you could set. Anyway glad everything worked out and hope youl be able to do more physical things in the future.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/cax8akb?context=5)|Pretty much, I'd say every 5ish times was either a replacement, or when they put in the 2nd or 3rd one.
[WOW Can you tell me how often the doctors have to expand the rods?I mean does this require surgery to expand them everytime they do?Also is this painfull to you,can you feel the rods in your chest,thanks for your answers and I wish you the very best in your life.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/cax94c5?context=5)|Usually it was between four to six months apart, and it'd be a full surgery. I'd spend a week down in Texas each time, Monday would be pre-op (bloodwork, x-rays, CT, lung tests, etc), Tuesday was surgery, Wed-Friday I'd be healing up. I can't really feel them, but I know the scars are very visible on my back.
[Holy shit. That would be horrible.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxmjh5?context=5)|Agreed.
[Titanium is ok, was there an adamantium option?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxdfz7?context=5)|I wish; I actually used to think I was a little like Wolverine, just didn't have the metal in the right place.
[I reckon given you're alive and thriving you have metal in all the right places.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxe252?context=5)|Well said, but I couldn't hurt to have some extra. Throw in an arc reactor while you're at it too.
[What is management like with this disease?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/cax80bw?context=5)|1) There is no real management at this point, just seeing a doctor once a year and being x-rayed to make sure everything is holding steady. During my growing years, I would fly down to Texas twice a year (length of time between surgeries co-relates with how fast I grew), and they would expand the devices. They may also need replacement when they get to the end of the expansion length.
[What kind of restrictions are there with physical activity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/cax80bw?context=5)|2) The main restrictions are no heavy physical activity, no contact sports, and nothing very upper-back related (ex. I cannot do a single pull-up and its very difficult to do a crunch)
[Why would this syndrome contribute to Mental deficiency?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/cax80bw?context=5)|3) This was 92, when they weren't positive about too much with genetics still. They weren't even positive on the diagnosed disorder, since they knew very little about it.
[*no contact sports.*  So no using your titanium chest to win bar bets?  ""i bet you can hit me as hard as you want in the chest and you'll get hurt""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxgy3j?context=5)|Sadly no, because it'd be very possible for them to either move around in my body, or even come out.
[So you are like Wolverine...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxm178?context=5)|By come out, I mean stab through my chest or back, so not really.
[You mentioned you have strong religious reviews. What did you mean by this? I'm often confused by people thanking God for fixing their afflictions, when their beliefs imply God caused their affliction in the first place.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxb9kc?context=5)|First off, I am a practicing Catholic. I am aware this means God caused all of my conditions, but I believe he wouldn't give me anything I couldn't handle. Prayer was a coping mechanism for me throughout all of the surgeries, and I felt as if I would be rewarded, in a sense, for enduring this. 
[Do you have any trouble breathing? Do you have to use other muscles to breathe? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/cax90bu?context=5)|My lung capacity is about 45% of what it should be for my height/age. That's also a reason why I have problems with exercise, since I can't keep enough air in my system.
[Have you considered a musical instrument? The reason I ask is a boy in my high school band evaded respiratory therapy because he was in band therefore exercised his lungs daily and this is what it took to bring his lungs back to capacity. I just thought this may have helped. Best of luck!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxds95?context=5)|I actually play the Euphonium, and even though I shouldn't have, did four years of marching band.
[Now that you have titanium rods in you, what's keeping you from fighting crime?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxef0p?context=5)|Money, and working to get a college degree. Once I become a billionaire, I will fight crime. 
[Are you Adam Jensen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/cax9ubs?context=5)|No, and I have no idea who that is.
[Will you ever be able to have the rods removed? Are they physically acting as your ribs, our are they there to keep them from collapsing (our something along those lines\)?  Do you have ""baby sized"" ribs in your chest, since they would never grow, or have they just grown really slowly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxh103?context=5)|The usual procedure is removing them at the end of growing, and then performing a spinal fusion. However, the main doctor, who was also one of the two inventors, felt that in my case, it would be better to just leave them in. As to the baby size ribs, I don't believe so, I think the implanted ones helped to coax the others to grow, somehow.
[Does it suck trying to go through security at airports and stuff?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxaika?context=5)|Nope, never had a problem with it, even with full body scanners.
[Do you feel pain sometimes because of these rods?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/cax8pmt?context=5)|Every so often, I get random back pain which I attribute to them, and if I bend or stretch in a certain way, I can get some pain. Nothing too major though.
[Do they ever feel cold or hot? Like in the winter or in a hot shower?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxixaz?context=5)|Nope, and if they did, I could never live in Arizona like I am now.
[I know someone with metal rods attached to his spine and he can't breathe well in the cold because they contract, which fucks things up. Do you have this problem or know why you don't?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxnaqo?context=5)|I have some slight breathing problems in the cold, and I also tend to get sick in the winter.
[Bitch please!  All women have iron rods in their backs.  But seriously, what do they do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxeiex?context=5)|At this point, they're just holding everything in place as is. However, they were to stretch my chest / rib cage as the rest of my body grew.
[Do you like the song ""Titanium"" by David Guetta?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxgtfs?context=5)|NO! He is NOT Titanium!
[You have three rods in your chest... *could it be?*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxnbig?context=5)|HL3 confirmed by my body? OMG.
[What are the costs like for having to do surgeries/scans every 4-6 months? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxkud5?context=5)|A lot more now than they used to be. It was about $400 for airfare (200 for myself and my mom), staying at a hotel, rental car, food, and then all the hospital care. I know my parents paid quite a lot for me over the years. Heck, my mother actually fought the insurance companies when I was 2-3 trying to get it covered. Back more on topic, I'd say each trip was around 750-1000 total.
[I read that this is hereditary, so my question is do you plan on having children when the time comes? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxl08w?context=5)|There's a lot of questions regarding the genetics of it. I do have a girlfriend, and I definitely plan on having children with her.  
[Are you an organ donor? Will the titanium rods be donated to future space craft?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxlf32?context=5)|I am not, and I don't see them being able to reuse the titanium rods. The structural integrity wouldn't be as great after sitting inside me for hopefully at least 90 years.
[My cousin had a cavity in his chest and it was compressing his heart and lungs. He went out to Arizona to have titanium u shaped rods put into his chest which were then flipped around to essentially ""pop"" his chest cavity out. Is this something similar to what you have?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/cax90jt?context=5)|It very well could be, I'm not very sure. 
[Do you feel that you can be active in what you do, for example your hobbies, sports or at work? Or is everything too exerting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxkreg?context=5)|A lot of stuff is very exerting, and that's actually why I'm in IT. When I was little, with all my restrictions, the one thing I could do is sit in front of a computer. That's what I grew up doing, and is my way to feel like I can do something.
[I'm sorry if this question is too personal, but do you think you'll ever have kids or are you too scared of passing on your disorder?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxmxm5?context=5)|I do plan on having kids, however, I realize the unknown chance about passing this on.
[What's your favourite dinosaur? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxke0r?context=5)|Velociraptor, just because.
[What does math have to do with network security? (Not being a dick, honestly interested\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxp6xy?context=5)|Network Security is usually a ""sub-major or emphasis"" within a Computer Science program. Those tend to require Calc 2 or Calc 3. One school I looked at required Calc 2 before you even did any classes in your major, because they were mainly an engineering school.
[Gotcha. So it's more of a school requirement thing rather than something needed for the actual job? I was confused because network security in practice, in my experience, doesn't require high level math.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxr4ga?context=5)|Only if I want to hack the Gibson, then I need some high level math.
[So you dont have any ribs at all?  Your chest and sides are all, gooey, like your stomache?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caydxiv?context=5)|I actually have most of them, just missing a few.
[I have a question - how on earth do you get through airport security?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxi1se?context=5)|They are non-magnetic, thankfully.
[Was there any physical accidents or injuries caused by your titanium ribs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxlsuz?context=5)|No, but they once did some nerve damage to my left arm during surgery. 
[Sup wolverine! Appreciate the AMA! Why did your last movie blow nuts and when will you return to singing and dancing on Broadway?  P.s. You're tough as nails, titanium nails. Don't ever forget that, even if you're not the real wolverine, just a realer tougher human.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxtfo9?context=5)|I really appreciate the humor, and thank you for the kind words.
[How painful is this, and how do you cope with pain?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxso1z?context=5)|Only hurts when I do something stupid :D.
[Can you have some titanium rods put into your arms, for claw effect?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxhwr9?context=5)|I wish! As far as I know, its never been tested though.
[The courses you have to take for IT majors is beyond retarded. I have no college degree and my job title is systems/network/software engineer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxmyo1?context=5)|Want to get me an internship? lol.
[No questions but best of luck with your life.  You have endured so much for such a young person.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/cax85ip?context=5)|Thank you for that. Looking back, I honestly do not regret anything that has happened to me, as I feel I can appreciate life a bit more based on my experiences. I also have very strong religious views because of this too, it was part of how I got through everything.
[My step brother has this, and I think he is you...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxiizo?context=5)|I do believe your prince is in another castle.
[We share the same birthday and I hope you live as long as I do. (Hoping I dont kill myself doing something stupid.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxn9na?context=5)|Here's hoping!
[So you're basically Wolverine.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxhnox?context=5)|I've never been in the same room as Wolverine, so what does that say?

1hspny,14,2013-07-07,Good questions to ask someone who has a very senior position in a global company.,alandalf,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1hspny/good_questions_to_ask_someone_who_has_a_very/,"I'm currently doing a placement year (during my degree) at a very large, global, technology company (I probably shouldn't put the name here). The company offers a mentor program where employees sign up and then are assigned to an intern. I've been lucky in getting the Senior Product Manager for Europe as my mentor. I know this will be difficult without knowing the company but I would really like some ideas of good questions."
1hsp4f,80,2013-07-07,In love with my [f]riend for 17 years. 36/married/mother. Confessions &amp; details of what happened and what I want to happen...,[deleted],bisexual,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/1hsp4f/in_love_with_my_friend_for_17_years/,"I just feel like getting all of this off my chest in some fashion. I feel like writing it out will give me some release since I have been carrying these feelings for a very long time. Only two people know any of this (her and my husband) and I am tired of not discussing/acknowledging these feelings.  I don't care if anyone responds, I just really want to ""say"" all of this to let it out. I will be going into explicit detail...probably so much so as to be able to relive some of the moments as I recall them up from memory.  I will be happy to answer any questions -- I don't mind getting anonymously personal about any of the details. Ask away or just enjoy the read, FWIW. 


I am 36, female, been married for 10 years and am a mother of 3 year old twins.  My husband and I are monogamous, I have never cheated on my husband, and we are both very sexually compatible. I absolutely love sex with him, love him, love our life together, see us together forever, and all that jazz. But, I'm also in love with my female friend from high school.  And he knows it. So does she.




When I was in 8th grade, I changed schools when my parents divorced. I had to start making friends all over again from the ground up. It was hard; at my previous school, I was a part of the ""in"" crowd and had tons of friends. In the new school, I met my friend Jenn and we became instant best friends. We were inseparable until I left for college. 




High school together was a blast. We were girly girls together through-and-through. We were joined at the hip. We would have sleepovers and hang out all the time and we were both each others complete inner-circle of friends. We each had other friends -- many of the same -- but nobody was as tight as we were.



Jenn and I were always very flirtatious -- with guys...and with each other. But not so with any other girls. There was just a chemistry between us. We both knew it but never acted upon it.




Jenn has so many great attributes that I still love about her, even though I haven't seen her in 17 years. Physically: she has long blonde hair (like me), a petite frame at 5' 3"" (also like me), she has an amazing body with a tiny waist and feminine hourglass hips, has a killer smile and can convey an entire conversation with just her eyes.  Her looks make me wet alone, and how she uses those eyes...how she peers through them.  Oh, and she has FANTASTIC breasts. I was always in awe of them. I loved seeing her in her bikini when we would sit around her pool. She would lay out for hours and I loved staring at her and those womanly breasts and tiny waist from behind my sunglasses. I think she always knew I was checking her out...as she seemed to coyly play it up, for my enjoyment. Her boobs have got to be cup size C or D. Mine are a small A (IF that) which is probably why I loved hers so much (since I felt like mine never 'came in'...and I still feel that way).  





She's overtly sexual in nature. In that 'Marilyn Monroe' sort of way...she just oozes sex. I love the match in prowess that I found in her.  She was the kind of girl that you would assume was very promiscuous, because of how sexual she came off. But, she wasn't and I liked that shyness about her.  She remained a virgin until college.  (I was also sexually conservative with how many partners I had and to this day am still on only 2 hands -- though I lost my virginity at 16 and was always ""ahead"" of her in that department, not that anyone would have ever assumed that.)  





Emotionally: I loved her attitude and her personality.  She was warm and kind and funny and has a great laugh. She also had a realness or depth to her friendship that always felt genuine. But she's also moody and a little bitchy/mildly stuck-up at times. I love that too. In fact, it draws me to her more than a person that only sees rainbows and sunshine and goodness in every person they meet. (It comes off shallow.) But not Jenn. Much like in a ""Miss Piggy sort of way"" where you know she can be moody and temperamental but it draws you in even more...wanting to win her over, pull her out, and break through that temperamental moody shell of an attitude, when it appeared. I liked the challenge. Personality-wise, we just clicked symbiotically.





The extent of our ""relationship"" throughout high school was nothing more than super-best-friends with an undertone of borderline wanting to take it to the next level but neither of us did or even dare mention it. The most that ever happened was flirtatious tickle fights or gifting each other girl-next-door-but-still-sexy nightgowns from Victoria's Secret. But I think deep inside, we both knew we were very connected...but would never bring it up. Call it naïveté, nerves, shyness, or insecurity that maybe one of us was reading into it more than the other.  



After graduation, I went 3 hrs away to college and she went to the college in our hometown.  Going away to college was exciting and a new adventure that I looked forward to, but I could tell she missed me and had some jealousy of new friends I made or the new boyfriend I POURED myself into, including my attention -- that usually went to her. I missed her too. I loved seeing her when I would come home. Our reunions were always as if nothing changed. Our favorite movie was Threesome.





The summer after freshman year took her to Denver on an internship for the summer.  I don't know how it came about, but she was going to be living in an apartment out there (out on her own for the first time) and I was going to go with her. The summer was going to be a blast.  





She went out first and got an apartment and started her internship and I joined her a few weeks later. When I got to Denver, I unpacked my suitcase in her studio apartment and quickly found a job waitressing. I had a car payment to make...my newfound adult responsibilities to yield to. She would work, I would work, and we would have fun just being buds in our off hours. We would go shopping, to the movies, trek the mall scoping out hot guys...all the usual best friend stuff. I loved it. And so did she. She loved having me out there and my attention I gave to her. 






My favorite part was her studio apartment. Having no luxury of another room or even a den, we shared her bed...A full-sized black fouton which was low to the ground and instantly felt more intimate.  I secretly loved that. I had no ""agenda"", per se, but after years of being drawn to her, I was ecstatic to be by her side at night. Night after night.





It was after I had been there for only a few days when the change in our relationship was about to take place.  That summer was unusually hot or maybe we just weren't used to that dry heat. One night was almost unbearable and she didn't have A/C. We went to bed, turned off the lights, opened the windows, and laid there. It was hot. I was hot. She was hot. We were both getting sweaty.  So the covers come off. Now we are laying side by side without the tacit barrier of even just a thin sheet separating us. We were both in skimpy nightgowns. I remember navy/white polka dots for her while I was in a hot pink short number she gave me a few years earlier.  (Which I still have, by the way.)  But it was still too much on our bodies.  I don't remember which of us did it first, but after a few minutes, our clothes came off...in the name of getting cooler, of course. I think I initiated it by taking mine off first. Naturally, I said something to blame it on the heat, but secretly, my mind was racing with the possibility of how this could naturally progress and unfold.





Delicately, I tossed and turned like I couldn't get comfortable. Probably to spark conversation with her and signal I was not yet asleep (far from it). I remember her being more still. She was probably nervous. Anxious, but nervous. Nothing like this was ever mentioned between us before so we were in uncharted territories, testing the boundaries of our friendship.





I remember finally settling into a ""comfortable"" position -- facing her, laying on my side. And then there they were. Her enormous breasts glowing in the moonlight that was shining through the open window. I remember simply staring at them, like a 13 year old boy glimpsing at his first porno mag.  It took me what felt like an hour to finally muster the courage to say something to her. I asked her if I could touch them. She softly said, ""yes.""  So I did. I touched them. I caressed them. I squeezed them. I had never felt anything like them. No part of my own body had that texture. Her skin was smooth like a cross between satin and velvet. And they were soft.  Soft when I pushed them in, soft when I gently squeezed them, and had an alluring weight when I moved them. It seemed like they were filled with feathers from angels' wings. It was glorious. 





Then I made the next move. I sat up for a better vantage point and to be able to use both hands. I sat beside her and she softly moaned when I touched her. Her breathing started to get slightly deeper. I instantly knew this was an experience in which we both felt a great internal release that had been building over the years as illicit sexual tension. I caressed her breasts and moved to her torso. Gently rubbing her stomach and chest and encircling her breasts from nipple to side boob.  I enjoyed every portion of them.  Then I slowly lowered myself to kiss her body. I started around her neck and slowly moved down her décolletage.





I moved over her body cautiously -- giving her ample time to stop me at any point along the way.  I softly kissed my way back up from her stomach to her neck and lingered near her ear before slowly approaching her face. I asked her if this was ok and she responded, ""yes, but don't kiss me on the lips. Those are the only parts off limits."" -- A sure fire defense mechanism, a-la the movie Pretty Woman. 




I longed to kiss her lips but totally respected her boundary. So, I worked my way south, pausing again to admire and spend time on her fantastic boobs. I kissed them, nibbled her nipples and gently sucked on different sections with my mouth. When I got close to her navel, I rubbed my hands on her stomach and down the outside of her thighs, returning upwards and teasing her on her inner thighs. I reached for her panties and slowly slid them down.  I could feel their wetness on my wrists as I took them off, which excited me even more.  I could hardly contain the excitement within me but was sure to go slow and enjoy each moment of a scenario that may never have the chance to play out again.





I lowered my lips to the mound between her legs and softly kissed her there. I breathed warmly as I passed over her clit and vulva, passing them by in absolute torture. I kissed her thighs, spread her legs apart with both hands, and lowered myself into position.  There I lay, rubbing her stomach, caressing her legs, softly kissing everywhere but THERE and gently breathing on her to silently announce I had arrived. She was moaning slightly and gently writhing. I descended my mouth to her clit and slipped out my tongue and took it into my mouth and ever so slightly sucked it and licked it. It was smooth and firm, erect with a tiny salute to pleasure. 





The sensation was surreal -- unlike anything I had ever felt on my mouth and uniquely distinct even to this day.  It didn't smell like mine but it was still 100% womanly. I was intrigued and my interest piqued even more. I moved my tongue around further and explored each fold and each lip. Her wetness mixed in my mouth. Even the juices were silky and I loved the taste of her.  I kissed and licked and nipped and then set in for a rhythm. I applied pressure to all the places I personally liked and consistently licked up and down.  I went faster and faster as her moaning increased and her breathing changed to a pant.  I alternated from time to time between a wide, flat tongue and a stiff flicker.  Then she started to cum. Her legs started to tense and she started to flinch and twitch. I burrowed in while her thighs pressed against my ears then she tightened and shook and relaxed all at once in an exhausted release.





I sat beside her lightly caressing her body and then asked her if that was ok...if she liked that. She said, ""yes, absolutely"" and that she was ""insanely tired from it all.""  It was probably 3 am and we both had to work early in the morning.  I pulled myself back up to my pillow and laid beside her and we both drifted off to sleep. 





The next morning and following days were normal just like every other day had been.  Almost as if it didn't happen. She started to get a little moody and I was getting busier at work and we suffered less time able to spend together after work.  After a few days, her moodiness turned to attitude turned to - what felt like - her pushing me away. Perhaps she was scared. Perhaps she regretted it. Perhaps we crossed a line in our friendship that it couldn't handle and we could never go back. Quickly, it became uncomfortable heightened by the insecurity questioning if it was because of the tryst...



I made the decision that our friendship was suffering and told her I had made the decision to go back to New York.  She responded with more attitude and pulled away, giving me what felt like the silent treatment in some sort of punishment: maybe for what I had initiated or maybe because I was leaving. I couldn't tell and we weren't talking about it.  I recall the day I left. She was cold and distant but hiding a pain underneath. I asked her if she was upset at me over what had happened. She said, ""no."" But added that when I get back to New York, ""don't expect our friendship to remain."" But we left it at that. I boarded the plane and we fell out of communication the rest of that summer. Perhaps she felt abandoned; perhaps I felt rejected.

1hsous,1,2013-07-07,In love with my [f]riend for 17 years. I'm 36/married/mother. Confession and details of our relationship &amp; what I want from it.,[deleted],bisexual,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/1hsous/in_love_with_my_friend_for_17_years_im/,"Long
I just feel like getting all of this off my chest in some fashion. I feel like writing it out will give me some release since I have been carrying these feelings for a very long time. Only two people know any of this (her and my husband) and I am tired of not discussing/acknowledging these feelings.  I don't care if anyone responds, I just really want to ""say"" all of this to let it out. I will be going into explicit detail...probably so much so as to be able to relive some of the moments as I recall them up from memory.  I will be happy to answer any questions -- I don't mind getting anonymously personal about any of the details. Ask away or just enjoy the read, FWIW. 


I am 36, female, been married for 10 years and am a mother of 3 year old twins.  My husband and I are monogamous, I have never cheated on my husband, and we are both very sexually compatible. I absolutely love sex with him, love him, love our life together, see us together forever, and all that jazz. But, I'm also in love with my female friend from high school.  And he knows it. 




When I was in 8th grade, I changed schools when my parents divorced. I had to start making friends all over again from the ground up. It was hard; at my previous school, I was a part of the ""in"" crowd and had tons of friends. In the new school, I met my friend Jenn and we became instant best friends. We were inseparable until I left for college. 




High school together was a blast. We were girly girls together through-and-through. We were joined at the hip. We would have sleepovers and hang out all the time and we were both each others complete inner-circle of friends. We each had other friends -- many of the same -- but nobody was as tight as we were. 



We were always very flirtatious -- with guys...and with each other. But not so with any other girls. There was just a chemistry between us. We both knew it but never acted upon it. 



Jenn has so many great attributes that I still love about her. Physically: she is my height (5' 3""), long blonde hair (also like me), has a killer smile and can convey an entire conversation with just her eyes.  Her looks make me wet alone, and how she uses those eyes...how she peers through them.  Oh, and she has FANTASTIC breasts. I was always in awe of them. I loved seeing her in her bikini when we would sit around her pool. She would lay out for hours and I loved staring at her and those womanly breasts and tiny waist from behind my sunglasses. I think she always knew I was checking her out...as she seemed to coyly play it up, for my enjoyment. Her boobs have got to be cup size C or D. Mine are a small A (IF that) which is probably why I loved hers so much (since I felt like mine never 'came in'...and I still feel that way).  




She's overtly sexual in nature. In that 'Marilyn Monroe' sort of way...she just oozes sex. I am also very sexual so I loved the match in prowess that I found in her.  She was the kind of girl that you would assume was very promiscuous, because of how sexual she came off. But, she remained a virgin until college.  (I was also sexually conservative with how many partners I had and to this day am still on only 2 hands -- though I lost my virginity at 16 and was always ""ahead"" of her in that department, not that anyone would ever assume that.)  




Emotionally: I loved her attitude and personality.  She was warm and kind and funny and has a great laugh. But she's also moody and a little bitchy/snotty at times. I love that too. Much like in a ""Miss Piggy sort of way"" where you know she can be moody and temperamental but it draws you in even more...wanting to win her over, draw her out, and break through that temperamental moody shell of an attitude, when it appeared. I liked the challenge. Personality-wise, we just clicked symbiotically.



The extent of our ""relationship"" throughout high school was nothing more than super-best-friends with an undertone of borderline wanting to take it to the next level but neither of us did or even dare mention it. The most that ever happened was flirtatious tickle fights or gifting each other girl-next-door-but-still-sexy nightgowns from Victoria's Secret. But I think deep inside, we both knew we were very connected...but would never bring it up. Call it naïveté, nerves, shyness, or insecurity that maybe one of us was reading into it more than the other.  



After graduation, I went 3 hrs away to college and she went to the college in our hometown.  Going away to college was exciting and a new adventure that I looked forward to, but I could tell she missed me and had some jealousy of new friends I made or the new boyfriend I POURED myself into, including my attention -- that usually went to her. I missed her too. I loved seeing her when I would come home. Our reunions were always as if nothing changed. Our favorite movie was Threesome.



The summer after freshman year took her to Denver on an internship for the summer, which was 3/4 of the way across the country since we were from
New York. I don't know how it came about, but she was going to be living in an apartment out there (out on her own for the first time) and I was going to go with her. The summer was going to be a blast.  



She went out first and got an apartment and started her internship and I joined her a few weeks later. When I got to Denver, I unpacked my suitcase in her studio apartment and quickly found a job waitressing. I had a car payment to make...my newfound adult responsibilities to yield to. She would work, I would work, and we would have fun just being buds in our off hours. We would go shopping, to the movies, trek the mall scoping out hot guys...all the usual best friend stuff. I loved it. And so did she. She loved having me out there and my attention I brought to her. 



My favorite part was her studio apartment. Having no luxury of another room or even a den, we shared her bed.  I secretly loved that. I had non""agenda"", per se, but after years of being drawn to her, I was ecstatic to be by her side at night. Night after night.


It was after I had been there for only a few days when the change in our relationship was about to take place.  That summer was unusually hot. One night was almost unbearable and she didn't have A/C. We went to bed, turned off the lights, opened the windows, and laid there. It was hot. I was hot. She was sweaty. We both were. So the covers come off. Now we are laying side by side without the tacit barrier of even just a thin sheet separating us. We were both in skimpy nightgowns. But it was still too much.  I don't remember which of us did it first, but after a few minutes, our clothes come off...in the name of getting cooler, of course. I think I initiated it by taking mine off first. Naturally, I said something to blame it on the heat, but secretly, my mind was racing with the possibility of how I could get this to naturally progress. 



Delicately, I tossed and turned like I couldn't get comfortable. Probably to spark conversation with her. I remember her being more still. She was probably nervous. Anxious, but nervous. Like I said, nothing like THIS was ever mentioned between us before so we were in uncharted territories, testing the boundaries of our friendship.




I remember finally settling into a ""comfortable"" position -- facing her, laying on my side. And there they were. Her enormous breasts glowing in the moonlight that was shining through the open window. I remember just staring at them, like a 13 year old boy glimpsing at his first porno mag.  It took me what felt like an hour to finally speak to her. I asked her if I could tough them. She softly said, ""yes.""  So I did. I touched them. I caressed them. I squeezed them. I had never felt anything like them. No part of my own body had that texture. Her skin was smooth like a cross between satin and velvet. And they were soft.  Soft when I pushed them in, soft when I gently squeezed them. It seemed like they were filled with feathers from angels' wings. It was glorious. 



Then I made the next move. I sat up for a better vantage point and to be able to use both hands. I sat beside her and she softly moaned when I touched her. Her breathing started to get slightly deeper. I instantly knew this was an experience in which we both felt a great internal release. I caressed her breasts and moved to her torso. Gently rubbing her stomach and chest and encircling her breasts from nipple to side boob.  I enjoyed every portion of them.  Then I slowly lowered myself to kiss her body. I started around her neck and slowly moved down her décolletage. 




I moved over her body cautiously -- giving her ample time to stop me at any point along the way.  I softly kissed my way back up from her stomach to her neck and slowly approached her face. I asked her of this was ok and she responded, ""yes, but don't kiss me on the lips. Those are the only parts off limits.""  (While that may seem odd, it was in-line for the times, as Pretty Woman was a prominent movie at the time and we watched it together religiously.  In the movie, Julia Roberts, a prostitute, says it to Richard Gere, her customer, to prevent herself from falling in love with him...a definite defense mechanism.)




I longed to kiss her lips but totally respected her boundary. So, I worked my way south, pausing again to admire and spend time on her fantastic boobs. When I got close to her navel, I rubbed my hands on her stomach and down the outside of her thighs, returning on her inner thighs. I reached for her panties and slowly slid them down.  I could feel their wetness on my wrists as I took them off.  I could hardly contain my excitement within me but was sure to go slow and enjoy each moment of a scenario that may never have the chance to play out again.



I lowered my lips to her mound and softly kissed her. I breathed warmly as I passed over her clit and vulva, passing them by in absolute tease.

I want to apply for internships next summer because I know that most learning is from job experience and not school. Since companies usually start hiring for internships during fall/spring and I will basically have an empty resume (other than 2 semester of basic CS classes), and only about 50% of freshman land an internship, how can I make myself stand out among other applicants when I am going in knowing nothing? 

I plan to start teaching myself Java or Python, along with data structures. I'm not sure how far I will get with learning, but other than self-projects, what else can I do to increase the chances of getting hired somewhere? Am I being too unrealistic in expecting to get an internship as a freshman with no previous programming knowledge/experience? Should I just focus on research for the first summer?"

I was foolish and didn't have an internship during my summers at school so this is going to be my first true work experience in the field.  That being said I'm scared out of my mind that I'm not going to be up to snuff and that I will fall on my face the first week and they will regret hiring me.  Any suggestions and/or knowledge of what I should know for my first job out of college would be greatly appreciated.

* take Computer Science classes(C,C++,C#,JAVA, Data Structures, and HTML/xHTML) for a full year at my local CC, and through a nearby Universities extension program ? 

* get both Microsoft, Sun and other relevant Certificates? 

* And to keep up with industry, go over videos in [pluralsight.com](http://pluralsight.com/training) and [appdev.com](http://online.appdev.com/) ?

My leg was in a cast for almost three months. And it itched something fierce. During the time I was in it, Mr S had me do what Lou used to do, match the assignments to the agents. He said that he would be able to sort out a permaneant replacement for Lou by the time the cast is off.

I saw assignments I have never seen. There was one that required the agent to 'carve pentagrams into the skulls of freshly skinned victims and then arrange the skulls around the victims'. And for Halloween, they had to 'sacrifice three virgins on an altar'. How they found three virgins in this day and age, I have no idea.

It wasn't all bad though. Amber was still my secretary and she would visit often. I enjoyed her visits. More than a recently widowed man should I would admit.

The burnt man visited too. He was moved back into the field as an agent in my place. He told me Reap Co had backed off, but he still wore his kevlar vest. He doesn't have a secretary though. He told me he doesn't want one, not after what Mr Black did to his last one.

Anyway the day that the cast came off was a bitter sweet day. It was sweet because now I can take care of that itch. But bitter because I would miss staying away from the murder and mayhem this job comes with. It does grow on you, but even now it still unsettles me.

I turned up to the office at around 8. Amber's car was already there. I smiled. No one else was there. Unless they all carpooled with Amber.

I parked my car next to hers and went inside quickly. I hate the cold as much as I hated the snow. The blizzard last night didn't help my hatred of the white cold stuff at all.

Inside it was warm. It was always warm inside. I took the elevator up to the offices. As soon as I stepped off, Amber stood up and opened the door to my office. She winked at me.

I went into my office and she was sitting on my desk smiling at me. 'Welcome back, Mr Smith.' She picked up the files and walked over to me. 'These are for you.' There was three of them. 'I'll be at my desk if you need, assistance.' She whispered that last word in my ear. I smiled.

I sat down at my desk and opened up a file.

Name: James Connelly// Age: 66// Sex: M// Marital Status: Divorced// Dependants: 0// Debt Due By: 17 January 2013// Debt Owed: 1 Soul.

Note: Head must be removed and body placed in a seated posistion. Agent must then proceed to fill the neck with maggots and the head placed back on.

Oh great. My first assignment is one of the twisted ones I had to sign off on. My stomach already felt sick.

I stood up and opened the office door. Burnt man had arrived. Good, the team was all here. 'Grab your coats,' I said. 'We're going to uptown.'

Amber smiled, 'The Connelly assignment?' I nodded. 'Good.' She opened her desk and took out a small white plastic container. 'I already have the maggots.' 

We exited the building and got into my car. My last car, the Chrysler 300, got totaled when Lou rammed into me. Mr S was feeling generous towards me, for the work I did and for expsoing the mole, and gave me the car of my choosing. There was only one car for me. A 1965 Ford Mustang Shelby. It came in pitch black with tinted windows. I loved it.

We drove to uptown to Mr Connelly's house. It was a small estate. Obviously he came from money.

We got out of the car and I popped the trunk. Johny had outfitted me with a variety of arms and ammunition, all placed in the back. I picked up an axe. My pistol was already in its holster. Amber chose a shotgun and the burnt man went with an M4. I hid the axe under my trench coat.

I knocked on the door. Mr Connelly opened the door. 'Hello?'

'Hi Mr Connelly, I'm Mr Smith from S and Co Debt Collections and these are my interns. May we come in.'

Mr Connelly opened the door wider. 'Why of course! Come in, I have been expecting you.'

I looked at Amber and burnt man. They looked just as confused as me. But we went inside.

'Can I offer any of you coffee? Tea? Hot chocolate perhaps?' Why was he being so polite?

'No thanks, I rather just get to.business.' I said reaching in my coat.

The smile drained from Mr Connelly's face. He grabbed a fire poker and swung it at me. 'You won't be taking my soul!' He shouted.

I grabbed the fire poker and pulled it away. So he knew why we were there. Amber pushed him down and held him. I took my axe out and stood by his head. 'Thank you for choosing S and Co Debt Collections. Have a nice da-'

'Go to hell cunt!' He shouted. I smiled and brought the axe down, severing his head in one blow. His neck started squirting blood like a fountain. It got all over my shoes.

The burnt man watched the door. Me and Amber grabbed the body and out it in a chair. She then took out the white plastic container from her purse and opened it. The maggots were squirming and moving about. She tipped the entire container into the neck of Mr Connelly. I picked up the head and placed it on the body.

I put my axe away and we went back to the car. I popped the trunk and we put the weapons back. The drive back to the office took 20 minutes.

When we arrived there was a black Porcshe that I have never notices outside. We went inside the building and to my office.

Inside was a woman. She was about 5' 8'', black hair, blue eyes and a perfect hour glass figure. She was waiting for me. She said 'Hello Mr Smith. I'm Mary. I'm your new co-worker.'

'Nice to meet you Mary. But I'm sorry I already have a secretary.'

She laughed. 'Oh Mr Smith, I'm not a secretary. I'm the new assignment manager.' She walked past me out of the office. I could feel her eyes undressing me. 'I look forward to working with you,' she said as she walked past.

Amber slammed the door and said, 'I don't like her.'

Me and the burnt man looked at each other and laughed. I picked up the next file. My laughing immediately stopped.

The file had been switched. The stack Amber gave me did not have this file.

I know. This file is black. A Reap Co file.

The burnt man gave me a worried look. I returned it. The assignment had to be done. I had picked up the file.

'Another mole?' I asked the burnt man.

'I don't think so. Shes a transfer from the East Coast. They keep a close eye on their assignment managers.'

'So this must be from Mr S.'

'Has to be, hes the only one authorized to hand out black files.'

I walked to the window and looked out over the harbour. I could feel Amber and the burnt man watching me. I sighed. 'There is no other choice,' I said. I walked over to the desk. 'Lets try to do this safe.'

I opened the file.

WARNING: Reap Co File

Mutiple Souls: 5

Names: James McClary, Alex Rodgers, Jesus Rodriguez, Tyron Johnson, Micheal Mason// Age: 21, 34, 23, 22, 30// All Single// All Male// No Dependants// Debt Due By: At Agents Convience// Debt Owed: 1 Each.

Note: All are members of Reap Co and are considered Highly Dangerous. Proceed with caution. They roam together near the docks.

'Fuck!'

'What is it?' asked Amber.

'We have to kill five of them.'

'So we pick them off one by one,' said the burnt man.

'We can't, they are a team.'

'For fucks sake! This can't be done! One or two of them by themselves. But five? What the fuck is Mr S thinking?'

'We killed Reap Co agents before,' Amber said.

'Yeah, when there was one or two of them. And that was because we ambushed them.' He turned to me and said, 'or threw a body at them.' I smiled. I almost forgot about that.

'So what do we do?' asked Amber.

'We make a plan,' I said. I opened up one of the desk drawers and took out a detailed map of the docks. 

I picked up the file. 'There is a note here,'I pointed at a document in the file, 'that details their patrol.' I marked their route on the map. 'If we can ambush them here,' I marked part of their route with an X, 'at this choke point, we may have a chance. What do you think?' I asked the burnt man.

'Maybe, but we would need some heavy fire power. Reap Co started issuing full body armour last month.'

'Why?'

'Oh something about how they kept getting riddled with bullets,' he smiled devlishly.

We discussed all the details of the plan before we were statisfied.

'Right, now lets go see Johny about some heavy ordinance.'"

The burnt man visited too. He was moved back into the field as an agent in my place. He told me Reap Co had backed off, but he still wore his kevlar vest. He doesn't have a secretary though. He told me he doesn't want one, not after what Mr Black did to his last one.

Anyway the day that the cast came off was a bitter sweet day. It was sweet because now I can take care of that itch. But bitter because I would miss staying away from the murder and mayhem this job comes with. It does grow on you, but even now it still unsettles me.

I turned up to the office at around 8. Amber's car was already there. I smiled. No one else was there. Unless they all carpooled with Amber.

I parked my car next to hers and went inside quickly. I hate the cold as much as I hated the snow. The blizzard last night didn't help my hatred of the white cold stuff at all.

Inside it was warm. It was always warm inside. I took the elevator up to the offices. As soon as I stepped off, Amber stood up and opened the door to my office. She winked at me.

I went into my office and she was sitting on my desk smiling at me. 'Welcome back, Mr Smith.' She picked up the files and walked over to me. 'These are for you.' There was three of them. 'I'll be at my desk if you need, assistance.' She whispered that last word in my ear. I smiled.

I sat down at my desk and opened up a file.

Name: James Connelly// Age: 66// Sex: M// Marital Status: Divorced// Dependants: 0// Debt Due By: 17 January 2013// Debt Owed: 1 Soul.

Note: Head must be removed and body placed in a seated posistion. Agent must then proceed to fill the neck with maggots and the head placed back on.

Oh great. My first assignment is one of the twisted ones I had to sign off on. My stomach already felt sick.

I stood up and opened the office door. Burnt man had arrived. Good, the team was all here. 'Grab your coats,' I said. 'We're going to uptown.'

Amber smiled, 'The Connelly assignment?' I nodded. 'Good.' She opened her desk and took out a small white plastic container. 'I already have the maggots.' 

We exited the building and got into my car. My last car, the Chrysler 300, got totaled when Lou rammed into me. Mr S was feeling generous towards me, for the work I did and for expsoing the mole, and gave me the car of my choosing. There was only one car for me. A 1965 Ford Mustang Shelby. It came in pitch black with tinted windows. I loved it.

We drove to uptown to Mr Connelly's house. It was a small estate. Obviously he came from money.

We got out of the car and I popped the trunk. Johny had outfitted me with a variety of arms and ammunition, all placed in the back. I picked up an axe. My pistol was already in its holster. Amber chose a shotgun and the burnt man went with an M4. I hid the axe under my trench coat.

I knocked on the door. Mr Connelly opened the door. 'Hello?'

'Hi Mr Connelly, I'm Mr Smith from S and Co Debt Collections and these are my interns. May we come in.'

Mr Connelly opened the door wider. 'Why of course! Come in, I have been expecting you.'

I looked at Amber and burnt man. They looked just as confused as me. But we went inside.

'Can I offer any of you coffee? Tea? Hot chocolate perhaps?' Why was he being so polite?

'No thanks, I rather just get to.business.' I said reaching in my coat.

The smile drained from Mr Connelly's face. He grabbed a fire poker and swung it at me. 'You won't be taking my soul!' He shouted.

I grabbed the fire poker and pulled it away. So he knew why we were there. Amber pushed him down and held him. I took my axe out and stood by his head. 'Thank you for choosing S and Co Debt Collections. Have a nice da-'

'Go to hell cunt!' He shouted. I smiled and brought the axe down, severing his head in one blow. His neck started squirting blood like a fountain. It got all over my shoes.

The burnt man watched the door. Me and Amber grabbed the body and out it in a chair. She then took out the white plastic container from her purse and opened it. The maggots were squirming and moving about. She tipped the entire container into the neck of Mr Connelly. I picked up the head and placed it on the body.

I put my axe away and we went back to the car. I popped the trunk and we put the weapons back. The drive back to the office took 20 minutes.

When we arrived there was a black Porcshe that I have never notices outside. We went inside the building and to my office.

Inside was a woman. She was about 5' 8'', black hair, blue eyes and a perfect hour glass figure. She was waiting for me. She said 'Hello Mr Smith. I'm Mary. I'm your new co-worker.'

'Nice to meet you Mary. But I'm sorry I already have a secretary.'

She laughed. 'Oh Mr Smith, I'm not a secretary. I'm the new assignment manager.' She walked past me out of the office. I could feel her eyes undressing me. 'I look forward to working with you,' she said as she walked past.

Amber slammed the door and said, 'I don't like her.'

Me and the burnt man looked at each other and laughed. I picked up the next file."

We have the same birthday. Do you remember the first time we celebrated it together? Our new friends as freshmen threw us a surprise party at the park by your house. 

You didn't like me then. But gradually I fell in love with you. Gradually you did too. Every small thing felt like it led to a bigger thing. Every anniversary, Christmas, birthday, Valentine's day. Every moment you interacted with my family, every moment I spoke to your dad, it felt like it was going somewhere. 

Last year, we didn't spend our birthday together. Instead, I was across the country at my internship. I wanted to make it up to you this year. I wanted to take you to Duluth or Chicago. A nice day, me and you. 

But I didn't get that chance. For whatever reason, among the many, you broke it off. Will you text me on that day? Will I? Or will we most likely just stare at our phones hoping one of us breaks. 

In the end, were separated for a reason. I'm broken, but I'm better. "

____
In early May my wife left for a summer long internship out of state, and as recent newlyweds we made use of the last days with a little more marital fun to make up for the time we were to lose.

We were worried at first that something may have happened but she got her period around May 16, which she described as being normal. Not abnormal in any way, regular flow and color.

She has told me that her period is really late, and recently has felt some lower back pain and tiredness and some nausea. 

I'm not at all worried about infidelity at all, my main question is could she be pregnant or is it a really late period due to a change in time zones (+3 hours) and dietary habits?

Thanks!

The classes havent really gripped me, and my lack of interest lead to bad grades. I've decided that if I change my major, it would be to CS. I took an intro class last semester, and really liked the material, plus I've been learning/using Linux for the past year and love it. I pay for my tuition via Stafford loans (hooray for the fucking interest increase), but I live off campus. I would have all but one social science course and a math course to complete the core requirements, so I could focus on the major classes for the rest of my time at tech (however long that is). Ideally, I want to be a declared CS major in the fall and try to land an internship in the spring (after taking 1331) to start gaining experience. I am qualified to switch my major, and I plan to have a few github/bitbucket projects going by the start of the fall term. I think it's a sound decision, and my family does as well, but I want my peers opinions. So, am I about to be a total fucktard or save myself from a fruitless degree?

Now that I have graduated I have decided to look for a job as a software developer.  

One of my big questions is: should I put my work in production on my resume?  While it's not directly related to the industry, it does show that I've been working extensively while still in school.  I have one or two small projects/tools that I've developed to make my work in the theater easier, but nothing in terms of real development internships since 2010.  


I have a whole host of reasons that my education and experience are valuable towards other work environments, I just have to get to the interview, and that's where I feel like I have a slight disadvantage.

1hvyxc,4,2013-07-08,Pathways into CS/tech from a maths degree,cs1123,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1hvyxc/pathways_into_cstech_from_a_maths_degree/,"So in September I'm going to go into the final year of my 4 year undergraduate (MMath) mathematics degree. 
My career plan throughout uni has been to just worry about the maths at the moment and figure out a career before my final year. Well my final year is looming ahead of my now and I'm still none the wiser about what I'm going to do. 

So I've been seriously looking around these past few days, considering all the options, when 
Computers &amp; IT took my eye. I've had a bit of experience programming -- last summer I had an internship and I spent most of it VBA coding through Excel and Access. I've also done a bit of Matlab script writing during my time at uni. Not much compared to a computer science graduate, but I feel, enough for me to know that I enjoy the problem solving aspects of programming, and certainly would like to work in tech. 

Now if I am to believe these maths careers websites, I, a soon to be graduate with zero experience with C or Java or even Html, am just as employable as a Computer Science BSc. Apparently, tech companies are to be awed by my problem solving and transferable skills, and be willing to give me all necessary training (a lot) and a job, for free. 

[**TL;DR** Thinking of going into IT/tech after maths degree with minimal programming experience. Wanting to know if possible, and how.]

So questions:

* Is this true? Would I be employable into the tech industry with an MMath degree? 

* If so, where in the industry would look for maths grads? (programming/'software engineer' or not)

* If not (or as a backup if above doesn't work out), could/should I do a computer-y masters/course to help CS-ify my CV. What would I do it in, would I struggle, and where would I stand with respect to careers afterwards. I would much rather build on what I have (MMath) than starting afresh (e.g. CS BSc)


P.S. Sorry for the butchered (lack of) distinctions between tech, computer science, software engineering. If you could also broadly give an overview of how the industry runs and what jobs go where, that would be great too. "
1hvv0u,34,2013-07-08,I am not doing well academically and I need advice.,[deleted],gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1hvv0u/i_am_not_doing_well_academically_and_i_need_advice/,"In the Fall, I will be entering my 4th year in the undergraduate computer engineering program.  I was originally planning on graduating in Spring 2014, but that isn't going to happen.  Thankfully, paying tuition is not a big issue for me.  However, my issue is that I am performing poorly academically and I think it's too late to turn things around.  I'm afraid that I'm not going to graduate or I'm not going to have a chance at a job when I do graduate.  I have a cumulative GPA of 2.26 and I was placed on academic warning.  I have had to retake more classes than I can remember.  Nonetheless, I have learned quite a bit and am performing well at my internship.  I am doing the internship this summer and was told I should do 3 terms of it and make it a co-op.  I do not know if this term of internship will count though since I was placed on academic warning after I registered for the co-op permit.  I enjoy the internship and I enjoy the material related to computer engineering, but because I didn't seek help and I made poor decisions, I'm doing pretty bad.  I don't want to switch majors, I don't want to give up, and I don't want to waste my parents' money.  What should I do?  What things should I consider?  Or am I just blowing things out of proportion or letting my depression take a hold of me?  I'd appreciate it if you were respectful in your posts, I know how some of these threads turn out...

I'm a university student that grew up in Vancouver and attending school in Toronto. I'm taking a year-long internship in Korea next year and I have 4 months of free time until then.

I have been thinking long and hard for what I should do for the 4 months (August to November) and I thought that I'd travel all of Canada/USA!

I have a few places in mind of where I should go.. Like Yellowstone, and Crystal Cave (in mexico). I love seeing beautiful scenery and the reason I travel is mainly for the food. I love trying the ""under-dog"" restaurants and most of my money goes into eating good food.

I'll tell you guys a bit about myself. I like all sorts of weather, whether it be hot or cold, and my travel time is from summer to autumn. I usually travel alone and like to visit quiet places where it isn't too crowded for peace of mind. I've travelled a fair bit already but I've mostly been to the ""big cities"" like NYC, Miami, Vegas, etc.

Please suggest me places to visit :D"
1hvtar,4,2013-07-08,How varied should my references be?,diamondsfrost,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1hvtar/how_varied_should_my_references_be/,"To keep it brief, I have been at my present job for 3 years and before that, worked 1-2 internships. I was lucky to find this job so quickly, but I'm also looking to stay open to better opportunities.

As it stands, I can get two references from my present job. One is retired, the other is a present staff who has been very mentoring and encouraging. Neither were/are my direct supervisor. Would it look good or bad if I used them both? 

I have 1-2 good references from my last internship. No issues there. I intend on listing at least one of them.

The internship *prior* to that, I am iffy about. The field is completely different to my current one and I didn't get along very well with the person who agreed to provide a reference (so..not sure how many good things that person will have to say). The big boss is too busy and my other direct supervisor there has left and won't give references. And honestly, I feel like i have grown a lot since I worked there that what they can say would no longer represent me accurately. 

University references are a little stretched, since it was a few years ago.

So... would it be ok if I listed multiple references from my present job? Would it look unusual? I work with many people on different projects, but I feel like what they have to say is more 'up-to-date' than old internship references."

1hvrz0,6,2013-07-08,My girlfriend [22F] of 1.5 years has confessed feelings for my best friend after I [23M] have moved across the country to be with her,crowski,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hvrz0/my_girlfriend_22f_of_15_years_has_confessed/,"This weekend, after packing up my entire life [23M] and everything I own to move to be with her, my girlfriend [22F] dropped the bomb on me that she has developed feelings for my best friend [23M], who introduced us close to 2 years ago.


A little background: my girlfriend and I fell in love almost immediately after we met. Through the last two years, I have flown to Australia from America to be with her while she was studying abroad for a semester and chosen a job (post graduation) to be close to her while she completed her senior year. 


The original decision we made together after she found a job some 6 hours away from where I was working, was that I would relocate once she found a position. Since that decision and her moving to start her career, I have worked it out with my company to let me work remotely (fucking awesome, I love my job and company) and that I would continue with them from the new city.


With a little luck, it turned out my best friend who is in grad school got a summer internship in the same city that my girlfriend and I would be moving. While negotiating with my company, my girlfriend and best friend were spending a ton of time together being that they each did not know anyone around. And with that time, she developed feelings for my best friend. 


Fast forward to this past weekend when she reveals that she has been struggling with me moving out to be with her and after several talks and delving deeper into the situation, she explains her feelings. I immediately become upset and tell her to leave, that we are finished and I will be by her apartment to get my things the following day.


She proceeds to leave and follows up the next day telling me that she has made the biggest mistake of her life and wants to be with me. 


My best friend, meanwhile, informs me that he had known for a little while but could not be the one to tell me. He said that he is behind me 100% and when I asked if it were too much of me to ask him not to speak to her again he said without hesitation that he would do anything for me. I believe him without a shadow of doubt. 


Obviously, I still have tremendous feelings for this girl. I am lost in the confusion and do not know what to do next. My trust has been shattered for her and while I am reluctant to withdraw from her completely and move back to my previous city, I am also reluctant to try to make it work. 

How do I go about forgiving her for betraying my trust in letting feelings develop for anyone else, let alone my best friend? Do I have her sever all contact with said friend while I will still be spending time with him? To me that seems like the only logical way to go but at the same time it feels like it will create a divide in my own life that is completely unfair to myself to allow. 




**tl;dr. I uprooted my life to be with my college girlfriend (now post grad) and she informed me she has feelings for my best friend whom is completely on my side and has my back in the whole situation.** "

[Would you prefer they not check for crashes/bugs/etc and just let you do the testing yourselves? Or do you think it's a useful service that has helped in the past?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caycyaz?context=5)|I like the fact that they at least some basic testing. It forces the developers not to be lazy and let the users QA for them when it is live. It makes sure that when people buy a game, they know that it will at the very least boot without a crash :)
[Hum... Microsoft did it well with FEZ. *If you know what i mean.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayj9mo?context=5)|Haha, yes Microsoft has an ""interesting"" policy when it comes to updates. Luckily we can update TT2 on the Wii U as many times as we want to, without being charged ridiculous amounts of money. At this point I don't know Sony's update policy on the PS4, but please let it be as far away from the XBLA update policy as possible. 
[I made an alpha version and posted on newgrounds, it received very good comments from people who are able to play it and enjoyed it. But I also noticed there is a huge number of people who ignored the game. I hope its not offensive to plug it here, in case you were interested. Link to www.newgrounds.com.  So here is where I need advice from you guys, how do you play test certain genre of games? How to reach the right audience for it? Because I believe especially for inexperienced indie game developers like me, play testing really helps improve a game. Or Am I wrong? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caycya9?context=5)|We don't playtest genres to test which genre we should develop for: we simply make games that we feel are fun to play. That's why, most probably, we haven't made a FPS or an RTS. Most designers here don't like those type of games. I think it is very important to make a game that you would enjoy yourself as well.
[What do you consider an indie game? With minecraft reaching epic proportions lately and now under fire whether it is an indie game or not, I'd love to hear your opinion/definition on what an indie game is. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caycudp?context=5)|Personally I'm not too fond of the word ""indie"". It has been used too much now and I think people tend to use it as some kind of measure. ""You are indie? You are cool and make awesome games! You are not indie? The hell with you. Your games probably suck""
 |In the traditional sense, an indie developer is a developer that can independently create his own games. And independently means: without a publisher. But let's be honest; (almost) every indie developer needs to have a platform like Steam or PSN or App Store or whatever to distribute their games. In that sense I think Valve, Nintendo, Sony etc have become the new publishers. So unless you sell your own games on your website (like Mojang does), how indie are you really?
 |Question is: does it really matter? Does it matter if you're backed by a publisher or investor, by Kickstarter or by money you made from previous games? No! What matters are the games; their quality and the amount fun.

[Do you think releasing your game on the day the Steam Summer Sale starts is a good idea?  It could be easily overlooked.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayadxm?context=5)|Perhaps it is a stupid idea, perhaps it is not.

The original game was made by Mobigame.
[How was it like to work on a 'port' of a game to other platforms, then? What challenges did you guys face?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayab1d?context=5)|A LOT! The original game was fake 2D. The Steam version is completely 3D. So apart from the game-logic, we had to rewrite the rest.

Adding another Game to my Linux Library is always welcome ;\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayalkt?context=5)|We're working on a Linux Steam version of EDGE/RUSH and Toki Tori 1!

[I I got EDGE on iOS way back in 2008 when it came out. It's still my favorite iOS game!  How was it fake 3D?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caydfqt?context=5)|The game only used sprites. There wasn't a single 3D rendered object in the game :)
[How was the Potato Sack ARG set up? Was the overall structure (logo + 16 word phrase + letter for each game for phase one, then password-protected .zip files for phase 2, ""play all the games"" for phase 3\) of the game done by Valve, or did you guys contribute to that too?  What was it like making puzzles for an ARG?  Was there anything we missed? =\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayexl2?context=5)|All the ARG developers were invited by Valve to come over to come up with these ideas. So the ARG was the result of several meetings and a gazilion emails.  Working on the ARG has been the most fun for me in years!  I think there were a couple of missed clues, but we implemented fail-safe mechanisms for that, to ensure you didn't get stuck.
[As someone who developed for the GBC, what do you think of chiptune artists and others who continue to make art using those older systems?  I picked up Toki Tori in a previous Humble Bundle but I'll be buying this one as well because I enjoyed the game so much! Thanks for the cool games! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayagvx?context=5)|I don't think chiptunes and 8-bit art will ever go away. As a matter of fact, we added the EDGE and Toki Tori GBC chiptunes to this humble bundle!
[Ever went to Eindbaas in Utrecht? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayelly?context=5)|Nope. Is het wat?
[When you get an idea for a game. Do you target a specific audience? Such as age, gender,play style? I played tokitori 1 and edge and they are very different 'feels'. Edge is more mature and precision where as tokitori is just playful ad childish.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caybvoz?context=5)|TT1 just happened; we were very young when we made it and I don't think we ever heard about ""target audience"" before. I'm sure we didn't, otherwise we didn't make an overly cute puzzle game with devilish hardcore levels :)
[What engine do you use to port/create/develop your games? If multiple, which do you prefer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caybvoz?context=5)|We use our internal engine.
[Finally, would you take interns? I am greatly interested in getting my hands dirty as many other friends of mine in college. And thankfully I don't have the necessity of a full fledged salary as of yet. Win win as they say.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caybvoz?context=5)|We do take interns yes. Check out our site: [Two Tribes Jobs](http://twotribes.com/overview/cat/jobs/) So feel free to apply, but do note that we hardly hire interns from abroad. But thanks a lot for your interest!
[I haven't played your games yet, but which is your favorite from the ones you guys have developed? :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caya4lt?context=5)|Good question, for me it would be Toki Tori 2+. And I'm being honest now :)
[Hi there. Congrats on the latest Toki Tori 2, played it on the WiiU, great game. I'm a developer myself and I'm interested in knowing a couple of things. How many people worked on it?  Also what kind of tools and languages do you guys use? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayapqn?context=5)|Hi there  co-developer! :D Our core team has about 10 persons, excluding 4 audio peeps and 1 story telling guy. We write everything in C++ and use Squirrel as scripting language. But I'm sure Eelke can detail more on the tech-side!
[Hi Martin, thanks for replying.  I've been playing around with some scripting languages too and am inclined to use AngelScript. Maybe Eelke can tell more about that choice, maybe because Squirrel has no GC, but I'm just making assumptions. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayb2rb?context=5)|There is GC in Squirrel, but you can do it manually. I believe we don't use it since we're using weakrefs as much as possible. But Eelke can detail on all that stuff :D Squirrel is nice, but unfortunately it isn't as well supported as compared to other languages such as LUA or even JavaScript.
[Are any of the changes from Toki Tori 2+ going to end up back in the Wii U version? I heard Nintendo allows updates on digital games much more easily now than they did with the Wii.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caydlij?context=5)|Yes, we'll do our best to put all changes in the Wii U version as well!
[I'm referring to the player character being awfully slow, and seemingly puzzles being built around that. like the birds that grasp on to you and bring you to higher places. was very tedious for me and my sister. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caye1fw?context=5)|Too bad too hear. We always love to hear feedback and I do understand your position on this. In Toki 1 the character runs around like crazy. In Toki 2 this changed. But we did this intentionally because T2 is not the type of game to be running around like a headless chicken. It requires you to absorb your environment. Look around you. Watch the animal behavior etc. The game is much more about thinking than it is about acting. That's why we strongly felt that a fast moving protagonist was inappropriate for this type of game. 
[How did you guys get into the business of developing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayab5s?context=5)|We started working on Toki Tori GBC when Collin and I we're still living at our parents. We developed on homebrew GBC hardware in our spare time. Over 13 years ago. I'm getting old :D.
[Changing the pace here, what do you think of the new consoles that are coming out soon?  Also, what's your favorite food? Haha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayb7qc?context=5)|I personally like the Wii U and are really interested in the PS4, mainly because I already played with the dev-kit. Food: authentic italian and asian. But right now I need a pizza! :D.
[I have toki tori gbc! sorry to say i have it used. but i did purchase toki tori for steam.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caycjd3?context=5)|To be honest; back then it was all new and super exciting; there was a new world opening for us. Suddenly people played a game that we'd been working on for years. It was awesome!
[What was the vibe of making a game for gbc at the time vs. making one for anything being released now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caycjd3?context=5)|These days it is still super exciting (and sometimes scary) to create something that will be played by thousands of others, but it also tends to be more business oriented as well. We ask ourselves question such as what is our metacritic score, why isn't Kotaku covering our game, do we make enough money, what are our medium and long term goals, is our staff still happy etc. That's all part of business I guess, but personally I sometimes wish I could go back to 1999/2000 :)
[Other than Toki Tori franchise, what you guys' plan in the long run?  Will you be developing games outside your comfort zone such as non-platformer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayagmx?context=5)|We created some non-platform games in the past: Rubik's, RUSH, Swap This!, Worms Open Warfare 2. So we're always open to new ideas. But we only have one focus, which is Toki Tori 2+. Once we released that, we'll take a long deep breath and see what's next...
[Do you have any plans to create a sandbox game?  Minecraft will be a good example.  I believe any open world challenges/puzzels/adventures will be a fantastic addition to Two Tribes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayawqf?context=5)|Well, we are shipping a level-editor with Toki Tori 2+, so you are able to create your own levels. Perhaps in the (near) future we'll enable people to write their own mods/custom scripts for the game, allowing them to create their own (mini) game within the Toki Tori 2+ world. Other than that, we currently don't have any plans for a sandbox game.
[Why don't you have more tribes? Are you some kind of casual? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caybm2j?context=5)|More tribes? Well, when we started 13/14 years ago the original members were part of two demo groups. Hence the name :)
[But yeah, where do I go? I went to a club and rocked out with a bird for a little bit, that was unique, and fun.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayc20z?context=5)|Thanks for all the kudos :D After you left the club, where did you go? Are you playing a review copy?
[I think I just went back to the overworld with the bird, and yeah I'm playing a review copy.  D: Never seen Grease?! Well, after Toki Tori 2+ launches you should all celebrate by watching it :P.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caycjob?context=5)|Have you seen any golden frogs yet? Thanks for the movie tip, I'll give it a thought :)
[Don't think I have, but I'll keep an eye out for them, thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caycnwv?context=5)|No problem! If you need more help, feel free to ask!
[I really like the look of Toki Tori, and considered getting it on the Humble Bundle Weekly, but realistically I know I probably won't get chance to play it, and my wife is complaining that I'm buying too many games.  My question is... I would buy the game for about £0.40 (or $0.70\), but I'd feel guilty doing that, like it's abusing the system. Would you still want my sale, or are people that would only play this much a scourge to the system?  Also, whats the process of getting on the Humble Bundle? Do they approach you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caye8is?context=5)|It is pay what YOU want. If you think it is worth that amount or if you don't have more money to spend: no problem. You decide! We won't flame you if you buy it at a low price: it's the other way around, we're happy that you are interested in us and our games! So pay whatever you want! And I hope your wife will love our games as well :)
[Hey, will Toki Tori 2 see a Linux release (incl. Steam\) ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayaddu?context=5)|I would say: yes, but it might take some time to port.
[As an independent developer, what do you think is the hardest part of developing a game, whether it be coming up with a concept or actually following through?  What would you describe your development process as being like, as far as when you focus on gameplay, graphics, sound, etc. or do you tend to flow more naturally with each project?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caya7y2?context=5)|The hardest part? Staying within the projected timeframe! We tend to 'go with the flow'; sound/gfx/gameplay etc all flow naturally from the design.
[Thank you for the positive answer ;\) i played Toki Tori 1 and really liked it so i hope i can the second part someday to my library. (hopefully on steam ;\) \)  Is there a status on TokiTori 1 for Steam4Linux?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayak0w?context=5)|Working on it! Hopefully it'll be live in a matter of weeks (perhaps even this week!)
[When will you update TT2 for the Wii U to include the level editor? Will Wii U owners be able to share levels? Will PC owners?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayd9mz?context=5)|The Steam version will have Steam Workshop integration for level sharing from day 1. The Wii U version will follow later this year.
[Did you feel the use of Indie Bundles aided the sales of your games, not just during the period of the bundle, but afterwards as well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayaf41?context=5)|The bundles definitely aided in terms of direct sales. I'm not sure what the long term effect is though.
[I hear Nintendo is making a serious effort with the Wii U to be more developer-friendly, especially to indie developers, than other consoles. Does this match your experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayai7t?context=5)|It is definitely more developer friendly than the Wii was. They have Visual Studio integration and an awesome profiler, which really helped the development of TT2.  But from what I've seen, my bet is on the PS4 development environment. They seem to be *really* dev friendly. But... I only touched it briefly so far.
[Why are you releasing Toki Tori 2+ on the first day of the Steam Summer Sale?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caybndo?context=5)|Ha! A trick question! Sorry, cannot comment on anything related to the Steam Summer Sale. It's all up to Valve.
[Aside from your own games, what are your favorite games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caydckl?context=5)|Monkey Island(!!!), Day of the Tentacle (Maniac Mansion), Zelda Windwaker, GTA series, Resident Evil... and probably a whole bunch of other OLD games :)
[So, what's coming after Toki 2? Do you guys have anything already in the works, or is your guy's focus solely on Toki 2 right now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caycm36?context=5)|At the moment: Toki 2+. Up next (probably): Two Tribes classics (TT1, EDGE and RUSH) for Wii U and Toki Tori 2+ for PS4. We have been working on TT2+ for almost 2 years now, so we can't simply release it and move on to a next project. First we need to make sure everyone is able to enjoy TT2+ on his favorite platform.
[What system is the hardest to make games for, and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caya6xr?context=5)|The systems with the lowest specs are always the hardest to develop for in terms of technical challenges. So I've to go for the GBC 
[Does that mean the PC/Wii version was a bit easier to make than the GBC version? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayafne?context=5)|Yes.. But! If you have a system with hardly any boundaries, it is easy to keep on adding until eventually you'll hit that boundary. And then you still need to profile, tweak, optimize etc...
[What is your opinion on the Oculus Rift and do you own one? As a fellow dutchman I enjoy my Oculus Rift, but I do not have the skills to make anything with it :P.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayfcea?context=5)|I would love to play with it, but unfortunately we don't have one. 
[How would you describe the atmosphere of your office?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caybu5u?context=5)|Relaxed with a lot of humor, especially during lunch.
[A technical artist contractor from the netherlands that I used to be a roommate of spoke very fondly of his time at Two Tribes. His initials are H.H. I've heard all about the late nights, it sounds pretty satisfying to work at your studio.  So anyway, my question is how many fulltime employee's do you have and how much do you have contracted out? How many of the founders are still at the studio? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayjbho?context=5)|Hajo! Awesome, please send him my regards. We miss his weird sense of humor every day :) We have 10 people working for us, 9 FT. And we outsource all audio and Linux/Android/3DS porting work. Two of the original founders are still at Two Tribes.
[Hello, fellow game developer here.  How did you guys get started on making new IPs, as opposed to do contracted work/projects for larger companies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayafsu?context=5)|Hi there co-developer! We were kinda forced into it. Back in 2008 we finished our last work-for-hire project (Rubik's) and then it became very difficult to find new WFH projects. That's when we decided to take matters into our own hands.
[Thanks for the awesome games! Will Toki Tori be made available through the Google Play store in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caya5hi?context=5)|Toki Tori 1: yes! As a matter of fact the Android version is already part of the [Humble Weekly Sale](https://www.humblebundle.com/weekly). We need to bring the app size to below 50 MB to re-launch it on Google Play. Working on that :)
[But...app sizes can be above 50MB. Just package the extra bit into an OBB data file. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caya9p5?context=5)|I'm forward that info to the guys that make the port, thanks :D.

R.E.S.P.E.C.T! My god, did you use some kind of infinite money and infinite time cheat?
 |Why you should play Toki Tori 1 &amp; 2? Because I think they're great puzzle games that almost everyone that love puzzle games, would enjoy. And Toki 1 is now part of the [Humble Weekly Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/weekly) and Toki Tori 2+ will be launching on July 11th with a massive discount! So now you know why :)
[Any chance of giving us a hint on your next big game after toki tori 2?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caycpxk?context=5)|TT2+ price is $15. But when it's launched on the 11th on Steam, there will be a big discount. You can give yourself even more discount if you use a coupon. We'll hand out a 10% discount coupon for each Two Tribes game you own.
[Why so casual?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayfdep?context=5)|Casual? I think our puzzles are pretty hardcore :)

 |Seriously, we tend to let everyone be part of the creative process. There are no ""bosses"" in the traditional sense. We have a team that is self supporting and everyone is more of less equal. Also we always lunch together and make sure we don't push people. I think stuff like this helps.

But first I think Nintendo should release some of their system sellers to attract a bigger audience. I am really fond of the Wii U as well and I'd love to see it succeed.
[With Valve working with smaller studios alot more (CS:GO being a good example\) would you consider working with them on a project in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caykh7p?context=5)|I would love to work with them again, especially on a new project (half-life 3? :)). So if someone at Valve is reading this, please take notice :)

Find someone that can make cool art (or do it yourself). Make something original (no, another angry birds is not original). Be creative and have a lot of fun when you create the game.

I've been transferred to another school for the fall because I am a part-timer and I was hired after the start of the school year last fall. The idea of starting over again at a new school, in a field that I don't even want to be in anymore, is doubly depressing. There are a multitude of reasons that I want to leave teaching, mostly I feel like an inauthentic asshole every day because I have to ""teach to the test"" and I am mentally/emotionally exhausted all the time. I am done with being sick and sleep-deprived. I am a decent teacher and my students and coworkers like me, but I just can't do it anymore. 

I have been on several interviews (mostly through networking) for non-teaching jobs in the past 4 months, but nothing has come of it. Part of the problem is that I have a masters of teaching, which seems to disqualify me for every other job in this type of economy. In each of my past three interviews, I was asked, ""Now, *why* would you want to *leave teaching*?"" in a super antagonistic manner and I didn't have any idea how to respond! In one interview, an interviewer commented snidely, ""Wow, you have had a lot of *different* work experiences."" I am at the point where I don't get nervous for interviews anymore, but I have a hard time dealing with these two issues in particular when looking for jobs. 

Prior to this, I held an odd assortment of of part-time and temp jobs throughout high school and college--ranging from food service, to driving a ""drunk bus,"" to desk jobs involving writing. I've never been fired or anything like that--I just seem to get bored and move on, or the position gets cut. I have been working since I was 15, but I've never had a full time position. The job that gave me the most satisfaction was working as an intern at my college's art gallery, but jobs like that are pretty hard to come by these days.

Are there any former teachers out there who could give me guidance? Can anyone in general give me guidance about how to address the interview questions? Thanks!

**TL;DR** - I am a first-year teacher and desperately want to find a non-teaching job. Can you offer any advice or describe your travails as teacher/education major job-seeker?"

- How's the public transport (I won't have a car)?

- How's the social scene? Any recommended hangouts?

After next spring I will have completed most of the core CS curriculum at my school including Intro Programming, Discrete Math, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Computer Systems, along with electives such as Theory of Computation and Linear Algebra. I do enjoy a lot of the CS theory that I have learned thus far, and so I have thought a lot about grad school (master's at least) along with the caveats that come along with continuing education over looking for full time positions after graduating. Since I'll only be a sophomore next year, I assume an internship is not as essential, so I was thinking it will be alright to research with one of my professors next summer. However, what about junior or senior summer? If I decide I definitely want to get my master's, should I do as much research as possible, or still try and get internship positions? Does having research help or hurt when applying to internships and or full time positions as opposed to work experience? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. "

(1) 1% of the companies profits goes to opensource projects. This is due to the main reason that I am using mostly (almost only) opensource software. So I think it's a good way to give back. 

(2) All internships are paid. All my competing companies are using a crazy amount of unpaid internships but, considering I've been on one, I know that a paid internship is profitable either for the worker and for the company.

Here is my life,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1hu3xu/i_just_want_to_express_myself_right_now_here_is/,"I grew up in a small that I loved and still love. I have many great friends. I was born into a seemingly perfect upper middle class home: a wonderful (perfect) older sister who I have a good relationship with, a loving mom and a loving father. My mom is one of the sweetest women in the world. I love her with every bit of my heart. But no matter how sweet we looked from an outsiders perspective, I was never happy at home. My father has always had and anger problem and we didn't have a great relationship throughout childhood. Never physical abuse but a lot of verbal abuse. I know this my contradict my last sentence about him being loving. He loves me unconditionally but he cant handle himself. I grew up hating him and I still do. Throughout middle school and high school my life social life was a breeze. I'm good at everything I try. I was popular, smart, athletic, and good-looking. People would have wanted to be me. I was the starting pitcher on a state championship winning baseball team. I earned a full ride academic scholarship to a D-1 school in a nearby city all the while dating the best looking girl in my town. I just knew my life would be great as an adult. I had it all figured out. But what I didn't realize is all the hate and sadness I was suppressing in my heart. Once I got in to high school I became really close to the youth minister of my home town church. He became my best friend, my mentor, my accountability partner and basically my father figure. He held me together in a way I didn't notice at the time. He left my sophomore year and it didn't seem to affect me. 


 Sorry if that was a backtrack. I'm writing this in tears and just typing.


In my later teens I started to notice I was a little different in one aspect. Caring. I knew I was more apathetic than the usual person but I didnt know how it effected me. Everything was great so I never thought much of it. But like I said earlier, life moved on. Despite my many many fights with my father, I was ok. My life outside of my home was so enjoyable that it offset the sadness of my house. I took the scholarship to the school close to my hometown and my GF went to an out of state school she had dreamed of going to all her life. My best friends went to school close by but not my college. I was alone. My GF and I decided on a long distance relationship because we were both sure we would marry each other. My friends and I kept in touch but it wasn't the same. I made friends easily through the department I received my scholarship from, but I never got too close to them. Although we had very similar interests, we were very different. Throughout the transition of everything I lost sight of life. I was overcome with a darkness that I didn't realize. There was no more uplifting happiness. There was no more best friends, perfect GF around all the time, loving hobbies like sports. It was just me, some strangers, and school. If I was normal I'm sure this would have been no big deal and I would have adapted and survived. I didn't and I didn't know why. I failed out my first year and lost my scholarship. I didn't understand why I didn't care about anything. I couldn't grasp it. I moved back home for the summer and almost instantly was ran off by my dad's anger to my sister (now married and living in my college town) house. I stayed with her for a short time and got a paying internship with a hospital and enrolled in to another semester of school. This is where I get back on track right? Nope. I said fuck school and failed out again but somehow kept my internship. I went to work enough to pay my bills but called in a lot because they thought I was still in school. This is when my life really started going down. I started getting severely depressed. I was pathetic. All I did was sleep, eat, and play video games while wasting away all the money I saved up. Sleeping 12 hours, gaming 12 hours. That was my life. I started lying to everyone I loved to think I was doing fine but I wasn't. I lost my job and broke up with my GF shortly after. Through this time I had made 1 really good friend. One that is still my best friend. I moved back in with my parents, who had moved in to the city my sister and I were in). I wasn't happy. I started working retail full time trying to get back on track. I was doing my best to live life. I also started seeing a therapist. The therapy finally helped me realize i was depressed and the reasons why. I was able to confront my father. I thought I would be good. I went through months of crappy retail and therapy. Lived month's of absolute hatred towards life and my father but I figure I'd make it. After therapy I thought I would never be depressed again. I knew what it looked like. I thought I could just see it coming and stop. Like it was some tangible being that was easily defeated by just saying no. I was naive. I moved from that city back to my hometown to accept a nice paying job from a guy I knew. I was back. My high school friends were still there so it was like nothing changed. I worked full time and hung out. I enjoyed it. I was finally social again. I found that happiness I thought I knew in high school. But it was never really full happiness. I knew it but just covered that up. I was struggling but I was beating it. All on my own. Then one day I did something I never thought I'd do. It's probably nothing too bad, but it messed me up bad. Long story short I cussed out and yelled at some 11-12 yr old girls on my softball team I was coaching. I collapsed. I didn't know who I became. I'm an exceptionally nice person. That was never something I thought would ever happen. Where did it come from? After that night I just lied in bed for a few days. Totally down. Severely depressed again. I wanted to bad to get up and go to work or hang out with friends but I couldn't. I was back in that same dumbass routine where my mind keeps trying to push me forward but my body won't move. I get saying I don't care. I stop caring. I stop feeling. I lost that job and had to MOVE BACK IN with my parents in the other city. They knew it was serious then but life just can't  be fixed with/by them. I tried several therapists and medication but nothing worked. My parents kept insisting on therapy but I stopped wanting to go. I had been in enough therapy and it wasn't helping. They kept insisting so I started lying about me going. Every progress I made was negated by something my father would do. I got a job at a local gun store part time. I was on a decent track but not the one I wanted to be on. I got in a huge fight with my father one night and he left my mom and me. If it was just me, I'd be happy. But my mom was devastated and I cared so much about her. I knew it was my fault he left so I got down again. He eventually came back after a couple of days but whatever. My best friend left the city because he graduated college. I was alone again. All I did was work and play video games. It was hard to find other guys I connected with, so life sucked even more. Which brings me today. I was late for work today and was fired. This was my second offense. Although as sad as it was my ultimate fear was facing my parents. I told my parents about that and about not going to therapy. They're kicking me out. I'm leaving tomorrow. I'm sad and mad and I don't know what to do or how to fix my problem. I wish I knew. 

I always think about my life and where it was, what I thought it would be and where it is. I hate myself and my life. I hate the people around me. For the people who actually read this, I'm sorry if it didn't make sense or if I rambled. This is a short summary of the top of my head. I haven't written like this in a long time. Also, to give you a time reference for this roller coaster. I'm 21. A lot of things have happened in the past 3 years but nothing has changed. Thankyou

1hu23a,1,2013-07-07,Starting to lock down some certs; looking for guidance.,mistawac,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1hu23a/starting_to_lock_down_some_certs_looking_for/,"So I graduated in May with a degree in CIS (Networking Focused) and was pulled on to my internship full time as a system administrator, so life is finally starting.  I was offered a decent salary and benefits, but want to make and do more.  I'm 24 right now and my goal is to have the architect title by the time I'm 30 - I think that's attainable.  That's really all the further I want to go in IT because any further and the hands-on aspect dwindles far too quickly.  

Anyhow, I've been eyeballing some certs that I'd like to attain relatively soon.  Specifically, the MCSA.  I believe that's going to be a great stepping stone to certs for me.  I have a couple questions regarding the MCSA and certification in general:

* MCSA 2008 or MCSA 2012?  I've never even looked at 2012, so I don't really know what's different.  Is it going to be that much of a gamechanger if I get the 2008 and not the 2012?

* What material should I use to study for the MCSA?  I already have a pretty strong grasp on the majority of the Windows Server 2008 R2 fundamentals, but brushing up on everything in an organized and structured fashion will do me some good.

* A pretty broad question here: what exactly is required of an Infrastructure Architect?  I've done some reading and, due to the title being relatively new, the specifics haven't been nailed down.  I kind of figured them to be along the lines of a system admin with average/above average development knowledge in applicable languages as well as average networking fundamentals and storage understanding.  So a mix of several things with a focus on making it work well together.  Any advice here would be appreciated."
1hu122,2,2013-07-07,"Got dumped, notice of deportation and the most painful throat infection this week.",[deleted],rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1hu122/got_dumped_notice_of_deportation_and_the_most/,"Out of all these things, getting dumped is the biggest thing. I met, what I thought (and still think), my soulmate last year. She is perfect. Just everything about her is amazing. Before I met her I was pretty cynical and would've never committed to a long-distance relationship. I never believed in soulmates. I had never been in love. 

I met her last summer, weeks before I was due to emigrate to another country for a fantastic job. Honestly, I was sad to see her go but I knew I had bigger fish to fry and kinda forgot about her. But she didn't forget about me and constantly pestered me to Skype and keep in contact. I had the impression she was in love with me which I thought was crazy as I had only spent a tiny amount of time with her. Anyway, through a bit of back-and-forth via Skype and email, it turns out this girl is amazing. We couldn't be more compatible. She loves the same music, holds the same values, has the same tastes, passions and interests. Just everything about her ticks all of my boxes.

She comes to visit me this Winter and holy fuck, is there fire works! Everything just fits so perfectly. The chemistry, the bond, the compatibility. Everything was there. And the passion too! I didn't think I was ever capable of having the sex that we had. It was just amazing. Unfortunately, this came to an end. She had to leave and I had to stay. So just like before, but now we've committed ourselves to a monogamous relationship. 

Everything is going great as it was before her visit; long Skypes, daily messaging, dirty talk. That is until she has to complete an internship as part of her degree. This requires her to move to another city where she'll live with an ex. An ex that she was with for 3 years and they had only ended weeks before I met her. She's also sharing a bed with this ex but assures me nothing is going on. And I honestly do believe her because I saw how stressed she was when he was trying to get back with her. She lost all physical attraction to him before they ended it and apparently that was a big contributor to their demise.

While living with the ex, we can't Skype as much as we want. They live in a tiny bachelor so we were constantly being interrupted and sometimes he'd want to sleep when she'd be Skyping with me so we'd have to rush goodbyes etc. This just piled on so much stress that wasn't necessary. Fast forward a few weeks and with her bachelor thesis due and the culmination of her placement, we have no time to Skype. This upsets me and I try to hammer it home that with a long-distant relationship, communication is the only thing that we have. We eventually get past it and all is rosey again.

Then... she goes on holidays to visit an old friend. Apparently they aren't as close as they once were and she's really upset about that and wants nothing more than to leave. One day, she casually mentions that he doesn't even know about me. When I make an issue of that she gets upset and says I always have to pick something to fight over. This was the big fight and the result of this was 2 weeks of tortuous silent treatment that ended up with a phone call telling me that she doesn't want to be in relationship. 

True to my belief, I beg her for a Skype as I know that communication is the key and 2 weeks of no contact allowed her to build some distance from me and forget what we have. We Skyped last Sunday. It was so nice, so perfect. As it always was. Like I knew would happen, she was reminded of all the things that makes us good. How compatible we are and how well we fit together. She says she still wants her space but she really loves the good morning messages that I continue to send her etc. She talked of visiting me this August though she did ask ""what then?"" after she visited. That it would be back to where we always were, apart. 

Fast forward to midweek and I have an awfully sore throat. I put it down to my new air conditioner and forget about it. But on Thursday, it's so bad I call in sick to work. On Friday when I come in, the HR woman comes to my desk and tells me that my visa renewal has been denied over a tiny technicality and there's nothing that can be done. I have to stop working at my fantastic job in 3 weeks. So massive kick in he balls number 2. But I do see the silver lining of being able to be with my now ex. I text her the good news but I get nothing. I tried to make it sound a bit non-chalant but I think it may have come across very intense if picked up incorrectly. It was along the lines of ""Oh and my visa was declined. Free to see the world now, you're free to join."" I text her today asking would she be free to Skype and if not, let me know so I'm not waiting around. I got no reply and it's way too late where she is to be expecting anything now. So yeah... I'm at a loss of what to feel.

And to make matters worse, the sore throat from the air conditioner is actually a pretty severe case of a staph infection and I've spent the last 3 nights in and out of delirious dreams, wimpering in pain to myself and sweating my own weight in ice cold, greasy slime. I feel awful.

Here's to another sleepless night tonight, followed by another day no eating and painfully slow meetings in work. I can't even talk... or at least without it sounding as if I'm gagging on a pair of balls. I thought I had something to look forward to when I got home but now I'm right back to severe recession, no prospects and a broken heart.

Whinge, whinge, whinge... I know. But I think I can feel sorry for myself for a little while."
1htygp,6,2013-07-07,Accident prone summer student - venting,CapillarianCrest,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1htygp/accident_prone_summer_student_venting/,"I'm a second year Mechanical Engineering student, at the University of Saskatchewan. Prior to starting school, i worked for a local heavy equipment machine shop as an assistant machinist. I've returned there for summer work the past two summers. 

I have a propensity for making mistakes. Last summer I was grinding lugs off a large carrier frame when the grinder i was using (the guard had been removed. It was my responsibility to either not use it or to find and reattach the guard. I didn't think of this, instead thinking of getting the job done as quickly as possible to impress my superiors) caught and kicked back and dug into my leg, requiring 10 stitches. Later that same summer, while moving around large (around 12 foot diameter) brake arms with a forklift, i knocked one over causing some dings and marring the paint. 

This summer, while lifting a large pinion from on top of a large gear (around 1000 lbs a piece) i incorrectly rigged the pinion, causing it to flip over while lifting and hitting tooth-to-tooth with the gear. Minor damage to both, to be repaired.

After this incident, i was brought into the safety manager's office, sat down with the production manager and he, and told that they don't think i belong in a production environment. I was told that if i hadn't been remorseful, or given them any lip, they likely would've fired me on the spot. Tomorrow, i go in to talk to those two as well as my direct supervisor about what they'll be doing with me. They flat out told me I may be fired.

I have a history with this company. I love working there (or i did up until now, i'm close to throwing up from the stress/guilt). They both said they like me as a person, they just can't afford to have me in the shop being such a liability. I don't know what's going to happen. 

This is why i went back to school in the first place. I'm clumsy and accident prone. I just want to sit at a desk, to perform analysis, calculations, work out equations, create drawings and design. I don't want to be operating cranes and forklifts, because i know i'm likely to cause accidents, and i don't know how to help it. Sometimes while working with the cranes i'm so nervous something will go wrong i'm literally shaking. 

I requested at the beginning of the summer to work in the engineering department, not on the shop floor, but i was told they had no positions there and was placed in the heat treatment department. It's a dangerous environment, but I find materials science so fascinating that i was thrilled when i found out. Now i don't know what to do. 

Does anyone have advice?

I was just offered an internship for next year earlier this week. Now i don't know if that's still on the table. 

Some have advised me to be bold and state that i don't appreciate their attitude toward me and won't be seeking the internship if this is how i'm going to be treated. It was a mistake after all. But i don't think i have the footing to do that. My managers are right. I made a stupid mistake and my history makes me a liability. I probably don't belong in a production environment. 

God i just don't know what to do. The thought of jumping off a bridge crosses my mind from time to time, but it wouldn't do any good. I just want to prove that i'm useful. "
1hyzar,1,2013-07-09,How you guys like my POF/OKC description?,[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1hyzar/how_you_guys_like_my_pofokc_description/,"Here's what i'm thinking of using (20/M half black/white 5'10 165lb athletic if it matters )

""I live an extremely boring lifestyle. I work, go to school, hold a internship, and drink away my liver on a typical weekend. I spend my free time riding some silly motorcycle quickly around some curvy mountain roads. I spend approximately 5% of my week rubbing sand out of my eyes (why do I always forget my sunglasses?) because of playing volleyball. I hear the n-word about 50 times throughout the day because of the music I listen to, and also the radio needs more Bloody Beetroots. 

I blow my $$$ on during some exceptionally dull things around the world. Things like road trips, bullfighing in Spain, and nearly getting robbed at sketchy karaoke bars in some random Chinese industrial city. 

I secretly have a man crush on NPH (HIMYM, yay?) and I spend too much money on boba, in n out, and gelato. 

    *I'm really good at section* 

Apparently I'm really going at basketball... as in I recently broke my second bone ever while playing basketball... my ankle. My first broken bone? A broken ankle (the other one) playing basketball.

I'm also kind of sarcastic (if you didn't notice)

    *You should message me if...*
You're just as boring as I am""

That's all i'm going to have. Even less for POF. I've had a long profile and it's just so uninteresting for girls. I mean there must be a million other guys with a good profile like mine where they love their school, job, life, etc and do so many fun things. 

 So I'm going the more I dont give a fuck about this website/goofy/sarcastic route. I had 7 pics on I think and I'm taking most of them off and keeping a real face pic, a pic in a suit, and a beach topless photo. Because girls always say they don't want to talk to guys with shirtless photos, but fuck that because they subconsciously do, especially when he has a good bod.

1hyypa,2,2013-07-09,[need advice] What did I do wrong?,throwaway_loser1,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1hyypa/need_advice_what_did_i_do_wrong/,"A few months ago, I was hired at a local animal clinic to tech/ intern with a local vet. This vet Dr X owns the clinic and agreed to mentor me, to improve my clinical skills, to help me prepare for my clinical boards. I am a foreign vet that has been out of practice for more than 10yrs. 
From what I understood and discussed with Dr X, my job was working with Dr X on all X
's cases, and helping out with clinic chores during my downtime. Dr X worked at two locations and most days were half days. So I was not able to establish a routine with clinic chores at either location, although I did take over reception/ pharmacy during breaks, helped clean up rooms between visits etc. 
A daughter of Dr X (lets call her Y) was also working at the clinic as a tech but was supposed to be leaving soon to go to vet school. Anyhow, things were really great for the first 2 months and then suddenly got weird.
Y started coming to the clinic and taking over the cases I had been working on, with Dr X. She would discuss the case with Dr X, conveniently leaving me out of the loop, try to 'diagnose' a case and propose treatments. She would do so, without paying attention to the past history or lab work, or even what the owner wanted/ could afford. She would make changes to the chart or do follow-ups but not document it or would incorrectly document it. 
Since the chart was not updated correctly, it was hard for me to determine the progress of the animal during the most recent visit and do a proper and thorough followup. 
Her mother preferred to ignore Y's changes and basically turned a blind eye towards her behavior.
Y's behavior towards me got increasingly bizarre. If we were working together, she would follow me around trying to correct or question every move I made. She would be rude or stand-offish if I asked her for her help or opinion. Being a shy, non-confrontational dummy that I am, I just let her act this way, since all I wanted was to gain enough clinical experience to pass my boards and had no intention of competing with her. I did my best to work with Dr X and the only thing I can see is, our line of communication got increasingly strained as Y kept making in roads into our cases.
Yesterday, I was called into the office with Dr X and the practice manager (who is less manager and more ass kisser) and told that Dr X did not want to work with me. I asked Dr X what the problem was, and she said, I wasn't progressing as she wanted me to. I explained to her, that she had not indicated that I had any problems, nor did she discuss if I made mistakes. I told her, I welcomed positive feedback/ criticism as my job was to learn as much as I could from her. We had this discussion at the time of my hire, and I also explained my personality traits especially my shyness that tends to passivity in situations I don't have any active role in. 
She contended that she had not been able to mentor me the way I needed, and had not been vocal about her expectations of me. 
The practice manager then spoke up and said that other techs were complaining about me. This was curious since I got along with all of them, except Y. I asked specifically what was wrong since I prefer understanding my shortcomings and improving on them. He then gave me these reasons-
* I was giving a slightly belligerant cat some fluids and told it to 'shut up' in an exasperated manner while it was growling and hissing at me. He and Dr X both called it abusive language. 
* I called an obese animal 'overweight' and said it needed to lose weight (not in the owner's presence) and they told me, this could hurt the owner's feelings. Dr X told me a previous colleague was being sued for throwing an animal against the wall angrily. I said that while that was outright abuse, how was my name calling related, since they are two totally different instances.
* I 'rolled' my eyes when someone asked me if I entered treatment protocols into the documenting system. No date or time was given or any context. 
* I was not helping with tech chores like vacuuming or sweeping. 
* I was not following up on cases (the ones that Y made undocumented changes to!!)
These seemed really bizarre reasons to me, and the only person who I can think is responsible, is Y. 
Am I wrong in assuming that? This has made me feel really sad as I had a lot of respect for Dr X and know she is a good person at heart. I can't imagine that she would encourage her daughter Y, to act in this manner. 
Please give me some perspective.

TL;dr- Boss's daughter undermining me for past month resulting in my job loss.

I'm on the path to transfer to a target school at the end of my freshman year.

I am very intent on getting in high finance, specifically WallStreet.

I am very passionate about getting into High Finance, and I'm looking to do every thing I can to prepare myself.  Here's a list of things I have already done:

 * Researched about what field I want to go in. (IB with possible switch to Hedge Funds)
 * Networked a little, leading to me meeting a few current analysts (Boutique) and learning what their work life is like.  Also met with one Associate (WallStreet firm).
 * I've taken an Intro to Finance course (purely for myself) and an Excel course.
 *  Really worked on my financial literacy and have studied what the industry is generally like.

 -------------------------------------------------
Here's what I would like to ask:

* What are some things you wished you did as a freshman?
* What classes should I take?
* What are some things I can do to get my foot in the door?
* Any exams I could attempt or internships I could get?
* Any thing you wish you could scream at incoming employees or students?

I'm open for any advice, and can answer on anything I missed.

Thank you for any help!

I continued working in the lab as my grad student gave me the option of staying and since I had so much more free time and still enjoyed the tasks they gave me. 

However, I know better than anyone that NO ONE likes a wishy-washy person. I've now become this type of person and I really don't think I'll be successful in this lab where the PI kind of hates me and the grad student thinks I'm an indecisive fool.

My PI had given me a few days to think about it and I have to let her know today what my final decision is. Should I stay or leave? If I stay I may have the leave anyway in the middle of my sophomore year for an internship I have. If I leave, I can join another lab when I'm ready (junior year). However, I already told my grad student that I'm staying (haven't talked to the PI yet). 

I'm at a big, public university, so hopefully my negative encounter with this one PI will not effect my entry into other labs. 

I know I've made mistakes, but I want to do the right thing now. "

	While there seems to be an app for just about everything nowadays, one company is managing to stay on the creative forefront of the mobile application industry and continually pushing the boundaries of innovation and utility.  Tendy Apps has released the new must-have application for social media fanatics and casual users alike: ShadowMe for Twitter (http://bit.ly/SzKsQ5).  The concept of shadowing has become increasingly popular, especially in the professional world, where an intern can shadow an employee for a day to better gauge the occupation, company and the individual.  ShadowMe for Twitter translates this trending concept to the handheld device; this app allows you to shadow another user’s news feed and essentially see Twitter through their eyes.  Not only can this be extremely fun (and slightly creepy) by shadowing a celebrity, classmate or even an exgirlfriend, the utility of the app is paramount.  Instead of doing an overly broad Google search or getting caught looking at a LinkedIn profile, you can now shadow a future employer or business partner before a meeting to get insider information on their favorite sports teams, hobbies, comedians, news analysts, or whoever they follow on Twitter.  
	But that’s not it, ShadowMe has yet another function with its most recent release, the installment of suggested and group shadows work to categorize the vast Twitter world into comprehensive curated news feeds by subject (Music, Sports, Television, with even more specialized feeds such as Hip Hop, NBA and Breaking Bad, among countless others).  So for new and experienced users alike, content discovery has become infinitely easier: finding your new favorite Twitter account is a click away with the ShadowMe app.  The television, sports and event shadows serve to fulfill the ever-growing second screen experience.  Sure, there are hashtags, but imagine how convenient it would be to check out ShadowNYGiants while you’re watching the game or ShadowMadMen during the season finale to see the hottest buzz in real time?  The ShadowMe Team has coined their “Suggested Shadows” as “TV Channels for Twitter,” serving useful, engaging and entertaining functions simultaneously.  Also, ShadowMe is not just purely informative, with the ability to create group shadows (which have become increasingly popular among sororities, fraternities and universities), ShadowMe is now an interactive experience where you can congregate all of your frat brothers/sorority sisters/college friends into one Twitter feed.  
	The multitude of functions that ShadowMe has achieved with such a neat and simple concept is noteworthy.  The future looks promising for this young app, perhaps ShadowMe for Instagram, or maybe even Vine, regardless, hop on this now before you get caught standing in someone else’s shadow."

I'm a Junior in CpE at my University and ill soon be applying to Google for a software based internship.

I was wondering if anyone had input on getting resumes passed automated résumé screening programs (and into a human's hands) - since this is the first step obviously. How do these programs rank your résumé? 

The main question aside, what are some specific do's and donts for software resumes. It seems my Career Services department is clueless on software resumes.

Thanks.

Never had any fatlogic that actually came out of my mouth that I remember, it was all just in my head. 

&gt;Be me in college (M/21/5'11). Don't know what I weigh because I'm too scared to get on a scale.

&gt;Always been a bigger kid growing up. Not hamplanet my whole life, just jigglier than most.

&gt;Since turning 21 been packing on the pounds like I am about to hibernate

&gt;Work out ""regularly"" (meaning once a week at most)

&gt;Working out consists of me driving to the gym, trying to find a parking spot near the front, 5 minutes on the elliptical to warm up and blasting my body with 3 sets of bicep curls. Maybe some shoulder presses if I have time. Drive home. 

&gt;Reward self after I work out with a bacon cheese burger, fries, DIET betus juice and a **small** milk shake (don't want to put back on all those calories I just burned). 

&gt;FF to summer. Got an internship lined up so I gotta get some new clothes.

&gt;Mom takes me shopping (don't laugh, she paid for my clothes). 

&gt;Guy at the store ask me for my pant size. Hope and pray that whoever makes these clothes makes them big (read huge) and say 36. Pick up some size 38's ""just in case""

&gt;Try on the 38's. They don't fit. Well technically the button buttoned but I looked like I was stuffed in a sausage casing.

&gt;I'm extremely embarrassed about my size, don't want to have to ask for 40 inch pants. Tell the guy helping me that I don't like the style, leave everything in the dressing room and walk out. 

&gt;Start reading about weight loss online. 

&gt;Start eating fresher, greener, leaner.

&gt;Still too embarrassed/ashamed to step on a scale to just know the number in my own head.

&gt;Continue to eat better. Develop workout plan. Start running as well.

&gt;Feel/see body start changing. Muster up the courage to get on a scale.

&gt;212.

Now I know that is not that big in terms of this sub but it was huge to me. For some reason that 200lb milestone is not one I ever thought I would hit, much less that I had actually surpassed. 

&gt;Fuck it. Time to go to work. 

&gt;Buy a bike. Ride that bike. Every other day as soon as I get home from work that summer I rode between 20-25 miles. The other days I was hitting the gym. Rowing machine, elliptical, swimming, squats, pushups, pullups. All the good stuff. 

&gt;Start running. 1 mile, 2 miles, finally get up to running a 5k at least 3 times a week.

&gt;Start setting goals. First goal is to get to 200lbs flat. Crush that goal in the first little bit.

&gt;190? Surpassed it.

&gt;180? Weight is harder to come off now but I get there.

&gt;End summer at 175lbs. Head back to school.

&gt;Friends are shocked at what I look like. Keep telling me how proud they are of me, asking me how much I have lost and a few asked me if I became anorexic.

&gt;Even at 175 I don't look the way I wanted to so keep working out. 5k's and P90X are my things now along with continuing to eat lots of veggies and lean meat. 

&gt;Friend invites me to the lake for some holiday weekend. Decide that I can probably be at 160 by then. 

&gt;Weekend comes and I am 162. Little short of my goal but my confidence is through the roof, I've worked hard and busted my butt to get to this point so I'm off to have a great weekend.

&gt;Drinks are had, bbq is being eaten, girls are given me the eye. This is how it should be.

&gt;Too many drinks are consumed, a slip-n-slide is brought out. This will be my downfall.

&gt;Drunken slip-n-sliding commences and something goes snap in my foot. Too buzzed to care. Keep going.

&gt;Weekend ends and I go home. Foot still hurts and is a little swollen. Too bad for my foot, I have to work off the damage I did that weekend and hit my goal of 160. 

&gt;I run, my foot hurts. I get in a pushup position, foot hurts. I stand for too long, my foot hurts.

&gt;Doctor tells me I broke blah blah blah bones in my foot but waited too long to come it and it has already started to set. We can either break it again and set it correctly or just let it go and it shouldn't cause me too many problems. 

&gt;Take time off from working out. Decide that a hamburger and a pizza are good things to eat while all that you are doing now is laying around on the couch. 

&gt;Weight starts to creep up but it's not *that* much. I can work it off when my foot heals. This becomes my thinking shortly warped into full blown fatlogic.

&gt;Foot gets better, workout and eating habits do not. 

&gt;Over time my bike gets rusty, running shoes lay in the closet, workout equipment become a spot to hang my dry cleaning.

&gt;Be me 2 weeks ago when I found this sub. Realize I might not have been on the receiving end of fatlogic from someone else but I was on the receiving end from myself.

&gt;Step on the scale. 195. 

&gt;Shit.

&gt;Let's start this all over again. "

The reviews praise the tablet but is it really any good? I know I can't expect the same from it as from what I'm used now. For 89€ it seems a good deal and less of a commitment, if I decide I don't like it that much in the end (which is highly unlikely though). 

Does any of you have this tablet and can give me a short review/experience on it? In also red that the tablet would show some malfunctions on Windows 7. Is this true?

2.) They cleared up a few questions on my resume (they weren't sure if i finished college)
3.) They asked why I moved to the area- while I explained they said I talked fast but didn't act too bothered and were nice
5.) They asked about other jobs I was applying for-- I answered a few types then told them why i liked their company the best.
4.) They asked my favorite class and then went on to tell a story about a related topic
5.) They gave me a time frame in which they'd call and let me know the next step, they said i made it through the first round of resumes but they also mentioned they have previous interns and referrals they'll be interviewing

-32 Years old, attempting to start a new career. I live in the Southeast Florida area.

-Currently I am an office manager for a financial planner. I do not do anything financially related. I'm back office and marketing. 

-Just graduated with a BBA in accounting about 1 year ago, with a 4.0


My goal was/is to get my CPA. I have over 150 credit hours, and meet all requirements. I've been looking for an entry level job with a CPA firm since a little before I graduated (learned about the importance of networking &amp; meeting with recruiters fairly late). I go to every career fair, networking events...yet I have a hard time getting interviews. I know I am personable and I interview well, yet not one offer. I feel like I am stuck in a bad position. Ever firm I speak with is either looking for interns or seniors...nothing entry level. Unfortunately, I can't take an internship because I have a wife, baby, mortgage, etc...

Now back to my current job. I work for a small financial planning firm, and my boss loves me, and is doing everything possible to keep me (including a raise when he found out I was looking for other jobs). He wants me to join him as a CFP. I can't lie, while I know the basics of what he does, I know next to nothing on a deeper level of financial planning (the only finance course I took was a principles course required for the accounting degree).

I'm not sure which direction to go at this point. I feel like the CPA route, if and when I do find something, would be more financially stable, but financial planning *could* be much more lucrative and less rigid. Obviously I have no idea, and that is why I started this post.

All advice, anecdotes, sarcastic remarks are welcomed.

Also, I'm sure I'm missing a bunch of details about my situation, so feel free to ask questions.

Here's the back story: I started out at a small business college in south FL studying marketing, hated it there, transferred to a huge tech school in upstate NY, loved it there so I changed my major to information security &amp; forensics and held a 3.6 GPA. I was sexually assaulted by an RA and then sucked into an abusive relationship which also sucked me into a pretty bad bout of PTSD, depression, anxiety and pretty much screwed up my academic life. I was then suspended for poor academics and went home for a bit. I then transferred to a small Catholic school closer to home, in Philly. I hated it there, got into fights with the professors and students and ended up dropping out before they kicked me out academically because I just couldn't concentrate and focus due to the mental health issues I was having. I spotted a summer internship in DC for a computer science internship and grabbed it. I loved it. Except my PTSD did not. I ended up being admitted into Georgetown hospital for a bit at the end of my internship. So I decided I'd go home and try to get things calmed down and such, so I transferred to University of MD's online program which hasn't been very successful to me either, I just came out of Johns Hopkins hospital after more than a month's stay due to problems with depression and PTSD.

My concern here is that I seem to be spinning wheels and crashing continually, obviously wasting time and a lot of money, while I am in classes. I do very well teaching myself programming and other IT things. I was wondering if I shouldn't just drop to one or two classes a semester or just drop out, take some certifications, and search for a job that will get my foot in the door doing something I love. I have been feeling that college isn't right for me for the past year or so but everyone keeps telling me that's depression talking. What is everyone's view on this?"

However, most of my experience is in hardware testing.  Throughout the testing I was involved with a good bit of software, but it was always written to 'good enough' standards (as it was automating hardware tests).

I'd be willing to move over to software, though I'd still need to overcome the learning curve of a pure software environment.

Are there hardware opportunities in Argentina that anyone knows of. Or, How willing would a tech company there be to allow me to overcome the learning curve?

I am 22 and currently moved back to my parents’ house (dads side) for the time being after feeling intense depression at my apartment alone. I cannot say that I feel much better at home. Everything I do is constantly scrutinized. I feel like I am a 13 year old living at home. My brothers now avoid me since they know about my mental illness. My mom and I have not spoken in 8 months because my step father screamed at me in December in front of my whole family to “just fucking eat” “you’re disgusting” “stop causing your mother grief” and basically told me to get out of the house because I had anorexia and it ‘made my mom sad’. 


So now I feel faint, exhausted, depressed, and alone every day. I want to just get up and leave, but so many things are preventing that.

After clarifying, it is indeed a full time role and it would start immediately if I were to start.

This is insane opportunity for me, but I'm still in college. I'm actually in an internship currently with a non-game development related company for another month.

I'm just unsure of how to approach the situation I guess. I obviously am not in a position to say yes but this is a huge opportunity. This is something I've wanted more than anything.

Should I explain how I'm still a student in college and if there is anything I can do part time or something intern-like?  Whats the best approach for me?

EDIT:
How does this sound?

&gt;Hello again,

&gt;So before I answer the questions because I am very interested, I just wanted to inform you that I am still a student in college with 2 years until graduation.

&gt;I would be free Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday all day but I'm afraid Monday and Thursdays I would have classes starting in late August. Would I still be accommodated if I am chosen for this position? I would hate to waste your time if [company] would not accept these constraints. 

&gt;If not, would there possibly be any other part-time or internship roles available, one that might even support this QA Engineer position?

**UPDATE**:
Got a response, hopes crushed momentarily. :P
It was a mistake on their part after I sent the above message, they didn't realize from the stuff I gave them I wasn't a graduate yet. Not sure how though.

However on the other hand, the fact that they found my resume and CV at least somewhat qualified for the position gives me high hopes for next summer when I go for a second round of internship hunting. Cheers everyone who assisted and offered advice. Now if only more people got back to me when I was looking haha"
1hxrcy,12,2013-07-09,Trying to gain first-hand experience - setting up first Domain Controller,anotherpoorboy,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1hxrcy/trying_to_gain_firsthand_experience_setting_up/,"I've frequently lurked this subreddit and have picked up several useful tips, and today I've decided to finally join reddit to ask for help. I'm working a summer internship at a pretty good company as their PC Systems Specialist, but I want to learn even more during my off hours. I have access to decent hardware in my apartment and I've decided that the best way to learn about domain administration is to set up my own domain controller. However, I'm running into some issues.

Mainly, I'm getting the following warning in the Event Log from the DNS Service:


    The DNS server is waiting for Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) to signal that the initial 
    synchronization of the directory has been completed. The DNS server service cannot start until the initial 
    synchronization is complete because critical DNS data might not yet be replicated onto this domain controller.
    If events in the AD DS event log indicate that there is a problem with DNS name resolution, consider adding
    the IP address of another DNS server for this domain to the DNS server list in the Internet Protocol 
    properties of this computer. This event will be logged every two minutes until AD DS has signaled that
    the initial synchronization has successfully completed.

I've only got one server, from my understanding during setup, the DNS services and Active Directory services are all running from this single server. Active Directory is not reporting any issues, only DNS. When I try to join a virtual machine (using Hyper-V) to the domain, it cannot find it. I can, however, ping both ways (virtual to physical, physical to virtual). 

For additional information, for whatever it is worth, I only have one NIC on the server. Does this have any implications for DNS functioning? I don't have this computer connected to any networks, the NIC goes entirely unused physically, so are there any settings I need to change in the properties?

Have any of you ever set up a domain controller from scratch? I have access to Server 2008, 2008 R2, and 2012. I would personally prefer using 2008 R2 since that's what I've seen used most in the environments I've been at, but if you have more experience in something else, I'd still like to hear about it. 

....I know that is a lot of questions. But I'd love to learn more about domain administration, so any assistance that can be offered would be most appreciated. I don't expect anyone to want to hold my hand through this, but a nudge or even a semi-gentle shove in the right direction wouldn't be met begrudgingly. Thanks. :)

**Edit**
I got it working. Thanks for listening to my questions. In retrospect, this should have been a simple thing to do. I think my main issue was my misunderstanding of how virtual network adapters should be configured and how they're managed by Hyper-V, and over-complicating things (especially with DHCP, thanks for that hint, /u/ashdrewness

In the end, what it took was giving the virtual adapter on the physical machine a 10.0.2. address, and making sure that the VM had an address on the same subnet, and assigning DNS manually. 'Cause, you know, no DHCP. This was a good exercise in logic. Thanks for helping me out! I'll be sure to check out the 70-640 materials. I recently got a copy of what I think has been hailed as the bible (AKA, The Practice of System and Network Administration, Second Edition) and I'll be giving that a read during my hours not filled with sleep, work, or domain testing. If you have any suggestions for me in my endeavors, please let me know. I love learning about this stuff, and I love the challenge even if I have to ask for help once in a while. 

Thanks again, all. :)"
1hxckp,0,2013-07-09,"HELP + PSA : Do NOT take Accutane for acne, makes your muscles/joints weaker",[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1hxckp/help_psa_do_not_take_accutane_for_acne_makes_your/,"Hey r/Fitness,


First post here, not entirely sure if this is the correct subreddit either, so please redirect me at the very least.


Let me begin:


I'm a 21 year old male. On and off used to be in athletic shape.
Currently I weigh in at 190 pounds, 5' 11"". It's definitely not all muscle. Ive constantly been having cycles of weighing in at 170 fit and athletic, and then after a few months, weighing it at 190 fat and out of shape sometimes hitting 200 because I have no self control when it comes to food...repeat. Except recently it seems I can't get out of it.

------------------


* For the last 7 months, I have been taking **Accutane** for my acne which was very necessary after trying everything else (but in retrospect maybe not....read on)
I was on **Accutane, 80mg a day.** I actually only completed 5 months worth of dosage. It took 7 months because I took a few breaks in between for drinking, as well as being forgetful sometimes. I still have a month left that I do not plan to take. My acne is gone however, so I am not worried (treatment usually 5-6 months, so I can stop at 5, but 6 to be ""safe"")




* My monthly blood tests actually showed that I was pretty healthy, because I was trying to eat better as well, and work out. **However, I found it very difficult to motivate myself, as the Accutane made me lethargic. When I finally did motivate myself, I would be incredibly sore for often up to 3 days after, which meant I was working out twice a week (gym, basketball, sometimes swimming).**




* Now that I have been off it for 3 weeks, I am still finding myself to be incredibly sore. I worked out tri's/chest + deadlifts (i always do deadlifts every other day becuase I love them), 3 days later, I am still sore as FUCK, which is not normal.

----------------------

r/Fitness, can you give me any tips, or tell me anything I should know regarding getting myself back into shape, SPECIFICALLY:

**1. Strengthening my joints and muscles due to accutane damage.**

**2. Quicker recovery from workouts to combat soreness.**

**3. Fat loss, target weight to be 170 (20 pounds lost).**
 

For starters, would Animal Flex be helpful for helping my joints/muscles get stronger? Any other supplements?
Also, I drink a lot of water, and usually take 5 grams of creatine before and 1 scoop of Optimum Nutrition whey after working out.

----------------------
* I WILL be eating right, as I am currently living at home for my summer internship, and my loving parents are health nuts (my dad is 58 with a 6 pack), mom not so healthy physically but EATS very healthy.


* I AM counting my calories, in regards to the fat loss, but honestly more concerned about the joint/muscle weakness + soreness. If I can overcome that, I will naturally lose weight from exercise and eating right.

* I AM off the Accutane, so I am now a lot more energetic and motivated than usual. I also have come to realize that I haven't been taking good care of my body, and am motivated and willing to work for it, so motivation is not a problem.


AND FINALLY, as a public service announcement to other users out there contemplating going on accutane, DON'T. It is NOT worth it, unless you literally have pizza face. 


It will make you SORE, it will make you LETHARGIC, it will make you DEPRESSED, it will SLOW you down, and it will also make you SUNBURN very easily, and very DRY. 



**TL;DNR Extremely weak and sore from accutane, need help. Also DON'T take it if you are considering it**

I am currently working on starting a League of Legends club at my school and getting it into the LoL Collegiate program. I hope to host LAN parties and other related events in the future.

It was suggested I make some programs related to League and just to get familiar with programming and design. I am looking for ideas and tips. Really I am looking for the direction to go start some projects. I am not really well developed in script but going to be learning. 

So any advice and suggestions would be great. Thank you"

I've considered getting help from family, but I know once you are committed to rehab it makes buying certain supplies impossible while that history is on your record. I don't have an exact time frame of when I plan to do it, but I like the idea of at least having the option when the time comes, because my medical and criminal history is otherwise perfectly clean.

I'll just say a little bit about my situation. I'm a 21 year old male that was raised in a middle-class family and I've had a pretty good life. I've had steady jobs since I was 16, and I'm now on my junior year of university in electrical engineering, and I have a paid internship at a respected company doing software engineering. (The only thing I have going for me) I don't actually do well in school, I've failed some very important classes and fucked up my GPA, but honestly that doesn't bother me much since I don't enjoy school. I like learning about things at my own pace at home...Since I have no friends I use my money to buy electrical lab equipment and I entertain myself by building amplifiers, messing with microcontrollers, etc. So the only positive I can think of, is my loneliness has led to me spending some of my time learning about electronics, which allows me to make a pretty decent amount of money for my age.

That isn't to say I haven't wasted most of my life so far. I've spent thousands of hours playing computer games, as I've always been somewhat of a loner. I haven't even been playing games lately though, because I've been so depressed that I just go to sleep when I get off work. I recently moved into an apartment with the one friend I have and it's been going pretty well, we manage to pay rent on time and there is food in the fridge.

So I guess you could say those are the positives in my life, but let me just list a few of the negatives. I've never even touched a girl. When I see people on here bitching about breaking up with their girlfriend, I dream of even having a girlfriend to break up with. Ever since I was 13 I had kept thinking, ""next year will be it, and things will change!""....well it's 8 years later now and nothing has changed. I'm still pretty young but at this point I've accepted that if I do continue to keep living, I'll be the dreaded 40-year-old-virgin. It takes so much effort for me to even do the most simple tasks. I'm pretty much late for work every single day and some days I end up just sleeping and not even going in. I have no doubt I'll end up losing this internship soon.

What point is there in working and going to school when there is nothing else to look forward to? I've finally reached the point in my life where I can say I fucking despise electronics. I've wasted 10 years of my life playing games and busying myself with dumb bullshit on the internet, never developing relationships with anyone. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm scared to get help for reasons mentioned above....my free will would be taken away, in sense. The only thing that gives me any happiness is driving around at night by myself listening to music, dreaming of smashing my car into a brick wall...but unfortunately I never have the balls to go through with it.

1hx2mz,1,2013-07-09,I realize I am depressed. How can I stay positive?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1hx2mz/i_realize_i_am_depressed_how_can_i_stay_positive/,"Hi all.

My name is AdventurousBeaver, and I am depressed. I don't admit this to anyone, I seem a bit down lately, my family can tell, but they don't know the extent of it.

**Background**

I am 28 years old, male, graduated college 4 months ago. It took me a while to get my ass in gear and go to college. I grew up poor, abused, sheltered, and in a very strict Christian household. I moved out at age 18 because my parents were evicted; they couldn't afford rent anymore, and couldn't afford to support me and 3 younger siblings. Other people have it much worse than me, I can't pretend like I had the roughest time. I survived.

I have been looking for work for over 3 months now, zero luck. I am fortunate in that my dad found full time work again around 10 years ago, and is able to come back from bankruptcy and offer me a place to stay for free and food to eat. I am most thankful and fortunate to have family that can help me in times of need.


**Now**

I can't find work. I am a recent college grad, relatively young, very fit, decent looking (I was a greeter at Hollister, so I must be at least average), I have acceptable people skills, had a relevant internship in Marketing at a widely respected corporation, yet cannot get hired. I have applied to over a 100 jobs, had 2 interviews. One of which was at Starbucks for a barista position. No luck. I am applying everywhere and anywhere, no luck, no dice. Full time, part time, McDonalds, you name it, I can't get it.

 I have cold walked into multiple businesses, talked to managers, hit it off with them(I thought), handed my resume and asked them to get a hold of me if they are interested, that I'd love to work there, nothing has came of it.

I am a man, Business Admin/Marketing college graduate with an acceptable GPA, but student loans are coming up due soon, and I feel utterly helpless. I can't support myself, I can't provide for myself, and I am swimming in stress.

I fantasize about killing myself. I won't do it, I hope I never will, but I would love just to end this existence. My life has been full of stress and worrying about money and job security from as long as I can remember. First seeing my parents always struggle with money and jobs, and now me. I just want to make ends meet.

How do I get through this?

I want to be able to make money, to support myself, to help my younger brothers who would love to have an extra $50 bucks a month for food as they put themselves through college. And I can't.

I'm so utterly discouraged. I feel as if there is a suffocating blanket of stress around me, I can't get out of it. I have good days here and there, but it's getting worse.

I realize I have so so much to be thankful for: loving parents who help me when they can, I can borrow a car to get around if I need, I have food, clothing, a phone. I am in need of nothing for survival. And I am thankful for those things.

**TL,DR** What can I do to help myself mentally?"
1hwywp,3,2013-07-09,100 day report as pertains to relationships and Christianity,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1hwywp/100_day_report_as_pertains_to_relationships_and/,"I've been insaneo busy lately with work, so I'm doing a 100 day report instead of a 90. It’s a very long post, and I apologize, but I think it’s worth the read. I hope it gives at least one of yall the strength you need. I also want to start off by saying that this is me trashing myself. I'm not judging anybody. It's just what I've come to believe and I love you all to death. I'm not trying to convert anyone =P I've been resisting the urge to masturbate for as long as I could remember as it has always been something that brought about negative consequences. It started out as curiosity. When I was younger, it made me feel like I was failing God. I didn’t have too great of an understanding of God and spirituality, but I knew that it was not something I was supposed to be doing, but I was just a kid. I didn’t have the willpower to resist even the most trivial of things, let alone the behemoth that is puberty. As I got a bit older, I got into working out. It started with just general athletics in middle school, but got real once I got to high school and started wrestling. I guess I could mark this segment of high school as the most shaping period of time in my life. I formed the concrete friendships that would keep me in check when many others faltered. Coaches taught me that what my body wanted was bullshit, and friends taught me that I could do my own thing and still have support and a good time. I was blessed beyond belief to have such a clean cut group of friends. When my time was not occupied with wrestling, it was occupied with homework or church for the most part. As I got more and more headstrong, I began to hate the idea that my body felt like it needed something. I knew God had bigger things in mind when He made me, but I felt almost powerless towards fapping and porn. Of my own will, I was nothing. I could not do it. Plain and simple. That’s such a difficult concept to face. As an invincible teenager who prided himself on his masculinity and whose time was consumed by a sport that’s all about overcoming mental and physical thresholds, it fucking killed me. I was above average in attractiveness (nothing amazing, but a 7…maybe 8 on a good day), very nice to just about everyone, athletic, and didn’t do drugs or cuss. Girls loved that. So naturally, I had a decent amount of chick friends. Bad. Why? Because once I started breaking sexual barriers, I couldn’t keep myself from continuing to cross them, and with such a large pool of girls who were comfortable around me and also curious about guys, I kinda just went to town. To the average person, especially now that we are older, I wasn’t doing anything bad, but to a churchy kid in his junior year of high school, making out with and dry humping half of the girls he was friends with was pretty bad. It really started getting to my emotions. I ended up getting many injuries from wrestling (shit happens) and failing out of every one of my academic classes. Shit started getting real. This was the beginning of my struggle with depression. I began cutting. I would run until I passed out on the side of the street. It just wasn’t good. My parents didn’t know what the hell to do and neither did I. All the while, masturbation perpetuated the cycle. I was always a deep thinker. I always thought about life and its purpose, how things might affect others, God and what His wants for my life might be, but He kicked things into high gear. It’s amazing how hard you will cling to the very last thing you have. I can’t tell you how often suicide was on my mind. When you’re that low, it’s natural for your body to jump to any temporary release it can. I know jerking off will be bad down the road, but I can’t handle much more of now. So where does that put me? God knew I was too tough to just let go. I was standing on the edge for so long, but He never let me fall off of it. That kind of dependency only comes from pure need. I guess this point is where I can really say that my faith became my own…when I really started to think for myself and develop a personal relationship. This was by no means an end to a porn/masturbation addiction, however. Senior year comes around and I coast. I do the best I can to make it through high school and it works fine. But college. Mother fucking college. A laptop to myself and no chance of a parent walking in. Ughhh. Any sort of handle I had on the situation took the hardest damn beating. I tried a distance relationship with a high school girlfriend, but it just didn’t end up working out. Emotional pain ensues, grows, whatever. Body copes by watching chick flicks (sue me) and porn. But here’s the deal; This time around, for the first time in my life, I start thinking about what I’m taking from future relationships by raping myself with all of this selfish and perverted bullshit. I start realizing that someday, I’m going to find a girl worth marrying. I’m going to find a girl that means more to me than anything else in the world, and I won’t be able to say I truly held out for her. I know most people draw the line at sex (and I still did too), but it’s the justifications that do you in. Every compromise I made was taking joy away from the future for immediate pleasure. Every single picture I saw, every girl I hooked up with, everything I thought about while going to town on myself in the bathroom, had the chance of sticking in my mind. Whether it was for a week, or a year, I was building a bank of lustful things in the back of my head that would come up every now and then. It really hinders your thoughts when you finally do find someone you actually care about. I went two years between previously mentioned high school gf and my next relationship. As you guys know, hard mode is a bitch. It’s one thing to not jerk off when you’ve got a girlfriend to take care of things every now and then. But zero ejaculation at all? You’re freaking PRAYING for a wet dream to take away urges. Anything to make life easier right? Guys, that’s what this whole thing is about. All of us have many reasons we do this, but boil them all down, and you get something that applies to just about every area of life. The easy path is rarely the best choice. Romans 5:3-4 says, “More than that, we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope.” Easier said than done though. I will be the first person to admit that. Even after reaching these conclusions my freshman year of college, I found myself meeting a girl sophomore year that I ended up compromising almost everything with. No emotional attachment. It started out as a date, but ended up just turning into a friends with benefits deal. She had next to no sexual boundaries and I was so fed up with being single that I loosened all of mine. We did everything there was to do up to the very point of sex…thank God I was able to hold onto that. Literally INCHES away several different times, but something inside me gave me the strength I needed to hold out. Junior year rolls around and guess what? My depression kicks in full force again. I would get spurts of it here and there, but nothing so bad that it completely devastated my life like it did junior year of high school. So here I am in the same situation 4 years later, but this time, I’m on my own. I don’t have my close knit group of friends to keep me straight. I don’t have my family to come home to to support me. I’m 100% on my own. I once again couldn’t do it, and ended up having to withdraw from classes and come home. I spent my time seeing a psych, reading the Bible, and finding a healthy lifestyle for my body to stay pretty level at. I knew masturbation could single handedly send me into a several day spiral of emotional stress if I wasn’t careful, so once again, I’m trying as hard as I can to keep from doing it, just as I had ever since my last emotional breakdown, and while I could make it a week or two at a time, I couldn’t straight up hold out. Toward the end of my semester at home, I ended up talking to a girl I had met whilst country dancing about a year and a half back. That was about half a year after my last girlfriend had broken up with me and although this new girl I met was a catch, I just wasn’t emotionally ready for a relationship and although she was head over heels for me, she knew it wasn’t going to work. She ended up dating a good friend of mine (I WAS NEVER FUCKING CONSULTED) and this went on for about half a year. Long story short, this friend of mine had left to go on his Mormon mission again (I won’t bore yall with his story about having to come back from his original mission) and they decided it would be best to break up. This is where we start talking again. This is where my life starts to rebuild. I start realizing this is the real deal and I’ve grown enough as a person and have matured enough in my faith that I’m ready for this relationship to work. While I still fapped for the first few months of the relationship, I was very careful to make sure she was all I was thinking about while it happened. I still knew this wasn’t right, so I got official. I knew I needed a support group. That’s where you guys come in and that was 3 and a half months ago. Yall have helped me so much and this is the longest streak I can remember since I started jerking it way back when. That counter does wonders. I realize this whole post has been all over the place and I apologize. I just threw words on paper as they came to my mind. I could elaborate on my current relationship more, but I feel it would be fitting to just leave it at I’m certain that everything I’ve encountered in life has been God shaping me into the person I need to be for her, as well as the person God planned for me to be to do His work, whatever it may end up being. Just before school got out, I got a call from someone that used to be the youth intern at the church I grew up in. She is now the youth director at her own church and wanted me to intern for their youth program. I was planning on just staying at college, taking a class or two, and working, but this felt too much like God prodding me in a direction for me to go the other way. Anywho, I’ve been working with the kids for a month and a half or so now and love it. I already feel like I’ve made some concrete differences. But I know yall came here for benefits I’ve seen thus far from my nofap journey. So here they are as they relate to my relationship:
1. I’m less likely to look at other girls in lust

2. My girlfriend is in my dreams more often, and very rarely is there a romantic encounter with another girl

3. I’m better able to treat her with the respect she deserves

4. It makes me feel 100% committed to her and only her

5. Sex is more fun when you’re exploring it for yourself and not doing things you saw on a video (she’s my first and will be my last, so help me God)

6. We all talk about how our bodies get conditioned into loving fapping because it’s what gives us that chemical high, imagine your body getting used to your girlfriend/wife giving you that chemical high…it ups attraction tenfold

7. Where my body would normally think about random women or porn or jerking off, it now thinks about my girlfriend

Nonrelationship benefits:
1. Now that I’m not so concerned with porn and jerking off, I can focus my spiritual drives outwards and help other people more easily

2. Better gains in the weight room

3. More time to spend on other things

4. I can look at myself as a man better than I could before. It’s easier to join in conversation with other adults when I feel like I’m taking ownership of my life

TL;DR: Life story as pertains to fapping, motivation, God, the PSP was the worst fucking invention ever…lost so much sleep to that internet browser.

I have been and will continue to pray for and thank God for all of you guys. Yall are my brothers and sisters and I could not be any more grateful for what yall have done for me. Hang tough guys. Every moment of resistance to temptation is victory.

I plan to start applying and interviewing for an internship this upcoming Fall. I have a relatively strong overall GPA of 3.6, and a major specific GPA of 3.9. Having just completed my Data Structures / Algorithms course, I recently learned many new useful programming tools and concepts; as well as putting them into practice with the class programming projects (albeit, the projects were relatively basic and we were guided towards which data structures were needed to complete each task). 

While I consider myself to be an average programmer in comparison to the majority of peers in my Comp Sci courses, I'd like to really strengthen my knowledge and programming skills for the next two remaining months of summer. Not only in preparation for upcoming classes, but also for potential internship interviews.

What are some exercises or concepts I should focus on learning for the internship? I'd like to put many of the programming data structures I learned about into practice, and understand when and why they are necessary. For every five structures or methodologies, we would maybe get to program one or two of these for assignments. And to be fair, that was all we really had time for with the time allotted. My next two Comp Sci courses this semester will be Assembly Language and Software Engineering Concepts. 

TL;DR Any advice for post-Sophomore year exercises and internship preparations?

Andrews: Let's go to Laurie to get ready for this collision.  
 
Laurie: This next bout is set for one fall...  
 
*""B!tch"" by Plastacines plays as Grace Stevens steps out and holds both arms out, as if to say ""check this out."" She climbs into the ring, then leans on the turnbuckle.*  
 
Laurie: ...from Melbourne Australia...the Queen of the RWF...Grace Steeeeevens!   
 
Andrews: She looks confident  tonight.  
 
Laurie: And her opponent...  
 
*""Monster"" by Skillet plays as Alan Lightbody appears on the ramp with a soda can in his hand. The red masked Amy Lightbody trots down the ramp looking menacing as ever.*  
 
Laurie: ...from Limerick Ireland...weighing in at 310 pounds...Amy Lightbody!  
 
Slam: The door to back out for Grace is about to close.  
 
Andrews: There's no way Grace backs down.  
 
*Alan gets in the ring first, walks to Grace, and crushes the soda can right in front of her. Amy stands across the ring as Alan points to Grace while looking at his relative as exclaims ""CRUSH HER.""*  
 
DING DING DING  
 
*As the two women approach one another, Grace  bounces off the rope and lunges for a Graceful Slap and connects, but Amy no sells it, turns her head, and glares at Grace with menacing eyes.* 
 
Amy: It didn't phase her!  
 
Grace: Mother of God.  
 
*Amy boots Grace, hooks the arm atop her neck, and hoists her in the air for a suplex.*  
 
Andrews: Suspending her in the air...and more...aaaaanddd...  
 
*Amy drops Stevens with a brainbuster.  Grace begins getting up as the referee stands  behind her...and eats a mule kick to the crotch.*  
 
Slam: The head b!tch in charge strikes again!  
 
*The referee falls over as Grace slides out of the ring and grabs a steel chair. Alan Lightbody sprints over to the chair and grabs the other end. Grace and Alan begin pulling both ends of the chair back and forth.*  
 
Andrews: This rivalry is incredible.  
 
*Above them, Amy Lightbody grabs the top rope, steps over it, and drops with a splash on top of Stevens. Alan points at Grace, laughing, as Amy  grabs the chair and swings it violently onto the shoulder of the former women's champ.*  
 
Slam: Grace needs to tap out before this gets out  of control.  
 
Andrews: There is no give in that woman!  
 
*Amy tosses Grace back into the ring under the bottom rope, then slowly walks over to the steps and climbs to the top rope.*  
 
Andrews: No way! This injured the leg of Lili Lafontaine!  
 
*Amy looks to Alan.*  
 
Alan: CRUSH HER!  
 
*Amy leaps off the top rope and splashes atop Grace Stevens. A second referee slides into the ring for the cover.*  
 
ONE  
TWO  
THREE!  
 
Laurie: Here is your winner...Amy Lightbody!  
 
Andrews: The women's division is officially on notice. But what will happen in two weeks when this monster faces the entire women's roster in a battle royal?  
 
Slam: No doubt she'll steamroll every one of them.  
 
Andrews: What if everyone gangs up on her?  
 
Slam: Would you help beat her up? I wouldn't!  
 
*The Board of Director’s music plays and Mr. Tanahashi Saito, acting Chairman and head of RWF International, walks onto the stage. He straightens his tie and extends a hand as a crew member scurries out with a microphone and disappears backstage*

Saito: Greetings, RWF Universe. I have come with my promised announcement regarding RWF Gold Rush. The Board has decided to have a multiple title match!

Andrews: What?

Saito: The RWF Tag Team and RWF International Championships will both be on the line in an Elimination 3-on-3-on-3 Match! Damian Mitchell and The Blaade Brothers will face off against Joey Knight and The Stone Foundation and The Hurtsville Express with intern James Lafontaine. IF Damian Mitchell is pinned, the wrestler scoring the fall will become International Champion. The last remaining team will take home the RWF Tag Team Championships. 

*The crowd is going wild as this major announcement sinks in*

Saito: Just another reason to buy RWF Gold Rush on July 22! Please, enjoy the rest of tonight’s show.

*Mr. Saito bows lightly to the audience and turns, holding out the mic and dropping it just as another crew member dives, catching it at the last second and scrambling off the stage*

Slam: That’s insane! I can’t believe this! I… this is going to be a pain to call, isn’t it?

Andrews: I would venture so. We’ll be back right after this.

*A commercial plays for Santa With Muscles 2 starring ‘Handsome’ James Harshaw, which was the #1 movie over it’s opening weekend. Peter Travers raves ‘I I would have taken slightly less money to recommend this movie!’ Santa With Muscles 2 – Christmas just got sexy*

Andrews: Welcome back, Universe! I’m going it alone for this match as Rodney Slam is competing in the Manager’s Battle Royal, where the winner can pick a stipulation for any upcoming match. These guys will finally get a chance to channel their inner J.J. Dillons and Paul Ellerings, putting themselves on the line for their charges. Except for Rodney, who will undoubtedly try something perverted if he wins.

Laurie: The following is the Managers Over-the-top-rope Battle Royale! The winner of this match will be able to choose any stipulation for their client for a future match!

[Don't Cry For Me Argentina plays as an Alan Lightbody-sized human emerges from the back, draped in an Argentinean flag and wearing an authentic El Mondo Loco wrestling mask (available for purchase online from AlanLightbody.com!). The Iowa crowd mostly boos, though several are confused by the apparently shrinking of El Mondo Loco. Upon reaching the ring, however, all doubts as to our first entrant's identity are removed, along with the flag, revealing Alan Lightbody's near-impossibly pasty-white torso. Fireproof climbs the four corners of the ring, shouting at the audience to respect the next King of Argentina.]

[Metallica - St. Anger plays and out comes Kas, clad in a basic college-style wrestling outfit, to a mixed reaction from the crowd.]

Andrews: With Fireproof Alan Lightbody already in the ring, Kas appears to be ready and focused for this unique matchup!

[Kas enters the ring and sizes Lightbody up as Nightwish's 'Last Ride of the Day’ plays and Jim the Gaucho makes his way from the back.]

Andrews: Jim probably has the most wrestling experience from his controversial run through the Women's Division as Jamie G - but you have to wonder if psychologically he is up for this challenge, between his identity issues, and the fact that he spent a week as an eggplant.

[Jim makes his way to the ring, drawing the jeers and ridicule from the crowd. At one point, someone in the audience throws a plate of eggplant parmesan in his general direction, which is truly impressive considering that involved someone from Iowa actually wasting food. As Jim enters the ring, the music plays and Korpikilaani's 'Tapporauta' plays, drawing cheers from the crowd as Sara makes her way from the back.]

Andrews: Even though Sara is a dangerous master of submission maneuvers, she might be at a disadvantage if she can't physically throw her opponents over the top rope - tap outs will not help in this unique match!

[Sara makes her way to the ring, clad in her grey digital camo tracksuit, and coldly eyes the men already in the ring. Godsmack’s ‘I Stand Alone’ plays next as Larry emerges from the back, sporting his protective facemask, and heads for the ring]

Andrews: Up next is Larry, looking for some revenge from last week and his altercation with Sara during the Champion versus Champion match!

[Larry climbs into the ring and mouths off at Sara, who doesn’t react whatsoever, as Faith No More’s ‘Another Body Murdered’ takes over the PA, and out comes Wilikins to a mixed audience reaction.]

Andrews: The esteemed butler to the Glorious Nation of Hurtsville, Wilikins looks confident here tonight without his usual tuxedo!

[Wilikins climbs through the ropes and dismissively looks over his competition as ‘Proud Mary’ begins to play over the arena PA.]

Andrews: [touching his earpiece] I am being told that, despite her original statement to the contrary, Sister Mary Elizabeth will indeed be competing here tonight, per orders of the Board of Directors.
[A scantily-clad blonde who resembles Sister Mary Elizabeth makes her way out from the back, waving and smiling to the somewhat confused but otherwise cheering audience. The crowd’s reaction turns much more positive as she bends over to climb through the ropes, and she innocently waves hello to everyone already in the ring. Larry, Sara, and Wilikins look confused as this stranger is obviously NOT Sister Mary Elizabeth, though Lightbody doesn’t seem to notice and fumbles through his tights looking for a business card to hand her. They are all interrupted by the opening riff of Ted Nugent’s ‘Stranglehold’]

Andrews: And last, and quite likely least, is my broadcast colleague, and former wrestler himself, Rodney Slam!

[Slam confidently walks down the entrance ramp to a chorus of cheers from the Iowan audience. Shirtless, his chest hair shaved into a mushroom cloud, and sporting blue trunks, he waves to the crowd, showing off his arm tattoos and surprisingly decent physique for a retired wrestler of his age. He enters the ring and creepily eyes the Mary Elizabeth imposter. All eight entrants back away from each other, taking positions near the ropes in a rough circle, anticipating the start of the match. Head referee Tom Blanchard rolls out of the ring, and yells for the bell to be rung]

Andrews: And this match is underway!

[Immediately, Larry charges at Sara, but he is intercepted by a diving Wilikins, who tackles Larry to the mat and starts pounding away. Sara backs up a step, turns, and levels Kas with a roundhouse kick to the face. Meanwhile, Jim and Lightbody are double-teaming Slam with fists and overhead clubbing blows, dropping the announcer to his knees. The model playing the part of Sister Mary Elizabeth backs away from the action in terror, not wanting to mess up her makeup or possibly break a nail. Sara flashes her a death-stare before dropping and elbow to Kas, and grappling for an arm to break.]

[Meanwhile, one of Wilikins’ punches errantly hits Larry’s protective facemask. The belligerent butler yelps in pain, creating an opening for Larry, who gets up and headbutts Wilikins in the face, sending him reeling. Jim and Lightbody have successfully beaten Slam down, and as Jim reaches down to pick Slam up, Lightbody predictably betrays his short-lived alliance and knees Jim in the face. Jim crumples like a sack of eggplants as Lightbody celebrates, congratulating himself and trying to get the crowd to join him. The crowd does indeed begin to show a more positive reaction, however this is due to the recovering Rodney Slam, is getting to his feet behind Lightbody. The mask blocks our view of the look of Lightbody’s expression as he turns to see Slam, though whether it be surprise and fright, it is short-lived as Slam drops Lightbody with a short-arm clothesline!]

[Kas has slipped free from Sara’s grasp, though he bumps into Larry in the process, and proceeds to eat a vicious headbutt, dropping Kas to the mat. Larry again goes after Sara, but the quick Finn ducks the attack and takes Larry’s knees out from under him, dropping him face-first to the mat. Sara quickly steps over Larry, twists herself around while grabbing his ankles, and locks in a modified cloverleaf, leaning back but keeping her head on a swivel, watching the other combatants to ensure she doesn’t get snuck up upon. Meanwhile Slam has notice the commotion, finds Kas getting to his feet, and quickly grabs him, running towards the ropes, and using his momentum, throws Kas over the top rope and to the outside.]
Andrews: And our first elimination of the night, Kas is out!

[As Kas is eliminated, Rodney Slam’s attention has now been diverted to the quiet Sister Mary Elizabeth impersonator in the far corner. Slam walks slowly over to her, kicking Lightbody aside. Sister Mary-ish is disgusted by the mass of man-meat making his way over to her, though Slam, oblivious to her disgust, begins flexing and making comments about her ability handling a legend like him. Meanwhile, Jim has caught Wilikins from behind, clubbing him over the back repeatedly. Lightbody seeing the compromised position that Larry is in thanks to Sara, begins stomping on the back of Larry’s head. Confident that whatever remains of Larry’s spine is sufficiently bent, Sara releases her hold and stalks Slam from behind. As Slam rubs his magnificently hairy nipples and offers Sister Mary-ish the opportunity to join him, our Ex-Nun-Impersonator has finally had enough, jumps over the top rope, and runs away screaming that she isn’t being paid enough to deal with this.*]

Andrews: And our second elimination, Sister Mary Elizabeth? I think? Anyways she’s gone, much to the chagrin of my broadcast partner.

[Slam leans over the ropes, yelling after the object of his affection, to no avail. He doesn’t notice that Sara is now behind him, as she drops to one knee and promptly European Uppercuts him in the groin. Slam turns pale and tries to yell, but his windpipe seems to be clogged, perhaps with shock, perhaps with part of his prostate, given the force with which he was struck. He turns to see Sara, still on one knee in front of him, though she promptly grabs him, one hand in the groin, the other under an armpit, and throws him over the top rope!]

Andrews: And off the *ahem* distraction, Slam is eliminated by the Finnish Femme Fatale!

[Back in the ring, Wilikins has got the better of Jim, backing him against a corner with some hard punches to the body. Lightbody, seeing the opportunity, lays off of Larry and joins Wilikins in beating on Jim in the corner. Our valiant Former Eggplant does his best to cover up in the corner, but the beatdown is too much and he collapses to the mat. Wilikins and Lightbody pick the slumping Gaucho off the mat and try to muscle him up and over the ropes, but the imbalance between them is too much, and Lightbody is not able to match Wilikins’ natural strength advantage. They regroup and try again, only this time Lightbody drops his half of Jim and instead punches Wilikins in the head, dazing the Doctor of Butlernomics. Lightbody continues to pound away on Wilikins, though his punches seem to be doing less and less damage. Jim slowly pulls himself up by the ropes, but Larry, back on his feet, sees the easy target and charges him! Our Enigmatic Ex-Eggplant, almost on instinct, drops down, holding onto the top rope, allowing Larry’s own momentum to carry him over and out of the ring!]

Andrews: Jim’s ring experience pays off, and we’re down to four competitors!

[Jim pulls himself back up by the ropes, though he doesn’t see Sara creeping up on him. Having seen Larry’s mistake, Sara instead chooses to superkick Jim high to the jaw, the impact of which forces Jim over the top rope! But our gallant Gaucho has the wherewithal to collapse onto the ring apron, holding onto the bottom rope! The smack of boot-on-jaw has caught the attention of Fireproof Lightbody, who leaves Wilikins in the corner, shoves Sara aside, and kicks Jim in the midsection repeatedly, then stomps on the hand holding onto the bottom rope, finally forcing the Foundation’s formative flunky to the floor, eliminating him from the match.]

Andrews: Ouch, the combination of Sara and Fireproof Alan Lightbody proves to be too much for Jim the Gaucho, and we are down to three!

[Sara, not taking kindly to being cast aside, grabs Lightbody’s left arm and falls backwards, grapevining her legs around his shoulder and locking in a Flying Armbar! Lightbody, lacking the strength to support both his weight as well as Sara’s, collapses to the mat in pain. Wilikins, shaking off the cobwebs from Lightbody’s last attack, comes over and begins kicking Lightbody in the ribs, yelling at him about hitting him from behind. Sara lets the arm go, looks down at Alan, up at Wilikins. Wilikins winks at her, and both Butler and Beauty hoist the fallen Fireproof up, carry him to the ropes, and unceremoniously throw him out of the ring, missing the steel stairs by inches.]

Andrews: Wilikins and Sara working together to eliminate Alan Lightbody, and they’re the final two!

[Sara and Wilikins, breathing heavily, separate and eye each other, knowing it’s down to them. As they start to circle each other, Wilikins extends his hand as a sign of respect. Sara takes it and they shake, but as Sara tries to pull her arm away, Wilikins winks at her again, not letting go. Instead, he yanks her over to him, and picks her up into a Fireman’s Carry, carries her to the ropes, and despite Sara trying to wiggle out, Wilikins dumps her out of the ring and to the mat below, as the bell rings!]

Andrews: A little misdirection by Wilikins, and this one is over!

Laurie: Here is your winner, WILKIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNSSSSSSSS!

[Faith No More’s ‘Another Body Murdered’ plays as Wilikins celebrates in the ring, as the furious Sara walks backwards up the ramp, watching his celebration in disgust. Wilikins climbs the corners of the ring, causing a mixed but excited reaction from the crowd.]

Andrews: And with that, Wilikins earns a guaranteed stipulation of his choice for an upcoming match for either Senor Tigre, The Foiler, or a tag-team match for HvX!

1hwtju,9,2013-07-08,"[C] Pthreads: What, how and why?",HoboLS,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hwtju/c_pthreads_what_how_and_why/,"Hey! I'm actually very new to C (kind of familiar with Java), but I got an internship and I now need to learn both C and Python. 

The overall project is about GPU computing, and the major focus of my learning is on pthreads! I did some reading up, and I have the basics of C (equivalents of imports, classes, primitives, if-else and io) down, but this thread stuff is going way over my head. Can anyone explain threads vs. processes and tell me how I would structure/write basic pthreads (especially the thread library part)?

Thanks! ~Hobo"
1hwqly,2,2013-07-08,[21/m] Need a way to tell a one-night-stand-ish turned friend [20/f] that I asked out a different girl [21/f],confusedneedadvice12,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hwqly/21m_need_a_way_to_tell_a_onenightstandish_turned/,"So this is a bit confusing but I'll do my best to keep it short and get to the question.

About six months ago, I was at a college party at a friend's school about six hours away from my school (just a weekend trip). At the party, I met a girl (I'll call GIRL1) who I hit off with, she asked me back to her place, we fooled around, made out, BJ, etc. (but no full sex), and slept together. The next morning we exchanged numbers and began texting fairly regularly. We seemed to be pretty compatible, but, we only talked on the phone once, and 95% of our communication was over text.

Fast forward to this Summer. I'm now on an internship for the Summer (not at my school, but six hours in a different direction from GIRL1). I've still been texting with GIRL1 and we've started making plans for her to visit (nothing set in stone yet). It's all been friendly ""hey how was your day"" kind of stuff, no sexting or anything.

During a party in the new city, through a mutual friend, I met a different girl (GIRL2). We became friends first, but slowly realized we liked each other. After hanging out in a big group multiple times, it culminated with us making out after a different party (when we both knew for sure). We spent the entire next day together and I've never met someone so compatible with me before.

GIRL1 and I never began ""dating."" After the one-night-stand-ish, we've talked a lot, but never talked about the future or anything else. I 100% know that I get along with GIRL2 much better (and have more opportunities to see her in-person whereas GIRL1 will be in college for another 2 years and we won't be able to actually be with one another until then). So I've decided to ask out GIRL1.

My problem is this: I need a way to tell GIRL1 that we can't talk as ""potential future romantic interests"" and that if we keep talking, it'll be as friends only. Although we haven't discussed it, we've both been talking with one another obviously with the hope of maybe meeting up again in the future and seeing where things go. I don't want to hurt her feelings or be rude because obviously we've been texting with the hope of seeing each other again.

Note: I've been careful here - I have not been dating either of these girls at the same time, the first is merely a friend who I happened to have a one night stand with. The second is the girl I am interested in. I just need a way to tell the first girl we can't be more than friends now.

TL;DR - One night stand with a girl, became friends, possibly dating in the future. Met a different girl, hit off, got to know each other more slowly and better, want to ask her out. Need a way to tell the first girl that she can't visit me now and that we have to stop texting unless it's just as friends.

Thanks everyone!"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What is something about working at NASA that the average person  (someone who doesn't work at NASA\) wouldn't know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayjnr2?context=5)|That we only get less than half a cent of the federal dollar but still make it work.
 |That the work we are doing is for the benefit of all and not just for the government or military.
 |That there are a lot more women working for NASA than you would think.
 |This list could get pretty big.
[How does it feel to be on the cutting-edge of science and have 98% of the public think you get too much money? For the record, I'd like to see us quadruple NASA funding. It would just get to me after a while. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayjrri?context=5)|It makes me kinda sad. We get less than half a cent of the federal dollar in funding.
 |I could only imagine what would happen if funding was quadrupled. So many projects coming back to life ... so many jobs.
[As a follow-up, what would you like to see happen if that were to occur?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayjydx?context=5)|More funding for manned space missions. I think it is silly that we haven't gone back to the moon in over 40 years. This would then be followed by more research in future propulsion systems, because they are needed if we ever plan on exploring the rest of the solar system.
 |I would also like to see more funding for alternative energy b/c yay environment! It would be great time for breakthroughs. If only we had said funding!
[How was the interview for the internship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayhxv6?context=5)|There was no interview (surprisingly), although I've heard that NASA interviews can be intense. As in, they are not allowed to so emotion and its just a simple back and forth. No jokes, no conversation.
 |The internship is 10 weeks long.
[Is there a lot of Naruto fans at NASA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayib62?context=5)|Believe it.
[How old are you (if you do not mind me asking\) and which college did you attend as well as what discipline did you study in?  Sounds like a NASA internship is a fantastic way to start your career.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayhypx?context=5)|21, Case Western Reserve University. I am finishing my BS in Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering.
 |I'm really happy I got an opportunity at NASA and I plan to stay with them.
[Do you have an interest in space and the moon or just advanced scientific practices?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayj0bn?context=5)|I would love to work on designing future moon mission, and deep space exploration is one of my greatest passions. If anything, it would be awesome to work with future propulsion systems. That's where my interests truly are. 
[Future propulsion systems like new fuels, nuclear reactor engines? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/caynf7r?context=5)|Fission/fusion engines (nuclear) are basically the only things left to create. There are also electric propulsion but they have been around for years.
[What are some of the other jobs they put you to do as an intern? Also, how does it feel to be an intern at an important agency?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayib8g?context=5)|Interns are assigned a project by a mentor (NASA employee doing actual research) from the get go. Usually the project is related to or part of the mentors project. Some people work in wind tunnels, some with rover stuff, some with re-entry materials. The list is huge.
 |""Research and Development for the Benefit of All.""
 |It makes you feel important.
[Do the permanent employees make you get coffee for them? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayhxgp?context=5)|No, you are treated like a person with a purpose. This is why I enjoy this internship, but it can also add pressure since you feel like you have to do something important.
[Is your project related to engines what work in zero gravity? I know that fighter jets engines are capable of starting and running in 0g?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayi06f?context=5)|My project is related to regular combustion engines. Working in micro just allows us to see the effects of the electric field much clearer. Fighter jets are capable of starting in 0g, thats how that start back up when they stall out.
 |Up in space the velocities of gas in rocket nozzles are so high that E-fields will have virtually no effect on the reactions.
[How do you simulate micro-gravity in lab?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayipd4?context=5)|Micro-gravity is essentially the same as falling without the wind rushing past you. Its like being in an elevator and having the elevator fall down the shaft. The elevator blocks the rushing wind, and you are simply floating inside ... well until the eventual crash.
 |Anyway ... we simulate micro-gravity the same way, but with a drag shield instead of an elevator, and with cameras watching the test rig inside the drag shield.
 |We used to do simulations in the [vomit comet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_gravity_aircraft), but that gets expensive. 
[How tall is the air shaft?  Are there cameras onboard or something? At first I was picturing some kind of tiny rig, but I suppose it could be bigger than a breadbox?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayig4f?context=5)|There are two shafts at GRC. One is a 500 ft deep (yes, it goes underground) shaft that is vacuumed out for a 5 second drop. The test rig is then pressurized and setup in a bus (looks like a crayon) and dropped. The bus is pretty big, 3 ft at the widest and 8 ft tall?  The other shaft is 80 ft tall for a 2.2 second drop. The rigs for this are setup in a drag shield that looks like a rounded wedge. It prevent the air from rushing in and blowing at the flame while the flame just uses the static air around it to burn. Here is a picture I found of one on google: [Link to facilities.grc.nasa.gov](http://facilities.grc.nasa.gov/drop/images/1994_05818_M.jpg) 
[Wow! That's really nifty. How does it stop without obliterating itself? 5 second free fall might be fun if you don't take massive damage at the bottom, no?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayiwca?context=5)|Haha, silly me. I forgot to mention it's cushioned by a 20 ft deep pool of Styrofoam beads.
 |The shorter one uses an airbag.
[How long does it take to evacuate the shaft? Or is there some sort of airlock so that not the whole thing hast to be evacuated after inserting the rig?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/caz4isv?context=5)|The bus is loaded at the top of the shaft and then it is evacuated. It takes about an hour to take out the air.
[EDIT: Are the shafts only used for experiments with flames or also for other kinds of zero gravity experiments?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/caz4isv?context=5)|As far as I know, it has only been used for flame experiments.
[What is the most interesting project currently being worked on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayj0hm?context=5)|Well, there is talk about an asteroid capture mission in the works. Hopefully the funding for it holds.
 |There is also the [James Webb Telescope](http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/) looks like its gonna be freaking cool. 
[How difficult to get an internship or job at NASA? I've always dreamed of working there eventually but I'm scared of not being smart enough. Are they very prestigious?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/caylf11?context=5)|They don't just look for academics, but also look for passion and ability to work with others. If you are persistent your chances for getting in increase.
 |They accept people from a range of years from high school students to past 4th year undergrad seniors. Just apply, show that you are really interested and don't get yourself down. If you don't get in the first time just keep trying, heck it took me multiple tries.
[Any room for social scientists? I'd love to contribute but as a social scientist, it's tough to find opportunities to work there, even as an intern.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cays3wi?context=5)|If you are interested it is always a good idea to apply. Don't even worry about your major. Just find something interesting and that seems like something you can handle and apply.
[Is NASA very selective with their interns? What qualifications did they look for? Do you have to be at least a junior in an undergrad program to apply? Thanks for doing the AMA, I've had a lot of questions about NASA internships for a while and wasn't able to ask them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayjgi8?context=5)|I feel as though they look for decent academics, willingness to reach out, your passion for your interests, and ability to communicate/work with a team. SHOW that you are interested!
 |I've met several high school students currently interning and many sophomores/juniors. If you are interested you should apply regardless of your undergraduate status. If you don't get it the first time, just try again. I applied to many different programs and got denied from a few until I got selected so don't get bummed if you don't get it the first time.
[How's the pay?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayirbh?context=5)|Great, but the experience is amazing.
[What is the most bizarre part of working at NASA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/caylfmr?context=5)|I was taken aback on how the center is like its own entire campus. Also, you can basically walk around the center and just learn about stuff if you have free time. 
[How does the living situation work, especially if you are still in college? Do you just happen to live near your internship site? May be a dumb question, but oh well. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayk228?context=5)|Not a dumb question at all. I was lucky enough to attend college nearby and just got summer housing there.  People are very helping in helping you find a place to live and NASA sent out a lot of open apartment information. They also ask about living preferences when filling out your acceptance IIRC.
[I dont think you underst...should we tell him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayiysj?context=5)|Its the whole ""geraffe"" situation all over again.
[Computer Science major here; I've always wondered, how many programmers work at NASA? How easy/hard would it be to get a job (or internship\) writing code for a NASA project? I imagine there is a lot of scrutiny for potential programmers, since they need to develop code that runs on very expensive equipment.  There was a post on the front page recently where a little boy wrote in to NASA and they sent him some stuff back, including a NASA sticker. I thought the sticker was really cool and I would love to have one, do you know where I could get one? Are they sold to the public anywhere, or would I have to write them a letter? ;\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayj0kp?context=5)|So, I'm aware of a few computer science majors currently working there although I have no clue what they are doing (I'm sure it's super neat). CS is a huge field that basically everyone is looking for so I'm sure you wouldn't have trouble finding something here.
[What is the future of space exploration?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayotue?context=5)|NASA is currently developing ORION which will be the new Multi-Purpose crew vehicle that will lead to future human missions. Hopefully to the moon, then to mars and beyond.
 |To go to Mars and beyond, we would need to develop nuclear rockets (fission/fusion). I dunno, there is so much we could still do but these are the immediate things we could do.
[Any goals for when you graduate / full time job? I interned w/ Boeing at NASA's Redstone Arsenal in the Saturn V first stage assembly building working on the space station back when I was in college. Lots fun, but working under NASA's umbrella was pretty tough sometimes. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayjl62?context=5)|I want to get into a fellowship program or a part-time situation while I continue with graduate school. If I really like the project I work on at that time then I would consider a full time job.
 |It would be awesome if I got to work on propulsion research.
 |That internship sounds pretty awesome. Saturn V is a monster, such a cool rocket. I'm pretty jealous.  
[What is the coolest thing you have seen/done an how does one get an internship at NASA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/caylxcg?context=5)|You can get an internship from here: [Link to intern.nasa.gov](http://intern.nasa.gov)
 |I've seen some wind tunnel tests and some microgravity tests. I've also worked with dangerously large amounts of voltage. I dunno what the coolest thing is though ...

[Damn, I was hoping you would be at the JPL or Johnson.

Propulsion is one of my favorite topics. I'm pretty sure Johnson has some research, they have the Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science (ARES). Not sure how big they are with interns.
[Why was the letter dated today if the project started June 3rd? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/caym9la?context=5)|Interesting, i didnt notice that. I pulled up the letter on word and took a snapshot when I was posting this, maybe word edited it to today's date?  
[That seems pretty unprofessional of NASA. Surely they would of sent a PDF. I know Word is janky but I've never seen it change anything on a document. Especially when it should of been opened as ""view only."" ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/caymldl?context=5)|Most of the documents I actually had to sign came in pdf's through mail.

Mech engineers do a whole bunch of stuff here at GRC.
 |They can do research, testing, analysis, code work in a diverse range of categories. You could work in wind tunnels, engine work, flame analysis, re-entry vehicles, rover research. It's a really big list.

1hwjho,1,2013-07-08,Looking for a month-to-month lease starting late July.,lescoo,AustinClassifieds,https://www.reddit.com/r/AustinClassifieds/comments/1hwjho/looking_for_a_monthtomonth_lease_starting_late/,"Greetings Redditor,

I am a 22 year old Texas State student who will be looking for a place in Austin sometime in late July. I have a med/large dog, so I'm looking for a pet-friendly house that has a backyard he can roam free in. He's a big lovable goofball who is fully house trained. 

My ultimate goal is to live with my best friend, but she's currently in DC for an internship and won't be back until August. She needs time to get her shit together before we can start finding a place, so I'm looking for a place I can call home for an undetermined amount of time.

A bit about me-
I'm quirky and can be quite the introvert, but I still like to occasionally go out, be sociable, and have a good time.  I have a weird sense of humor and can have even weirder taste in movies. I avoid drama like it's the plague, so you would have none of that crap from me. I'm a decent roommate, meaning I would respect both your shit and the cleanliness of common areas. I've always paid my rent consistently and on time, so hooray!

If you have (or know of) a place that can fit my needs, please PM me! I would really appreciate it. 

Danke!"

24-year-old American girl here. I will be living in Strasbourg from September through December for an internship for my master's program. I was wondering if you folks had any recommendations on which neighborhoods to live in, which neighborhoods to stay away from, whether or not I should buy a bike, etc. I have lived in France before but in the southwest so Alsace is completely new to me! Additionally, if any of you know of anyone who is looking to rent their place for a while, that would be AMAZING.

Random question - I'm into craft beer. What is the best pub/bar for a great beer selection? After living in the Bordeaux area for a year a while ago, it boggles my mind to think that France even has decent beer. I'm assuming Alsace is a different story. 

Thanks in advance! :)"

I just started messing around with OpenCV as part of an internship I am doing, and I am falling pretty hard. Part of my program involves taking the simple x-oriented gradient of an image. My code is as follows:


int main() {

 Mat A;

  string filename;

  cin&gt;&gt;filename;

  A = imread(""/home/boyang/""+filename, CV_64F); //read in image into matrix

  int r = A.rows;

  int c = A.cols;

  cout&lt;&lt;r &lt;&lt;"" ""&lt;&lt;c;

  Mat gradx(r,c,CV_64F);

  for (int i = 0; i &lt; r-1; i++) {

    for (int j = 0; j &lt; c-1; j++) {

      gradx.at&lt;double&gt;(i,j) = A.at&lt;double&gt;(i,j+1)-A.at&lt;double&gt;(i,j); //take gradient

    }

  }

  namedWindow(""windowname"",CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE); //print image to screen

  imshow(""windowname"",gradx);

  waitKey(0);

  cvDestroyWindow(""windowname"");

}

This code will print a strange image that seems to have 3 of the originial image, but all loosely connected and in black and white. 

I know the problem is somewhere in the ""CV_64F"" part of the matrix initialization, because this code works with ""CV_8U"" and unsigned characters; however, I need my numbers to be doubles. 

I guess most of my problem is that I don't understand what the ""CV_64F"" represents. The OpenCV documentation wasn't really clear.

[Here's an original image](http://i.imgur.com/LUmfmkr.jpg)

[Here's what the above code does to that image](http://i.imgur.com/KwGD04j.jpg)

[Here's what the above code does if all the CV_64F and doubles are replaced with CV_8U and unsigned char, respectively](http://i.imgur.com/oZT0tqV.jpg)

Ultimately, my question is: Why does CV_64F squish and screw up my gradient image, and CV_8U does not?

Thanks for your time and help!"

I have plenty of time to build a project so what should I build to stand out.**

I am about to graduate and I need to know how to get a job in the CS field. I applied for internships this summer and never heard anything back. The one phone interview I had was with someone who was a recruiter and didn't understand a thing I was taking about.I feel like I struggle to present myself on a piece of paper

I ended up taking a job overseas to get some work experience because I didn't want to sit around all summer.It turned out to be more like system admin work so far rather than programming. I had to setup an SFTP server so far, not exactly the most exciting thing in the world. I did learn some bash scripting and feel more comfortable in linux because of it. VIM included lol that thing's learning curve is rough. 

Anyways my strongest languages(In order) are Java, Basic C, Python. I have dabbled in some c++, html, javascript not enough to say I know it though. I am teaching myself Haskell at the moment so I can learn more about functional programming, and I am working on my first android app. Haskell is pretty fucking cool if you haven't tried it out yet you should.

All criticism is good even if it's hurtful. I know I am doing something wrong and I really just need help. I love programming and I really just want to work already. I don't even mind relocating(Clearly I'm in Kuwait). Maybe you could give me some ideas on how to stand out above others as well. I don't mind getting my hands dirty with code and I have what feels like a bottomless amount of time at the moment this summer. There is nothing to do here lol. 

Anyway here is the link for my resume- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s_slN9DUxQ624_9JBcDzksgykaHHEfYv8gRpT5ELMOo/edit?usp=sharing

[As an adoring ice cream fan I naturally have three chest freezers large enough to hold a human body filled with ice cream. These cause large drains on my electricity bill and must be damaging my carbon footprint.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazrh4o?context=5)|Okay, so here's the deal. Those freezers are using the [refrigeration cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump_and_refrigeration_cycle) to cool off the inside of those chests. If you live in a cold environment then it heats up your house which is fine, but if you live in a warm climate then you're essentially heating up your home then using the same cycle (!) to then remove that heat given off again using your AC unit.  Second fix - can these chests be located in an unconditioned area like a garage so that they don't heat up your house in the summer?  Third (unrealistic) fix - you use hot water right? Why can't that hot coil (the condenser coil) on the back of your fridge be used to heat incoming water? It'd make the fridge more efficient and lower your cooling and water heating bills all in one. The problem is that marketable solutions for this sort of thing would be complex and you'd need skilled installers. All of which costs money, so typically we just plug stuff in and deal with it.  EDIT: someone mentioned below that additional insualtion could cause a fire. If you can see the condensing coil then it shouldn't be a problem. If you have a chest freezer where the condensing coil is below the exterior sheathing then you can't add additional foam as it would cover the coils and keep the coils from dissipating heat. Basically, you'd have a bad time.

[So what are some design elements that help to make a house more energy efficient. Assuming you are building a new house. What's the top there things that make a difference. And can they be implemented in existing homes (built 15-20 years ago\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazrln5?context=5)|Air sealing.
 |Properly insulated walls with minimal [thermal bridging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_bridge)
 |Solar orientation in relation to location of windows.
 |Shape of building (long and thin vs. compact with no bump-outs)
 |Air sealing is probably the easiest way to retrofit older homes. Additional insulation can sometimes be added but it can be expensive if it's not in the attic or easily accessible. Upgrading your AC/heater is another good option (heat pumps, high efficiency water heaters, etc.).
[Have you used non-conventional material like treated straw or mud for construction?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazt1fv?context=5)|I have not personally but I have seen successful projects from high design firms with those materials.

Any reliable rating/review systems out there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazt5b4?context=5)|Ugh, it's difficult. Find recently built buildings in your area and find out who built them. I often find these people through blogs.
[When building a house, how do you find good construction companies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazt5b4?context=5)|Usually same deal but to a lesser extent on the blog front. Also, most architects have people they like to work with and trust.
[Most importantly, how do you make a really energy efficient house that is also zombie proof.  Note: Walking dead type zombies.  Not the Running dead type zombies in World War Z.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazt5b4?context=5)|I would do an ICF wall house with additional exterior insulation, and if you're serious about the zombies just get impact resistant glazing (they make them for FL) make the openings high enough or narrow enough that they can't get through. Also, shotguns. Or just hire me. I used to shoot people professionally.
[I've done that somewhat.  I can find a lot of places that ""look"" good, but since I'm a computer geek, I don't know if it's built and designed well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazw653?context=5)|Air tightness is really tricky to gauge and measure. There are standards (ACH50) but it's trickier than that. You can typically find before and after studies from retrofits though.
[What is your opinion of ICF (insulated concrete form\) homes?  The cost to build seems to be about 15% higher in my area (US midwest\), but the long term heating and cooling costs are really appealing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazss3h?context=5)|ICF's are great. I mentioned this elsewhere but my only beef with them is the interior foam. I want more foam on the exterior. ICF's typically do not have a higher R value than a typical stud wall. What they do is mitigate thermal bridges and leaky cavities. This combined with the reduced noise, won't rot, and increased protection (tornadoes, cars, bullets - I'm in Chicago) is what makes them better.
[Would you recommend ICF for a desert environment?  I'm in Yuma, Arizona, where it'll climb over 115 degrees F in the summer.  ICF's R ratings are very attractive, but will it do well in extreme sun and heat?  Will the foam break down?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cb01vq1?context=5)|ICF's should be fine in that environment. Actually, some types of insulation perform better at different temperatures so there may be some slight advantage or disadvantage. I can't remember off the top of my head which ones do which.
 |As to the breakdown. So long as you keep the UV off it with brick, stucco, a rainscreen, whatever - it should last far longer than either of us. The stuff they use, EPS, is the same stuff used to make styrofoam cups that environmentalists hate because they never break down...

[When designing a house, how much thought is given to the construction with regard to fire safety?  From what I understand, modern construction techniques (using manufactured wood products, gusset plates, adhesives instead of 'real' wood, screws, nails\) makes modern houses much more prone to catastrophic collapse during a fire.  Do you have any insights as to how these problems may be solved while also keeping costs down, or is the only solution to throw more money into the build and use better materials?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazs162?context=5)|First off, buildings aren't designed to be fireproof. They're designed so that you have enough time to get out.
 |Fire safety is an issue that is addressed literally everyday where I work. All the codes are built around it, especially in commercial construction (which I work in). It's so pervasive that you really don't think about it because it's just built into everything.
 |2x material (2x4's, 2x6's) is combustible but the sheet rock (gypsum board, drywall) it's covered in has a fire rating of 1 hour. Gyp is really really cheap. Two layers gets you two hours, etc. This is the cheapest way to fireproof just about anything and a major reason why every house is drywalled in the US.
 |The manufactured timbers you're talking (~~TJI's~~, glulams, paralams, etc.) about are actually considered heavy timber*. Heavy timber is actually very fire resistant and all those products are tested extensively.
 |When they're at least 8x8 or bigger! Thanks /u/nac126 for the reminder.

Modern homes can have pitched roofs and what not. I feel like a building should reflect its time, place, and construction. Typical homes in the US fake it and add features that cause maintenance problems and add cost just so they can look like they were built is 1880. Why? What is the point? Is it aesthetically pleasing...I don't think so. It's just the way things are done.

I've personally learned a lot by the mistakes and failures of these types of buildings.
 |In the US we're on something like V2.0 now whereas in Germany, Austria, etc. they're on V3.0.
 |As far as commercially viability - probably not as they're portrayed in the given link. In function, yes. Labor is the biggest factor in a buildings construction cost. Odd angles, curves, anything not standard and square adds cost. It may sound boring but shaving 1% or 2% off a construction budget can be a few thousand dollars. Also, the general public has a certain reticence to anything that looks different.

[Also, is it a good idea to live underground?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazsz3n?context=5)|Living underground poses a lot of challenges. For starters banks often hate the idea because of resale. There's also the fact that moving earth is very expensive. Foundations are typically the largest cost associated with a home her in the Midwestern US. There's also moisture issue. All of this can be dealt with if you find someone who knows their stuff. Instead of going that route I would opt for [ICF walls](https://www.google.com/search?q=icf+wall&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=h5ndUareMeeEygH6_IHwCA&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1026&amp;bih=1064) (concrete walls with rigid insulation on both sides) with additional insulation on the outside.
[Do ICF walls make sense in seismically active areas, like California? If not, what's the best alternative?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazumap?context=5)|I'm probably not qualified to answer this, but lighter buildings perform better in seismic areas. Wood framed structures tend to be better than concrete, but the scale/size of the building is going to make a huge difference too. If it's only 1-2 stories ICF's are probably fine.
 |You also want a structure that can deflect and bend a bit while keeping itself laterally stable. Concrete tends to be rather rigid whereas steel and concrete can both be designed to give a bit more. Anyways, yeah, question for a structural engineer.
[What do you see are the trends for the green building movement?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazt6zo?context=5)|So far it's market dominated. Businesses and people are doing it for the financial incentives more than anything. It seems like a fairly logical path. I think the increase in comfort and other aspects are being undervalued though. Am I right to guess that your house never feels drafty? What's that worth? How does a contractor/bank/real estate agent quantify that?
[Is it ramping up quickly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazt6zo?context=5)|Kind of. It's becoming more integrated and standard. More or less all government buildings are required to be LEED certified now and while I take issue with LEED it is a step in the right direction.
[What do you think is the future of the Passive House standard in particular?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazt6zo?context=5)|I don't want to speculate too much. It took off in Europe but they have a more temperate climate with less variability than the US and North America. I think Passive House will remain somewhat of a niche for a while. The people who seem to be adopting it are builders and one day I think a few bigger builders are going to get a hold of it and figure out how to make the energy savings work for their bottom line. After that? Who knows. I've heard of talk that PH would become the energy part of the requirement for LEED.
 |EDIT: I want to hear more about your house.
[Do you find that people who are looking for small affordable houses turn to an architect when a general contractor can design homes himself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazsaiz?context=5)|To be honest I'm not really sure. I feel like it's an unmet need. I work for a medium formerly large firm so the only houses we deal with are large and high end.
 |Most homes are built without an architect and I can't say I blame anyone for the situation. The vast majority of homes are very formulaic and often times an architect's ideas are shot down by the contractor because of cost. To add to this a contractor typically knows where to cut costs and what to include to hit a certain price point in that market. It really comes down to a financial equation. The average price for a home in the US is about $200,000. A typical architects fee is about 10%, so $20,000 on a project of this size. A licensed architect with 20-30 years experience is going to be charging something like $100-$200/hour (for billable work). Let's use $150/hour. That's 133 hours, so about 4 weeks of billable time. For anyone who's ever designed and built a house that's not much. Basically, it's too small of a job for most architects to tackle. The way to get around this is to make the design over and over, refine it, build a relationship with a contractor, etc. I'm still trying to figure this out myself as it's what I, one day, would like to do. You need to be able to offer something they can't otherwise get like accurate energy modeling, finding the rights products, convincing the bank it will work, etc.
 |My firm is actually kind of dying right now so I doubt we'll be hiring any more interns. Sorry.

[What is the typical budget for a home? Sometimes high efficiency doesn't mean cheap. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazrf51?context=5)|It depends mostly on the area of the country you live in (I'm assuming US). A typical residential construction budget is around $140-160/square foot (SF). $200/SF is a nice home with better finishes (FFE) and $250/SF is premium. Here's a [cheat sheet](http://blog.buildllc.com/2009/02/residential-construction-cost-cheat-sheet/) from one of my favorite blogs.
 |High efficiency certainly doesn't mean cheap. However, I have seen it done. Advanced framing to minimize thermal bridging, 2x6 studs on 24"" centers to deepen the insulation cavity, cellulose insulation because it's cheap and stops air infiltration and installation issues, frost protected shallow foundations, compact home designs without bump-outs, and solar orientation are all ways to maximize thermal efficiency that actually save money.
 |Many of the methods contractors employ are utilized because they're methods that have worked for decades. The more thermally efficient you make a building the more potential problems you run into. Basically, if you don't know your shit you're going to have some seriously expensive failures, and this happens a lot. I think that's where a lot of the fear surrounding a change in construction methods comes from.
[I'm an Architect in Los Angeles. I have a fair amount of experience with residential design. In my experience, new, high-end modern homes are usually in the $400-600/sf range. I have a hard time finding contractors to build simple additions for under $200/sf. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazxqja?context=5)|Woah!

I'm talking ""best bang for your buck"" kind of improvements.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazsoa8?context=5)|Typically it's air sealing. It solves so many problems for almost nothing. If you want to do it really well you can do a blower door smoke test and find the leaks then plug them up.
[I realize this depends on the age of the house and the quality of the build, so it may be better to ask what the biggest variables in efficiency would be in an existing house.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazsoa8?context=5)|Your next best bet is efficient appliances.

Efficient appliances and HVAC equipment is up there too. Minimizing [thermal bridging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_bridge) is often overlooked by just about everyone. Also, most insulation (batt in particular) is installed improperly.
[How much should this cost, but also how much is this saving me over time??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazxmje?context=5)|Depends if you hire someone or do it yourself, how old your house is, how big your house is, what area of the country you're in, how in depth you go, etc. so I feel like any numbers I throw out would be at best a guess. At the very low end you can walk around your house on a cold/hot day and check for drafts and seal them. At the other end you can hire a professional to do a thorough inspection and do all necessary work. The first one might cost $30 while the second could be a few thousand dollars.
[Do you think grey water reclamation and other water waste features should be part of future energy and sustainability standards?  I think its silly and wasteful that so many people are flushing toilets with potable water.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazt13x?context=5)|However, dealing with waste water is very expensive and moving water around is somewhat energy intensive. A lot of the cost of water is subsidized through sewage fees and other municipal taxes. It's the same issue that stands out with so many issues with our built environment - unaligned incentives. Those who pay the money have little incentive because they do not personally stand to realize the positive benefits of their expenditures. Builders don't put extra insulation on a house for the same reason that people don't install gray water systems in their house. Who benefits? Someone else.  To me, this is something that needs to be addressed legally with building codes. If everyone did it it could save your water reclamation district a lot of money which may have a positive ROI. I think with time and more evidence this sort of thing will become quite common. In Chicago we already have retention codes that make buildings store a certain amount of water after a rain event so as not to flood our (combined, ugh) sewage system.

 |Otherwise, I'm not entirely sure. They're cheap, but not by much compared to 2x4's. If you weld then great, but the moment you start cutting holes in them they lose a lot of their strength, so you have to reinforce.
 |Overall, if it's DIY and you're a welder it's far more viable than most people. Just make sure you insulate it properly. I'd use the exterior of container as the exterior skin then make a stud wall of 2x3's or steel channel held back from the wall and sprayed with open cell spray foam (icynene). Also, try to get containers that are made of cor-ten so you don't have to grind and paint all the time - if you can.

 |I view earthships as a useful first step in energy efficient/green construction that taught us a lot of lessons. I believe there are better ways to proceed now.
 |It's all about net metering unless you're off grid. Batteries are expensive and have a rather short life span. Not to mention hydrogen off gassing.
 |Sure, but then you'd need a fan and an insulated duct and a way of switching it over in winter and summer. Conversely you could just hang dry your clothes outside and use the sun directly.
[What is the most important aspect of energy-efficient or 'green' home?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazt01c?context=5)|This is a bit of a loaded question since all the systems have to work together and be designed for your climate, but I would say the enclosure system. Your walls, roof, and foundation all need to work together to keep heat in/out while also staying dry and still being relatively inexpensive to construct. The enclosure needs to be as airtight as possible and as thermally non-conductive as possible (high R value) while reducing thermal bridges. Most walls and roofs in the US are actually insulated fairly okay, but they tend to be leaky and have thermal bridges everywhere. Taping or caulking all the seams plus a layer of exterior insulation would help to mitigate this. For some reason lots of foundations aren't insulated or it's done poorly. Which is strange because concrete is about the worst insulator on earth (aerated concrete is a different story).
[Given your position as an ""Intern Architect"", do you usually adapt existing building designs to your more energy efficient criteria, or do you design from scratch more?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazuj5i?context=5)|Both really. Now that I think of it the buildings we retrofit are generally in some sort of moisture decay, hence requiring our work, so energy efficient upgrades are almost always part of the package. Vapor barrier issues and drying out of wall assemblies leads to almost every retrofit we get. Of course building new offers much better opportunities for sitting, orientation, etc. which is huge. Retrofitting may be ""greener"" but building new makes for more efficient buildings (assuming you do it right).

1i0px6,1,2013-07-10,I'm worried I'll never get a proper chance at this life thing.,aoktoday,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i0px6/im_worried_ill_never_get_a_proper_chance_at_this/,"This is a long post.

I'm 21.

I realized several years ago that my parents were abusive. For a long time, for whatever reason, I thought their behavior was normal. Just some quick examples: 

*pretty much refusing to let me invite friends over or go places (I distinctly remember my mom telling me in highschool she needed a ""week's notice"", and the other time I was walking home, and met up with a friend walking home. It was hot, we went to my house for drinks, and my parents berated me for ""letting these people in our house with no notice""). My mother would also consistently tell me she only had children because ""it was the thing to do"", and stated that if she could ""do it all over"", she would not choose this life.

*on my father's behalf, blatantly staring at me whenever i walked by. when i'd tell him he made me feel uncomfortable by doing that, he would tell me to get over it, or that he could do that being a parent. This is the same man who has an alcoholic sister whose three kids estranged themselves from her. He goes on weekly rants about how shitty the kids are, and how dare they abandon their mother.

^That's not even the half of it. I'm skipping over the physical threats, etc.


Anyway, point being. Around the age of 17, I started to realize that stuff was *really* fucked up. In the past year, I began to realize the extent of its effect on me.

I realized it's why I've only been kissed a few times, and why I've never gotten anything close to a boyfriend. It was why in highschool I had few friends. It's the ""why"" for a lot of things.

Anyway like I said, in the past year is when I really started trying to remedy what has happened to me, so I can go on and live my life. It was only recently that I was able to feel emotion again.

But, this past month, doctors found a potentially cancerous tumor in my adrenal glands. (Don't panic!!!) It's been removed, and everything is looking good for me. They don't expect it to come back or anything.

But I *will* have to be on bed rest for the rest of summer. Plus, the medication they've been giving me has caused me to gain 20lbs. 

Plus, my mother is threatening to not let me go back to college. don't worry, it's not because of my sickness (which the doctors already said such action would be unnecessary), although she is pretending like it is. I overheard my mother talking about how tuition got raised, and the financial aid they give us isn't enough, so there's a need for a couple thousand more. 

So, considering all the above, I'm feeling very bad about myself. I feel like such a loser. Now, it might seem weird to you guys that I am *so* concerned with getting a boyfriend while all this other shit is going on. But it's more like, I just want to feel normal.

All my friends are normal. They're dating. They're doing internships. They have pretty decent families. I'm doing none of that. I feel like I can't talk to them anymore because I'm such a loser. No, I'm not dating yet, not now, now ever. No, I don't have an internship because I'm sick. No, I can't go to the pool with you. I'm pretty short, so 20 extra lbs is very, very obvious. I am obese now.

As my title says, the more terrible shit that piles on top of me, I feel like I'll never get ""my chance"" at a normal life. as it stands now, most of the life-changing experiences I've had have changed my life for the worse.


I feel very out of control, and like nothing will ever get better. I feel like I'm not getting any opportunities to make my life into what I want it to be. I am desperately trying to leave the narrative of suffering behind, but I can't seem to."
1i0ptm,8,2013-07-10,"[28/m] I don't know how to help my wife (27/f) cope with her struggling career, and it's impacting our marriage",PirateNixon,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i0ptm/28m_i_dont_know_how_to_help_my_wife_27f_cope_with/,"My wife and I married young (when I was 21 and she was 20). Our marriage has always been strong, and we've never had any significant issues between us. For the first five and a half years of our marriage I was in the air force, and as a result her options for education and then employment were limited to what was available near my assignment.

She got her degree in what she was told would be a very useful and competitive degree for a business environment, Organizational Sociology with a concentration in Business Management, and graduated with honors. She also worked as an HR intern in a SCEP internship during the last ~16 months of her education (considered a fairly competitive internship to get). At the end of her internship, I was preparing to end my military service, so we could move back to the area I grew up in (at her request). As she was open and honest about this, her bosses didn't bother with the vast quantity of paperwork required to convert her position to a full time position.

She ended up with a several month gap in her resume due to the move, and then couldn't find any work when we first moved. After a few months living in an area where she knew nobody except me, my father, and my step-mother she got traction on a job opportunity at the company where I work (which is highly regarded and is rated in the top 5 places to work in the world). The down side was it was an office admin job that would require her to cover a receptionist desk in the afternoons. She was not thrilled, but took the job as it was her only option and we needed the money.

When the offer was formally extended it was identified as a receptionist position, not an office admin, but she accepted it anyways as we needed the money and she couldn't stand to be at home any longer (we share a single car so she was stuck at home while I worked). Also, the company is known to allow internal job transfers fairly easily so the thought was she could float in this job for a few months then transfer to a better fit.

Since about two months after she got her job, she's been trying to get a different job, or get her current job upgraded to the position she was told it would be (an office admin). She has gotten several interviews for positions she's qualified for but she has not received any job offers. She is getting really depressed. She is very irritable, she is very pessimistic, and just generally unhappy.

The most important thing to me is my wife's happiness, and I don't know what to do. I work in a technical job, that's the only professional experience I have, so I don't really have any contacts in the fields she'd be working in. My friends that I grew up with are either scattered to the wind, or about three hours away, so I can't tap those resources to help her. I know that I most likely can't help with the job search, but how can I help her with coping with it? She refuses to seek professional help because her parents used that to drug her up as a teenager, and I just don't know what I can do to help her. I try my best to do whatever I can think of to help her with the job search, when that runs out, I work on giving her other things to think about and keeping her active so she doesn't just sit and wallow. What else can I do? I can't stand to see her like this and not be able to help.

**TL;DR:** My wife can't find work and it's depressing her. How can I help her cope with that so she can still be a happy person?"

I'm considering never smoking again all because of my best ""friend""",[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1i0h22/i_could_really_use_some_advice_im_considering/,"Last night my ""friend"" did a bunch of shit that was not cool at all and I was wondering if you guys could give me any advice to me to fix this cluster fuck. 

He's an alcoholic, and tricked me into being his designated driver by asking me to drive him to this bar to pick up his car. (I'm only 20, and he is the reason I will never drink alcohol) He said he would only have one beer, but it turned into 4 shots of whisky and another 10 beers throughout the night. later, I was waiting on a half ounce to come in when his friends walked by the porch and he asked if ""we"" cold buy some weed off them.... even though I was was waiting for this half ounce and he spent all of his money at the bar. We walked over to his friend's dealer, the guy said it would be 65 bucks, and my friend immediately said ""We'll take it"" (keeping in mind that he is drunk) and he turned to me to get the money... without asking if I was cool with it or even if I wanted that much. Later, we all smoked a couple bowls and got really stoned at 1:00 am. At one point I said I was done to which he responded ""Don't be a bitch."" and said to his friends ""come on, aren't we supposed to pressure him?"" That is exactly what he said. One of his friends even said ""If he doesn't want to smoke, he doesn't have to"" because they could tell he was trying to fuck with me as a joke, but he would not let it go. I had to get up early for an internship and I am at work right now.... still slightly stoned which is not cool. I told him no, and he pressured me into smoking more. He also wanted to get some ""blow"" whatever the fuck that is... I guess it's crack or something, which is fucked up. Luckily he didn't get a hold of any. He also got pissed that I gave one of his friends a beer. He said ""Dude, I can't believe you are giving away my beer"" as if he forgot that I spent my own money on weed so that everyone could smoke. He knows that I prefer to smoke by myself, but he threw me into this really shitty situation and I don't know what the hell to do. There's about 20 other things he had done the week before that wasn't cool, but I don't want to waste anymore of your time.

I am a relatively new smoking (5 months ish), so I don't know if I am over reacting.... but this little event (and a bunch of other stuff that I haven't mentioned) has made me think that it would be best to just quit. I love smoking trees, it has given me some good times in the past, but whenever I smoke with my friend, I hate it. I can't stand it. I am seriously considering never smoking trees again because of the shit that I have been through. That being said, I could really use some advice.

EDIT: I should mention that I moved in with him and his roommate last week (just for the month) so I didn't have to rent my own apartment or get an extended stay. In the past, I had helped him out with some serious shit. He got suspended from university for drinking and a whole bunch of other stuff. He is only a complete asshole when he drinks or gets stoned. It's like he thinks I'm a fucking joke. Anyway, I have been thinking about this for a while, and I am done with him. I am tired of the lies, belittling, and pressure from him. This is the kind of shit that happens when I bend over backwards for someone. Thanks for the advice everyone... I don't think I am going to give up trees but I am definitely going to give up on this friendship."
1i0d47,24,2013-07-10,Girl said she likes me...but she has a boyfriend. What do I do?,neededathrowaway122,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i0d47/girl_said_she_likes_mebut_she_has_a_boyfriend/,"So to preface this, I'll be fully honest: I've never been in a relationship before, and haven't even kissed a girl until now. I'm not socially awkward or anything, but my parents frowned upon dating in high school and I respect their wishes. I just finished my 1st year of undergrad, and for the first time since I started engineering, I've got some free time as my job isn't that demanding this summer. 

So I met this girl a few weeks ago, who seemed really fun and shared my sense of humor. She friended me on Facebook, and it turns out she's got a long-ish term boyfriend. At that moment, I told myself that any silly romantic thoughts I might have were pointless, and that I should just treat this as a great friendship. 

We end up getting dinner a few times, going to the movies as friends, and even get mistaken quite a bit as a dating couple, but I always just laughed it off. Keep in mind how inexperienced I am with relationships. 

A few days back, we get together to study for a test, and for some reason we went back to her place to finish studying. Sometime later, she gets a call from her boyfriend, which she takes very quickly. Then she told me, very shyly, that she felt guilty hanging out with me. I really had no idea what she meant, so I just made a joke about it, but she insisted and said something like ""I keep telling my boyfriend that it's not like that when I hang out with you, but really, for me, it is like that. I *like* you, Anon"". I don't know why she chose to admit it right then.

At this point, I didn't know what to do. We were alone at her place, and for the first time in my life, a very pretty girl was telling me that she liked me. On one hand, that felt awesome, but on the other, I'd feel like a prick if I tried to start something while her boyfriend was away on an internship.

I sort of panicked, played it off like I didn't understand, and went back to studying. Derp. She dropped me back home, and we went back to texting and talking like it never happened. 

I asked her to come to the movies with me this weekend, she accepted, and I'm wondering if I should ever bring it up again, or let it go completely. Thing is, I really do like this girl, I just convinced myself that she was off limits early on. Her little confession leaves me very very confused. 

EDIT: Guys, please see a quick update post a ways down in this thread too. I just wanted to clarify a few things that weren't necessarily clear in this OP. I'm going to copy paste it below for any future reference.

...
I think I gave the wrong impression of this girl in the OP. She's a real sweetheart, and not the type to aggressively go cheat on her SO. 

She knows how inexperienced I am with dating, and I think this was just her muddled way of talking about any confused feelings she had while trying to give me a confidence boost at the same time. I mean, the confidence boost thing worked - I felt like I was on top of the world. It's just a great feeling for a guy like me, clueless about the dating game, to hear that a very pretty girl might like you. But I needed to hear from you guys that my moral compass should prevail, and that I shouldn't take that message (even though it is confusing) the wrong way.

I really value my friendship with her the most, and it's no problem if I go back to my ""she's off limits"" attitude. Is there anything I should say about this in the interest of my friendship, or should I bury the hatchet and move on? We still go out to eat/she accepted to go to the movies with me as friends as usual, so maybe I just take the confidence boost in stride, never speak of it again, and treat her like what she is: a good friend?"

1. Are AR-15 prices back to normal yet? I've been reading that prices were inflated significantly post-Sandy Hook, but haven't read anything about prices coming down.

2. Would it be cheaper to purchase a pre-assembled AR-15 directly from a manufacturer (such as LMT or DD), or to buy it from my LGS? I live in the same city as the only Cheaper Than Dirt retail location in the country, so I was thinking about giving that a shot (after I return from my internship, currently in another state entirely).

Alright guys.. Let me start off by saying what I am going to be using this build for. First off, I am planning on playing SC2:HOTs and PlanetSide 2 with this PC. The only reason why I do not have any other games in my mind is because I have never played any on any consoles or anything like that.. so I might be interested in playing higher end games as I get used to this PC. Other than that.. I'll be getting Photoshop and video editing software as I make more money later.

**Secondly**, I want to say some things about my budget.. Luckily, I got a summer internship that gives me approx 20 hours a week. Thus, I think I can pay off this build as I get my paychecks. I am trying to keep it around the $1700-$2000 range.

**My goal is to build a pc based on longetivity.** Also, I want to say that this PC will be turned off at night (it is NOT going to be on 24/7). So, if that changes anything.. please tell me.

**Next**, I am going to give a breakdown of my rational behind each parts and some of the missing parts:

**Processor:** This is purely just bias.. I just want one of the best processors out there right now and it has been my dream to get an i7. Do I plan on overclocking? Right now.. NO. I heard that overclocking substantially reduces the life of the processor so I am scared. But, as I get comfortable with the setup.. I might overclock! Who knows? :D

**CPU Cooler**: I just saw this on sale today. Even though I am not leaning towards overclocking right now, the reason I am getting liquid cooling is because I hate the look of the big huge perpendicular fan. I think these types of cooling looks much better. I was planning on buying an H100i but since this was on sale and H100i will be overkill.. i just chose this.

**MoBo**: I just absolutely love the armor. I've heard that it traps dust but since they have little fans inside now.. I think it is better. Also, it has caps for every single port on the board so it keeps them safe. I am open to other thoughts

**Memory**: The only reason I am buying this is because of [THIS](http://promotions.newegg.com/combo/13-2908/index.html?SID=0cbsoOj9EeKifh40xRvYTA0_av9d3_0_0_0&amp;AID=10440897&amp;PID=1225267&amp;nm_mc=AFC-C8Junction&amp;cm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-_-cables-_-na-_-na&amp;cm_sp=Homepage_MidRight-_-combo%2f13-2908-_-http://promotions.newegg.com/combo/13-2908/300_250.jpg) deal. I am basically getting it for around $50 dollars.

**Storage**: No explanations needed. SSD for OS and HDD for storage.

**GPU**: I think this is the card I need because it is low priced and at new. I'm open to other suggestions. I might buy other brands of this card like the Windforce but I'm not sure.

**Case**: I love the look.. and it is on sale.. impulse buying ftw!!

**PSU**: I don't have a preference.. I'm just waiting for one to go on sale. Right now, I'm thinking about getting this because it exceeds my needs and is on a good sale.

**Monitor**: I just chose a popular monitor. My question is.. does the resolution work? This is my first time building and thus.. I don't know much about resolutions.

**OS**: I am not getting an OS yet because I'm pretty sure I am going to get Windows 8 for free next year for some classes I am taking.

**Peripherals**: I prefer these 2.

**Conclusion**: What do you think? I'm open to any suggestions. Please keep in mind that this is my first time building and I have given it all ~8 months of research.

**I live 1hr away from a MicroCenter btw**

1hzdx6,3,2013-07-09,"IT field Redditors, how would you approach finding an entry level tech job with only A+/Net+ certifications and 8 years of unrelated experience?",AshenCrow,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1hzdx6/it_field_redditors_how_would_you_approach_finding/,"How should I go about finding an entry level IT job with the wrong kind of experience, aside from just putting in my application everywhere and hoping for the best? I couldn't find a previous question about this, amazingly enough.

Twenty four years old, currently unemployed. I have been in the work force since 2005, started with a crappy job washing dishes at Denny's and some retail management after, followed by owning my own business selling e-cigarettes for over a year, a pick up job, and more retail management and sales.

I am sick of retail. I was always unhappy and unfulfilled and unchallenged in my previous jobs after only 6 months. I have had too many jobs in those eight years. I got A+ and Net+ in high school, and never used them to get a job. Part of this was due to psychological reasons, which I am now finally happily medicated for. The condition also allowed me to not value myself and feel I wasn't worth a $30k+ a year salary because I have lived on $8400/yr without government assistance, but I am finally past that. I am fixing my job problems, right fucking now. =)  

The problem now is that I have a lot of experience in the wrong types of jobs, because I let my insecurities stop me from getting a challenging and rewarding and well-paying job. Over and over. On my resume I narrowed it down to five jobs, all management except for my own business and the cashier job. There are no gaps of employment.

I have finally written a resume that I feel is extremely presentable and have included my other experience in a separate section. It is as follows:

-----

Personal Experience
- Vast experience over nine years in diagnosis, repair, and solution implementation in personal computers, laptops, and other devices for clients and associates
- Over fifty machines built for clients suited to their needs, including personal, server, and high power (gaming) machines
- Experience over seven years in the implementation and repair of networks, both LAN and WAN, in both home and office environments
- Three years of experience administrating and moderating webservers and dedicated servers using appropriate practices to maintain maximum uptime

-----

Most IT jobs, even Tier 1/help desk, require 1-3 years experience from what I can find. If you were looking at my resume, would you consider my personal experience relevant enough? I do, that is why I included it, but I don't want to appear foolish to hiring managers. The computers built were never a taxable thing because the amount I earned wasn't enough to list as an independent contractor. Over the years I realized I had built quite a few though. The WAN implementation was from classroom and personal use of CISCO routing, among other small things, but it sounds great.

I have talked to everyone I can think of that might know some one or know of a position open and put in a good word for me. All four of them. I used to be extremely bad at accepting hand outs, but I'm finally forcing myself to get over it because I will never get a good job otherwise.

I understand that there are intern positions open sometimes but they are always snatched up immediately.  I'm willing to work part time some where and also work an unpaid internship, but I can't freaking find them! Where should I be looking? I'm checking out LinkedIn tonight, I've never used it."

I guess the first thing I should say is thanks for reading. Hopefully this isn't going to be the beginning of a novel, so I'll keep it concise and separated. 

I was in a 4 year relationship with the girl I thought I was going to marry. I mean, I thought she was it, and my family and I did everything to make sure that she had a life setup for her first long time away from her family (she moved from across the state). She originally moved across the state for an internship for her career, and we helped her find housing, helped her with her car/support system out here, etc. 

I loved her everyday, even though my job wasn't covering half of what I needed to move in with her in the 3rd year of our relationship. So, I decided to go back to grad school to have a greater chance at getting a job, and talked with my family about proposing to her (what they thought, even though I already knew I was going to I wanted to make sure that I was seeing everything.) I went to grad school, with the premise that I'd be home every two weeks (grad school's about 200 miles away from home for me) and that we'd trade visiting each other.

We'd done the long distance thing before for a year, as she was in school and I was at home working, and didn't think that it would be a big deal when something changed and she decided to break it off with me. I was at this point heartbroken, because I had already picked out the ring, and was planning on asking her parents for permission (even though I didn't really need to) and proposing to her the day after Valentine's day. 

Long story short, towards the end of the relationship, she started telling me that something was wrong, while at the same time talking to family friends and talking about this co-worker that kept telling her these sob stories and how she felt bad for him. I was naturally pissed, and really, after she broke it off with me, I had a serious case of revenge (even though she was the real scumbag, not really him.) Even though I don't know for sure, I have this sneaking feeling that she'd been planning this the whole time, and was just waiting so that she could be with him. 

--

According to her, I never valued her, but I don't think that that's the case considering all the tangible and intangible things I've done for her and us. Aside from spontaneous flowers, road trips, phone/Skype calls frequently (almost daily), visiting her every two weeks (which, by the way, she visited me once in the nine months that I was in grad school), and planning on proposing to her, I'm not sure what more I could have done. She hasn't spoken to me since then, and has ignored any communication I've sent out to figure out what the hell happened. 
--

Which brings me to my current predicament. It's been six months since that happened, and I can't get over her. She's still on my mind frequently, and even though I'm incredibly busy, going to the gym, hanging out with new people, looking at new jobs and pretty much everything else that I've read to do. And now, since I've wrote my novel, I'd appreciate anything at all, because as crazy as it sounds I still am in love with her. Help?

**TL;DR**: Went out with girl I thought I was going to marry for 4 years. Broke up with me under suspicious circumstances. It's been six months, and I can't get over her, no matter what I do. "
1hz59h,2,2013-07-09,I miss my life.,freezeezypeak,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1hz59h/i_miss_my_life/,"I've been having a rough few months. I graduated from a top 10 engineering school with a degree in Chemical Engineering in May, and I feel like I've gotten nowhere and done nothing since.

I'm currently living with my parents because I don't have a job. I know this is a really common thing these days, but it's hit me really hard. All throughout college, people told me that I'd have no trouble getting a job. Yes, I'd have to work to find one and I'd have to try, but there'd be plenty of people that would want to hire me because chemical engineers are so employable. However, that hasn't happened yet and it makes me feel like shit. I don't have a problem with my parents, and it's not any financial hardship, but I feel like I have nothing here and there's no promise of things getting better.

I've been feeling like this would happen for the past year especially, since I haven't had internship experience and was worried that would make it hard to get a job. This gave me a ton of anxiety, though I tried to ignore it so that I could at least enjoy my last year of college. However, while I was visiting my girlfriend of over two years a few weeks ago while in her city for an interview, she broke up with me, citing the way my anxiety had affected me over the past year or so and her wanting to grow as a person on her own. I was an absolute wreck especially for the first week after she broke up with me, because she was the main reminder that I was still worth something to someone even after all of my failings. She says she still loves me, and I believe her, but it's been really hard losing that connection to what my life used to be.

That made me realize what was really bothering me. If you had asked me what made me happy last year or even 6-8 months ago, I'd have a ton of answers for you. I for the most part enjoyed my studies, I had a fantastic group of friends, was the president of my social organization at my school, had a girlfriend who I was very much in love with and loved me very much, and hoped to have a bright future because of my major and such. I feel like I don't have any of that anymore.

* I obviously don't go to school anymore.
* My friends have been supportive but are busy with things like work and building their own futures.
* I don't see any prospects for getting on with my life.
* I'm still very much in love with my ex-girlfriend and wish that we could be a part of each others life again and make each other happy like we used to be able to.

People have told me to get out and just do something, like volunteering or some such, but it just feels like it would be a waste of time and wouldn't make things better. Right now I'm waiting to hear back from the company that I interviewed with while visiting my (now-ex) girlfriend, and if I don't get that job I honestly don't know what I'll do, and that scares me.

I feel like an entitled jackass for even complaining about this stuff since I've had so many opportunities and on paper have many things going for me, but it still feels like shit no matter how much I try to rationalize it.

I'm not sure what I expect you all to say, but any suggestions you might have for things I could do or things you might have to say to make me feel better would be very much appreciated. "

Good day, RWF Galaxy. My name is Drew Hardway, and I am a member of the RWF Board of Directors, along with Tanahashi Saito and Anton Sykes. Without further delay, I would like to discuss our upcoming mega-event in Oakland called RWF Gold Rush.  

*The camera shifts to the right side of the desk, as does Hardway’s focus.*  

This past week, we unveiled the true reason for this card being called Gold Rush: The three team elimination match for the RWF Tag Team Championship and the International Championship. Thanks to the temorarily empowered Wilikins feeling ever so Hurtsville-ish and upping the ante, that match will now feature a War Games atmosphere, complete with two caged rings. As a reminder: The International Title will change hands if the current champion, Damian Mitchell, is personally beaten. The potential is there for one group of allies to leave with all the gold...or lose it all. The stakes have never been higher. In light of this, our Battleground show this week in Dallas, Texas will give us a preview of this match.  

In triple threat action, The Foiler, Corey Blaade, and Troy Stone will collide with all their respective team mates undoubtedly standing by to merely root them on, I’m certain.  

*Hardway shifts back to the center camera.*  

Elsewhere Monday, newly crowned RWF Television Champion Lord Vecna faces Joey Knight in non-title action. Vecna is now confirmed to defend his title at Gold Rush in his own triple threat match against Mr. Harshaw and Mr. Loco.  

Former Television Champion Mikko Paatalo and the sultry Sara obviously want the title back quickly. At Gold Rush, they will have their chance to make that happen by competing in a Television Championship #1 contender’s triple threat match against the amicable duo meteorological proportions of Trent Winters and Victor Storms.  

Back to Battleground this week, ahead of the massive Women’s Battle Royal at Gold Rush, RWF Women’s Champion Lili Lafontaine’s bum leg will need to be ready to go when she faces Alan Lightbody’s favorite female, Amy Lightbody.  

And mixing members of multiple Gold Rush matches, HVX intern James Lafontaine will collide with James Harshaw and Lightbody’s other client, El Mondo Loco.  

*Hardway stands up and walks to a circular desk in his office and glances at a sheet of paper, then holds it up.*  

I hold here the contract for Christopher Steel and RJ Supernova’s match Monday. Our attorneys begged us to not present this contract for signing Monday due to some considerations in Oakland’s jurisdiction. They have cleared up any confusion and are ready for the document to be signed Monday in Dallas. Therefore, the final segment Monday will include this document being autographed.  

It all happens Monday in Dallas. And cask your cable or satellite provider to order Good Rush right now.  

*Hardway shuffles the contract papers as the scene ends.*

In a nutshell, I am currently a software engineering intern at a Fortune 500 company making 25/hr or basically 52K annually before taxes.  However, my internship only lasts for six months.

I'm looking for jobs in my field around where I live (near Raleigh, North Carolina).  Recently I was asked in a phone screening about what sort of salary I'm interested in for an associate/entry-level position.  I said roughly about what I'm being paid now or a little more.  This particular company said they could not pay that much for the particular position.

It was quite embarrassing to be put in that situation.  I'm usually afraid of shooting too high.

Call me presumptuous, but in case I am indeed asking for too much salary, should I go lower?  I was taught to never do that but I want to be realistic.  I'm only 23 and, honestly, I'm confused despite how fortunate I am."

We met at an internship I took last summer and hit it off immediately. We spent a majority of each day together (mostly because I followed her around, as she puts it, ""like a puppy"") and became really good friends during those four months. At the end of the internship she asked me on a date and we've been smitten since. That was 10 months ago.

About my SO. She's an extremely ambitious person with a fire in her that I've never seen before. I like to consider myself fairly ambitious (finishing up B.S in engineering and planning on getting my Masters) but she is leagues ahead of me or anyone else I know in that department. Due to this a ""mentor"" has taken an interest in her for a very nice position in the company that he is the CEO of. It's an airline company. I'm so excited for her and think she deserves the job as she's worked very hard to be in the position she's in.

But I can't help but have a nagging feeling in my gut. I don't want to hold her back; her ambition is part of what captured me in the very beginning and I would never ask her to dial it down for me. I'm just worried that with such a strong focus on her career, the future that we talked about will be taking a backseat to that.

I've voiced my worries to her and she's assured me that once shes in a stable career that family will be her focus. I trust her deeply and don't doubt what she tells me but I can't get rid of this feeling. I don't want to sound like a broken record, which is why I'm coming to you guys. 

How do I get rid of this worrying before it causes unnecessary issues?

---

**tl;dr**: My SO is extremely career driven and I worry our relationship will be put on the backburner. She tells me otherwise but I can't shake my negative feelings on the matter. Help for a needless worrier?"
1i40lh,3,2013-07-11,I just need to talk about jobs.,threaux_away,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i40lh/i_just_need_to_talk_about_jobs/,"I graduated from college in 2011. I'll admit that a BA in English probably wasn't the best degree to get in terms of jobs, but I throughly enjoyed the topic and the skills can be rolled over into other fields (with most LA&amp;S degrees, it's not about the actual degree topic, it's how you relate those skills to jobs). My last term at school, I had an editorial internship that I loved in Chicago. I then moved to Los Angeles and worked as a Copywriter for a small auto parts retailer. But I was hired 1099, and when the company closed, we were all given our last paychecks, a firm handshake, and an ice cream bar to brighten our spirits. This was a year ago. 

Seven months ago, I moved back to Chicago hoping to find more luck and to be closer to family. I've gotten very, very close to jobs a few times but in the end I always get passed over because they want someone with more experience. The ""entry level jobs"" are usually just there so they can legally hire the intern (and to be an intern, you must be enrolled in college courses) and the next level up in the job chain requires three to five years of experience. I have two. This doesn't stop me from applying, but I'm simultaneously over and under-experienced. 

I can't convey my frustration with this situation without it sounding muddled and convoluted. I've had employee referrals to companies here in Chicago for roles that weren't even open to the public yet, and I was turned down. I've been averaging about an interview a week (a handful went onto second interviews) and then silence (or a ""thank you but no thank you"" email). After this long, I can only assume it's a problem with me, which would be fine if I could figure out what the hell it was. Instead, it's the copy-paste letters saying they've decided to go with another, more qualified candidate. I've tried everything to clear my mind; I run, I go out with friends (and order water because I'm broke), I talk to my cat way too much, and work retail to help ease the bills. Nothing seems to be helping. There isn't anyway to *not* sound cliche about this; I'm stuck and I can't figure out how to get out.

A friend of mine works for an airline based out of the US (I can't say the name because the last thing I need is corporate America getting mad at me). This airline just bought a bunch of new planes and has on-site representatives that are stationed where the parts are being designed and manufactured. That's what my friend does; he's the point of contact based just outside of Amsterdam and he makes something like 70k/year. When I was first laid off, I jokingly asked him if they were hiring. They were. The job was in Ireland but I turned it down because I had only been unemployed for a few months--I wasn't desperate enough to flee the country for a job that wasn't in my field. 

Recently, I've thought about asking if they're hiring again. It wasn't a guaranteed job, but having an employee referral wouldn't help. I'm not psyched about leaving the country (or Chicago), but it'd be an experience (I just need to figure out how to take my cat with me haha). I would have to come back for Visa stuff, and I could also afford to fly home and see my family when I wanted to do so. An on-site representative could also roll into editorial work, if you think about it. It's internal communications within a large company, keeping projects on schedule, that sort of thing. 

If you're still reading this, I apologize. For a writing student and someone who has two years of experience, this is a terribly discombobulated wreck that has no real thesis, no punchline. I'm just trying to figure out where I go from here. If I ask my friend about jobs overseas, where will that lead? I don't know. Since I was in high school, teachers always told me to plan my future and my parents, their friends, and media in general have told me to embrace being young. But no one tells us honestly, we're not in charge of our future; no one plans for a horrific car crash or getting laid off. And I've managed to worry about doing things right when I'm young (aside from student loan debt) that I'm worried to take a career chance and regret it. 

I need to do something differently than just keep blindly apply for jobs. Maybe if I take a job overseas, I'll land on my feet. Maybe it'll be the worst thing ever. I just fear that if I do this, I'll wake up at 39 regretting that I didn't go into editorial work instead of... project management or whatever. 

Thanks for reading. "
1i3z2h,7,2013-07-11,Question on finding coding jobs or internships that help the environment,SteveDoocy,ecology,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecology/comments/1i3z2h/question_on_finding_coding_jobs_or_internships/,"Hey guys. I'm a soon-to-be graduating computer science major who is trying to get an idea of what avenues he can explore within the environmental field.

Over the years, the cause I have come to identify with has been that of the environment. By training (and by interest), however, I'm a computer scientist. I'm knowledgable of ecology and biology, but I want to be coding for my career.

For my undergraduate thesis, I've been building a GIS and agent-based model of an endangered plant. I've also been investigating what opportunities there are for ecoinformatics in graduate school. However, I don't think I'm ready to jump back into school right after I graduate. I want to get an idea of the breadth of opportunities there are and then, later, go for depth as a grad student.

So. I'd like to explore, either through internships or through jobs, the different lifestyles available to me in the junction of computer science and environmental work. My question is this: Are or were any of you involved in this intersection and NOT past the graduate school level? Do you guys have any insight you could share with me?

Been living together for four months. At the moment our relationship is long distance because he has an internship in another town and I am visiting family due to a death of a close family friend. 

When we started dating, I was severely depressed. I was hospitalized for suicidal tendencies (a walk-in clinic psychologist deemed me a danger to myself). During this time, I would call me boyfriend up in complete hysterics, crying, screaming, the whole shebang. 

To my surprise, he did not break up with me after all that; instead offered to help. I moved out of state to be with him because my parents did not want me to seek therapy at first.

A week or so ago, he texted me saying he was having a bad day and that we couldn't Skype that night. I didn't think much of it, we all have bad days, I thought he just needed some downtime. However, this continued. He kept pushing me away and ignoring my texts. I had no clue as to what was going on until last Friday, when he called me and said he had a nightmare about one of my episodes, and now he couldn't see my name or hear my voice with getting scared and anxious.

I am devastated. It's my fault entirely that he's hurting like this. I always knew dealing with a depressed S.O must hurt, but I did not know I could drive him to this. If I knew this would happen, I would have left when I was released from the hospital. I feel so incredibly guilty.

I also miss him. I miss him so damn much. I was abroad visiting extended family for a month, so we didn't have the time to talk, and pretty much as soon as I got back, this happened. I feel so empty without him. I try to distract myself by going out with friends, reading, whatever, but all my thoughts lead back to him. I spammed his phone when he first told me, apologizing and freaking out, and he just told me to be patient. I recently deleted his number so I won't be tempted to contact him.

I love him, but I don't want to hurt him. He said he doesn't want to leave me, but sometimes I can't help but think he'd be better off without me.

We're supposed to move into a new place next month. I have no idea what to do.

**TL;DR**: Boyfriend can't bear to see my name or hear my voice due my to past depressive episodes. I feel incredibly guilty and have no idea what to do."

I'm 22, with a PoliSci degree, and no internship experience really. I'm freaking because I don't want to be stuck living with my parents for the next 4 years of my life. How did you guys pull it together?"

[I've been waiting for this AMA forever!  I wonder how long you've been working with Conan, and how you managed to get that job. Was it more of you always trying to be a personal assistant or was it just trying to work with him?  What was it like being his assistant when the whole Tonight Show ordeal happened?  Also, how long did it take for you to get used to his jibes?

1i3dph,3,2013-07-11,Is it too late for me?,[deleted],AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1i3dph/is_it_too_late_for_me/,"Hello all,

I am heading into me senior year of undergrad studying computer engineering. Up until this Summer I was *positive* I wanted to avoid post-undergrad school and wanted to enter the workforce as soon as possible.

During the spring I applied and got accepted to my ""dream"" internship. I was sure that I would love the work, obtain a full-time position and be set for life. As my internship draws to a close, I'm finding its not everything I expected it to be and although I believe my performance will lead to a full-time offer, I am not sure if I want to accept it.

I'm finding myself far more interested in my education in the past few months than I ever was before, becoming far more interested in the problems I had previously seen as a means to a grade which where a means to a career. Now I'm staying up late reading papers and books and finding the things I am really interested in.

I'm beginning to think that I would like to pursue a phd but I am not sure how plausible that is. I have very good grades, but have not done any research and as I have previously seen class as just something to get through, I don't really have relationships with professors that could lead to letters of recommendation.

Applications for grad programs are due in the winter so I guess that gives me one semester to get involved in research and show my aptitude for it to other professors. Is that possible or am I kidding myself?

Also as I am just now getting interested in this, I am not really sure how a Masters degree works in relation to getting a phd. Is it recommended to get a Masters before going onto the phd? I imagine in my case that is probably the best solution as I getting into the Masters program will likely be a little easier and I could build more of a ""research portfolio"" there, but ultimately I don't really know.

Any advice or reassurance would be appreciated, thanks guys!"

&gt;pulls out bag of chocolate

&gt;begins to eat

&gt; holy shit is this even possible

&gt; offers me a chocolate

&gt;i politely refuse, no appetite

&gt;gee i wonder why

&gt;scoffs at me

&gt;""asians don't get fat, don't worry""

&gt; sofa roars in protest

&gt; ""i bet you don't have a boyfriend, you're too skinny""

&gt;""no one likes skinny girls""

&gt; ""did you know that Yang Guifei (chinese empress) was curvy""

&gt; ""she's one of China's legendary beauties""

&gt; ""China's picking up too much American culture""

&gt;""curvy is healthy, Yang Guifei is beautiful""

&gt;""you wouldn't understand, you're *American*

&gt;Bitch I know my Chinese history

&gt;She was fat, but not hambeast fat

&gt;I don't say anything, just smile

&gt; ""I think I'm the Yang Guifei of our generation""

&gt;I spit my water everywhere

&gt;don'tlaughdon'tlaugh

&gt;""uh, ok, that's nice""

&gt;""I'm the school flower at college, you know?"" (I used a direct translation from the chinese vocabulary, it basically means the girl that every guy likes)

&gt;Some guys can't appreciate traditional beauty anymore

&gt;They like skinny skeletons like you

&gt;""It's ok I'll find a guy for you don't worry""

&gt;""I've rejected twenty people this semester""

&gt;""I'll introduce you to one of them, they're all losers anyways, they play League like you""

&gt; uhh...thanks but no thanks

&gt;""wow you're not even grateful""

&gt; No, I think I can find my own man

&gt; Thanks for worrying, though

&gt; ""Yeah, no problem, I'm a traditional beauty, I'll teach you how to find men.""

&gt; Hamplanet now proceeds to reach into her bag again (I swear, that thing is an endlessly deep pit of junk food and beetus)

&gt; Pulls out a giant box of pocky

&gt;nomnomnom

&gt;continues telling me how I'm thin and thus going to die single

&gt; she's going to be here for three weeks

&gt;godhelpme


TL;DR: Hamplanet cousin comes to stay, pulls my cat into her gravitational field, eats a week's worth of junk food before dinner, slaughters a small village of dumplings, claims she's a ""traditional beauty"", insults my weight, eats more beetus-lathered cookie sticks, and is going to be here for three weeks.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT: I just got into work and I'm early, so I'm just taking time to answer questions and the sort. 100 dumplings was a slight exaggeration, she probably topped out at around 60-65. I'll also start taking pictures of all my food from now on so you guys have a good idea of what we're eating and the size of my portion. I'm meeting with a friend tomorrow to do some shopping for friends back home, and she's insisted on tagging along. I smell a story in the horizon. "

1i2uzn,16,2013-07-11,[Discussion]Black Swan,dragonsky,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/1i2uzn/discussionblack_swan/,"So one week ago I saw the movie Black Swan. I wanted to talk about it with someone and after I bored my friends with my ""OMG THIS MOVIE IS GREAT"" I decided to talk with someone on the internet about it. So I remembered that this place exists and it is full of amazing people so I said why not post it there :)

IMO the most important thing when seeing movies is expectations. Expectations will determine how much you enjoy the movie. In the last month I've been going to movies without seeing trailers and without any big expectations. By doing this I enjoyed like every movie I've seen in the last month. For example I really enjoyed The Internship. It made me feel good after I exit the cinema. I knew nothing about the movie (well I knew Vaughn and Wilson were in it and the idea of the movie but I haven't seen the trailers). After the movie I realized that the movie was one of the corniest movies I've ever seen and I really enjoyed it. It had every cliche but I didn't mind it cause I didn't have any expectations for the movie.

So back to the Black Swan. Here they had a kind of ""festival"" where they reshowed movies from the past year or so. The prices of the tickets were low and I preffer seeing movies in cinema than at home so I said why not  go and see a movie that had some Oscar nominations. 
Basically here is what I knew/expected about the movie:

""So the chick from Pirates of Caribbean is in it (I mix Keira with Natalie), and she had a lesbian scene with Mila Kunis, and  she is a ballerina. This should be a drama movie about ballet which on some weird sophisticated hipster way tried to win some Oscars and I doubt that I will like it."" Then I heard some couple talking that Natalie Portman was actually in the movie and I realized that I mixed Keira and Natalie one more time. 

Then I grab the program and I saw that they listed the movie as a thriller. I was confused by this but I thought ""heh they would list everything as thriller to atract people these days"".

And the movie began ""So there is a ballerina dancing, ok, this is what I expected.Cool music. This is the Swan Lake right ? Ok..more dancing...WOW What kind of monster was that ?! I did not expect that one...! ""

And that was only the beginning. Since that moment I was 100% into the movie. I was feeling the movie, and I can rarely say this. I won't continue to talk about the movie cause I might spoil something but I'll say that the phrase ""finger biting"" was not only a phrase. With every scene I was more confused as to how the movie could end. And then at one moment I realized ""Wait Kunis and Portman should have sex scene.How the fuck would that make sense in this movie? How would they made that one happen when there are roughly 40mins until the end of the movie and there is nothing going on between Kunis and Portman"" And while I'm on that topic let me tell you that the sex scene is the most intense sex scene in history of movies (movies I've seen at least), some might say that they put that scene to attract male audience but that's wrong, cause the scene is really good.

There is also a disco scene and I always love disco scenes in movies cause I like seeing characters having good times, but this scene was fucking intense. Every minute of the movie is intense. You know how in some horror movies you expect something to jump ? Like there is music in the background and when the music reaches its climax something happens. In this movie when the music reaches its climax nothing happens and its more scary and intense than anything jumping into the camera. 

After the movie I started to ""learn"" more about the movie and I loved it even more. I found out [this](http://cinematiccorner.blogspot.com/2012/02/48-hidden-images-in-black-swan.html?fb_action_ids=10201437559123626&amp;fb_action_types=og.likes&amp;fb_source=timeline_og&amp;action_object_map=%7B%2210201437559123626%22%3A10150583960755053%7D&amp;action_type_map=%7B%2210201437559123626%22%3A%22og.likes%22%7D&amp;action_ref_map=%5B%5D) article about the movie and now I love the disco scene even more, I can only imagine how hard was it to film and edit the movie. I really like Aronofsky as a director and after this movie he might become my fave director. After this movie I know how most of /r/movies (or reddit in general) feels about ""Requiem for a dream"", a movie that is so good but people only want to see it once cause they can't bring themself to seeing the movie again.

So RAOA have you seen the movie ? Did you liked the movie?

P.S. This movie became my second fave movie of all time (1st being Fight Club and 3rd Forrest Gump)"
1i2ltf,2,2013-07-11,My girlfriend [21F] cheated on me [21M]. What do I do?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1i2ltf/my_girlfriend_21f_cheated_on_me_21m_what_do_i_do/,"My girlfriend and I have been together for nearly 3 years. We were each other's firsts and we've talked about everything, including getting married. She's always been the stronger one in the relationship - ""I'll love you forever"" and getting angry at rational thought about how things could go wrong and the like. I'm always considered myself pretty lucky for a girl like that.

Three semesters ago she spent the semester in France. Long-distance was hard, but we got through it.

This summer she took an internship across the country and is living with a family there. They have a college-aged son living at home. She called my Sunday to say that she had kissed him. She didn't feel anything for him, but she was scared about how serious we were after three years and after having never dated anyone else and not spending a lot of time single, she wanted a break to be independent. I wasn't real hip on the idea, but saw she needed to figure some stuff out, so we said we'd talk in a week.

I called her tonight too frustrated to wait. It turns out in the time between, she ended up giving this guy a blow job and he fingered her (this was all in one setting, not over several encounters).

I've never been more angry in my life, but she feels awful. I've never seen her so upset.

She's going to put her foot down with this guy, but I don't know what I'm supposed to do. They'll still be living together. I want to forgive her - three years is a long time and it's been a great three years. We've never had problems like this before. But I'm not going to see her until the second week of August when I had planned on flying out there.

I know Reddit is pretty vengeful when it comes to unfaithful/ex SOs, but I could really use some advice. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Am I an idiot for wanting to give her a second chance? Should I? Is it unreasonable for me to ask her to seek other living arrangements and find other people to hang out with? She doesn't have a lot of friends out there at this point, making it tough.

**tl;dr**: Girlfriend cheated - is it worth forgiving?"

However, I love lifting weights, I love the soreness, the growth and the visible progression. I use them as a reward for cardio. I am concerned that I should be more focused on weight loss though given that I am over 300 lbs still and want to get that down. Should I continue doing both cardio and strength training?

She has been told by the IT manager that he would love to have her as a full time employee once she graduates HS and he would provide a real apprenticeship opportunity.  I always assumed she would go to college; but, it seems like this may be the way to go.  She gets to learn on the job, has time to expand her knowledge and also mature as an employee.

SP: Thank you!  What have the last few months been like since having to leave the RWF?

JM: Complicated.  That's the best I can do on that.  I've been really busy with... a lot of things, but I have to say, I miss being in that ring, doing what I do best for my fans and hell, even those people who hate me, I miss it all.

SP: What do you miss the most?

JM: The free tubes of Quaker Meats.  I mean, holy crap, Scott ate every bit of the ones I had saved up.  Can someone please hook a brother up?

JM: Yeah, Scott is like my little brother, and he's been doing a ton of editing and working hard on his film career and documentary of yours truly.

SP: Any release date on that documentary?

JM: Hopefully just in time for the holiday season.

SP: Have you been following RWF since leaving?

JM: To be honest, the first few weeks were tough, and I wasn't watching any wrestling, then one Saturday morning Dawn was watching the RWF.com replay of that weeks Battleground on her RWF.com app and she got me to start watching again.  It's her thing now, too, watching wrestling, getting into wrestling like I did when I was first starting out.

SP: How is Dawn?

JM: She... umm...  she's great, and she's been doing a ton of physical and speech therapy and is blowing the minds of all her doctors.  She has her moments, but let's be honest, don't we all?

SP: Is there any truth to the rumor that Dawn isn't your real sister?

JM: I'm not at liberty to talk about the current situation, can we change the subject real quick?

SP: Sure, since you have been following, who do you have a close eye on? Any favorites?

JM: I'm a huge Storms mark.  I think once he finds his pace, he's going to be huge in the RWF.  I've also always had nothing but the utmost respect for Mikko Paatalo and Sara, and I hope his lost to that Vecna derp doesn't detract him from the championship he deserves.

SP: Not a fan of Lord Vecna?

JM: He needs to pick a real language and stop talking to inanimate objects.  I can't, however, take away what he brings to the ring.  I'm surprised that he already has a championship, but you know how those things come and go.

SP: Have any of the new talent catch your attention?

JM: Does Lili LaFontaine count?  I know she isn't new new, and is a dominant Woman's Champion, but come on, can I pick her as a favorite?! Please?!

SP: Sure you can!

JM: I'm waiting to see big things from the whole roster in the coming weeks, and that pay per view? Holy crap, what a main event, and that war games trio match?! Whan that was announced my pants may or may not have exploded in excitement! It'll be great to watch that with Dawn and Scott like old times.

SP: Your pick on those matches?

JM: I think RJ has come a long way, but no disrespect to him, my money is on Steel to retain.  I'll also let you in on a little secret, under my jacket I'm wearing a Hurtsville Express shirt.  They're my pick in what is going to be a match of the year candidate for sure.

SP: You think there will be a Moshe sighting at Gold Rush or maybe another RWF event?

JM: I can't make it to Gold Rush, but me and the crew will be watching from home.  Probably live tweeting like I do every show.  Other than that, maybe the Board can get a hold of me to bring a PPV to the Verizon Center in Washington DC.  Hell, I couldn't say no to a PPV in my backyard, right?

SP: Well, thank you Justin for taking your time out to answer some questions for the RWF and what have to be your fans waiting with baited breath for your return.

JM: Serena, you are a doll, and be sure to let Lili know she's got a fan here in DC.  Also, for all my fans out there, remember just because I'm not there doesn't mean you're still not living in the Year of Moshe.

*RWF.com can report that 6 weeks after leaving the RWF to help his sister, Dawn Moshe, in rehabilitation after coming out of a coma, an unnamed woman from Alberta came forward and filed a court report saying Dawn Moshe is actually her daughter who was kidnapped more than twenty six years ago.  There is an current investigation into these reports and no open information, we'll continue to update the RWF.com fans on this court case.  RWF.com would like to personally thank Justin Moshe for his time with this interview.*"

The company is in the field of electronics.
Can work well with a global team.
Strong excel and written/oral skills.
Provide analytical expertise to demand management requests.
Candidate is pre-MBA.

Any help would be appreciated. I messed up in college and did no internships or really networked. Therefore, I feel that I need to ace this interview and make a great impression because of my lack of experience.  If this is the wrong subbreddit for this, please downvote."
1i1p73,4,2013-07-10,Refreshing my excel knowledge,ludwis,excel,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/1i1p73/refreshing_my_excel_knowledge/,"Hey everyone, 

I used to do work with excel in a very basic way during some internships and summer jobs while in university. Well now I'm done with uni and I'm starting a job where I'm going to be working with excel quite heavily. 

I studied economics, so while I'm very comfortable with stata and matlab, I realized that I'm not very good with Excel.

After a rather long time searching jobs I scored quite a good job (which I'm very, very happy about, because now a days it isn't that easy in the region I'm living), which will require a lot of Excel work, especially in the first years. So getting ready to start my job in September, I want to get up to date with the program. 

Are there any good online courses or books (was thinking ""excel for dummies"" or something similar), with which I can relearn the basics of the program? I'm going to be working with bigger spread sheets. I'm tight on cash (guess that isn't surprising coming out of university), so any education free of charge would be great. 


I'm going to start my first job, for which I searched rather long, and any help would be appreciated."
1i6rv5,3,2013-07-12,"[24M] with my [24F] of 2 1/2 years, cheats and leaves, still confused.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1i6rv5/24m_with_my_24f_of_2_12_years_cheats_and_leaves/,"I'm going to attempt to be succinct because the amount of relevant info is quite large.  Ex-Girlfriend and I in big city in TX met via online dating website in feb 2011.  she had just moved back from Hollywood (followed a guy there in 2009).  I had moved up to big city for work after finishing my masters in small city in mid-2010. 

Guy she was with before me was 2 years of grief.  Dragged her out to Cali w/ no family or friends nearby.  He didn’t encourage her to do anything with her life (she was unemployed for a year just sitting at the apartment).  He made no money, couldn’t keep a job, worked at a popular porn production company, stayed out at work until midnight (at the studio) all the time.    Wouldn’t tell her when he was coming home or answer her calls sometimes. Super hypochondriac and constantly in the hospital for nothing.   Didn’t have a car. Late rent payments all the time.  Emotionally distant and never around. And then she found out he was emailing intimate pictures to transvestites on Craigslist and planning meetings with them. This is NOT the ex that is referred to later.

So she breaks up with him, moves back to big city in TX, then we get together only a few months later.  Whirlwind romance, july 2011 I ask her to move back to small city with me.  She wasn't going anywhere and wanted to go back to school.  I'm from small city so I miss my friends and family, and the school is one of the better ones in the area and cheap.  She agrees, we move back, goes to school.  Rooms with 2 other girls and I end up staying over all the time (though I live w/ my mom I am only over there every couple weeks if that).  Roommates don't like this.  So when renewal comes up, she gets her own place.  I stay over all the time.  Basically end up living there but no agreement made to live together, just sort of happens.  fall 2012 I ask her if she wants to make it official and I sign on the lease.

At this point her parents move several states away.  She's super sad about this.

It's time for internship (fully paid) so I help her go get clothes and practice and write her resume.  She goes to (other big city) to interview.  I go out there every time and stay at hotels with her and help her dress professionally in the morning, drive her to and wait around all day and pick her up from interviews.  She lands 3 out of 4 offers.  Takes one.  I go back to small city.  She stays there for internship - with some family I have in that city, to save rent money.  Supposed to run january to may.  so 5 months of long-distance.  We agree that we can make it through this OK.

She drives back every weekend for the first 2 months.  I would drive too but she wants to be at her own place not in the city anymore.  I offer every time but she prefers to drive.  She starts growing more distant each time.  Attempt every time to talk about it but she shuts down.  Then march she has a really big health crisis (out of the blue).  I immediately leave work and drive the 3 hours to be by her side in the hospital.  I bring her food and I hang out with her and I tell her jokes and I stay by her side for over a week, missing work (no vacation days).  Her health issue results in no more birth control pills.

So it's beginning of april.  can't resume internship because of health issue so drops it.  I think she'll come home but instead flies to her parent's place.  I'm OK since I think she needs someone to have more time to attend to her and she says probably 2 weeks.  Well 2 weeks later, I ask when you coming home? She says I haven't looked at planes but I'll check tomorrow.  several days later, haven't looked at planes, I'll check tomorrow.  Several days later, I haven't looked at planes, I will check tomorrow.  I finally say well damn, just get a ticket so I know when you're getting back, it doesn't matter when it is.  I'm glad you're having a good time w/ your parents but we have a life here and I've already been waiting several months and I want to take care of you.  Big fight ensues.  Ends up staying a total of 6 weeks.

She gets back, is back for about a week.  Acting strange, won't talk to me about anything.  Asks if she can go back to her original big city to see an old (girl)friend. I say OK and assume it will be a weekend thing.  Ends up staying there Friday until Thursday.  Thursday night, gets back, I ask to see phone because I want to show her a cool feature of the S III, she says ""why you want to see phone"" and I say well for feature but now for curiosity.  Won't show phone.  Help her fix her car (we were on the way when phone thing happened).  Back to our apartment, she breaks up with me.  I leave that night for the weekend.  Come back monday and ask to see her.  She says meet at restaurant.  I say let me come see my dog (she's watching her), she says OK.  I go to the apartment to see dog and then we go to restaurant and talk about things.  Bring her flowers.  Really sweet.  I think it goes well.  Go stay at my mom's place.  

Next day, really sick at work and I ask if I can swing by apartment before I head home.  Only live a few minutes away so I'm there before she answers text.  I find her ex-boyfriend and her hustling him to his car.  Not the previous one.  The first guy she ever dated.  Her original ex.  He left her 5 years ago.  He says I came down to surprise her today but she wants me to leave.  I tell him to stay.  I talk to him and to her and I say I can't believe all this stuff is happening.  Go inside to vomit because of illness and find pregnancy test in trash can (literally nothing else in can so it's not like I rooted around in there).  Now I know it's not just him surprising her and her rebuffing him.  We haven't had sex since before health crisis since no birth control.

She fesses up finally and says that he came down Friday after I went out of town and has been there the whole weekend.  That means that Monday she agreed to meet at restaurant, she didn't invite me over because he was here.  And when I did come over, he must have just driven around the block and hid while I was there.  After several hours of talking I leave and he stays over.  The next morning he heads back to big city (he lives about 4 hours away).  She begs to go to lunch with me that morning and I agree and we talk about it and she says that she'll end it with him if I'll give her another chance.  I ask to finally see her phone and she's obviously deleted most of his texts, but there's a few about how amazing their life together is going to be, and about 15 pictures of them together.  I throw the shit out of her phone and it shatters all over the place - This is the only violence I have ever shown her during this entire ordeal and during our entire relationship.  I am very reserved in that regard.  I end up buying her a phone a couple days later since I broke hers (a better phone than she had before.)

She calls him from my phone that night and says she needs time and he needs to respect her space and she's going to try things with me.  Stays with me for a week.  Make her go get STD panel.  We have a really great time and I think maybe it's worth working through.  I can see our old relationship coming back.

I get a copy of a relationship book and tell her to read it too.  Get her a copy as well.  She had already bought tickets to go to see her parents again before all this happened so she went back there.  I told her that she needs to be here working on things with me if I am going to get past everything.  She leaves anyway.  We have 2 2-week periods where I don't talk to her so she can ""think about things"" but I think she talks to guy.  Turns out that when she was with her parents the first time, and made me feel bad about wanting her to come back, she had been talking to him for several hours a day and FaceTiming and everything.  That's why she didn't want to come back and that's why I felt weird and like she was being distant and unresponsive.

After these periods where we have time apart, I say I think we should just break up and make it official. She agrees but wants to stay friends.  We talk about everything again and I say no way, No Contact.  Three days later she emails me and I reply back raging about why she broke No Contact when I told her she could text my mom about anything she needed from me.  It wasn't for anything important.  Then she replies and says she's sobbing and she made a huge mistake and she wants me back and will do anything for me.  So I wait a day for her to settle down and talk to her and she says she still wants to talk to me and try to work through everything.  I keep talking to her for another week. 3-4 hours on phone each night.  I'm acting on assumption that she's not talking to the ex but turns out she was the whole time, for several hours a day too.

I finally say make a damn decision, she says I choose the ex.  I say goodbye.  That was a week ago and we haven't talked.  I'm still in the apartment and she's still at her parent's for another 2 weeks.  I'm moving out tomorrow and giving my mom the keys so I don't have to see her again.

I guess my main question is what's normal for my feelings at this point?  Was I stupid to believe her and to give her the chance to even try things again?  I felt SO TERRIBLE the entire time she was going back and forth with me.  It was about a month and a half where I couldn't even wake up in the morning and I started coughing up blood and getting extremely stressed and having issues at work.  But since the latest NC (it's been a week) I really don't feel that bad.  I've had time to reflect on everything and before I felt like she was perfect and I just wanted her back in my life; now I think a lot of other things about her.  I was hoping to get some outside perspective on it from people not invested in the relationship.  I have a lot of family and friends who have rallied around me to support me during this time but I want a less biased opinion if possible.

Also right before the NC, she asked if she could change her mind and still have a shot with me.  I said super unlikely but she said that she will call me in a month from the date of the NC.  She is going to spend 2 weeks w/ her parents then 2 weeks with the guy and then she wants to re-evaluate everything and make a decision then.  I say this is BS and unfair and I can't believe she asks me that.  But I kind of lose the will to say no on this one and I say I don't expect a call but I will answer if you call.

Should I answer if she calls?  My gut says HELL NO.  Me 2 weeks ago would've said HELL YES.  I'm not sure what me in 2 weeks will think.

I know they say love is unconditional and all but I think we can agree that it's usually not.  And I can't comprehend why she would leave me for this guy.

Me

masters (perfect undergrad GPA, high honors for grad) in super in-demand field
already making almost 70k a yr at 24 years old - had an offer for high 70's salaried with big bonus but rejected so she would be able to finish school (required relocation).
no debt at all.  2 paid off cars (I love cars), paid my own way through school working the whole time, took several classes above recommended workload each semester.  Finished my masters a month after I could legally drink.  Paid off all school loans myself already.  Helped her out financially with everything.
fairly fit, a bit more chubs since I met her though (she eats a lot more junk than I used to, and started me on them.)  Tall, dark and handsome (kinda).
I've got money in the bank, planning on buying a house for us so we wouldn't have to live in apartments anymore.
I'm super sweet.  I make incredibly good food AND wash the dishes (she's supposed to but doesn't).  Always make time for her.  Always help her when she needs anything.  Never unfaithful.  Never even talked to other girls - she was offended by my having female friends so I broke contact with them for her.  Thought she was incredibly sexy and always showed it. I told her how much I loved her every day. 
Drink one beer every few months with food.  No smoking, no drugs.  Super smart and into all kinds of hobbies.  Just got ham radio license.  Build my own audio equipment.  Write mobile apps and websites.  Very sociable and tons of friends (who I never got to see when I was with her because she's so introverted and jealous.)  Play Guitar and Piano proficiently.  Into mixing/mastering.  Getting pretty good at photography.

Him

barely high school educated, works at coffee shop as barista for 6 years. used to get drunk constantly, even by himself at home. depressed. morbidly obese.  not an exaggeration either.  she said the same thing. short. unreasonably obsessed.  she found posts of his talking about her and how much he missed her before they even started talking - they broke up 5 years ago!!

got a tattoo of them when she wasn't even talking to him
no hobbies other than writing which he won't do anything with
wants to maybe someday become a bartender

She has mentioned she thinks she can get him to lose weight and start submitting his writing to places and get a better job.


I just don't see what she sees in him.  His value from an absolute standpoint seems extremely low to me.
 
Is she trying to fix the relationship because it didn't work out and she doesn't know why?  Is she afraid of how good things were going with us?  Weigh in and let me know.

Oh and this whole time we have been together, she has talked about getting a job but never has.  Her longest job was retail for 6 months and she's been unemployed most of her life.  And during our last talk she mentioned she might not be able to finish school so she may give up on that too.

---- 
tl;dr: girlfriend cheats with ex, breaks up with me, wants me back, doesn't want me, wants me back, doesn't want me, No Contact.  Did I let this go on too long? Should I have left earlier?  Should I give her another chance if she asks for it?  Why would she cheat on me for such a crappy guy?"

I recently came across that quote while looking for jobs after graduating this past December. I haven't had much luck at all. It doesn't help that I graduated with a BA in Communications -- don't worry, I know the whole shtick now, I get it. I was fucked from the start. Yet, I've tried to make the most of it. Even though I've had two successful internships in higher education and non-profit work, I have yet to find any source of stable income. I feel that I have failed, seeing my friends becoming accountants, engineers, animators, math teachers, etc., and I am ashamed to talk to a few of my oldest friends because I don't have a career. I am almost 24 and have nothing to show for myself. I am nothing.

It's just, so many things could be solved if I had a job, or knew how to focus or even simply *find* something. I have searched on countless job sites for higher education, looking for admissions counselor jobs (which is what I'd like to be since I had an internship in admissions and it was pretty fun). Literally, nothing. I hate not having a purpose. I have even networked with university presidents, major gifts officers at ivy-league schools, as well as directors of fundraising. I get the same answer every time: ""Don't worry, you'll get something eventually. You're a bright kid"". 

I don't even try to go on dating sites anymore because one of the main questions people ask is ""What do you do for a living?"" and I don't want to become even more ashamed of myself by telling that to attractive women who expect a man to have his shit together. I visit my parents and do work around the house for them for simple food-and-gas money, and I volunteer at a well-known non-profit near my home, but I lack the main motivation to do much anymore because I don't get paid. I am humiliated by myself in these aspects. I like to think my resume and letters of interest and references are pretty good, but it never produces any results. All this shit, for nothing. I waste space, air and resources daily, and cannot give back to the community through working, even though I want to desperately.

I feel like the scum that dirt shits out; I am lost without a job, and can't get a job because fuck me. This was not a good week and I really just wanted someone to read this because clearly I am somehow unable to help myself. I am the child. Fuck.

It was a card to replace a chair I had under warranty for $300. I know 100% she did it, but my evidence isn't 100% conclusive in the eyes of the law (as far as I know).

Staples was able to track the usage of my gift card and pull up the receipt and then bring up a picture of her from their security footage. Unfortunately it only shows the back of her but the description the employees gave matches her perfectly and the clothing she is wearing in the picture matches what she was wearing. She is also only 1 of 2 people I told about it, and the other is my room mate who doesn't even own a Mac (all three products bought were Mac related) plus he wouldn't do that to me since we've been friends for awhile now and this other intern has only been here about a month.

Since I don't have an image of her face, I'm waiting for our building's security to get back to me. Hopefully they have an image showing at least what she was wearing that day and hopefully that's enough for the police to check her apartment where they will definitely find the stuff she bought.

Plus, one of the things bought was a wireless keyboard, and coincidentally the day after the purchases were made she brought her own keyboard in from work since our keyboards are crap. It's so interesting that the day after the purchase, she doesn't need her keyboard at home. 

Regardless of security's response I'm going to the police during my lunch break today. Tried last night but they were closed.

I am so fucking pissed off. I don't understand why anyone would risk their $24.20 an hour job with Sony for a $300 gift card. I mean, that's two days of work...

I guess she thought it would be untraceable. I can't wait to get her fired and arrested.

Thanks for reading, just so hard to be patient when my blood is boiling."

&gt; Be me, age 20

&gt; Get a reasonably prestigious temporary internship (yay!) in a city far from home (shit, gotta get a place to stay and the internship doesn't pay at all)

&gt; Uncle lives there with my cousin (also 20.) He offers to let me stay in his house for the six weeks

&gt; awwwthx.jpeg


I should mention that, when my uncle offered to let me stay over the phone, I hadn't seen my uncle or my cousin in person for a couple of years because I live far away and they don't travel very much. 

&gt; Fly to the city, bright-eyed and excited to start my new job

&gt; Uncle (who's a 45 year old man with a bit of a beer gut, but nothing out of the ordinary)  picks me up from the airport

&gt; ""Where's Cousin?"" I ask

&gt; ""She didn't want to come,"" he says, ""She was tired.""

&gt; shrug.gif

&gt; Oh well, I'll see her when we get to the house

&gt; Arrive at house, see cousin for the first time in three years

&gt; She is sprawled out on the futon in front of the television, watching Duck Dynasty, eating a giant bag of Ruffles chips and drinking from a two-litre of Mountain Dew

&gt; Cousin is 5'6"", and was about 170lbs when I last saw her, but has easily ballooned to at least 250lbs

&gt; ""Hey,"" she says, not even looking up from the TV.

&gt; fuckingrude.bmp

&gt; ""Hey!"" I respond. ""It's been a while, how have you been?""

&gt; Cousin grunts

&gt; I press on

&gt; ""How's community college?"" I ask, knowing that she is in community college. ""I heard you were studying film.""

&gt; ""It sucks,"" she says. ""I failed three of my classes this semester.""

&gt; Failed three classes

&gt; At community college

&gt; Studying *film*

&gt; I cover my disdain and try to be polite

&gt; ""That's a shame,"" I say. ""How's everything else going?""

&gt; Cousin grunts

&gt; ""Well, my stupid *dad* says I have to get a job.""

&gt; ""Well, yeah, that's frustrating, the market is pretty terrible right now, especially in entry-level stuff.. Do you need any help looking for a job?"" I ask, wanting to help this suffering blob of humanity. ""I worked retail last year, I know a few tips that can make it easier...""

&gt; ""NO,"" she says. ""I can handle it myself.""

&gt; okay.jpeg

&gt; I leave to unpack

&gt; Cousin continues watching tv

Later that week, I come home from work and Cousin is, again, lying in front of the tv, watching garbage, and playing with her phone. 

&gt; ""Hey,"" I say. ""What are you up to?""

&gt; ""Twitter,"" she says. ""I fucking love Twitter.""

&gt; lol.ok

&gt; ""I have Twitter too,"" I say, trying to hold a conversation. 

&gt; ""WHAT'S YOUR USERNAME,"" she roars.

&gt; I tell her

&gt; She follows me

&gt; I politely follow her back

&gt; She swells with glee at the thought of gaining a follower

&gt; Wasn't sure that swelling was possible for her but apparently I was wrong

&gt; clearly has not been looking for a job, or looking for anything other than her next meal

&gt; Uncle is clinically depressed, clearly doesn't give a shit

&gt; get depressed, stop reading

&gt; vow to periodically check in for chances of Schadenfreude

The job I worked at was absolutely phenomenal-- fascinating, compelling stuff in my field, and I feel really privileged to have been given the chance to do it, if only for a few weeks, unpaid. The days are really long but I don't mind because it's so interesting. I usually get home from work at about 7pm, but one day I got home at 9:30pm.

&gt; get home

&gt; feel super tired and also hungry

&gt; cousin lying in front of tv, eating chips and watching TLC

&gt; judging by the dirty plates, empty bags of chips and bottles of pop scattered around she's been there for at least a few hours

&gt; Don't even bother with the half-hearted ""hey"" today, just sit down and order some supper because I am hungry

&gt; Allergic to gluten and dairy so I get some sushi

&gt; luvdatfish.ohyeah

&gt; wait impatiently for sushi to arrive

&gt; fifteen minutes pass

&gt; sushi arrives!

&gt; get ready to eat

&gt; Cousin is angered by the arrival of food not intended for her consumption

&gt; ""Why didn't you order anything for me?"" she bellows.

&gt; gotta feed dat beetus 24/7

&gt; ""I saw that you'd already eaten,"" I say, gesturing at the mess of dirty dishes she is literally wallowing in.

&gt; She is clearly furious, but idgaf because a gurl's gotta eat dat supper

&gt; After supper I go to meet a friend

&gt; While on the bus to her house, I decide to read Cousin's twitter

&gt; 20 minutes earlier: ""CAN U STOP ORDERING FOOD AT MIDNIGHT, BITCH""

&gt; [MFW] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/you-talkin-to-me.gif)

&gt; *it wasn't even midnight you crazy sea cow*

&gt; hang out with friend

&gt; have a good time even though I am filled with the blinding hot rage of a million suns

&gt; return a few hours later

&gt; Cousin still lying in the same position but has clearly eaten more food, because there is more food detritus

&gt; Too frustrated with her fatlogic and her laziness to deal with it any more

&gt; ""Listen,"" I say, ""If you have a problem with something that I'm doing, you should say it to my face or shut the fuck up about it.""

&gt; She fakes incredulity

&gt; ""WAT R U SAYIN WAT R U TALKIN ABOUT""

&gt; ""I thought your tweet was rude and very middle school, frankly. I didn't order you any supper because I don't feel comfortable enabling your eating habits.""

&gt; she seems surprisingly unflustered by this statement

&gt; ""Oh, OP,"" she says. ""Don't worry. While you were gone I walked to the corner store to get a snack. I might like to eat, but I certainly get my exercise!""

&gt; corner store is literally closer than the bus stop I just walked from

&gt; wat.gif

&gt; ""Well, I'd appreciate it if you didn't write stupid shit about me online. Especially when I'm sitting in the room with you. It's rude.""

&gt; ""BUT I WAS ONLY JOKING OP, CAN'T YOU TAKE A JOKE""

&gt; *a joke like your life though?*

&gt; ""It wasn't funny. You're not twelve, just fucking stop, okay?""

&gt; she shrugs

&gt; teehee.senseofhumour

&gt; give up and go to bed

TIME PASSES

&gt; four weeks have passed

&gt; job still hard work but awesome

&gt; Cousin still fat and lazy

&gt; Still hasn't found a job or even bothered to look for one

&gt; Still tweets rude shit about my being a ""bitch,"" complains about not having any money, feeling fat, periodically links to HAES blogs, wishing she had a more interesting life, feeling depressed, etc.

&gt; Only eats chips and watches tv all day

&gt; My job ends after six weeks

&gt; thx4themmrs.docx

&gt; Thank my uncle, go home

&gt; Realize that I hadn't ever seen my cousin leave the house in the full six weeks that I lived there, and had only ever seen her stand up to go to the bathroom/get more food

&gt; gag

&gt; vow never to live with a hamplanet again


TL;DR-- went to stay with my uncle and my hamplanet cousin; cousin does literally nothing for six weeks; tries to use social media to be rude to me and goes into full on hamlogic when I call her out."

[I've always felt that it is such a *huge* bureaucracy that it would be frustrating to work there. Also, I've felt that it is an organization that has quite a bit of bark but not bite in real world terms.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb16zky?context=5)|There is a LOT of corruption. I've heard stories of high-level UN staff with huge titles misusing money, making travel plans that are not justified, and using the money allocated for hotels (during their travel) to pocket in cases where they don't stay in a hotel but stay with a friend. Those are just some examples that my seniors have told me about.   DEFINITELY way removed from the ""real world"", or as we call it, the ""field"". For example, there are often resolutions put forward advocating for safe&amp;legal abortions, access to free contraceptives, etc. I agree with these, and that it is arguably part of every individuals human rights to have access to these. However, you cannot impose these measures (or expect countries to adopt them) in countries that are religious or conservative. Not sure if that's a good example?  Long story short, I've learned that the UN isn't as prestigious as I had originally dreamed it would be as a student. I've learned that after I finish graduate school, I probably don't want to work at headquarter level, for all the reasons listed above. Maybe the country offices are better, since they are closer to the on-the-ground realities.
[What did you study? how did you get such a nice internship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb14xpg?context=5)|I did a Bachelor degree from Canada with a major in International Relations. Right now I am doing my Masters in the same topic. During both degrees I was active in student life, made an effort to get to know my profs (that's where the reference letters come from, it helps to have known a prof for longer, and helps if you did well or were in a leadership position there, such as a class representative), and took part in research projects and clubs.
 |I got the internship by stalking names of directors of UN offices I wanted to work at, and emailing them my resume, cover letter, a one-page description of the program I am in (it is a new program), and a formal 500 word Personal Statement type essay describing why I want to work at that office in particular. I would reference specific names, projects, branches, wherever possible - personalized it as much as I could. When I didn't get a reply, I would call (it's worth the cost in international charges), and I faxed many offices my application as well.
 |In about two months or so, I had four offers from UN agencies for a summer internship. Two in Bangkok, one in Jordan, and one in Geneva, which I accepted. I had another informal offer in Vietnam as well, but by then I had decided I would be in Geneva in the summer.
 |*Edit - spelling.
[Do you speak French? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb18x5m?context=5)|A little bit.  I can understand most things, and speak enough to get by. English translation is available at all meetings/conferences, so there isn't too much pressure to know French. I know I should work on it though.
[U of T, Trinity College? I'm assuming Trin cause you did IR and ESL. Hello fellow Trinny :\)!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb1a2uh?context=5)|University College actually :) But I was in Trinity programs, yes. 
[Have you seen any change in behavior from any countries towards the US after the Snowden leaks happened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb16ocy?context=5)|I'm in Geneva, so the General Assembly is not here. It is in New York :) The only time countries interact with each other here is during international conferences. I've been covering one recently, and there has been no talk about Snowden, or any coded political language by the USA on this topic either. The reason for this is probably because the conference I'm attending has a theme of sustainable development and science/technology.
[Snowden used to work for the CIA in Geneva. Do you have any fear that the same station he worked at, are actively spying on your offices?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb193dk?context=5)|I didn't know that! The CIA is some creepy shit. I wouldn't be surprised. Good thing that if they spied on me, all they would find is my reddit history. Hehehehheee...
[Any particular reason why you chose the Geneva internship rather than the ones offered at Bangkok and Jordan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb156eq?context=5)|The offers at all other locations were focused on research, whereas the duties for this one included attending inter-agency meetings, major international conferences, and liaison with country offices around the world. Research is cool, but it's something that I can do from my laptop anywhere. Geneva has 22 international organizations here. The networking opportunities, and opportunities for exposure to the ""real world"" of international relations just didn't compare to the other offers that I had. 
[Interns aren't paid, right? So how are you supporting yourself? Savings or parents?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb15am5?context=5)|Yes, the UN does not pay any of its interns, pretty much anywhere in the world. My school gave me some money to cover like 40% of the cost of living here. I also had some savings. 
[The ""real world"" of international relations. This is the story of  representatives from 192 countries, picked to live in a small European city and have their lives taped. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb19n0l?context=5)|I know. Definitely does not represent the real world at all, I agree!
[Goddamit I hate unpaid internships. It's a great opportunity, don't get me wrong, but you ought to get paid for work you do, full stop.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb18z8v?context=5)|Yeah, this idea is gaining a lot of traction/attention these days! I think a local newspaper in Geneva recently wrote about this as well. And there's an official petition going around too.
[So you're on some sort of scholarship, that's cool. How expensive is it to live in Geneva, and what happens if you run out of money - are you allowed to take paid work over there without a work permit? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb15kqa?context=5)|I'm actually not sure! I came here with enough money, so that I wouldn't be in a situation where I run out of money :P It's VERY EXPENSIVE to live here. It's honestly ridiculous. A meal at a restaurant averages around $20. Cheapest coffee is $2.50 (McDonalds). Big mac meal is $15. They charge you for everything here. Even ketchup at McDonalds and tap water at restaurants. 
[Not true - I was an intern at the IAEA in Vienna, and it pays 1000 Euro a month. As far as I know, it's the only UN agency that pays it's interns. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb1ad3k?context=5)|Yup, there are a couple of exceptions. I think the Global Fund also pays their interns.
[Yes, I know it's expensive other there, that's why I asked. I'm surprised really that the UN offices don't have canteens where interns can eat cheaply. I trust you're in some sort of student accommodation? Btw, how long is your internship for and do you plan on travelling a bit while you're in Europe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb15zg0?context=5)|It is 4 months. I have travelled a lot within Switzerland, and been to London and Prague. Next week I'll be going to Rome and Paris :)
[Do you think the U.N. is still relevant or is it more of a barrier to a country's sovereignty?  Wouldn't the incredible amount of money wasted in this organization be put to better use by directly helping countries in need, rather than spending 85% or more of its budget on administrative costs?  Have you been to a lavish party on a mega yacht?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb198ri?context=5)|Haha! I thinkk the admin costs are actually about 14-16%, somewhere around there. Which is really high. I've heard of UN staff not using the money properly, pocketing money given to them for hotels when they stay with a friend while travelling, and other similar stories. I have been to some VERY fancy receptions, but they are always hosted by countries, and not the UN. Still, I don't think it's right - that money can obviously used to save many, many lives. Also, funny you mention a yacht  - there was a reception on a boat last week :/ Again, it wasn't hosted by the UN. But still. It's a goddamn boat. 
[Thanks for doing this! I'm an IS major as well and I would love to work for the UN someday.  What do you plan to do after your internship is over? If its a job at the UN, do you have a specific position you desire?  Also, how essential is foreign language proficiency? The UN careers page requires it, but I was just curious how often it is used in an internship position? I assume its more important for individuals working in the field?  Are many of the people you encounter career UN workers or people doing a few years and going back to their lives at home?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb198uc?context=5)|Hey I've answered the first two! Read the thread :) As for the third question, most I've met are career UN workers, since this is Geneva. If you go in the field, you'll probably meet more staff that are on contracts and will go back home when they are done (or start a new assignment)
[On a related note, what do you know about prior experience for jobs both at the major offices like Geneva as well as the field offices? What type of work experience or volunteer experience would make someone a good candidate for a field office?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb19gpa?context=5)|Honestly, for some field offices sometimes it can be very easy. For the dangerous areas, it's hard for them to get people. But I'm talking about internships. To be honest I can't say much about actually getting hired, except that it seems that most staff get hired after already being in the system. As for work/volunteer experience for a field office - I imagine it would be things like community work or studying related to the issues that the agency you are applying for deals with. As long as in your cover letter you can make a strong connection between your experience and why you want to work there, it should be fine. That's what I did. 
[How long is your internship for?  Do you think unpaid internships are morally correct at places like the UN?  Don't unpaid positions act as a final barrier to poorer candidates, or a final advantage to those who can afford to work without pay? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb18eiv?context=5)|It's for four months. I completely, completely agree with you. It's very unfair. Most of the people who are able to do it are from well-off families. After talking to most people, it turns out most interns come from rich families, have parents in the UN, etc. Most interns I've met are from the USA or Europe. Very few are actually from developing countries. How can the UN serve developing countries if they don't even have proper representation? Those who are from developing countries are from the elite class. In a place like Geneva, only the well-off can afford to live here. It's very unfair, and there is a petition going on to pay UN interns: [Link to www.change.org](http://www.change.org/petitions/make-youth-a-priority-pay-un-interns-a-fair-wage)
[Now that you've got your foot in the door, whats your goal with the internship?  Where do you see yourself in 5 years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb17exx?context=5)|I have no idea! I wish I knew. As explained above, I've kind of come to the conclusion that I don't think I want to work at the UN, at least not headquarter level (i.e. Geneva or NY). I've been considering working for an NGO after I graduate. I think it will allow me to see actual results, and will directly help someone. Here, I feel way too disconnected from the people we are helping. 
[What's the working language or languages there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb17cvy?context=5)|English and French are the main ones. In Geneva there is a lot of French, but almost everyone speaks English as well. For every meeting/conference, there is almost always translation available for English, French, Spanish, and Arabic. I've seen Russian and Chinese translation as well.
[What is your nationality?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb17aus?context=5)|I was born and raised in Canada. 
[Have you ever been ""starstruck"" or stunned/captivated by any of the politicians that have come through your office?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb185hq?context=5)|At the start yes. But now I don't. Whenever I attend a conference, I'm usually surrounded by literally the world's most senior people in their field. It's actually made me a little bit more confident. Titles don't intimidate me anymore, and I'm comfortable just walking up to someone and starting a conversation with them. I've also met people with fancy titles who really don't know much about what they are talking about. It's actually pretty disappointing. So yeah, I don't get starstruck anymore. They're all just normal people. I sat next to the Executive Director of my organization (a major UN organization) and had lunch with him the other day. When he first sat down, I was a bit nervous. But it was chill. As for 'captivated'...I honestly can't say I have felt that way about anyone. 
[How tight are the air ducts? Could a moderately sized person crawl through?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb19pzz?context=5)|It's Friday here and I'm home. I can get back to you Monday afternoon on that. Also just a side note - everyone in Europe is moderately-sized. 
[What are you doing to protect political activists like Snowden?  What are doing to protect the rights of sovereign leaders from being forced out of the air?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb18nm9?context=5)|I'm just an intern, so the direct answer to that question is ""nothing"". And I haven't heard much talk about Snowden here these days. But again, as I mentioned in another post, the General Assembly is in NY, not Geneva. So this isn't the forum where these things would get discussed. In Geneva, Snowden may get discussed at the Human Rights Council, but it is not in session until September. 
[What language(s\) is most business carried out in?  Is working at the UN as cool as you though it would be (seems like a dream job even though you're just an intern\)?  What type of experience do your bosses/colleagues have?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb196pf?context=5)|English and French. I've answered about if UN is as cool as I thought it'd be, read the thread :):) My colleagues/bosses have worked at various other UN agencies before this. Many colleagues start off in the JPO program, which is where your home government pays you and sends you to the UN to get x years experience (contract position). Then the UN hires you (hopefully). 
[What does your job consist of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb176ky?context=5)|I cover international conferences, inter-agency meetings, and sometimes phone meetings with country offices. I take notes and report back. I've also attended several high level debates on the Syrian conflict. I've recently started working on a research project related to reproductive rights. 
[Where are you originally from?  What languages do you speak?  What is your favorite salad dressing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb1abid?context=5)|Born and raised in Canada. I speak English  and a little bit of French (but not enough). Balsamic Vinaigrette. 
[Do you wish to stay at the un and live in switzerland?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb1amf8?context=5)|[This]( http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb18jdd) is my answer to that question!
[Ever read the comic DMZ? You should, it portrays something like the UN in a similar fashion.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb1avdt?context=5)|Nope, link?
[Have you watched Shake Hands with the Devil. How did you feel about UN then and how do you feel about it now - in the same context?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb18mla?context=5)|I actually have not watched or read the book! I did meet Romeo Dallaire though (not at the UN). 
[How did you get this internship? This would be my dream. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb18h7b?context=5)|[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb151gi) is how I got my internship. 
[I know you have already wrote something about unpaid internships issue, but I have similar question.  Why do you think UN internships are unpaid? What's the reason?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb1bzp0?context=5)|That is a great question! I guess the UN has such a big name to it, that almost anyone is ready to do an unpaid internship there, for the obvious resume boost it will give you. I've also always heard that the only way to get a real job at the UN is to ""get into the system"", and the only way to do that is through an internship. I am not sure how true this is, I guess time will tell when I see if my colleagues/classmates end up getting hired by the UN. Also, it majorly, majorly cuts costs for the UN! There is one agency in the building I am at that has THIRTY interns. Imagine that! Thirty, qualified (likely graduate students), individuals doing work 9am-5pm. Unpaid.  In a way, I guess the UN is saving money which could be better spent elsewhere. But still, it really is not fair and disadvantages qualified candidates who cannot afford to do an unpaid internship for months. 
[Thanks for the reply. How much an ordinary UN official makes after 5 years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb1cd79?context=5)|I have absolutely no idea, and it's an awkward question to ask colleagues!
[Who is the most ""powerful"" person you've met while working there?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb19dm7?context=5)|The head of the agency I work for. And some ""Special Rapporteurs"", who are really, really important people.
[What qualifications do you need for that position? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb18bnh?context=5)|You have to be enrolled in a Masters program, and usually they want you to be studying in a relevant field. 
[Sorry I don't mean to negate what you're saying, but I did an internship at the U.N. in Vienna headquarters and neither I nor many of my intern colleagues had a masters.. while it is true that you have to have a masters to work at the UN, in order to intern there that's not the case. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb1afpe?context=5)|I heard that they made a new rule a few years ago that all interns have to be graduate students at least. Almost everyone I've met is a grad student. I've met a couple others, but they got their internships in a very informal way (ex. one knew the office director). That's interesting though, when was your internship?
[Why you work for an evil organization?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb19e3r?context=5)|I ask myself that sometimes too.
[What do you think the over/under is on how many countries are spying on each other in the UN?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb19j0h?context=5)|I'm in Geneva, not New York where the General Assembly is. So I don't have any exciting gossip on that. Geneva is mostly international conferences. Countries interact here too, but its not as political as it is in NY.
[How did you get the internship? I heard that you really have to know people to get into a lot of the UN internships. Did you know someone? Know 20 languages? Bribes? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb19cq3?context=5)|[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb151gi) is how I got the internship. One thing I didn't mention though is that I've met quite a few people who did get an internship through knowing someone or having parents that work in the UN or politics.

[How do you like Geneva? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb18xel?context=5)|I don't like living here, mostly because I am from a big city. I find it too quiet! And way too expensive to live as a student. It's nice to be in Europe and be able to travel easily though.

If you want to live comfortably, it's around $900-$1000? A bus pass per month for anyone under 25 is $45. Food is VERY expensive. Like, I'm talking a dollar an orange, sometimes. There are some budget brands that are cheaper though. Meat is seriously expensive. A meal at a restaurant is minimum $18, at least. A nice restaurant, you're looking at $40 for a plate of food. At restaurants, a little bottle of coke costs around $4.75. If you order tap water, they act like they don't understand what you are asking for and bring you bottled water instead, or they charge you money for the tap water. Main point: it is unaffordable.  
[How old are you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb19707?context=5)|I'm 22, and a graduate student.

[Quick question. Is Geneva sort of the secondary headquarters of the UN or is just the European hub?

Basically, NY is where the General Assembly and Security Council are, and Geneva is where all the major international conferences happen. I think it would also be a better choice for HQ! The main UN building (Palais des Nations) used to be the headquarters of the League of Nations.

It is in New York :) The only time countries interact with each other here is during international conferences. I've been covering one recently, and there has been no talk about Snowden, or any coded political language by the USA on this topic either. The reason for this is probably because the conference I'm attending has a theme of sustainable development and science/technology.

1i547y,0,2013-07-12,"What form rejection means to me - suck it up, buttercup [an essay on getting your ass handed to you]",[deleted],writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1i547y/what_form_rejection_means_to_me_suck_it_up/,"I will share a story that happened to me back while I was at university, writing until all odd hours of the night, raising hell with my friends, so on and so forth. Typical Jack Kerouac nonsense. I was Hot Shit Young Writer at that point, because I was in a bunch of upper level writing classes and receiving, without fail, very high praises and very little criticism from every creative writing and English professor I ever had. My poem the first day of class made my poetry professor cry. I was chosen for a reading at a symposium. I was Billy Badass and Chuck Palahniuk rolled into one.

Needless to say, my ego swelled to roughly the size of New Hampshire. Luckily I come from the South, or I probably would have turned into an insufferable braggart. Instead, I (mostly) just internalized all the compliments until they began to take the opposite of their intended effect and the Ego Bubble burst. Suddenly, I didn’t believe a single nice thing anyone ever said about my work, no matter how sincerely expressed. Work on what I considered to be The Next Great American Novel, the Novel That Defined A Post-9/11 Generation, crawled to a screeching halt. I would do dozens of revisions on any piece I worked on. It’s little wonder that I went into college as a writer and left college as an editor.

However, when I started submitting work and people—random people I didn’t know—started to reject it…I actually loosened up a little. Rejections were a release for me. I let myself lighten up and write shitty first drafts, focusing on output rather than perfection. *This is all one big game,* I thought.

These days I still try to think of rejection that way. If I send a story to someone and they reject it, I try to immediately revise it and bat it back to someone else who might have more use for it. There’s no point in dwelling on rejection, because at the end of the day **it’s not a rejection of you, it’s a rejection of your story. You are not your story, and if you make a life out of writing, you have a gazillion more where that one came from. Suck it up, buttercup: Revise, rebound, and keep writing throughout.** The more you write, the less attached you get to any particular story, which I find greatly decreases the disappointment of rejection.

I still haven’t submitted very much work compared to some people, more due to an intense hatred of the post office than anything else (online submissions are helping me in that regard) but I’ve had my share of form rejections at this point. I’ll share a moment of private humiliation on the off-chance that someone else down the line somewhere decides to share it first at my expense.

Soon after I began submitting stories, I wrote a short story about a serial killer in South Boston called, “A Study in Red."" After receiving quite a bit of positive commentary back on it, I felt myself start to puff up with what can only be described as temporary insanity. I thought, “This story is so good, it could be in *The New Yorker!”* (True story.)

So I sent it. (Also a true story. Stop laughing.)

And they form rejected it. *Duh.* What did I expect? Some no-name twenty-something upstart from Boondocks, Alabama, sends one of the most highly regarded publications in North America a short story completely outside of their intended demographic. No sort of dazzling query letter will save a *faux pas* like that.

And that was the first form rejection I ever received. I’m happy to report that I’ve been form rejected by *Black Warrior Review* too (for a story I’m happy to say was a lot closer to what they were actually looking for). *BWR* is the rag at my alma mater and is also a publication where I happened to intern as a rejectionist/first reader/slushpile minion one summer. So at this point I can cheerfully say I’ve been dumped by the best and the brightest (and several in between). Things can only go up from here.

In short, form rejection happens to everybody. The most important thing to do when it happens to you is laugh it off and move on. The second you let self-doubt constrict your creativity due to the rejection of some random person you don’t even know (who may be rejecting you for a reason that has absolutely nothing to do with you) you’re putting unnecessary limitations on yourself that stifle your growth as a writer.

**Keep the ball in play.**

I figured the former has better job security, better pay, how fascinating it was, and more mentally challenging so I chose that over my 'hobby'.

I couldn't even get an internship so I missed the opportunity to get a real-world feel of the field and gain some experience (I have none whatsoever). 


So great, I have a degree in a field that gives me anxiety (I actually have work related anxiety but thats another story). I could always fall back on my hobby right? Well, I have 0 interest in drawing, painting, anything art related anymore.


So there's nothing left. I have no other interests or hobbies believe it or not, most died off while I was in college. I do not experience that same satisfaction like I did pre-college.


So now what do I do if I cannot enjoy anything? Do I still seek a CS position even though I feel incompetent and lack creativity?

1i4ezn,2,2013-07-11,[20/M] Afraid of intimacy?,Ohe4TheChipper,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1i4ezn/20m_afraid_of_intimacy/,"I think I may have some deep rooted fear of sexual intimacy and a strong natural aversion to intimacy in general. I consider myself a loving person with an open heart toward most. I've been quiet and inquisitive for my whole life but I've made countless meaningful connections over that time. Though those traits can be ""beta"" I have never felt socially excluded or shunned. I've always been good at fitting in. 

For example, I was homeschooled up until the 9th grade. I went into school pretty much knowing no one. I made friends quickly and pretty soon I had a girlfriend. 

This lasted a few months and though we did care deeply for each other, in some ways we were incredibly immature. Having the upbringing I did, I was significantly more sheltered than my peers at this point in my life. She was also a very conservative girl from a family of nuns. We became physically intimate but never sexually active. I broke up with her right before that point and rationalized the move to myself as ""I'm bored of her and I want to move on"" 

Well, time went by. A year or more later I began seeing another girl. She had been dating a good friend of mine for the last 6 months and then she left him for me. 

This was an incredibly low thing of me to do to a friend, but she rationalized the situation so well that it seemed like his fault. I pretty sure he thought it was his fault too, that he deserved this. After all, he never held it against me. We talked about it a little but the point is he's treated me with nothing but respect before and since. I'd also like to add that it's been almost 5 years now and he hasn't had a girlfriend since then (he had many before) and has gradually had his life and mental state crumble over that time. This is the kind of girl I was working with.

Now about my relationship. She and I were incredibly close physically and emotionally. We were truly in love in a way that is completely foreign to anything I've felt towards another person. Everyone who saw us knew there was something special between us. At this point in high school I was on top of my game. By my senior year I was popular, I had a girlfriend I was obsessed with, a nice car (for a kid), and a great life ahead of me. 

Then, of course, things started going downhill. I went away to college and she still had a year to finish up. We went from as much time as possible (and it was a LOT of time for years) together to nearly nothing overnight. 

I went to college near enough to commute home on the weekends. It destroyed my social life at college but I did it almost every weekend (she came here pretty often but her parents didn't allow her much freedom). Things were getting tense between us. She would be going to school soon, probably in a different city or state. Things gradually became more and more strained but I saw it as circumstantial rather than seeing the foundation of our relationship crumbling away (it was).

Eventually she wanted to grow. I wanted to grow too, but I wanted even more to just hold onto the relationship we had forever. 

See, she was incredibly warm spirited. She was sweet to a fault always ready to help anybody. I'm a relatively cold person. I fit in well and make close friends selectively. I would often much rather spend time alone ""progressing"" mentally / physically then spend it in substandard company. 

She brought out that side in me in a way that no one else has ever done. I have always struggled even showing affection to my loving parents or to close friends who I've shared so much with, until we were together. It was as if all that pent up warmth and care and compassion was let out at once. 

When she broke up with me, I was really hurt. I didn't want to get her back because I knew her agenda had changed. Her parents were incredibly strict, so when we were together in high school it was like magic. I was her outlet and she was my damsel in distress. As she got older, she wanted to become everything she could be and make up for lost time. I wanted her to organize her life around our relationship because I was willing to do that for her. That's why she stopped loving me.  I wanted her to feel sorry for this, but she never will. 

Since then I have struggled with depression and anxiety. This began slowly the months leading up to the breakup and has continued to the present day. For a long time I didn't believe that I suffered from these conditions. I thought depression was that ""heart aching"" feeling I had for a night or two right after the break up and anxiety was something only timid old people (like both of my parents) could suffer from. 

Eventually it had grown to a point where managing these conditions became the most difficult part of my life. For about a year my brain shut down and I became apathetic and lazy. I was always a person who cared about concrete accomplishments but I was becoming no one. 

Over this time my GPA dropped from 3.8 to 2.9, I was arrested (first and only time), disciplined for a separate idiotic violation at school (again, first and only time), I was fined and nearly evicted for continued noise violations at my apartment and was placed on probation in the academic program that awarded my full scholarship. 


At this point, I didn't have too many friends. I had managed to keep some people around by peddling tea leaf flowers to the local college kids. I still had my old charm but it took far, far too much energy to muster it and any energy I did have was crippled by periods of severe anxiety. While I had always kept to myself and my own business, at this period I began to openly avoid human contact. 

Around this time I started fucking up in normal social situations that normally I would handle with ease, becoming anxious, scared looking, and unable to process even basic thoughts. Around this point I began to accept to myself that I do suffer from some residual anxiety and depression. I decided I had to get over my last relationship.

Literally the next day after deciding this, I met another girl. This is worth mentioning because my depression over the past few months had kept me from meeting any new women and my anxiety had caused me to drive away many of my female friends. I was too afraid to talk the others because I feared the same. 

This girl was very assertive, slightly awkward and had low self esteem (she was a slut).  The first night she slept over, I couldn't get up. (I was blackout drunk) She didn't mind. She spent the whole weekend with me and I treated her like a princess to spite the image I had of my former lover. 

The thing is, I didn't really like her, and I wasn't attracted to her at all. I managed to get up 1/3 nights and even then it was so awkward because of the first two times that I couldn't get into it. Of course, this made my anxiety much worse. 

Luckily I began an internship at this point. I worked a full time position and had a lot of time to think and I had to meet a bunch of new people. I was still incredibly anxious and depressed but I began to focus my entire life around fixing these things. 

If I had to ""sleep"" for 12 hours to feel rested enough get through my workday with a positive attitude then I'd do that. If I had to spend the time planning through and working up a conversation to prevent myself from blanking mid-sentence I did that too. 

It took another 6 months to pull myself together. Over this time I did little but work my job and work on these issues. This also included working out daily. I had been a long distance runner for many years and gave it up during my depression. I began working out and sprinting. This helps immensely to see my body grow with effort. Over this time I only met older (25-35) women at my job. This was useful because they were often very beautiful so I could work on my anxiety and maintaining rapport without the social pressure of dealing with peers. 

However I didn't make any serious emotional or physical connections with these women, and that is what I still struggle with. 

So we arrive in the present. I'm 20 years old, fit as I've ever been, intelligent, well liked and respected, well rounded etc etc etc I basically have the good life right here before me. I still struggle with these issues but I'm able to overcome them on a daily basis but I've reached a point of serious RESISTANCE internally

I'm afraid or unable to bring women back into my life. I'm good at attracting women. I've been called a master of body language. I walk like no body fucks with me (no body does) I have a great coy sort of  smile that women can't resist. When I'm excited about something, I talk with rhythm and bravado and my mind is always two steps ahead. 

But that's where it stops. I can do everything I can do but I can't do what I can't do. There are several women who stop by from time to time and we talk and they seem interested in me. I captivate them just until it's time for me to make the next move and I fail. 

It's like I know I can't live up to this huge persona that I carry with me and then, the moment I even think about shyness and weakness, I am undone. The conversation gets awkward because I missed a step, she gave me one, and i missed the second chance thinking about the first.  

I'm just not sure where to go from here. I really just want to find one single girl who I could be with. I don't think this is realistic and I feel pressure to raise my sexual activity to reduce depression / increase experience and confidence.

My priority is to grow and break through these phobias at any cost. I just need help on where to go from here. My social circle and preferences lead me to attractive, confident, and sexually experienced girls. My anxiety and relative lack of experience prevents me from making the most of these situations. My anxiety is triggered by girls I'm attracted to, so the girls that I can get are the ones I'm not into. 

**tl;dr**: broken heart and confidence. almost past it but the last bit seems unattainable. how do i find the energy to dominate women when day to day life seems so mundane and seeing an attractive one makes me anxious "

1i8oh4,2,2013-07-13,Advice on how to deal with Client?,AnalyticLunatic,web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/1i8oh4/advice_on_how_to_deal_with_client/,"Hello! I came here looking for some opinions.


I now have a thriving client-base, but my Freelancing all started with one client back in College. She is a nice middle-aged woman who is about 95% computer illiterate. She runs a high-end home decor and floral arrangement business. When we started she had no web presence and I was still learning. I built her an entire static website using html/css for Internship credit, and she liked my work so much we struck a deal for me to remain on retainer and perform updates for $100/month. This price, if she had used me properly, could have been very low pay on my end, but she was uncomfortable calling/emailing/txting me regularly to say what updates she wanted done (in her world, she would have preferred me there in the shop all day to make changes right as new products came in).


After a year the client grew to think the price was too high, and we changed to an agreement of all future work being billed at $10/hr (this was before I grew my client base and is the still-standing agreement, nearly 1/4 of what I charge current clients
).


The client still failed to be in contact regularly, so I would about every 1-1.5 months call her up for some updates. It has now been 3 months since any updates to the site were made to the site. The following is the response I received after contacting the Client:


**""Hi AnalyticLunatic-- I want to thank you for all the help in the past with my website. But, I think I am at the point where I need to manage it myself. Would you please forward to me all the information regarding my website, including any passwords, etc... as soon as possible? Thanks again and I wish you much success in your future endeavors!! -Client""**


I do not believe she has found someone else to take over the site, and if she has, they are someone who is overestimating their own abilities based on what I was charging. It could be as simple as the client believing they can figure out how I make all the html changes for new photos.


I don't need the business any more, but this was my first client (and a good contact since she is married to the President of my bank).


Should I propose the option of building her a CMS so she can upload new content as she chooses, or, play the waiting game to see how long before she comes running back? There is no way this Client can update on her own in the sites current set-up, and I doubt anyone will charge her less than me (especially after the first round of headaches).


Looking for some thoughts/opinions on the situation.


tl;dr Client is ending business with me and I'm trying to decide to propose CMS system for her or play the waiting game until Client comes running back."

Hmm, yeah. So having spent the umpteenth weekend all alone now, I am slowly going insane, haha.

So, I just wanted to ask, how do people make friends?! :S
I have always had a very small number of friends, and they've usually been pretty good friends. I guess you could say I've always been picky about them. But people are moving around (especially myself) a lot, and I am for lots of short periods in areas I don't know many people, if any at all. And I don't know what to do about it.

I am not too angsty about social events anymore, I've done a lot of work there. I even know I can do pretty well if I manage to get into it. But I still know how painfully bad I am at conversing. I just can't ever think of anything to say, the conversation falls dead and we usually don't talk much again.

I should probably join some sort of activity, but I don't know how to find some, or even something I think I would enjoy.
I also often realize how draining I find socialising. I am sooo tired after work every single day that the last think I want is to go somewhere I would have to talk to people :/
I am working an internship right now, so I just go home, make dinner, work out, then bake or surf around reddit/do other hobbies.

I'd also like to say that I've learned quite a bit this past year. I met a guy once who had seen me a few times. He was very interested in people, and he said that he didn't understand me. I was always alone, working or out running. We were drunk so I just told him that it's because I'm not any good with people, but I'm trying to improve. We then talked for quite some time, but what he said was that it was weird talking to me. That it was like I had no mask, no persona I put on, and wearing my insecurity on the outside. And that this makes most people uncomfortable. It is hard to connect with anyone when they feel uncomfortable talking to you. I am not sure what to do about it. It is all I have ever known, but I suspect a bunch of practice might better it, I don't know.

1i873u,7,2013-07-13,Serious doubts after getting accepted,mol3earth,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1i873u/serious_doubts_after_getting_accepted/,"Hi all, 

So, stated simply, I don't know if I have the stamina to continue schooling. 
I just finished with a double B.S. (Geology/Geophysics, and Anthropology). I worked my ass off the past 3 years to get from a 2.9 GPA to a 3.6 (with about 215 hrs total). I overloaded each semester (15 - 22 hrs) and was intently focused on getting into a good grad program, pursuing a PhD and becoming a research professor at a large university. 

Well, without explaining the job outlooks for that direction, I just got done with an internship with a research professor and while I didn't hate it, I can't see myself enjoying that future. First off, way too much desktime, and programming, secondly, so little comes of all this effort. We had Wednesday ""learning"" days, and the researchers, grad students, and profs would bash all these recently published papers. Not sinisterly, but just, ""well, they're methods should be better explained here,"" ""What are they trying to say at all?"" You know, just making me wonder what the point of publishing is, if it's not even taken seriously. 
So, I am in a PhD program (starting in the Fall). And part of me just wants to fuck it all and go work at a coffee shop in a mtn town. Live for fun, and enjoyment. 
Another part says to get the masters, opt out early, and go teach at a community college in a mtn town. 
Third part says, I should finish what I got myself into, maybe I'll enjoy it after all. 

But the bottom lines are, the research prof route leads to stress, living in a place that is dependent upon job opening and your very specific field of study. And just seems so meaningless, so much research just never gets seen or talked about. 


Does anyone else share these thoughts? 

Can I actually drop out before starting? 

What is the experience with all of this for you people?

Thanks"

I'm back with another Hambeast story after she tagged along today when I went to meet a friend from college. Per suggestions, I'm going to give everyone names in order to provide clarity.

**Me**: 5'5""/165cm, 105lbs/48kg, 18 y.o., F. Cousin to the hambeast, visiting Shanghai for an internship and general family love. 

**Hambeast**: 5'0""/152cm, 260lbs/118kg, 19 y.o.,F. Known for being the new Yang Guifei (according to her and no one else), destroyer of dumplings. Will be called **PMM** from now on, because PMM is short for 胖妹妹 in Chinese, or fat sister. 

**VV**: 6'2""/188cm, slim, 19 y.o., M friend from University. Lives in Shanghai, extremely attractive Chinese boy. Also has an equally attractive girlfriend who lives in Beijing. Called **VV** for vroomvroom because he decided it was a good idea to name himself after a motorcycle brand. K. Whatever makes you happy, dude.  

I met up with VV today in order to go shopping. Both of us were looking for League keychains. I can get a miniature Riven sword for 4 bucks? *Sweet*. PMM had heard that I was meeting a guy friend, and insisted on tagging along. Ok, fine. 

&gt;Be me, getting ready to meet friend after lunch. In bathroom, putting on makeup (because makeup is awesome, gais).

&gt;Bathroom mirror cracks

&gt;Floor tiles rattle

&gt;Mascara tube flies out of grasp and into orbit

&gt;Oh god, who put that giant pile of melting pudding there?

&gt;Jk, just PMM. Dressed in a frilly lace top that made her look like a squished cake, and these horrible pink lace crochet shorts that bulged in every way possible. 

&gt;Paired the terrible outfit with an equally terrible pair of white mary-janes. No one even wears those anymore. 

&gt;ohgod.jpg

&gt;""OMG OP WHY DO YOU WEAR MAKEUP""

&gt;""LOW SELF ESTEEM""

&gt;""IF YOU WERE GORGEOUS LIKE ME YOU WOULDN'T NEED MAKEUP""

&gt;That's because I would go bankrupt trying to buy enough makeup to cover the greasebomb you call a face

&gt;I'm not even wearing that much makeup

&gt;BB cream, eyeliner, mascara. 

&gt;Haha, ok, well I like putting on makeup.

&gt;LOW SELF ESTEEM, cries the beached whale

&gt;Ignore her, ask her is she wants to leave for the subway.

Now, I live on the main street, and the subway station is a five minute walk. It's maybe 85 degrees out today, not terrible, and exercise is good. 

&gt;Walk down one flight of stairs, not even out of house yet

&gt;OP IM TIRED

&gt;""The walk isn't that far, it's ok""

&gt;MY LEGS, she cries

&gt;Are being compacted by the giant mound of flesh that is you, I know. Boohoo. 

&gt;Get out the door and cross the street, people turn to wonder why Jubba the Hutt is dressed like a burned lolita doll. 

&gt;I have to stop every thirty seconds for her because she's huffing and puffing and reaching into her bag.

&gt;Pulls out a large bag of chocolate chips (for those who haven't had the glory that is Asian chocolate chips, it's basically milk chocolate molded into the shape of pringles. Delicious, but I can have maybe one or two pieces before I'm done with sweets.)

&gt;Moist smacking of chocolate being devoured hits my ears.

&gt;Bag is crinkling louder than humanely possible

&gt;Keep walking, followed by a large mass of chocolate-destroying, whiny flesh.

&gt;Finally get to the station---it normally takes me five minutes. It took us fifteen.

&gt;myface.exe

&gt;Subway station, so you have to take a flight of stairs down into the ground. 

&gt;""OH MY GAWD STAIRS""

&gt;""PPM it's not even that bad, there's AC down here and it's cooler""

&gt;BlubbatheHutt slowly rolls down the stairs

&gt;Child going up the stairs nearly gets sucked into her gravitational field

&gt;Finally make it down the stairs

&gt;PMM is huffing and puffing

&gt; I'M TIRED

&gt;Pulls out a box of Pocky from her bag

&gt;Holyshit.betterbuypockystock

&gt;Devours box of pocky in under a minute

&gt;Finally gathers enough energy to follow me to the gate where we get to the subway

Now, Chinese subways consist of these gates where you put your ticket/travel card onto the reader, and once it approves, you cross through the turnstile and down into the subway. Don't get ahead of me, guys. 

&gt; I go first, put my card on the reader, pass through the turnstile. 

&gt;PMM tries next, slaps her card on the reader hard enough to break the machine

&gt;Beep, approved

&gt;Tries to get through turnstile

&gt;Fat gets jammed inbetween metal bars

&gt;It's like watching a morbid pasta machine at work

&gt;PMM backs up again

&gt;Tries to pass through gate

&gt;Nope.lol

&gt;Guard at gate seems rather disturbed

&gt;If the gate breaks, he loses his job

&gt;He also doesn't want to approach the pile of fluff

&gt;He can always find a new job

&gt;Eventually makes his way over to her and asks if she wants to pass through the other gate

&gt;This gate is reserved for cargo and carts to pass through

&gt;PMM declines, says she can get through, claims machine is broken

&gt;Bitch it will be if you keep ramming into it

&gt;Guard insists, PMM backs up and takes the walk of shame through the cargo gate

&gt;Angrily tells me that machine is broken

&gt;Claims girl at service desk is jealous of her and prevented metal bars from turning

&gt;what.what

&gt;Bitch I just went through the gate, it's fine

&gt;omg.morestairs

&gt;PMM huffs in frustration , but at least there's an escalator

&gt;the two steps it takes to get on the escalator is too much

&gt;I get on escalator first

&gt;BOOM

&gt;Entire escalator dips

&gt;Lights flicker

&gt;People look back in fear of having the entire structure collapse

&gt;PMM has gotten on the escalator and is leaning heavily against right railing

&gt;Railing might fail any second

&gt;Finally get into subway waiting area

&gt;PMM sits down on metal bench

&gt;Bench groans in protest

&gt;Seat nearly dips in two

&gt;Pulls out bag of fried corn snack

&gt;Finishes that in the thirty seconds it takes for subway to arrive

&gt;Gets on subway

&gt;Entire train digs deeper into ground

&gt;Barely moves down trail

&gt;Pretty sure we're slower than usual

&gt;Finally get to station

&gt;Get off

&gt;Subway train flies up after PMM exits

&gt;Call VV to see where he is

&gt;Find VV, run over to say hi

&gt;PMM is left twenty feet behind because anything other than crawling is too much exercise for her

&gt;Pull VV over to PMM to introduce her

&gt;PMM's face

&gt;PMM's FACE

&gt;Piggy eyes glint under folds of fat as she appraises her new prey

&gt;Tries to be cute/seductive and waves hello

&gt;vomit.swallow

&gt;PMM's voice goes up three octaves

&gt;Hounds VV for information

&gt;VV is too nice and answers all her questions

&gt;We all head for shopping center

&gt;PMM has clamped herself onto VV's right arm

&gt;I'm sorry bro, we're going to have to amputate

&gt;VV looks at me hoping I'm going to save him

&gt;Nope, you fed in LoL yesterday

&gt;You must *suffer*

&gt;We get to toy store

&gt;The need to see LoL toys exceeds the laws of physics and VV frees himself from PMM's grasp

&gt;I follow, leaving PMM to slither over at her own pace

&gt;Oogling LoL weapons

&gt;Wow you can actually *shoot* that Ashe bow

&gt;Rin Rao spear, awesome

&gt;Holy shit Soraka's staff

&gt;General LoL fangirling going on

&gt;PMM is sulking in the background because no one's paying attention to her

&gt;Finds anime cat hat

&gt;Prances over with it on her head

&gt;VV AM I CUTE

&gt;PMM has fluffy white cat hat on her head, is making a demented :3 face and trying to be kawaii

&gt;ohgod.isthishell

&gt;VV is about to vomit

&gt;swallow it bro

&gt;she might eat it if you spit it out

&gt;""Yeah, PMM, it looks nice""

&gt;Turns back to keychains

&gt;VV you're too nice

&gt;Now she's going to try and suck you into her fat

&gt;No hope

&gt;Nice knowing you bro

&gt;PMM spends entire time trying on different animal hats and anime hats

&gt;Continues asking VV is he thinks she's cute

&gt;VV just wants to look at LoL toys

&gt;Poor guy

&gt;We finally pick our stuff and get ready to pay

&gt;PMM spots cosplay costumes in corner

&gt;ohgod.no

This particular shop in Shanghai has this large area for cosplay costumes and the sort, and they have ""sample"" costumes on a rack and a small curtained fitting area where you can roughly try it on to see how it looks on you. Disaster strikes.

&gt;PMM grabs my wrist

&gt;Well I guess I don't need that hand anymore

&gt;OP LETS TRY THESE ON I'LL LOOK AMAZING

&gt;VV has already paid for his stuff (and mine, I pay him back later) and sat down on the plush bench in front of the fitting area waiting for us

&gt; PMM is rifling through rack of costumes with no sense of delicacy at all

&gt;I'm browsing the other rack slowly

&gt;Never been into anime, but I guess this is cool

&gt;There's some traditional chinese robes here too

&gt;VV is sitting there, texting his girlfriend

&gt;PMM pulls a tiny gothic costume off the rack

&gt;IM GOING TO TRY THIS ON

&gt;I'll be surprised if that entire thing gets onto your arm

&gt;PMM disappears behind changing curtain

&gt;Curtain does little to hide the fat leaking from all sides

&gt;Thank god VV is otherwise occupied

&gt;He'd go blind

&gt;Hear lots of banging and struggling from behind curtain

&gt;PMM storms out carrying costume, which is now frumpled and wrinkly

&gt;IT DOESNT FIT

&gt;Don't you say?

&gt;Throws costume back onto rack in a huff, rummaging through again

&gt;Everything is the same size

&gt;None of this is going to fit you

&gt;Maybe you should take that curtain down and try it on

&gt;Pulls out an elasticized Tang Dynasty style gown

&gt;Looks like this http://imgur.com/PZOCJjB

&gt;OMG THIS IS LIKE WHAT YANG GUI FEI WORE

&gt;This woman is obsessed with her

&gt;Goes behind curtain

&gt;I can hear the fabric dying

&gt;Comes out

&gt;By some miracle, managed to squeeze into elasticized skirt

&gt;What should be flowy is barely staying intact against her curves

&gt; Sleeves are bulging against porky arms

&gt; Looks like a sausage wrapped in silk

&gt; VV AM I PRETTY

&gt; VV looks up

&gt;Color drains out of face

&gt;Why is a silk sausage in my face

&gt;Tries to be polite

&gt;""It looks ok""

&gt;Lots of squealing

&gt;Myears.rar

&gt;PMM decides to buy costume

&gt;370 RMB

&gt;Almost 60 bucks

&gt;Cheap in American terms, but still

&gt;60 bucks to look like a glorified sausage

&gt;Ok

&gt;Finally leave store

&gt;Everyone is hungry

&gt;VV recommends local restaurant

&gt;Local Shanghainese cuisine

&gt;PMM wants Pizza Hut

&gt;Uhh...ok

&gt;Find Pizza Hut

&gt;I sit down on one side of booth

&gt;VV goes to sit down next to me

&gt;NO VV COME SIT WITH ME

&gt;VV looks like his grandmother just died

&gt;Ok man, I'll save you this time

&gt;No, PMM, VV's going to show me the stuff he got and we can order

&gt;PMM pouts

&gt;A puppy dies

&gt;VV and I look over menu

&gt;Vegetables sound nice, how about that garden pizza

&gt;PMM roars that she wants meat and extra cheese

&gt;Alright, one garden pizza and one meat lover's with extra cheese and stuffed crust

&gt;PMM roars at waitress that she also wants two orders of wings, a Pepsi, and breadsticks

&gt;VV and I won't eat any of that

&gt;Pay up front

&gt;We split bill equally even though we know PMM's eating more

&gt;Waiting for pizzas

&gt;Sipping water, chatting about college

&gt;PMM feels left out

&gt;Mating cry ensues

&gt;VV IM LONELY

&gt;You're on the other side of the table

&gt;You'll survive

&gt;Pizza finally comes

&gt;Olives and spinach and grilled onions, tomatoes, and celery

&gt;Heaven.zip

&gt; Meat lovers pizza is a giant mass of oozing meat and cheese

&gt;Wings are shining with grease, breadsticks reek of garlic and cheese

&gt;VV and I each take one slice of pizza

&gt;PMM loads her plate with two slices of pizza, two breadsticks, and four wings

&gt;Start eating

&gt;Wait, PMM just loaded her plate

&gt;Finished all that food within ten minutes

&gt;I just finished a slice and a half

&gt;Finish second slice

&gt;Full

&gt;VV eats three slices, maxes out

&gt;PMM is like a eating machine, finished entire order of wings and breadsticks, almost done with her pizza

&gt;We have 3 slices left

&gt;PMM finishes her pizza (8 slices)

&gt;Reaches for our slices, doesn't even ask

&gt;Well we're full anyways

&gt;Systematically pulls off every bit of vegetable topping, leaving a pitted slice of plain cheese pizza

&gt;Drowns said slice in parmesan

&gt;Down the gullet in less than three minutes

&gt;Repeats with remaining two slices

&gt;Also had two refills of Pepsi

&gt;VV is disgusted by display of gluttony, unable to bring face back into neutral state

&gt;PMM takes his appearance as love

&gt;Tries to flirt across table

&gt;My pizza

&gt;It's coming back up

&gt;Finish dinner

&gt;VV has to go home

&gt;Walks us to subway station because he's a nice guy

&gt;PMM tries to hug him goodbye

&gt;VV now is in a wheelchair

&gt;VV extracts himself from large amount of fat

&gt;Runs away before PMM can ask for phone number

&gt;Entire time we're going home PMM tells me how VV was totally into her and in love with her

&gt;See, larger women get all the guys

&gt;Tells me to give her his phone number

&gt;I refuse because feeding in LoL isn't that terrible of a crime, and no one should be punished like that.

&gt;She gets angry

&gt;Tells me I'm jealous of her

&gt;It's not her fault I'm skinny and unattractive

&gt;It's not her fault he's not attracted to me

&gt;NOW GIVE ME HIS PHONE NUMBER

&gt;I mean, privacy's optional when you're PMM 

&gt;Perfect time to drop the bomb

&gt;""Hey, PMM, you know, VV has a girlfriend, right?""

&gt; PMM's life has just broken in front of her eyes

&gt;Her dreams, crushed

&gt;WHAT

&gt;""Yeah, she also goes to my school, she's from Beijing and she's a tiny little thing, adorable as fuck""

&gt;Longest pause ever

&gt;FUCK HIM FOR LEADING ME ON

&gt;""He didn't lead you on...""

&gt; HE LIKED MY COSTUME

&gt;""He said it was OK, he was being nice""

&gt;Even longer pause when she realizes I'm right

&gt;WHATEVER HE WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME ANYWAYS

&gt;k.

TL;DR: Hambeast attacks friend named after motorcycle, nearly causes two amputations of limbs, squeezes into dress, nearly explodes, devours two pizzas, allergic to vegetables, and throws a giant fit when she realizes the motorcycle already has a rider. 

Whoo, laptop at 7% battery, guys. Hopefully you guys liked this installment of PMM stories, I'll be back with more, she's going to be here for a while. I have work next week, so the likelihood of hamplanet storytime is low, but not impossible. She's also been sulking for the entire night in our room ever since we got back. Maybe she's learned and will tone it down a bit, which is good and bad news, I guess. 

Probably not, though, she's probably wallowing in self pity and HAES love right now. Sigh. On the bright side, more stories!

If you want my LoL summoner name, please please PM me, don't comment on it, I want everyone to enjoy the hamplanet comments without having to see people asking each other for LoL names. LoL is awesome, but we're here to enjoy fatpeoplestories!"
1i84gn,29,2013-07-13,The girl I love is getting married today to someone else.,taitapedro,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1i84gn/the_girl_i_love_is_getting_married_today_to/,"I met her a few years ago while doing an internship. I had recently broken up with my girlfriend at the time, and meeting her made me feel born again. I fell in love pretty much at first sight, but shortly I learned that she had a boyfriend. I was dissapointed but decided to move on with my life, except she started looking for me. She would always come to sit with me and chat at my desk, text me during the weekends to find out how I was, she added me on Facebook and would message me every night as soon as I logged in. We started to become really good friends, and then a mutual friend, and co-worker passed away in a traffic. accident. It was really hard on her, so I became worried and tried my best to be there for her. This only made us closer, and we started talking on the phone staying up all night, only to hanging up to get ready to go to work. I finally confessed my feelings for her one night in her car, and she told me she felt the same way but wanted to keep me as a friend. I understood this but told her I had fallen in love with her and I was going to need some time and space to get over her. I knew I wasn't going to be able to be her friend and be close of I had feelings. She eventually told me she eventually told me she loved me too we hugged for a long time and I ended up kissing her. 

After this we began seeing each other. At first it was very secretive, only going out late at night and she usually come to see me. It was amazing, I've never felt this way before for someone. It was excilirating. She told many times that she also had never felt this way before. I thought it would be a matter of time until she broke up with her boyfriend to be exclusive with me. We had so many talks about life and our thoughts am she confessed that she never trusted anyone else as muh as she did me. She told me I knew her better than anyone, even her friends and family, even her boyfriend. Once she looked at me in the eyes and tolde I was the love of her life. I felt exactly the same. I knew from the beginning I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. 

Well time went by, she found a paying job and so did I, so we stopped working together. And it wasn't happening. She hadnt broken up with her boyfiend. After an incident when he saw her running into my car, we finally talked about it and she tolde that she was in love with both of us and could make a decision. She was torn and knew that choosing one would mean losing the other and she knew that either way her heart would break. This is when things started going wrong, I told her I wanted to be exclusive and be her boyfriend but if she couldn't leave the other guy I would understand. She would always beg me not to leave her because she thought I would stop being her friend too. She told me she needed me in her life. She confessed to me that she and her boyfriend were no longer intimate. They wouldn't have sex for months and fight about it. She thought there was something wrong with her and had gone to therapy for it. But we had sex all the time and it was amazing. She told me with me she had love, passion, intimacy, and support and understanding. We kep seeing each other, but started fighting more often. Then one friend asked me if she was with me or not because her Facebook said she was in a relationship with some other guy. I checked and coulnt see anything, it turns out she had blocked me and few of my close friends from seeing her relationship status. That was big fight that eventually would be the root to everything ending. 

I stopped trusting her from this point on but I still loved her and believed she would be mine one day. She did eventually break up with him on New Year's Eve, and came to see me. I thought finally she's mine! But our problems didn't go away. He wasn't ready to be my girlfriend but instead of telling me she would just keep treating me like a secret. I wanted to be a part of her life so badly. I should've been more patient, she did get out of a very long relationship (5 years) and she wasn't truly over it either. She broke it up for me. But tey remained friends. The thing was, he always knew about me and told her he understood. Well, I wasn't happy and she wasn't happy. But out relationship was still good. We spoke every night on the phone and chatted over Facebook at work. We did see each other once a week or every two weeks. Sometimes we would go Oma snowboarding trip or have a sleep over (at my house of course)

Things didn't change and my feelings of unhappiness towards not being in the relationship I wanted to be got bigger and bigger. We were fighting on regular bases. Many I was ready to give up, break it off and move on but kept coming back because it was too painful to not speak to her. I missed her and we still wanted to be in each other lives. She finally confessed to me after me begging for an answer that she wasn't ready for a relationship. She wanted us to be more casual (something she would never thought she would say) mainly because he wasn't ready for the transition of having a new boyfriend. She didn't want the pressure of having to do any explaining. I thought fine, I can do that but it did hurt.

We kept on having an on and off relationship and had many fights. Her now ex was still a big part of her life, and in my opinion she never did anything to ""end"" her relationship with him. All her friends and family thought of them as being an item. There was constantly pictures of them at parties on Facebook and comments from friends about the two of them. I would usually lose my mind and call her to confront her, her excuse was they were both invited and had gone separately, and she couldn't control what people said on Facebook. 

I had hurt her so much that it was becoming hard for her to be intimate with me and the idea of a relationship was hard to imagine. We tried being romantically involved and it didn't work, she really wanted to have me in her life as her best friend. I couldn't understand why, I still love her despite everything she had done that hurt me.

One night I finally had it. We had grown apart so much and it would weeks without seeing her. Our phone conversations didn't happened as much anymore, and the fusing out she was still hanging out constantly with her ex made me lose it. She told me the reason she hung out with him was because he never put any pressure on her. They would just hang out and talk about other things. She said I always asking her what was going on? Whether we were together or not? It eventually became stressful to see me and talk to me because of it. I was drowning in uncertainty and I needed clarity. So one night after a huge argument I lost my temper over the phone, yelled and cussed at her an hung up. The next day I called her and told her, what we were doing wasn't healthy and we should stopped talking to each other and seeing eah other for a while, and that maybe one day we could be friends. She said ok. 

That was a year and half ago. I constantly break down every few months and go stalk her twitter/Instagram. She blocked my number and Facebook. I'm sure she blocked my emails too. I can't stop thinking about her. I miss her. I feel like we were right for each other but we didn't handle properly the circumstances under which we met. Anyways, she got back with him shortly after. About a year later they bought a house got engaged and today is their wedding day. 

I tried reaching out to her. I even saw her once for a few seconds this week. I wanted to beg her no to get married. I've had the worst week of my life. It's pretty obvious she's over me and wants nothing to do with me. I did speak to her per chat once briefly last year and when I asked her why we find work out all she said was ""I'm sorry but it wasn't meant to be""

Since I stopped talking to her, I've gotten involved in many activities. I played in a soccer league for a while, I took acting courses. I'm in a band, I've been in a couple of short films both behind and in front of the camera. I went on a trip to my home country in South America. I've tried dating, I have an online dating profile. I still can keep her our of my mind. I miss talking to her, I miss having her to cheer me up, support me and hear me about whatever was going on in my life. I imagine myself having conversations with her constantly. I start a new job, and on the first day I picture myself telling her how my day was, what my job is like. But I neer actually talk to her. 

I did think she was the love of my life. Instill think she is, but seeing her and build a life with someone else is tearing my soul apart. 

I know this was the wrong person to get involved with. Everything points to it. But she hve something no one else has. I felt connected to her and close. At one point we were crazy for each other but our problems pulled us apart. 

She is getting married today. I lost. I lost her. She starts the rest of her life with some one else today, and I'm just sitting here alone typing this. My heart is broken. I thought I was doing fine, but this week was a huge step back. I don't even want to move on, I just want to feel sad. 

TL;DR - I met a girl and feel in love. She was in a relationship, I was her affair. After it all went to hell she got engaged to her boyfriend and is getting married today. "

(Working on software to make the supercomputers there more energy efficient). I half way expect some people from the center to be on this subreddit! My background thus far is more in the compute side of things, rather than CFD itself but I've developed an interest in it thanks to the internship. 

I start school again in the fall at a 2 year college in place of my junior and senior years of high school. I hope to transfer to MIT afterwards. I'll be undeclared in major at the 2 year college, and just be taking classes I feel are interesting or relevant to future aspirations. (Math through calculus 2, linear algebra, engineering design, computational methods for engineering, comp sci, etc)

I know I want to go into science/engineering, and I'm really interested in computer science.. But that's certainly not my limitation. CFD seems to encompass all areas of my interest though!

How would one prepare for grad school work related to CFD as an undergrad, or at least gain more exposure at a young age? Really any advice or direction I can get would be helpful. Thanks for giving this a read!"

2 from science professors

1 from a Dean that I work closely with

1 from the physician that I shadowed &amp; volunteered with

1 from a High School teacher that I had all 4 years 

1 from my manager at the internship I had for 2 years (Fortune 500 financial company)

and 1 letter explaining how my non-traditional undergraduate courses fulfill &amp; surpass the necessary requirements for pre-medical students



I've heard that medical schools do not like to be bombarded with letters so I feel like I shouldn't send all seven. Yet, I feel each letter individually speaks to a different side of my character. My question is which letters would you send? Personally, I think the 2 science professors, the physician, and the non-trad letter are necessities, but I really think the letter from the Dean and my high school teacher will speak to my character so much more, and the letter from my manager comes from a totally different side of my education (I didn't always know I wanted to be a doctor). I'm really torn and don't want to send all 7, so what would you do?"

How to approach and/or help?**
___________________________

About two weeks ago I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night to find a flooded toilet with food morsels and dumpling wrappers in it.  (The room mate, a summer subletter, made dumplings the previous night.)  I though this very odd especially since the contents of the bowl resembled what I saw when I used to suffer from an eating disorder.  However, I knew there were alternative explanations, such as her using the toilet as food disposal (although there is a food disposal unit in the kitchen sink).  After cleaning up the mess in the bathroom, I woke up my boyfriend of 6.5 months to let him know the toilet was flooded and it looked like someone had tried to throw away dumplings in the toilet.  He was bewildered and went to the bathroom to check it was indeed flooded.  A half hour later, I heard the room mate come out of her room and presumably unclog the toilet because the next time I went about 15 minutes later it was no longer flooded.  The whole event was never brought up by any of us.

This morning I went to use the toilet again and again there was a solution that highly resembled vomit, with semi-digested food morsels and the oily residue on top characteristic of vomit.  I needed to go badly so I just flushed it and did my business.  I did notice that the whole night tonight she was up in the kitchen cooking or something, which she does a lot even at 4am (I wake up a lot in the night).

She also has very poor hygiene, where she won't shower three days in a row, and as I mentioned before, really weird sleeping habits where she will stay up all night-- usually spending a portion of that time in the kitchen.  It is surprising she manages to function because she has an internship where she had to wake up ~8am and gets home ~8pm, yet she doesn't sleep for a large part of the night.

She might also deal with anxiety because she has a very bad habit of leaving the lights on. In the morning, bf and I wake up to find all the lights in the apartment on (this has only started upon her moving in).  He and his room mates have asked her to please turn off the lights after usage but there has been no change in behavior.  I should note here that on both occasions of me finding unusual contents in the toilet bowl, the light in her room was on and shining through the crack of her door.

She also compares her body to others' a lot.  The first time we hung out outside of the apartment (after the first incident but before the second), she covertly asked me quietly so my bf wouldn't hear, ""What is your weight?""  I just said I didn't know and she remarked how jealous she was of my legs and how I should show them off more.  (I hate how skinny my legs are and try to cover them up.)  Later she remarked to my bf how skinny his legs were and actually put their legs side by side to compare them next to each other, which bf found really weird.  She also told me she checks her weight every single morning and feels very good when it is a lower number than the day before.  In addition she really enjoys cooking for us all, which can be a great hobby but also sometimes a sign of an eating disorder.

I'm concerned because I know eating disorders have serious ramifications and this girl is very nice, and if she is struggling I wish to help her.  She is extremely thin and although she looks fine now, she will look very unhealthy if she loses any more weight.  I need input on what is appropriate to do and if the toilet incidents are really as weird as I  find them, or if I just think they are weird because they remind me of how I used to be.  I have not told my bf of my suspicions or the second incident because I feel it is not respectful but am debating whether it is better for him to talk to her since he is her room mate."

1i7qar,50,2013-07-13,"Me[22F] with my [23M] of 2 years, fantastic job he's less than pleased with me",turtles2839,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1i7qar/me22f_with_my_23m_of_2_years_fantastic_job_hes/,"Hello all - 

First time poster here, long time lurker, but you guys seem to have a pretty good handle on your advice. 

So this happened yesterday, and it really bothered me. As it should, but I just don't know what to do next. So my boyfriend (let's call him John) and I have both recently graduated college (him the year before me). He sort of messed around in school, was in a fraternity, didn't really attend to the academic side of things. In the beginning of college I however was in an extremely abusive relationships for about a year, and did extremely poorly, to the point of almost getting kicked out, but then I got rid of the guy and decided to focus on my studies intensely. As a result, I was able to bring my GPA up a lot. I encouraged him to focus on his studies more and he did, but still was a little lax compared to me (not that it impacted my view of him, he's good at what he does and that's what matters). We have plans for him to move up here in about six months and we would get an apartment.

Now, we both got jobs. He got one last summer, he programs software for a pension company. I work as a psychology researcher for the government (which I got by being an intern). Because of my GPA, I thought I was going to be receiving a big pay increase from the internship, but when they hired me they only offered a pay increase that was one third of what I was originally going to get, which was a little disappointing but I love the work I do and the people so it was still worth it. John joked about how he was happy about how he was still the main bread winner (we live about four hours away from each other, I with my parents and him in an apt), and that was that.

Fast forward to my performance evaluation, which occurred about a month after I started my new job. I got really great marks (yay!) and exceeded expectations in all areas. I felt like I was on cloud nine. Then my boss started discussing this program where they pay for your grad school with me and I started to get dizzy with happiness. I mean, FREE GRAD SCHOOL?! So awesome. I am so grateful to have gotten the original internship. Anyways, after all that she says that they looked at the wrong transcript when hiring me and I am going to be getting the big raise. I. Was. Ecstatic!!!! I can afford to contribute to a nicer apartment for the both of us now, and we could maybe get a really nice couch instead of a hard/lumpy one from Ikea! 

I got back to my office and immediately called him. I told him everything, and how excited I was about the raise. He was happy for me, and then asked how much I make. I told him, and he started to act differently. I thought it was maybe just because he was at work and couldn't express his emotions, but then after we got off the phone he texted me. He said ""I'm so proud of you...but it's also making me insecure."" When I pressed him for why, he told me it was because it was emasculating. What is emasculating? That I make less than 1% more than him each year. That's going to be such a little difference after taxes. He then claimed that it would make him happy to ""provide"" for me. This really took me aback. I don't want to be taken care of by a man, I can take care of myself. I see myself as an extremely strong woman and I have goals and aspirations. I don't see myself as a stay at home mom, or even a mom for that matter (I know I'm young and this could change). I told him that, and he kind of avoided the subject and started joking around.

Now my problem is where to go from here. I love my boyfriend and the amount of money we each make doesn't really matter to me (I mean I wouldn't want to date someone who completely relied on me for all income, but that's simply a personal feeling regarding motivation), especially since the difference after taxes will be so miniscule! But it bothers me that he takes issue with it. I intend to pursue my masters and hopefully a PhD, and I want someone who supports me in my endeavors, which would include salary increases. It really really hurt when he was not happy for me. I mean maybe he's scared I'll leave him for someone richer? I don't know. I just know I was really unhappy that he was not as ecstatic as I was. Reddit, how do I deal with this?

1i7pnr,1,2013-07-13,2.5 days in this foreign place,relishandjam,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1i7pnr/25_days_in_this_foreign_place/,"Ok, wall of text story time. Here goes.

So I'm a little over 2.5 days without booze. I've been slowly leaning myself off the past couple months due to some fun health issues. Before that, I drank just about everyday, minus a couple attempts at stopping, for a solid 8 years straight. Annd before that I drank for another 7 pretty heavily, but only a few times a week. All in all I've been drinking like a champ for over 15 years. I also got into OxyContin and then heroin and then methadone for a string of 3 or 4 years in my early twenties. Don't know how I lived through that one. Even the withdrawals, I must've come so close to having a heart attack. I'll never forget the pounding like I'd just ran as fast as I could for an hour, and it went on for so long. Days. Sorry, ol' body. Then, after all that, I switched it up to cocaine for a couple years... I needed something... until I went crazy.

Cocaine ultimately saved my life. That's funny to say. It made me extremely paranoid, the crazy as shit lock yourself in kind. I became convinced everyone I saw was following me and trying to sabotage me in some way. It was a trip. It turned out to be the best thing that happened to me though, because I had to move to escape the impending doom (in my mind), and I did. I also cut off all ties to my past friends, which was probably the best part. Those fuckers were nothing but trouble even though we had a lot of good times together. Lots are dead now. A few are in jail, returning for longer and longer sentences every time they get out. Sad stuff.

So I moved across the country to live under the wing of my sister. Of course I thought my followers set up shop there too, but my sister assured me day in and day out that I was indeed crazy as shit, as I peered out the closed blinds at the cars driving by to film me or plant evidence. Slowly, the longer I was off the blow, the paranoia went away. My sister (she was really what saved my life) eventually got me straight enough to work again, and then got me an internship at her friend's creative agency.

Holy shit, I didn't know you could do creative things and get paid. Really? Everyone partied too. Crazy. This changed everything. So I worked my fucking ass off making minimum wage happily doing all the things nobody wanted to do, basically the same as my old jobs, and learning as much as I could. Constantly asking questions like an excited child curious about the world. Then, at night, everyone drank. Holy shit. A creative job where people party every night? I can do this. I was made for this.

A year later I went from intern to my first entry level position. Busting my ass. Boozing every night. Joking everyday how much I drank the night before. That continued for years. I got better and better at my job. I got better and better at drinking. Eventually I somehow ended up in a senior position. Holy shit. Talk about contrast. I thought life was just meant to be endless suffering and suicidal thoughts all the time. What the hell is this weird place where I'm good at something?

A few years ago I started my own company. From the outside things were going well, but the fucking stress was a killer. Any second I wasn't working I spent drinking as much as I could to disconnect from it all. Have a day off? Wake up, eat breakfast, get shitfaced, pass out. Wake up, eat lunch, get shitfaced again... Wait wait. I can get drunk, sober up, and get drunk again in one day? Three times? Well, that's what I call efficiency.

Writing these things makes me want to drink again. I'm gonna wind it down now. Sorry for the sudden falloff in details.

So luckily I started getting some nerve issues. Now the more I drink the more my limbs hurt in some form. Pins and needles. Electrical shocks. Cold sensations. Burning. Pain. My wrists spasm and twitch. If I don't drink, that stuff is barely there. I don't know if I'll be able to keep it up. But it sure as shit makes it easier to stop when these scary things happen.

So I'm nearing my 3rd day. I'm emotional. I have that hunger in me to consume substances. I can barely sleep. When I do I have these really vivid dreams. I haven't dreamt much in a lot of years, so that's cool. I hope I can keep it up. Not so much for the dreams but for lessening the nerve pain. I don't know. It's hard. I guess that's why I'm here. This is all new. Life is crazy.

Thanks, all. I appreciate what you are all doing here. Thank you for letting me get this out."

How to approach and/or help?**
___________________________

About two weeks ago I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night to find a flooded toilet with food morsels and dumpling wrappers in it.  (The room mate, a summer subletter, made dumplings the previous night.)  I though this very odd especially since the contents of the bowl resembled what I saw when I used to suffer from an eating disorder.  However, I knew there were alternative explanations, such as her using the toilet as food disposal (although there is a food disposal unit in the kitchen sink).  After cleaning up the mess in the bathroom, I woke up my boyfriend of 6.5 months to let him know the toilet was flooded and it looked like someone had tried to throw away dumplings in the toilet.  He was bewildered and went to the bathroom to check it was indeed flooded.  A half hour later, I heard the room mate come out of her room and presumably unclog the toilet because the next time I went about 15 minutes later it was no longer flooded.  The whole event was never brought up by any of us.

This morning I went to use the toilet again and again there was a solution that highly resembled vomit, with semi-digested food morsels and the oily residue on top characteristic of vomit.  I needed to go badly so I just flushed it and did my business.  I did notice that the whole night tonight she was up in the kitchen cooking or something, which she does a lot even at 4am (I wake up a lot in the night).

She also has very poor hygiene, where she won't shower three days in a row, and as I mentioned before, really weird sleeping habits where she will stay up all night-- usually spending a portion of that time in the kitchen.  It is surprising she manages to function because she has an internship where she had to wake up ~8am and gets home ~8pm, yet she doesn't sleep for a large part of the night.

She might also deal with anxiety because she has a very bad habit of leaving the lights on. In the morning, bf and I wake up to find all the lights in the apartment on (this has only started upon her moving in).  He and his room mates have asked her to please turn off the lights after usage but there has been no change in behavior.  I should note here that on both occasions of me finding unusual contents in the toilet bowl, the light in her room was on and shining through the crack of her door.

She also compares her body to others' a lot.  The first time we hung out outside of the apartment (after the first incident but before the second), she covertly asked me quietly so my bf wouldn't hear, ""What is your weight?""  I just said I didn't know and she remarked how jealous she was of my legs and how I should show them off more.  (I hate how skinny my legs are and try to cover them up.)  Later she remarked to my bf how skinny his legs were and actually put their legs side by side to compare them next to each other, which bf found really weird.  She also told me she checks her weight every single morning and feels very good when it is a lower number than the day before.  In addition she really enjoys cooking for us all, which can be a great hobby but also sometimes a sign of an eating disorder.

I'm concerned because I know eating disorders have serious ramifications and this girl is very nice, and if she is struggling I wish to help her.  She is extremely thin and although she looks fine now, she will look very unhealthy if she loses any more weight.  I need input on what is appropriate to do and if the toilet incidents are really as weird as I  find them, or if I just think they are weird because they remind me of how I used to be.  I have not told my bf of my suspicions or the second incident because I feel it is not respectful but am debating whether it is better for him to talk to her since he is her room mate."

Sorry if I am wrong!

Hi guys,

I have just graduated with a 2.1 in Computer Science with Games Development, and I am currently searching for a job. I've interviewed at a bunch of companies, but I have finally been given an offer!

The company is small - medium, and I managed to get offered the position after passing all of the interviews. I was just wondering if this is a good opportunity? Most of the other roles I have applied for have been between 25K - 28K, but I also got rejected from them :(.
A few other things to consider. I have minimal commercial experience (mostly internships) and I am based permanently in Essex (not too far from London, but will have to get the train everyday). 

If I can provide any more relevant information, then please do not hesitate to ask.
Thanks!"
1i7gww,2,2013-07-13,Accepting first job offer and still applying to other companies?,tragichero24,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1i7gww/accepting_first_job_offer_and_still_applying_to/,"I just graduated as an EE last month and currently have a follow up interview that I feel confident about. The four big problems are that it is an Applications Engineer Position, it got a lot of bad ratings on glassdoor, it may be the only offer I get in my area (Southern California) and looking like a job hopper if I look for and find another job. Here's a little more on each problem:

**Applications Engineer**: From what I gathered from the first interview, this position requires a lot of talking with customers on the phone and is more on the ""sales"" side of engineering. Coming out of school I expected to be doing more on the design or testing side of engineering. Also, would going down the Applications Engineering road set me up to only do that type of work in the future? My top choice would be something in RF and communication systems. I do not want to be too picky on my first job but at the same time don't want to hinder my career advancement.

**Reviews**: A great majority of reviews on this company on glassdoor, pretty much says it is a terrible place to work. If I have to prioritize what I'm looking for in a job it is that I want to be happy working. However alot also say the pay is good which is another factor. Lastly, I understand that most people that write reviews are either terribly angry or extremely pleased with what they are reviewing so I take it with a grain of salt. It is just tough to shake off as there way A LOT of negative reviews. How accurate would you guys say glassdoor is?

**Location**: There is not a lot of engineering positions near Los Angeles so I know my pickings are thin. Staying in LA is honestly a top priority as it is my home town. The problem is I only graduated with a 3.06 GPA and no internship experience (only tutoring and grading some engineering courses, and customer service as working experience). I feel the competition is tough and I will only have a limited amount (if not the only) shot at getting a position here.

**Job Hopping**: Based on the position itself and the bad reviews, it seems like it will not be an enjoyable job. Would it be okay to continue searching for positions while working there and switch jobs as soon as I get another offer? I feel as if this will make me look like a job hopper to other companies. 

**TL;DR**: App engineer not my top choice as a position, bad reviews on glassdoor but great location. Continue to search for work while working there?

Any suggestions?

I'm interested in becoming a sysadmin or computer security specialist and I was wondering how important certs are in getting these positions. Furthermore if they are extremely important in getting those jobs should I start form the bottom up (A+, Net+, etc) or just focus on the the path I choose (i.e. starting at MCSA).

I'm currently doing an internship at a local school mainly doing PC-refresh, the my supervisor said that companies are giving the people with degree's priority when they are hiring, and that certs are just a plus. I was wondering how true that was.

I'm a junior in college, about to go into my senior year and I have been with the same relationship since the end of the first semester of freshman year.

I had been in one realtionship durin junior year of highschool and it was actually pretty successful. They were a good fit, did alot of firsts toghter and then they moved a long as way away during senior year. I was hear broken, but not as bad as I should have been.

So life goes on and I go to colllege. Fuckyeah, freedom and shit. I hook up with a good amount of people, still in my comfort zone but branching... kinda. And then the one from highschool, or rather one of the ones.. kind of cute but sexy enough and I get into a relationship.

We have sex.. About 5 months in we both give the V card.. Just before valentines day, Outback stake house to celebrate. Everythings the fucking best, ya know?

Fast forward to 1 year plus a few months. Thats when the first breakup happens. Lies to me about what was said between them and my best friend.

I have a suspission and I ask, quote ""if you can't trust me then you don't love me"" and they lie. Obviosly its a huge fight and it happened 2 years ago so I can't quote everything but I know that I said that and I know they lied. I break up..

I'm a weak motherfucker and we get back together.. Add a year. I find out from my best friend that while we were on the original break, they grined and hooked up with someone. Note that trust was a huuuge deal in getting back ""together"". So i get lied to by my bf and them. Go crazy.. Ge back together cause of low self esteem and lack of faith in myself.

So here is what it comes down to. I'm an intern far far way. I have 4 weeks left, and then one more year of school. Should I end it? I feel like i should but I dont really think I have the courage to. I'm a dude and go to a engineeing school. Used to have courage but now I can barely talk to girls.

Fuck I probly talked forever but idk, I had a shitty night and I just want some advice. I'm no saint either, I have danced with 3 girls, 1 during one of our ""breaks"" and the other 2 about 2 weeks ago. I told her about the one on our break and the other 2, I tried to tell her. She cried and I folded, saying I just grinded and walked away but really I grined for about 2 songs total. She has hooked up with 3 different dudes. About a week ago she says she is cool with a threesome but there are some other substances involved so idk.. I do think she loves me and cares for me, and probably I'm not giving the whole story.

WTF does reddit think about any of this. Probly too much of a life story but maybe it will make me feel better.

tl;dr Should I break up?"
1i7co4,0,2013-07-13,Moving to Denver with limited funds to look for work... Worth the risk?,lax2den,Denver,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/1i7co4/moving_to_denver_with_limited_funds_to_look_for/,"Sorry that this is long, but I have been wanting to move from LA to Denver now for a very long time because I have visited countless times and absolutely love the place, but looking for a job from out of state has been incredibly difficult, especially for my desired line of work (architecture). I currently have a job in the tech industry, which I like and gets me by, but it's not something I want to do as a career and I am willing to let it go if it means I can move to Denver because I can't take living in LA anymore.

I recently had an interview in LA for something that meets my career goals and told them I was interested in moving to Denver. The employer was nice enough to pass on my information to HR at their Denver location and I thought this would finally be my big break. I had my interview at their Denver location but unfortunately I didn't get the job because the two available positions had been filled one week earlier by interns.

Sad story and my qualifications aside, both the LA and Denver location interviewers roughly gave me the same advice to help in my job search from out of state: ""to improve your chances of getting a job, especially in a competitive job market, you should be present in the local market. This applies to most jobs in all sorts of fields. Unless jobs are super high in demand, employers will not even consider you if you are not local regardless of qualifications because they don't know what kind of obligations you have to take care of at home which can delay the relocation process; they don't know if you have a house to sell, an apartment to sublet, an entire family to relocate, etc.. If there is an immediate opening for something or they want a position filled quickly, they want new employees to come on as smoothly as possible and one of the biggest obstacles that can make that process rocky is hiring people from out of town.""

This advice sounds like it makes a lot of sense. They then both suggested that if relocating to Denver is that important to me, that I should take a risk and just do it, and then look for a job once I am there, even a temporary or part-time job to gain income while I look for a job that meets my career goals. I found it odd to hear that kind of advice from executives of a large international firm, but it sounds like it would be a good idea, except for when finances enters the picture while in between jobs

I've got a good chunk of change saved up that would last me 9-12 months if I found a cheap room for rent in the outer parts of Denver and I don't have bills or loans of any kind other than for food and gas, but that chance not being able to find work in that time frame still lingers given the circumstances of the architecture job market.

I am not sure what I should do. One side of me tells me to suck it up and stay in LA and keep working to save up until I find something in Denver because it's the safe thing to do; the other side of me says fuck it and take a chance if it means you will be happy being in the city you love. I know this may sound desperate but I have been trying to make this move for years now and living in LA is really starting to make my skin crawl. I'm in serious need of a change of scenery, but I don't want to be reckless about it. Any thoughts?"

1iaewc,19,2013-07-14,Zimmerman's life is ruined,[deleted],GunsAreCool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/comments/1iaewc/zimmermans_life_is_ruined/,"W.E.B. Du Boise once asked ‘How does it feel to be a problem?’ How does it fell to know that your race made your very existence criminal, suspect, suspicious? Knowing that wherever you went you would be treated differently not because of the content of your character, but because of the color of your skin. You see a black person and you assume they are violent and lazy among other stereotypes. Being a problem is what made Zimmerman believe Martin was criminal who didn’t belong. Ironically, Zimmerman’s actions have now made him a ‘problem’ in the same vein Du Boise spoke about. Zimmerman will not see a prison cell, but he is trapped with a life sentence in a different sort of prison—one without walls but that is still very real.  Zimmerman decided he was the sole arbitrator of justice. He took his gun and stalked a teenager who had a legal right to walk down the sidewalk. He initiated a confrontation, lost, and then used his gun to kill. In doing so, he ruined the rest of his life. Martin is dead and Zimmerman is not sentenced to a state penitentiary, but he can’t escape his actions. 

Zimmerman can never have a normal existence. He will be recognized wherever he goes. His name will be remembered and his face is very recognizable. He will be reminded every day of his actions. He won’t be able to go outside without worrying about some vigilante with a gun stalking him. Even leaving his house carries weight. He won’t be able to get coffee at Starbucks without giving a fake name. He won’t be able to go on dates without discussing the murder to a potential spouse. He can’t give his name to make reservations. Any contact  he has outside the home will be framed around the murder. People, will remember and even if they feel he was right, the incident will still be something that is discussed. It looms over him. This is a scarlet letter he can’t remove. It will be passed to his children and his grandchildren. He will have to explain to his kids what happened and his kids will see the stories on the internet. Again, everything he does from here on out will be framed around the shooting. This is now who he is. Regardless of what he does, he will be first and foremost tied to the incident. He will be reminded of it every day for the rest of his life. Even if he changes his name and moves away, he will know that every time he gives his new name he had to because of the shooting. If he lives in a different state, he knows he had to because of the shooting. He can’t escape this, even in the privacy of his own home. 

Zimmerman will find it hard to find a job that yields a rewarding career. He is 29 years old, the time when most finish with internships and school and are now solidly on a career track.  Zimmerman majored in criminal justice and wanted to be a judge. Law enforcement or similar fields will be cautious to hire him because he will be seen as a liability. Any transaction he has with a perp could cause a lawsuit because of his past; especially if he loses any upcoming civil cases. Employers may not want him associated with their company because of negative publicity or public pressure the firm will receive. His career choices are limited because of the shooting and trial. Regardless of how much of a model employee he is, he will be seen not as an asset, but as a potential problem. 

Zimmerman will see financial difficulties the rest of his life. OJ Simpson went broke paying for his defense team and Simpson had much more resources than Zimmerman did. Moreover, if there is a civil case and he loses, he will be forced to file for bankruptcy. Even if he wins a civil case, he will still need to pay the legal fees.  Though we don’t know the final numbers, his lawyer said that his legal fees for the past trial could reach $1 million. He will be forced to keep a lawyer on retainer which costs money. He could write a book about the shooting, but again, that continues to tie his existence around the shooting. Something he probably doesn’t want. His vigilante justice cost him a career and financial security.  Sure, he can get donations to pay for some of the legal fees. He did set up a website where people could give money. But how long is that going to last. Will people still be donating 10, 20, 30 years from now? He was considered a champion by a few people but over the next few weeks and months there will be more stories in the spotlight. There will be another Casey Anthony. There will be another scandal or something that will catch the public eye. People will forget about him and his legal fund. In the near future he will have all the negative consequences of his action but see none of the positive. 

In short, Zimmerman’s life is ruined. He is now a problem. Everything he does will be framed around the shooting and trial, whether he likes it or not. What does this mean for the gun nuts who need their firearms to defend themselves against the other  ‘problems’? It means that the era of really truly getting-away-with-it is over.  They can’t kill with impunity.  They now realize that Stand Your Ground laws and very subjective ‘self-defense’ laws may keep them out of prison, but the price they will pay for the rest of their lives is not worth it. They can’t kill a ATF agent or cop because they don’t like the government without being regarded as a murderer. They can’t shoot a minority walking in their neighborhood simply because they don’t like their race. They know self defense better be legitimate self defense not a convenient excuse delivered with a wink and a nod.  They can posture and grandstand about how tough they are, but they know once they pull the trigger, they will be in a prison without bars. They won this battle, but we are winning the war.

It saved my iPad from thieves.

I’m currently in Hamburg for an internship in this tiny apartment with no terrestrial internet connection and consequently completely dependent on cellular data.

To make things worse, I’m on ground level with heavy iron bars in front of the windows, so living in a Faraday cage with practically no reception. What does extremely inventive (and dumb!) me do? Put his iPad in his backpack, hang it on the iron bars of the window (perfect 3G reception out there) and turn on the personal hotspot. I mean, the window is on the back of the house in an area where there is not much going on, it’s even in a niche and altogether pretty hidden. I’m right on the other side of the window all the time. What could possible go wrong?

I was just watching some stupid YouTube video when I lost connection. When I got up, opened the window and looked at my backpack it was open, iPad gone. I didn’t hear anything at all.

In that moment I honestly thought my iPad was gone forever – luckily Find My iPhone exists and the world is apparently full of stupid thieves. I left my apartment shortly after (laptop, 3G USB Stick with my second SIM card in hand) to get outside and better reception (to activate Find My iPhone).

Those seconds it took to show up on the map were pretty long and nerve-wrecking. But it was there. 18% battery, somewhere in southern Hamburg. Apparently it wasn’t in reach of any GPS satellites and consequently didn’t show an exact location.

First I locked my iPad and let it display a message to return it to me. Then I played a sound. Maybe it was nearby … but nothing.

After ten or so minutes with no change in location and no more precise location and after constantly playing a sound I gave up and went back inside. The first thing I heard as soon as I opened the door was my iPad pinging. From a locked up storeroom.

Wait a minute – when I left my apartment laptop in hand didn’t I see this guy locking up that storeroom (middle aged, nothing special)? I hadn’t seen him before. When I went outside he went, too, to his wife in the car and they drove away. I even had some smalltalk with him (“Oh, you are now staying here?” – “Yeah, only until the end of this month, though, for an internship”).

For the next hour or so I camped out in front of that storeroom and jumped up and went outside whenever a car arrived. I learned (from other people I met during that time) that the renters of the storeroom are living on the first floor, their name and that they are usually not away for long, most likely they only went quickly to some store. When they arrived back I was standing in front of their car, asking for my iPad back. They artfully played dumb but as soon as I said “you know, the one you have in your storeroom, I made it beep and heard it in there” they suddenly got surprisingly defensive: “You know, this storeroom is always unlocked. Anyone can access it. Anyone can get in there.” – “Well, it isn’t right now.” – “Oh, well, did you lock it up today? Usually it’s always open!”

Anyone, they unlocked the storeroom and I got my iPad out. It was hidden in a toolbox under a towel. 

I told them that I didn’t believe they didn’t take it and they remained steady in their denial. I also told them that I won’t pursue the issue any further and that they should be very happy about that. (I don’t know whether I would also do that if I wouldn’t move out at the end of this month. I’m still not sure whether I should tell the landlord.)

Conclusion: I’m so happy that thieves are dumb. That way my own stupidity isn’t quite so obvious."

my fiance and i are getting married in september, we have been together for nearly 5 years.  we have decided that i will go off my birth control once married and attempt to have a baby.

for as long as i can remember, being a mother has been my ultimate goal.  its the most important thing i can possibly think of. but i also wanted to do it ''right'' and so was very careful to not get pregnant when i was younger, i didn't even loose my virginity till i was nearly 19 because of how important it was to me to not ''screw up'' especially with my mother and aunt's reputations for getting knocked up just by looking at a man.  being a mother is so important to me i have always lived my life doing what would be best for my future children.  it is an utter obsession of mine since my own childhood.  i'm not sure why i feel like this and when i reflect upon it my intensity of desire for a child is terrifying and overwhelming.  

my ex didn't really want children, and towards the end of our relationship it became the 'deal breaker' for us, among many other things...i became involved with a mutual friend of ours who moved in with us, he was intending to already, and so as odd as it was, especially for my personality, i ended up having two serious relationships back to back.  i honestly never thought it would last long with my fiance...surprised me.  anyway...about two months after ''switching'' partners...i had a miscarriage. 

i was attending a vocational school to become a vet tech, and part of the program is to work in veterinary hospitals in an intern like position. i was working at a local emergency hospital that i desperately wanted a job at and had been killing myself to spend as much time there as possible around all the intense schoolwork i had. the day before i left early because my mother called me to inform me a relative and lost their battle with cancer, and i broke down.  i was grateful for their sympathy but was working even harder to prove that i could keep my home life at home and be a dependable worker. 

that day my stomach was upset, and i started having horrible cramps.  i assumed it was finally my period coming...everything had been so stressful and crazy in my life that my period was just no longer on any kind of schedule.  in retrospect i realized it had been maybe 6-7 weeks since my last period, and that was an incredibly light flow, just mild spotting.  but i was so busy with life that i couldn't spare the time to think about it.  the pain became worse.  eventually i think, well maybe if i go to the bathroom i'll feel better.  it was a quiet day at the hospital anyway.  

in the bathroom i have what i imagine to be a ridiculous bowl movement.  it wasn't until i wiped that i noticed there was...stuff coming out of me.  it wasn't recognizable as anything.  just...chunks of fleshy looking tissue and blood. my initial reaction was i had started my period, maybe i was passing some clots or something. and then i really looked at it.  i'm thankful now that i wasn't far enough along to recognize anything because i don't think i could have handled it.  as it was...just staring at it all in the toilet...i didn't really comprehend.  i knew something was wrong...and then i just knew...without a shadow of a doubt that it was a miscarriage.  that i had been pregnant and not known it, and lost the baby. i didn't know anyone close to me who had had a miscarriage.  it was never something i studied up on too much when obsessing over all the baby and child care stuff, attempting to groom myself into the best possible mother i could be. i had no idea what the symptoms where or what to expect or what it would look like.  i just knew. and in the same moment i knew, i shut down.  

i flushed the toilet, washed my hands, and went back to work.  eventually i went home and slept. then woke up to start another day of school, work, internship, studying and sleep.  i didn't tell anyone.  i didn't write about it in my diary.  i didn't even google miscarriages to see if that is what had really happened.  i didn't go to the doctor.  as long as i didn't acknowledge it, then it never happened. i was too busy, in too critical a place in my life to allow myself to fall apart. 

 i didn't cry for almost two months.  i cry at everything, a flipping leaf falling from a tree in autumn will bring me to tears.  i suffer from rapid cycling bipolar depression, my emotions are always off the charts in one direction or another. not only did i not cry for my baby, but i didn't cry at all for two months. that has never happened to me before.  i cry several times a day on average.  i was graduating as valedictorian from school.  i did not get the job at the emergency hospital because they were already over staffed.  my fiance and i had found our own apartment and where no longer living with my ex. i finally googled miscarriage.  i finally confirmed it.  and i cried.  and i ached. two months of ignoring it did nothing to abate the eventual pain.  it had been years since i contemplated suicide, but the thought entered my mind then.  

i completely blamed myself.  i should have seen the signs.  i should have paid more attention to my body.  if i had known i wouldn't have been working with anesthetic gas, or all the medications that can cause a pregnant woman to loose her child.  i wouldn't have done this that and the other thing.  if i only knew i could have saved it.  it was my personal failing.  i ignored the signs and thus killed my child.  killed the one thing i wanted in life more than anything else. 

i decided not to tell my fiance.  of course this was still in the beginning of our relationship and i still wasn't sure of his permanence in my life. i didn't know whose baby it was.  i had no idea how far along i was.  i still couldn't bring myself to go to the doctor.  i'm not sure if it was because of the final confirmation, i could still be wrong you know...it may have been my embarassment of how i handled the situation...i was always so level-headed in a crisis, to have handled things so poorly as i did was definitely embarassing.  i continued life as though nothing had happened...and cried through the night after my fiance was asleep.  

eventually, when i reached what i had figured to be my approximate due date...i was so overwhelmed with grief, i tried writing my child a letter.  and then my fiance came home early.  and he couldn't figure out why i was so torn apart about something.  i finally told him. he was mad at me for keeping it a secret.  to this day he is mad at me for keeping it a secret for so long.  he feels i robbed him of his grief, that he couldn't mourn the loss for the child that he feels was his own, because thinking of it reminds him only of the betrayal of me not telling him.  i have tried explaining that i couldn't have told him when it happened, i couldn't tell myself that it had happened.  i tried explaining about my depression and occasional suicidal tendencies, that if i had tried to accept it then i would likely not have survived.  i understand his anger.  it was unfair to him.  but it couldn't have gone any other way than it did.  

eventually i told a few friends and began to heal.  every year on that dreadful date i lock myself away from everyone and cry.  every year i write my baby a letter and apologize for killing him/her.  i don't mean it to end up like that...i know rationally that i didn't kill my child, that this happens and you frequently never know why.  it could have been the anesthesia i worked with during surgeries on the animals...it could have been medications i touched...it could have been my severe stress levels at that time.  it could have just not been viable. 

in the last two years i have had ovarian cysts, and during a surgery to remove one it was discovered that i had endometriosis as well. my doctor at the time suggested having any children i wanted asap because by the time i turned 30 he wanted to remove everything.  

and then now...i'm engaged and planning a wedding on a shoestring budget.  i'm actually out of work this last year for workers comp reasons, which is a whole other bag of bs and pain and stress. i am 26 and my fiance wants two children, possibly 3.  i'm afraid that with the cysts and endo, i will have difficulty conceiving.  but im even more afraid now of actually conceiving.  three of my closest friends have miscarried this year.  two years ago a friend from another state was pregnant, and i was for the first time genuinely excited for someone else to be pregnant.  i was healed enough to have genuine joy for her and not lament my own loss. i followed every dr appointment, each ultrasound photo, every craving and uncomfortable moment she had with joy and sympathy.  she posted when her contractions started, when she arrived at the hospital, to saying she's so excited to meet her daughter, can't wait.  and then there was nothing.  no more updates.  for nearly a week.  her daughter was still-born.  doctors had no idea what happened.  the devastation on my end was almost as bad as my own. i can't imagine how she managed to pull through it.  btw she succesfully had a daughter two months ago...posts pictures almost daily.  

so now i am finally at the point where we can try to have our own child.  and i'm almost more afraid of getting pregnant than i am of discovering i am infertile.  my lost baby was an ''oops'' and i had no idea i had it till i lost it.  my grief was so strong, and is still very strong.  but i have always been able to say to myself that next time i will know, next time i will be ok.  but i don't really know.  maybe it was the stuff i was doing at the time that caused me to loose my baby, maybe it was me.  maybe i am incapable of having one. i honestly don't know if i can survive knowing i successfully became pregnant, and then loosing it. i don't know if i can survive the first trimester based on my anxiety levels alone lol.  being a mother is still this ridiculously important thing in my life, and i have explored my other options and we will likely adopt if i am unable to have a child.  i can be a mother one way or another and i can be ok.  i keep telling myself this at least.  i debate with myself about maybe waiting until i'm more mentally stable...but im running out of time...and will i ever actually be more mentally stable.  won't i just have all these feelings then as well.  

i am so overwhelmed with stress lately, and this is just icing on the cake.  i need to find a way to chill out.  speaking of icing i still need to decide on frosting flavors for my cupcakes for the wedding.  uhg.  

so if anyone made it this far...how did you get back up on the proverbial horse and try again.  or did you.  was the constant fear there through the entire pregnancy or did you ever ''relax'' and just enjoy the ride.  whats your favorite kind of cupcake lol.  

 i apologize for any poor writing or confusion...im on benadryl and loopy and still not able to sleep...and its now 10am. also sorry again for this horribly long rant.  i just needed to vent it all out. "

But lately, probably bc my gf (24) has been away for 3 months in NY doing an internship (luckily she'll be back in 3 weeks), and I've (25) been practically living at the hospital as a medical student, stressed and tired - I find myself getting annoyed if she goes out drinking with friends once or twice a week. It's not a trust issue, it's not low self-confidence, it's not that I think NY is sketchy as hell to be out late, or anything like that that..it's just something in the back of my head that I make into a bigger deal.

As soon as she tells me that she's going out my mood instantly changes and I become bitter. She's realized this mood change, and we've talked about it, I've told her that I'll truly do my best to nip that BS in the bud bc my mood affects hers and I'd hate for her to not have fun on my weird distaste...  Yet it still gets to me.

Any advice would be great!

Since this is taking a large amount of time she asked me if it would be possible to enter the customers name/number into her document and then have the rest of the data automatically filled with the according information from the Excel.

I thought that i would best go about somehow setting variables in her document and fill them out with the result of queries (from my research i think SQL would be a good choice, they seem to be pretty easy?)

What programming language should i use? (maybe VB script? or autoit? or is there an office intern language that helps with tasks like this?)

Do you know a good resource where i can educate myself? Maybe even one with code samples that do similar things

How would i go ahead with sending queries to/receiving the data from the Excel?

What should I do?,forgotab,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1i9nkq/i_21f_am_confused_about_my_feelings_for_my/,"tl;dr I owe my professor a lot and also have a pretty big thing for him. What do I do? Sorry for the wall of text!


My college career has been rough. I attend a cut-throat university with an enormously high drop out rate and low average GPA. During the fall of my freshman year, I put all of my effort into joining a sorority. This had a small negative impact on my studies, and my first semester I got a 3.5 ish. However, it was fun and I was happy. My second semester I got in a major accident that resulted in me having strokes, frequent TIAs, episodes of vision loss, greatly reduced memory loss, white outs, etc. As a result, I lost all of my new ""friends"". My sorority was both morally and legally responsible for the accident that had caused this at-the-time life threatening condition. They told me they were afraid I would sue them (I never intended to; shit happens and I didn't want to ruin a bunch of lives), so they blocked me out and cut all contact. I was devastated at the time. Now I kind of understand that they were scared and young and stupid and had only known me for a few months. 


I had just started dating a new boyfriend and he stayed with me through it all. Unfortunately this made be very dependent on him. For the next two years he was my only companion. We moved in together in the summer and it did not take long for him to become emotionally and physically abusive. I was terrified of leaving him and quickly got dangerously depressed. I am a stubborn person and made the poor decision to try to stay in classes through everything that happened, and a combination of missing lectures and literally having a temporary lowered IQ (I don't know how to describe it; I could not process information properly anymore) resulted in me failing things. My GPA tanked and I almost lost the scholarships that are paying for my education.


By some stroke of luck, last year I ended up in an internship in my field. My boss in that job is amazing and I love every part of it. Eventually I befriended some of my older co workers and got some of my self respect back. What was supposed to be a one-term deal ended up getting extended until I graduate, and I started bringing my grades back up to ""normal"" range. Last semester, I finally hit a breaking point and I split from my abusive boyfriend. The relationship obviously did not end well and I was not myself, and for a few months I was definitely suicidal and spent most of my time just praying to die. I saw a therapist for a while and then a psychiatrist because apparently my brain damage was contributing greatly. I never left my apartment for anything besides work or class. My parents had to come live with me for a while and when they could no longer afford to do that I got a puppy. 


He saved my life. I basically forced myself to get my shit together because another living creature depended on me. I started making myself wake up in the morning and take him on walks, seeing other people so he could socialize with their canines, etc. By this January I had some degree of normalcy back in my life... but I still kind of hated myself and was only really putting on a show. Once the dog went to sleep I was back in a very, very dark place.


Anywho, none of that changed until I met who I will refer to as Professor V. Professor V teaches the last class I will ever have to take in a subject I have always been ""bad"" at. I've never gotten better than a C in this field and even those C's I had to fight for. The first day I attended his lecture, I knew I had a crush on him in the standard ways. He's funny, charismatic, physically attractive, and has many shared interests. However, this was not enough to make me forget my shame about how poorly I was going to do in this subject. I avoid things I am afraid of, and so I did not attend a single lecture after this until the midterm. 


On the day of the midterm, I had some extra time before it was being proctored, so I met up with an acquaintance on campus to hang out. By chance I decided to go ask Professor V a question, and somehow he spent the next three hours giving me a crash course on the test's material. Even though I had been blowing his class off for weeks, he even went as far to skip his lunch and spent his only free time that day helping me prepare. This cram session is the only reason I passed at all. 


I never missed class again. I don't know; something about how much effort Professor V had put into helping me got to me. Then I started taking good notes, studying, coming to office hours, and REALLY REALLY trying to do better than a C. Professor V was always there to help and would stick around even into the night if my friends or I had questions for him. After a while I stopped needing any assistance from him and can even teach the material to my peers myself now. My GPA shot up not just in his class but in ALL of my classes. I began going out again. I've met tons of new buddies, rekindled old hobbies I used to love, and have even decided to shoot for going to graduate school. It was really strange. Every time I left a meeting with Professor V, I felt smart and good about myself, so I'd go home and accomplish something. I haven't felt smart or good about myself in a long time. 


At the same time, Professor V and I have become friends (though we never cross any lines). He's always there to support me even in things that aren't relevant to the course material (for example he's guiding me through my graduate school applications and he got me in touch with a local symphony to play in). Now the semester is ending and I am aware that I am about to lose my excuse to be around him.


I am head over heels for Professor V. He is single, unmarried, and not much older than I am. More importantly (and independently), I respect the hell out of him. This man regularly goes way above and beyond his obligations as a teacher. You can tell he does his best all of the time and is always willing to help people (not just me!) even at his own expense. I want to be like him really badly. I want to be like him so badly that this drive has changed me. Now I, too, am trying hard. And my life is falling back into place.  


I don't want to stop having Professor V in my life. I'd like to try dating him if I could. I'm aware that he might not reciprocate my feelings and I'm okay with that. However, if I can't be with him, I want to thank him. I feel like Professor V almost single handedly pulled me out of my depression and improved my life for the better. I've already decided that I'm going to take this experience and try to ""pay it forward"", but I also want to tell him I appreciate all he's done. Letting him know that is more important to me than satisfying my hormones.

For a month or so we've been doing a little bit of flirting back and forth and we just started to carpool to and from work. Nothing too extreme, since we work together.

I started to realize that I have a bit of a crush on her this week. She's a really cool, sexy girl and we see eye-to-eye on many things like probably no girl I've met before.

This Friday I was planning to ask her out on a date, but while at work she casually slipped that she has a boyfriend (who lives 5 hours away during the summer). I never asked her if she had a boyfriend, but given the amount we have interacted... she has actively hidden this from me. 

I don't know why, but it kind-of crushed me. I feel like a bit of a fool for thinking we had some sort of connection... and now I find myself in a bit of a depressive state. All of a sudden I can't stop thinking about her and it makes me physically sick.

I realize that the smart thing to do here would be to just move on, but I'm going to see her every day, drive to and from work with her every day. The worst part is: I don't see how I'm ever going to meet anyone who I vibe with so well. I've had my share of hookups in college, but I don't think I've ever met anyone who understands me and actually likes me.. This is a recurring theme in my life and this is what makes the whole thing so difficult.

Should I tell this girl how I feel or not? What the hell should I do? Thanks."
1i8zjh,12,2013-07-13,BS or BA for Computer Science does it really matter?,rjd89,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1i8zjh/bs_or_ba_for_computer_science_does_it_really/,"To put this into prospective I am ready to be done with school as the computer science degree I am working on now will be my second (first one was a AAS in police science which I did not enjoy, but looking back I was not ready to take a computer science degree seriously as I was immature coming out of high school).

I am thinking of switching into a BA degree which will be a semester less of classes (2 semesters left instead of 3). I am currently working as a internship in a job related field reporting off databases and will continue on as part time during the school year and from what I hear they usually hire on the interns when the finish their degree. Will the year and a half of experience be enough to make up for getting a BA in computer science over a BS?

I should note the major differences between the BA and BS are 5 classes. (2 math classes and 2 CS classes) however I will still be specializing my degree in the Database systems course as I would with a BS I just wouldn't have to take as many general CS degrees for other specialized fields (1 instead of 2).

Either way I plan to continue on as normal next semester as I am not forced to make a decision until then as up until then all classes taken will not overlap, but I would like to start thinking about it now. Also I am not %100 sure but I am fairly certain my gen ed/classes for other degree will cover the extra elective hours needed for a BA.

Some nice, some angry, some crazy, and some just plain pathetic.  As an intern in DC not only do you pass these people every day but they call to your office to complain to you about the state of the nation.  You’re all smart people and I assume you know yelling, “abortion is bad,” or, “Republicans hate me because I’m poor,” don’t really get your thoughts anywhere in the office except on a piece of paper next to my phone.  

Having said that, we do receive calls from level headed people but for every level headed, intelligent call I receive, I receive 5 irrational calls.  Normally these calls are limited to the caller being angry about what my boss voted on or what the House and Senate are doing and end at that, but sometimes they go to far.  Now obviously we have protocols for dangerous people who threaten things and it’s quite easy to scare them off once they are aware of that but sometimes they skirt the line between psychopath and angry citizen that the protocols don’t regulate.  

Now, I’ve never been afraid in DC.  I’m from the midwest and while the people might be a little shorter with you, being polite to them usually wins them over.  I give money to the  few homeless people I pass on my way to work every day and they seem to recognize me and appreciate that having talked to me and knowing I’m an unpaid intern.  But there was a new face on the street yesterday.  

There was nothing immediately off-putting about this guy.  I gave him some change on my way to the office and he thanked me.  That was about it.  The next day I did the same thing and even chatted with the guy.  He asked me where I worked and I said what office, he said he’d never heard of the guy but was pulling for him since he had, “Such a nice young man on his staff.”  

That was when the phone calls started.

The first one was non-alarming.  “Congressman ********’s office this is ******** how can I help you?”  On the other end of the line there was just shallow breathing.  Again I receive tons of phone calls all the time.  I asked again how I could help and with no response, hung up the phone, just relieved I didn’t have to get yelled at again.

These phone calls became a regular thing and honestly, I didn’t mind the little break.  Not doing paperwork, not getting yelled at, whatever.  

Then one day I noticed that the new guy wasn’t on the street that morning.  At first I jumped to the worst conclusions thinking maybe something happened to him but then I got hopeful thinking maybe he found something to get him out of his bad luck.

That day I received a phone call at the office. “Congressman ********’s office this is ******** how can I help you?”  “You’ll never find me...” * click *

The line went dead and that was that.  Okay... this guy is unstable and running around DC thinking me or anybody else has it out for him and is looking for him.  Whatever, he’ll move on, he’ll forget this office, he’ll forget me, and nothing will happen.
 On the way home I asked the other homeless guys if they’d heard anything about him, out of curiosity, and they said he just disappeared but that they’d keep an eye out for him. 

The next day at the office I received a call, “Congressman ********’s office this is ******** how can I help you?”  “But I can find youuuuu.....”  * click *

Ok. What the fuck.  

I mentioned it to my supervisor and they said it’s probably nothing to worry about but if it happens again let them know. 

I talked to the homeless guys again and said I was kind of freaked out.  One of them mentioned they saw the guy using a pay phone earlier in the day.  I may have jumped to conclusions but I figured it must be him calling me from these phones and he must be messed up on something.

The next call was the most disturbing.  I received a call, ““Congressman ********’s office this is ******** how can I help you?”  “******** office how can I help YOU?”  “I’m sorry what?”  “You heard me you little fuck.”  * click *

Now I’d had enough.  I talked to my supervisor again and he said go into the caller i.d. and write down the number.  He’d pass the number along to find the pay phone and my description of the guy so they can take him in.

I went into the caller i.d. and started writing down the number when I realized I was writing my own number down.  He was in my house.  I told my supervisor and we immediately phoned the police.

I wrote an application in Delphi XE2 a year ago for a company I was interning at. This application connected to the company's sever for the development team that had a specific database for my application. The server uses SQL Server 2008 R2 to manage the databases. 
 
This summer I returned to the company as an intern again and made some changes to the database and application.  I have SQL Server 2008 R2 and Delphi XE4 this time. The changes I made in the database were minor but I still needed to update the app, which I did in XE4 with a few improvemtns. 

Now comes the confusing part. My app was being used while I was gone. It worked just fine on a co-worker's station up until I came back and pushed out a new version through XE4. The error that was being thrown was ""Provider not found...."" But the app works fine on stations that have SQL Server 2008 R2 installed on them.

So my question is why did that happen? How come, in order for my app to work now, a SQL Server 2008 R2 has to be installed? Because that was not the case before. Were there changes in the component ADOConnection (which I used to connect to the database) since XE2 that could cause this? 

Previous searches proved fruitless, so I was hoping maybe some of you guys had some input. I can update with any additional information tomorrow if you guys need. Thanks in advance!"
1id7pj,92,2013-07-15,On the performance of hedge funds vs. index funds,dontfightthefed,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1id7pj/on_the_performance_of_hedge_funds_vs_index_funds/,"Upfront disclaimer:  I am an engineering student at an American university who is currently an intern at a bank.  I have been obsessed with finance since my senior year of high school, and plan on working in finance after college.  This is a throwaway account because I prefer to have very little personal information on my actual account for privacy reasons.

I joined the investing subreddit a little while ago, and have pretty much been a lurker minus a few posts here and there.  I would like to use this post to discuss the widespread negativity towards hedge funds.  I am a bit biased in that I would like to work for a hedge fund one day, but I will try to be as objective as possible and am by no means claiming that I am right.  I would just like to provide the other side of the argument:

As I’m sure most of you know, we have seen an unprecedented expansion of the monetary base by the Federal Reserve since 2008 known as [Quantitative Easing]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing).  Since the bottom of 2009, the S&amp;P 500 Index has increased in value from [676 to 1683](http://i.imgur.com/VN4UXsn.gif) (as of 4:00pm ET), which is a return of almost 150%.  

There has been an increasing amount of scrutiny from both news outlets and retail investors about the hedge fund industry, and how the returns do not justify the exorbitant fees.  Many examples use the industry's performance against the S&amp;P 500 as proof that they are not worth the money.  It is very much true that the hedge fund industry has under-performed the stock market in recent years.  [This graph](http://i.imgur.com/h38Ly1v.gif) plots the most widely used proxy for hedge fund returns from [HFRX](https://www.hedgefundresearch.com/hfrx_reg/index.php?fuse=login_bd) against the S&amp;P 500 since the bottoms of 2009.  However, that is not a reasonable comparison.  Some hedge funds are long-biased equity funds, but most are not, which means comparing returns to the S&amp;P is in many cases comparing apples and oranges.  

By definition, hedge funds are ""hedged"", which means they have positions that ideally benefit from both upward and downward swings in the markets.  Although many still do outperform the market during up years, it's the down years in the market that hedge funds tend to provide the most [alpha](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alpha.asp), which is a risk-adjusted measure of performance against a benchmark.  The most recent crash is a great example of this; [here](http://i.imgur.com/Z8DhUJZ.gif) is a graph of hedge fund returns vs. the S&amp;P 500 during the heights of the financial crisis.  As you can see, the S&amp;P 500 reached less than half of its value from the peak, while overall hedge funds never went below about 77% of their peak.

Looking further in the past to 1998 (the first full year the HFRX Index existed), we can see that hedge funds have [pretty handily outperformed](http://i.imgur.com/AfKKM4s.gif) the wider stock market, even after fees.

So what has caused hedge funds to perform so poorly recently?  Well, for starters, the markets are becoming more efficient every day, and it is much harder to find low-risk-high-reward trades today than it was even 5 years ago.

However, the cause of most of this lack of alpha is undoubtedly the intervention of the Federal Reserve in the markets.  Institutional investors tend to have greater returns during periods of higher volatility, and during times where individual stock picks do not correlate very closely with the broader market.  Since the financial crisis, the correlation of individual stocks with the broader market has gone from a range of 40-60% to a range of 60-80%.  [Here is a graph](http://i.imgur.com/rjJjUta.png) of the implied correlation of stocks within the S&amp;P 500 since 2007, with the beginning and end of each round of Quantitative Easing labeled for convenience.  

During periods of QE, hedge fund traders have a harder time gaining any kind of edge unless they try to predict the policy decisions of the Federal Reserve, since that is the major driver of the market.  Since the S&amp;P 500 Index has performed so well with the extra liquidity, and so many of the assets that make up the index have moved in tandem with it, institutional investors have had a very hard time finding that edge that they charge the big bucks for.

So, in conclusion, I believe the data shows that the recent abysmal performance of hedge funds relative to the stock market is a result of the extreme outperformance of equities and the high correlation between assets.  I also believe that hedge funds will definitely see a reduction in the fees they will be able to charge over the next few decades, but the top funds will most likely still be justified in making fortunes in the markets.

This post is intended to hopefully dispel some of the myths that have been thrown around in this subreddit, but also to start a conversation about actively vs. passively managed assets.  Please criticize anything I say that you disagree with, but try to provide some sort of evidence for your claims so I don't have to Google around too much, and so I can hopefully respond with something equally insightful.  Thanks!

**EDIT**: I knew I would screw something up in this.  My graph of the implied correlation of stocks doesn't have QE3 labeled.  It started in September of 2012 and is still going today.

**EDIT2**: Some people have correctly pointed out that Hedge Funds are not necessarily ""hedged"".  I don't know why I phrased it the way I did, because Hedge Funds are such a broad category nowadays that they aren't necessarily hedged at all.  I should have said Alternative Investment funds."

What should I do?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1id4wz/i_21m_love_my_girlfriend_20f_1_year_so_much_but/,"
I used to work with my [23F] friend and was deeply in love with her. I met her before I met my girlfriend. She was the only friend I had when my life went to shit at the same time hers was going to shit as well (broke up with 3 year boyfriend). We sought comfort with each other and well we never technically dated but we spent a whole summer jsut together smoking weed and just driving around talking about our problems. About a year ago I met my now girlfriend. Around the same time I made a decision that I should just spend time with this girl I'm dating because 1. I couldn't afford paying for two lunches everyday (I have a tendency to be so gallant even though unemployed...still happens with my gf now) 2. I wanted my first actual relationship and I didn't think it would happen with [23F] I had to leave my friend abruptly and very angry. No closure. I just stood up and told her ""...man I can't do this anymore, I don't want to be your back up I have to just go..."". I can see why she was very confused now (I was also reading reddit posts how girls keep a back up friend so they have a fall back, so you can see why I thought that way). It's been a year since I last talked to her. A few days ago I saw her while I was headed to my gym and we talked. She now interns at a [real job she wanted] and it happens to be close to the gym I go to! I've only been going there for 2 months. What a fucking surreal coincidence! I can't say that I forgot about her because she would still enter my mind now and again. When I saw her my mouth was just wide opened and felt like I was in this surreal dream. When we talked she kept smiling and laughing and happy to see me. She kept calling me douchebag for not texting her anymore. ""...haha what are you up to now?"" ""Uh well I-..."" ""YOU DOUCHE! Why did you stop texting me? haha"" ""Uhh you stopped.."" ""No you did you douche haha. I thought you were busy and shit"" ""Uhh I thought you were, I wasn't really..."" I was mostly still shocked, adrenaline rushing through my veins. I would only nervously laugh. We then sat close by to catch up, it was her lunch break. She then left jokingly said ""Well goodbye I'll never see you again, haha"" I texted her that afternoon after the gym and told her the truth. I thought I wasn't good enough for her that's why I just never kept in touch. I wanted to be someone she's not ashamed off. She thanked me for being honest and said we should have lunch sometime. (I forgot to mention that I told her that I never stopped thinking about her as a matter of fact I bought her something when I got back to my home country and I said I still have it if you like. She replied saying yeah I want it as payment for disconnecting me from your life, haha.

My question here is should I start being friends with her again? I really don't have a lot of friends I hang out with. My girlfriend has been busier lately with her job and she volunteers as well. I need a friend to hang out with. I'm unemployed still currently job searching and I go to gym everyday. I'm quite introverted and she [23F] was the only one that actually made me more who I am now. I try harder now than before because I wanna be like her [23F]. I admire her alot, her confidence and her personality. I love my girlfriend and I would marry her in an instant if I had money that would sustain our lives together.

SORRY FOR THE WALL OF TEXT, I can't make it any less as I fear I would n't be accurate enough :'(

Has anyone worked with/for their spouse and made it work? Is it a recipe for certain doom? If you made it work, what advice do you have for us?

---

Here's the stupidly long explanation I dumped on the poor bastards in /r/relationships. I'm bolding what I feel like is the important stuff, I know you guys have shit to do. 

**History:** 
My GF and I have been dating for about 3 years. We met in December of 2009 at a college party, started dating in April casually, and I broke it off before the summer because I was 19 and didn't want to try the long distance thing. I was immediately plunged into deep, deep regret which made me realize that I was, in fact, crazy about the girl, and we started dating again in the fall, going from 0-serious pretty quickly. 

She drove out to see me every weekend for the rest of the school year, and when I graduated and got a job she came up to see me twice a week and every weekend. In March of '12 she got a job near my apartment and we ""officially"" started living together. 

**She is the absolute love of my life, I believe I'm the love of hers, we both want to get married when we reach that point in our lives. (""That point"" is largely a financial one for me, I just want to be able to afford an engagement ring I'm proud to give her)**

**Sure, we have our share of spats, squabbles and arguments, but hardly ever have a fight we can't solve before we fall asleep.**

**Situation:** Right now she is a Proposal Coordinator for an IT contracting firm that is slowly in the process of going belly up, and I could write reams on how poorly her boss treats her. I am a ""Product Specialist"" (whatever the hell that means) for a very large internet company, while I enjoy the work, I do not enjoy the environment of a  Fortune-Fuck-You sized company that places little to no value on its workforce as people. 

A colleague from the BD department of her old company contacted her a few weeks ago, saying he was exploring a job opportunity with a company that does aviation contracting where he would go in and basically build a BD department and Proposal shop, and wanted to bring her on as his Proposal Manager. 

It is a phenomenal, practically once in a lifetime opportunity for her. It's far more responsibility than she has in her current position, and would give her the opportunity to set up and run a Proposal Department exactly the way she wants to. She would have a technical writer/graphic designer in her department immediately, and they would bring in writing interns from the nearby school. 

**He offered her a 50% bump from her current salary, and the company is located in an area with a cost of living that is at least 50% lower than where we currently are, so we're talking about a *significant* lifestyle improvement. We've always wanted to get out of this high-cost area we're currently in, and this new job is also closer to both of our parents'. All of this stuff is very, very good. We've been planning on doing this in a rough 5-year plan, never expected an opportunity to do it right the hell now to fall in our laps.**

**The only downside? It's a 2+ hour drive from my current job, and located in a pretty rural area. I've already applied for *the* job within 75 miles of her new office that I'm qualified for. Also, we're stuck in our current townhouse lease until next June, so we'll have to find new tenants to take our places.**

This leaves us with a handful of options, from easiest to most difficult: 

**1.)** I hear back from that job I applied for, get it, we find new tenants, find a place down there, move and live happily ever after.

**2.)** She telecommutes until we find new tenants, we find a place to rent exactly at the halfway point between our two offices, and we each have a 1 to 1.5 hour commute each way to our respective jobs. We live there for a year, which I spend combing the area for a job, and then once that lease is up we buy or rent a place closer to her job. Our biggest concerns with this are burning ourselves out on the commutes.

**3.)** She moves down and gets a 1br student apartment, and either finds a replacement or continues to pay her rent up here. I continue working up here until I can find a job close to her. This seems like the most practical solution, but I absolutely hate the thought of separating again and only seeing each other on weekends.

**4.)** I quit my job and move down with her, as soon as we find replacement tenants. Her income would be more than enough to maintain a comfortable lifestyle for us in that area, indefinitely. However, given the glacial rate of the job market down there, I'm scared that I would end up unemployed for several months and going stir-crazy, or just becoming irrelevant.

**5.)** The crazy fuckin' idea. 

I'm actually reasonably well qualified for the tech writer/graphic designer they want to hire to work in the Proposal Department. My bachelors degree is actually in tech writing, I have workplace experience writing requirements documents which is a similar type of work, and I have experience with, and enjoy doing graphic design work. If we both had new jobs starting at the same time in the same location, pretty much all the moving pains are absolved.

However, we would be working together on a daily basis. I would take my assignments from her, and she would review all of my writing (as well as the technical subject matter experts and executive team). 

I feel comfortable with this, but I'm sure I would be fooling myself to say its not going to place any additional strain on our relationship, or to think there's no chance of impacting our workplace performance or relationship at home.

Does anyone work with their spouse, that could share some words of wisdom? Is it a guaranteed recipe for disaster? If not, how could we set ourselves up to approach from the best possible way? Maybe we could set up rules about how we interact in the office, what we do and do not bring home from the office, etc, etc. Maybe we could structure our workplace relationship so that I also report directly to her new boss.

I'm pretty good at compartmentalizing what goes on in my work life from what goes on in my home life, and I think if we approached it correctly, we could keep that line clearly defined.

**Assuming the company was actually open to the idea, we'd be open to having some check-in sessions with a relationship counselor, and/or contacting my old career coach, to make sure we have all the tools we need to make it work.**"

So, today I get a call from the reception desk saying that someone needs help saving a document uploaded with a network scanner I moved to a Windows 7 machine a few weeks ago.  When I get there, the woman explains that she can't find the share drive (to save the scanned document) in Windows Explorer because it doesn't appear in the drop down menu, regardless of the fact that the icon was 2 inches away under ""Computer"". 

Honestly, I was glad it was an easy (and somewhat understandable for older users) issue, and my cube mates and I got a decent chuckle out of it.

TL;DR I taught someone how to use Windows Explorer today."

**EDIT:** After mulling it over a bit I think I have a better proposal for her boss. He had originally mentioned hiring both graphic designer and a tech writer. I was thinking I could offer a lot of value by performing both roles, but that opens up the can of worms of working with my GF. 

Instead, if I offered to just take the graphic design role, and expand on it as much as possible putting all of my marketable skills to good use, and also offer to lean in and provide support to the BD department, then I think I could still be a good candidate to join the company. 

This means we wouldn't work together day in and day out, and she wouldn't issue me assignments or review my work."
1icuq6,3,2013-07-15,What's wrong with me?,[deleted],MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1icuq6/whats_wrong_with_me/,"I'm a 19 year old, graduated from high school last week. I've been having anxiety episodes every now and then, but never had any proper medication. I struggled through it, until it passed (from a few days to a few months). 

My parents are very uneducated. They never showed any interest in my life, so that left a huge mark in my life. There are many lessons I didn't receive, things I had to learn all by myself. I never felt any emotional support. Sometimes I think I'm too selfish and expect too much support when I don't deserve none (I hope that's not a double negative). And something I inherited from my family I keeping my feelings to myself. I always found people very hard to trust, and if I trusted them, I would almost always have second thoughts about it, almost to an extent where I would become paranoid about trusting people. I pile everything up inside me.

When I was a kid, I wanted to hang out with friends all the time. But since none of my friends lived close, whenever I asked my parents to take me somewhere they either had no time or didn't let me. Inviting friends over was not an option, because I always felt ashamed where I live.

That made me a very introverted person. I kept hanging out in my room, behind the computer. I've become a great programmer and a computer guru (or so I've been told), but lost all social skills. I don't know how to approach people, how to start a conversation, how to ask a girl out etc. I always had friends, but I could mostly only hang out with them in school. By the time I got my driver's license and I could drive anywhere I wanted, I didn't have the motivation to go anywhere, because I was more used to being inside.

Anyhow, then I started sharing my problems. I have 2 sisters. I told them how I felt, and they were supportive. They tried to help me, and kept asking me how they can help, but I never know how people can help. Or I'm too anxious to tell them. 

Now this might sound douchy, but I never felt like anyone in my family was on my intellectual level - I could never join conversations they had, and when I tried explaining things to them it ended up with an awkward silence and a bunch of confused faces. Then my sister got a boyfriend. I could really connect with him, I felt like he understood me. He saw everything that was wrong with my family, and even confronted my parents about how they treat me, which no one has done before. He's become my idol, and I'm really glad my sister found him. He's helped me through many problems, and actually taught me a lot of things I've missed out as a kid. 

But lately, I've been feeling really depressed. I'm sad all the time, and the only other emotion I've been able to express was rage, when something didn't go as planned. Talking about the smallest things here - I tried cutting cheese, I failed to cut a perfect slice and got so mad I wanted to bash my face into the ground. I don't know what's going on with me, but I don't feel like a normal person.

And today is my sister's boyfriend's birthday. I really wanted to go and congratulate him, he lives 100 feet from my house. When I walked out I froze up. I got really anxious and I could barely breathe. I turned around and walked the other direction. Now I hate myself. I couldn't make a tiny gesture to someone who's done more for me than my whole family. I fucking hate myself. He's gonna think forgot about it, and that I'm an ungrateful bastard.

I don't know what to do with myself. Sometimes I just feel like a giant attention whore with no real problems. I hope these blocks of text make any sense to you.

edit: Oh, and to top it off - I had goals in my life, things I wanted to achieve. I lost all that - even though they are still very realisable, I don't feel like completing any of set goals. I've been offered a great internship that requires me to make a project of their choice, but I can't find motivation to even start it. The internship would help me immensely throughout college.

I've been attending college, pursuing a degree in compsci. I only have one more year left, so I decided to get an internship. I applied, and got it, and moved 3 hours away from home to work for the summer.

I won't give out too many details about the job, but right now I'm basically sitting at a cubicle and working on the occasional small programming projects. Sometimes my employers need time to come up with projects for me and the other interns, so I occasionally have a bit of downtime throughout the day.

This can become a bit boring, so small things like phone meetings are pretty exciting for me because I see them as a means to kill some time. The other day, I get an email for a team meeting to be held at 1pm. 

The way meetings work, is that we call in using the meeting code attached in the email. We're prompted to speak our name, then join the room where our name is repeated by a recording. Then the meeting starts when all the necessary people have joined the call.

Excited for the meeting, I called in at 12:55, knowing I might be the first person on the phone. I said my name, got switched to the meeting, and I was right. After saying a couple of ""hellos"", no one responded. Oh well. 

After two minutes of waiting, the automatic voice chimed in. ""Now joining: ...""

Usually the person's name is stated after the ""now joining"", but instead of a name there was just a pause. The automatic voice also sounded a bit distorted. I didn't think much of it and just continued waiting for other people to join.

I looked across the office and saw that other people were just sitting at their desks doing other busy work. I began to wonder when they would join the meeting.

I sat back down, and start rocking back in my chair. I start hearing a strange noise, like someone puffing air out of their nose rapidly. I took off my headset, thinking the noise was coming from my chair. Nope, it wasn't. I thought nothing more of it and put the headset back on my ear. It was one of those weird headsets that wraps around your ear. I'm still getting used to it and often have trouble putting it on and taking it off.

The puffing noise stopped. I look at the clock and saw that it was 12:57. Still no one else has joined the meeting room. They should've be coming in by now. 

The puffing noise started again, this time faster, sounding like someone just got done running and is breathing through their nose instead of their mouth. I just sat there, listening to the noise, not thinking much of it at all. The puffing noise turned into a low grunt, and the grunt slowly built up to a light laughter.

I was a bit put off by this, thinking it might just be another worker who forgot to mute their microphone. The laughter got louder, almost painful in my ear. I rolled over to the controls and turned the volume down on my headset. But as I lowered the volume, the laughter just got louder and more beast-like. 

Now was the time for me to start freaking out. I stood up and tried to take off the headset. My fingers fumbled with it, and I couldn't get the damn thing off. I obviously made a loud ruckus. I finally got the headset off and threw it onto the table. I could still hear the laughter coming from the headset. A coworker came by and asked me what was wrong, I pointed to the headset. The laughter had stopped though.

I asked him if he had gotten the meeting invite in an email, and he said no, that there wasn't any scheduled meetings at 1pm. I got goosebumps, and decided not to tell him or anyone else about what I had heard. I put the headset back onto its stand and just sat down, and the coworker just went back to his cubicle.

I had broke out in a sweat, and was shooken up. I got up to go get a drink from the breakroom, and when I got back, I saw I had an email. I checked it and saw that it was another meeting invite for 1pm the next day. I walked over and asked my coworker if he got an invite, and he said no. I showed him the email and he just scratched his head. We checked who sent it, but the sender field was blank. 

I haven't called into that meeting again, but I'm still getting the invites. I've just been deleting them."

So, I have an internship at a small IT company, and I'm working with asp.net in VB. During the first month, I've been getting used to the whole asp.net framework and learning vb (i thought it was pretty similar to java), doing simple string substitutions, querystring, etc. Then last week, my mentor challenged me to implement the Google Speech Recognition API to facilitate users when they have to input something in the textbox! The API is at 

https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html

and once i took a look at it. I was instantly lost. Is this normal?

Anyways, today, he said for me to hold off the speech recognition, and to look into how we could import linkedin profiles to our database. I took a look at the developers page, and I think it doesnt let you simply just extract files with the API. Could someone help me understand the whole concept?  I really want to learn, but I feel like I dont even have a grasp of anything here!

Thanks!"
1icq0l,2,2013-07-15,I [22/M] need advice about my major concerns with my girlfriend [21/F] for Marriage,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1icq0l/i_22m_need_advice_about_my_major_concerns_with_my/,"I need advice on my current situation. I appreciate the help.


So a quick background. We met in my junior year of college in the same club at school. I was interested in her but decided to wait a little till i was more stable in terms of career (i have gotten 2 internships since then) to tell her. Me and her come from conservative/religious backgrounds: no sex before marriage, seek a girl/guy out for the sake of marriage, etc. So i didnt want to start things till my ability to be a husband was in the near future (1-2 years). 

So i told her of my interest, it was mutual, i talked to her father, our parents met. At this stage i am still trying to get to know her as a person to see if our personalities can mesh, our mentalities in life are similar, and to see if i am making a good decision in terms of marrying at this age. 

So here are my pros, cons, and concerns:

First off i always have a hard time making a list of why i like her, but heres a shot.
1. Her character is really good. She is a really polite, nice girl, very sweet, doesnt get angry at much, assumes the best of people, she is God Conscious. 

2. I still havent really got a solid picture of her personality. The bulk of our interactions in the past have been strictly business. When we began talking to get to know each other more, it was only 1-2 months before i left college. 
3. She is fearful of living in America due to islamophobia, and is afraid she might get attacked by people. A fear i believe is completely unwarranted. 
4. In general, she is fearful of things (like marriage) because she ""hears a lot of stories and it scares her""
5. She is traditional in her way of thinking and i think a bit resistant to new ideas. 
6. Our humor is similar, we have good intellectual conversations, she hates it when girls get over dramatic about things (""you havent called me so im mad at you"" lol)
7. She loves her ethnic country and wants to visit it alot. I dont really care for that country and have talked to her about living in America to build our family and she is on the same page.
8. shes really shy. She doesnt question people when something is wrong, or just avoids “arguments” even though its right to speak up about something
9. Half the time i am attracted to her (physically and personality) and other items i am really turned off (physically and personality). I dont if im physically attracted to her. The fact that i cant answer that question is troublesome.
10. She has a victim mentality. 
11. She has big insecurity issues. Like at first, she wanted to know early on if i was set for marrying her, and couldnt handle the insecurity of not knowing. This is a big concern for me cause i am very ambitious and want to accomplish much in my early years and in life, and wonder if she will be able to handle financial insecurity. Her support isnt simply verbal, its also her ability to handle situations.
12. I dont wanna wait till im like late 20s to get married. Obviously i dont know the future, and i might find someone in a year or two, but i guess still being a virgin and never having a relationship, i want both and perhaps i am a bit impatient (which is a big mistake). 
13. This is the worst part: If for some reason it was to be broken off right now. I think i wouldnt care. I would brush it off. Maybe later i would wonder if what i did was right or wrong, but for the most part, i dont think it would effect me much. That being said, many things dont effect me much. 

Sooo yeah, i think i put most of it. There is still the whole question is if i am ready formarriage or not,or if i should focus on getting my life in order then think about getting married. 

I really appreciate the help guys.

The more I think about the movie the more I like it. I entered the cinema with an open mind, but having a preconceived notion that there won't be much a deep message but just a nice action flick. I was mistaken.

The big take away from this film in my opinion: Mortality.

""A good death is it's own reward"" is a great line that pops up a couple times during the movie. I think this really is THE line of the movie. Acknowledging your own mortality and accepting the fate of your inevitable demise in the best way possible for the greater good.

Here are some moments in the film that support this theory.

- Johnathan Kent accepting his death for the greater good (keeping Clark's powers unknown) during the tornado.

- Perry White attempting to rescue the inevitable dying intern who was trapped under the building. Even staying with her to the very end.

- Faora-Ul (Zod's commander) allowing Colonel Hardy a warrior's death with a knife fight. The line comes up for the first time here.

- Colonel Hardy sacrificing himself and all the crew members on the plane by nose diving into the machine. Repetition of the line.

- Lara-Lor Van accepting her planet's fate (Krypton) and not attempting to run. Dying with acceptance and not fear.

- Zod being the villain is also the counterpoint to this thesis attempting to keep his species alive no matter the cost. Even if it requires destroying another planet and all it's inhabitants. Refusing to die, but causing so much more destruction in return.

- The key to Krypton is a skull (irony). The mortality of a corpse.

I'm sure there are many other points in the film I may have missed too. What do you think?"

1icdks,2,2013-07-15,"My ex (21F) just broke NC with me (21M). Trying to re-heal, now.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1icdks/my_ex_21f_just_broke_nc_with_me_21m_trying_to/,"To give a bit of backstory (without going into gory details), my ex left me a little over two weeks ago. For the most part, it was out of the blue. Her and I entered a relationship not even 5 months after a highly damaging, 3 year-long one with her ex. The 8 month relationship that her and I had was very refreshing to her because it was very intense with much love and talk of the future, but she has suddenly come to the realization that she never took time to be single- to get over her ex and to be her own person. She was very heartless during the breakup, and even the days after. She broke my heart, and then posted pictures of her going out having a good time. I initiated NC- I blocked her on Facebook and Twitter, deleted our texts, deleted her number- etc. I struggled with checking her Twitter until the past few days, but became adamant in my decision to stop once I found nothing but heartbreak on social media.


I was at the lowest, saddest point in my life after the breakup. Crying often, not eating, turning to alcohol, etc. But, slowly, I started to put myself back together (of course, with plenty of relapses). I followed all the advice- revisiting with friends, working out, staying busy with projects, no contact (of course), and I slowly started to get better. I’d stop thinking about her for 10 minutes at a time (which is very relieving when it’s all that occupies your mind for 2 weeks). I stopped dreaming of her every night. I took her off of her pedestal and was able to recognize things that I did not love about our relationship. I stopped wanting her back endlessly, and allowed myself to be upset with her- to be angry with her decision. I even came to an acceptance that what she and I had was true love, but that she has demons that she needs to handle on her own. I cannot make her baggage my own. If nothing else, I was at least happy that she was finding happiness on her own. I was determined to do the same.


Two nights ago, I received a text from her, saying “Hi. I know you don’t want to talk to me, but I just wanted to say hello and that I hope you’re doing well.” To which I only replied “thanks.” I woke up to two pages of her saying how much she misses me, but that she’s not in a good place in her life. She has gone back home to her parent’s house to figure her life out, and that she’s honestly wanted nothing more than to call me. She’s very sorry for what has happened. I replied by saying that I won’t deny that she broke my heart, but that I understand what she’s doing. I told her that no matter what, both of us will be fine and that life goes on. I told her I hope she finds what she’s looking for and that I want her to be happy.


I did not tell her I want her to come back. I did not offer her help. I did not tell her there was no future for us, nor did she. I could not give her closure, and she could not give it to me. So, now, I have never been more confused in my entire life. I feel as though I am suffering from bipolarity- I will desire her one moment, then despise her the next. This experience has caused many emotions to resurface. She is giving up a LOT to return home like this- she worked two jobs and had an internship, and none of her friends are at home. She is clearly not doing well…and it hurts for me to see it. I am glad to see that our relationship had an impact on her, but it doesn’t please me to see her hurting. However, I still recognize that no matter what I feel, I cannot help her. I cannot even try to. If she and I have a future together, she needs to find peace within herself. I cannot try to bring her back when she is vulnerable. After all, that was how our relationship started.


This brief conversation has opened many fresh wounds and has left my future even more unpredictable. While I was unhappy with her attitude towards our breakup at first, I was at least coping. By her reaching out to me again and telling me that she’s unhappy, I feel responsible. I feel frustrated, because I just want her to be the person she was when we were together. This has made me want to wait for her, because it implies hope. It puts her on the back burner again, and I know that’s not healthy for me. However, I play out a scenario where we get back together, and it’s hard to imagine. We’d have to start from scratch. She would have a lot to answer for, and she’d have to adhere to a lot of ground rules. She would know what I suffered through, and she’d know how bad she hurt me. This scenario is impossible to predict and plan for, so I need to continue without her. After all, my biggest nightmare is her “rediscovering herself” with a new guy. I need to rediscover my “happily single” life.  I’m going to try to continue as though the breakup was final. I will continue blocking her on social media and avoiding all contact. I will not jump back into the “dating game,” but I will not avoid meeting new women, either. I will continue working out and trying new things. I only have a year left of my bachelors, and I need to focus. I’ve heard of many relationships that suffer a roadblock such as this one, and it has made them stronger. However, I know that every situation is different, and this truly might be the end. I just can’t stand this level of uncertainty. 


Anyways, I don’t really know what I’m doing here- I guess I’m just trying to put my thoughts on “paper”. Any advice, Reddit?

**TL;DR;**  My ex has contacted me again after a traumatic breakup and it has caused many wounds to open, with a brand new level of confusion and pain (though definitely not back to ""square one"")."

I've been doing a lot of soul searching, and I am slowly formulating a decision on whether I should remain in grad school or not. I am a PhD student in civil engineering (structural emphasis), but I believe that a PhD is out of the question completely for me at this point.  

I just completed my second year at an ""average, nothing exceptional"" institution. I think it will take me at least one year to get my masters.

I got super depressed and burnt out after my second year. I had been feeling it for some time, and I tried to push through, but ultimately I lost all energy, passion, and motivation to go on. My adviser was very demanding, and additionally required me to take many courses outside of my major. In reality, I only have taken 2 structural engineering courses. The remainder of my courses have been EE and ME. This was particularly due to my research area, which is structural health monitoring, but honestly, in hindsight, I don't think it does me much good for a job in structural design. I would mind a ""structural health monitoring"" job, but I don't know if there is even a solid industry for that.

I don't want to complain about the classes I'm taking, because I think they're very interesting, its just that there is a HUGE learning curve for me to overcome in order for me to excel in those classes.

Last semester, I literally bombed both of my classes. I had to take an undergraduate mechanical engineering class (yeah I've taken two undergrad classes), and a graduate level EE class. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love the ME and EE subjects, its not like I wasn't interested in the material. It was just that I had no fucking way of dealing with all the stress at that point. 

The professor of the grad class that I bombed told me I have until Aug. 8th to take a final, comprehensive exam that would dictate my grade. I have barely studied. I can't bring myself to focus.

I also started smoking weed heavily to cope with the depression and stress. I don't see weed as a negative thing, but I do believe it is unhealthy for me to be smoking this much. I smoked through my first cigarette pack as well. So it doesn't seem like I'm headed in a good direction.

Its honestly come to a point where I can't even take care of myself properly. The notion of getting out of bed has become stressful, and simple tasks such as checking the mail have caused high amounts of stress. I've been on depression medication, and have not yet gone to therapy, though whether I quit or stay, I think therapy will be my next choice.

Although I am potentially close to a thesis masters, I honestly do not have the urge to continue.  I tried taking a break over the summer, but honestly, it hasn't helped much. I've been flirting with the idea for some time, and would really like to hear other peoples perspectives on what they would do in my situation.

 Let me tell you some of my credentials...this is engineering specific:

**Current Status**


* ~3 classes short for MS in Structural Engineering

* BS in Civil Engineering

* Previous internship experience

* FE license

* One 2nd author published journal paper

* Several conference papers/presentations

My idea is, I can't handle any grad school right now because I'm so burnt out and over it, so quit, take a break for a semester/look for an engineering job. Finish my MS (perhaps non-thesis) after I get a job. 


I really just want to know what other people think of my situation. Do you think I need to suck it up, or is quitting right before a MS thesis degree taking a step back. If you guys can please give me some advice, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Last semester, I literally bombed both of my classes. I had to take an undergraduate mechanical engineering class (yeah I've taken two undergrad classes), and a graduate level EE class. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love the ME and EE subjects, its not like I wasn't interested in the material. It was just that I had no fucking way of dealing with all the stress at that point. 

The professor of the grad class that I bombed told me I have until Aug. 8th to take a final, comprehensive exam that would dictate my grade. I have barely studied. I can't bring myself to focus.

I also started smoking weed heavily to cope with the depression and stress. I don't see weed as a negative thing, but I do believe it is unhealthy for me to be smoking this much. I smoked through my first cigarette pack as well. So it doesn't seem like I'm headed in a good direction.

Its honestly come to a point where I can't even take care of myself properly. The notion of getting out of bed has become stressful, and simple tasks such as checking the mail have caused high amounts of stress. I've been on depression medication, and have not yet gone to therapy, though whether I quit or stay, I think therapy will be my next choice.

Although I am potentially close to a thesis masters, I honestly do not have the urge to continue.  I tried taking a break over the summer, but honestly, it hasn't helped much. I've been flirting with the idea for some time, and would really like to hear other peoples perspectives on what they would do in my situation.

 Let me tell you some of my credentials...this is engineering specific:

**Current Status**


* ~3 classes short for MS in Structural Engineering

* BS in Civil Engineering

* Previous internship experience

* FE license

* One 2nd author published journal paper

* Several conference papers/presentations

My idea is, I can't handle any grad school right now because I'm so burnt out and over it, so quit, take a break for a semester/look for an engineering job. Finish my MS (perhaps non-thesis) after I get a job. 


I really just want to know what other people think of my situation. Do you think I need to suck it up, or is quitting right before a MS thesis degree taking a step back. If you guys can please give me some advice, I'd greatly appreciate it.

I'm a 22-year-old-female. I am also about to finish my undergraduate program this coming fall semester. I had a very rough semester this past spring, and starting going to counseling for self-esteem issues and minor depression. Unfortunately, counseling ended for me with the school year. I am looking into starting back up this week, as I just got a reference from a friend in my current city. I am not currently taking any medication. Just a little back story, it might help.

At the beginning of this summer, I think I had a panic attack. I was about to sleep, and right before nodding off, I felt this surge of strangely vague terror go through me. My heart was racing out of my chest, and my breathing was very shallow and quick. I was very scared, so I woke up my boyfriend. We were staying at his parents house. I didn't know what was happening, but I had this distinct feeling that I *needed* to leave the room (or maybe even his parent's house). I started to beg him to take me back to my apartment (at ~1:30 in the morning), which was about 30 minutes away. We ended up staying in the room, but he did stay up with me, turning the light on, holding me, talking to me, basically doing his best to try to calm me down. I was so freaked out. I called my mom at 2am, because I starting thinking, oh my god, what if something happened to my family? by 3 I tried listening to music to calm me down, but it didn't help much. I eventually just passed out from being so exhausted. I slept with the light on.

That was the worst episode I've had, but I have had many, many nights this summer of not sleeping due to feeling way too anxious to sleep. A few weeks after the panic attack, I moved to a new city to start a summer internship. I know that's a big life change, and probably a huge cause of my anxiety, but I never was too worried about it in my waking life. I was actually pretty excited.

Anyway. Back to not sleeping. I have had plenty of nights this summer where I just can't seem to settle. As soon as I get into bed and try to get comfy, my heart starts racing, my throat gets tight, and my breathing doesn't grow calm. I work M-F, so during those days, I try to get into bed by 11. However, when I'm feeling anxious, I won't sleep until 3-6. Sometimes if I do sleep on time, I'll wake up in the middle of the night, from a dream, and then feel very anxious and not fall back to sleep for hours.

To deal with this, I've just been watching my favorite shows on Netflix or reading. If I make myself focus on something, it helps. However, if my mind is not focused on something I like, the anxiety seems to worsen. I feel like its impact on me gets stronger and I cannot fight it as well.

I've never dealt with this kind of thing before... This is not the first time I've moved and had to take care of myself in a new place. But I am becoming increasingly frustrated with the lack of sleep.

Any recommendations? I don't know if this is something that I can manage on my own (perhaps through exercise, diet, mediation, etc) or if I need to get professional help.  Thank you so much for your time &amp; input."

I'm a student in Boston for the summer. Some things about me:

- I'm studying physics in a college on the west coast and am here for the summer for a research internship.

- I consider myself extremely nerdy - some of main interests are physics, reading/watching fantasy and scifi novels/movies, and video games. My favorite novels are George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series and Dan Simmons' Hyperion, and my favorite video game is Super Smash Bros. Melee (an old but classic game. I play at a semi-competitive level).

- That said, I see myself as a well-rounded person. I am an amateur musician on the side (I play piano and trumpet), and love going to live music shows and playing with groups. Jazz is my favorite genre, although just about anything can capture my interest.

- I don't smoke or do drugs, and am indifferent about drinking. I enjoy time alone, but also am a huge fan of good conversation. I dislike the typical college party, but do enjoy the smaller ones where I can meet new people and have some nice chats. The club scene doesn't interest me at all.

What am I looking for?

- You are not deterred, and hopefully interested by the above description.

- You are single and are open to the idea of a friends with benefits relationship. The friends component is crucial - I'm not interested in hooking up; I would like to become friends with someone and enjoy a sexual relationship too. If the chemistry doesn't work out, I would still very much be interested in having a platonic friendship. I just got out of a long-term relationship, and am looking for nothing serious, just a summer friendship/fling.

- Age: preferably 18-25. Although I consider myself mature, I'm not sure if I will have much in common with someone who is much older than me.

- Physically, I'm attracted to petite/slim builds. I am 5' 9"" myself, with a very slim body type (I'm Asian-American).

- If you have been in Boston for a while, I would love it if you would show me around and introduce me to the city. I've only been here for a few weeks and am eager to learn and experience as much as I can!

- You are nerdy, or at least open to geeky stuff like me. Although I like chatting about anything interesting, most of my interests are pretty nerdy, and most of my friends tend to be nerds as well. I go to a tech school - go figure.

- The above, however, isn't a hard requirement. Mainly, I'm looking for someone who I can click well with. Empirically, I've found that these tend to be educated and driven people. I like to hang out with people who are excited about something, be it science, music, or anything else.

- You must be accessible via MBTA.

If I still have your attention, please send me a PM and we'll see how things go from there. I'm excited about this summer, and would love to meet a nice girl to share time with :).

1ibcef,2,2013-07-14,Concern about my Background Investigation,[deleted],ProtectAndServe,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/1ibcef/concern_about_my_background_investigation/,"I have recently applied to a couple large police departments.  I have wanted to be a police officer for years now and it is my life's dream.  I feel I have a lot of good qualifications, i am a Lieutenant in the National Guard, I have had several volunteer internship positions in college with the main department I am applying for, and I have a four-year BA Justice degree from a well-regarded University, with letters of recommendation from many law enforcement personnel I have worked with.

Now here's the part that I'm worried about... I recently graduated from college.  Like most, I did some of the dumb guy stuff in school like drinking underage or buying a case of beer and letting my underage buddies have some.  Pretty much all of the random college stuff I did was in my first two years of school, when I was still a teenager (18/19)  I got a Minor in Possession ticket on spring break but it was dismissed after I completed a diversion program; I took a sign from campus once for my buddie's dorm room wall, and went into one or two buildings that were unlocked but closed without any intent to steal or vandalize, just to explore.  All of that I am confident will not be an issue especially since it has been a couple of years since I did any of it.

There is one thing though, during my sophomore year as a fraternity pledge I had had several too many drinks and was in a building that I was allowed to be in at the hour of the night, just wandering around and talking. My buddy and I passed a textbook donation box and Jack Daniels thought it would be funny to grab a handfull of the books, we did and met with our friend who did book buybacks and sold them to him for like ten bucks per person.  I woke up the next morning with a hangover and extremely guilty conscience.  I know it was wrong what I did and I am terrified that this will not allow me to continue as a cop.  Anybody have similar experience or can put my mind at ease?  I plan on disclosing everything to my BI.

(TL;DR: I am a well-qualified police officer candidate who once while drunk in college almost three years ago with a friend took some textbooks out of a donation box and sold them to a book buyback, will this screw me in backgrounds if I am honest about it)"

1ib8gr,2,2013-07-14,Deadline for applications to an internship coming up; can I exaggerate my skills?,needthisintership,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ib8gr/deadline_for_applications_to_an_internship_coming/,"I found an awesome online internship for the fall/spring semester. The internship I want to apply for requires a background in statistics, Excel and a statistics computer program. I'm a math major who hasn't taken any statistics other than a survey class. I've never used Excel or the computer program. But from the very start of the summer, my intention was to learn to use Excel/Access, the computer program and a database program in order to become employable in this field. I haven't started yet, so right now I know nothing. The internship won't start until September so I will have plenty of time to learn. 

But I really don't think I should lie on my resume and the application and say that I have experience using Excel and the computer program, right? Technically I would have some experience by the time the internship starts, but I don't think it is right to outright lie.

I just feel really shitty about this. This internship would be perfect for me if I had taken my education and career more seriously. But since I procrastinated learning what I need to know, I won't get this internship and I won't be able to get one next summer either because I have no references or experience (this one doesn't require references).

What should I do? Should I lie?"

Monday at 12:00AM I have a interview for an internship at a broker. Now normally with such an important even that would require my full attention and alertness I'd have a good 8 hour sleep but that is not possible in my position right now.  
  
It's not that I'm unable to sleep, I just can't because of things I have to do which require me to stay up this night without any sleep.
  
Normally this is not a problem for me as I'd just get a gram of speed and blast through whatever obstacle I'd have, seeing as I only do it on special occasions I don't have any tolerance either.

However I am unable to acquire any speed or coke, I am very surprised that this was ever possible because normally I can get both within 20 minutes.  
  
What small things can I do to get my body and mind to function properly? From what I recall coffee has not been something that affects me at all honestly. 

Is exercising a good option? Because I heard that gets your mind working and your muscles too, because once you start working out you get the ""gotta continue using energy"" mindset going and stay active.

Anyone have any idea's? I really can't screw this interview up because I'm tired en dazing off while being half in dreamland.

1ib11i,11,2013-07-14,Losing a close friend ever,btscott456,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1ib11i/losing_a_close_friend_ever/,"Two years ago, I worked at an Internship for a well-known company. There, I meet one of the closest friend I have ever had. Him and I became quick friends and we would do everything a stereotypical broamnce/bro-ship would do.

 However, things were getting intense when he ask for help about his sexuality (being gay) and I was trying to help him with it.  Then, things got intimate because I too had a slight attraction to men and him. Today, I am coming to terms with my bi-sexuality and learning that my attraction to men only goes so far. That breaking point was one night when he wanted to try his first blowjob. Afterwords, I quickly regretted it and learned it was not for me. I reacted badly to it - avoiding the subject, reducing hang out time/texting. Though, the subject kept coming up and I continuously rejected it.

At this point, I had to move away due to end of my internship. However, I returned for the summer and things changed quickly. I tried to make amends to my actions and felt bad for mistreating him after the fact. However, the requests continued and my apologizes were not working. The final straw was a lengthy ""text battle"" where both of us mocked and angered each other over personalities and habits. Fast forward to the present, I returned to the company for an entry job after college. Again, I try to make amends and ""to start anew"". However, I get in return is ignore texts, passive aggressive hostile, and fake conservation when the rest of our mutual friends are around. 

I never tried to be a dick and just wanted to be friends. His biggest complaint was I let him on and I repeated said I am sorry for it. Later, I would learned my bi-sexuality was to blame and could not help it. Also, it seems one wanted a romantic relationship and the other wanted to be friends. Can you guys make me feel better for losing a close friend?    

TL;DR - Two guys become very close friends. One is gay and the other is bi. Misunderstanding of friendship/relationship results in both being angry. Now, he doesn't want to be friends and starting anew won't work "

I am living with a woman temporarily over the summer while I am doing an internship with a government agency. The only other people who come into the house regularly besides the two of us are her pet sitter, we'll call her Stacy, and her handyman, we'll call him Bob. 

Once I moved in, she started noticing jewelry missing. When she confronted me, I was genuinely shocked and told her, after she opaquely accused me of stealing from her, that she was free to look around my room. Of course, she didn't find anything because I didn't steal anything. She is now - I think - suspecting Stacy, the pet sitter. She's been reluctant to set up a Nanny cam or anything like that (though I wish she would because I moved all my jewelry to my office because I don't want shit stolen, either). Not to mention that for my internship with the agency, I had a full background check done, including criminal background check.

It has made my living situation... uncomfortable. I've looked for another place to live but I'd rather stay where I'm at since I already paid her for the month and I'm going home at the end of the month.

Now my landlady is talking about filing a police report. She had an officer come out last night and they just chatted. I'm fine with her filing a police report, since her stuff is missing, but I have some questions.

If she does file a police report, am I obligated to talk to the police? Do I have to let them search my room? Should I have a lawyer present when I talk to the police? I have watched way too much Law and Order, so I am all worried. I also worry that once this all becomes public, Stacy might be very eager to plant something in my room. I don't have a lock on my door but I've been searching my room every night since I was semi-accused to make sure there isn't anything that shouldn't be there.

Nothing has really changed -except I can now remove the word Junior from my Manager title. 

I was wondering if anyone has any ideas how to approach this on my CV and Linkedin.

Do people usually list the company they are working at when they are consultants?

Linkedin is another issue, I want to update my profile to show that I now have a ""real"" job and not an internship, the company I actually spend all my time at looks better than the consulting firm, which is relatively small, but if I add my new position as the ""old"" company the consulting firm may not be too happy about that, and they are my real bosses when it comes down it.

I was moving one of the cables for a server named Odin. Upon unplugging the power cord, all the blinking lights went away. Apparently the socket that the other cord was plugged into was dead, and this server was running off one power supply. I plugged them both in to working outlets, and ran to my boss.

Right now I'm working at an internship within my university at an office that does educational outreach and the like.

Among my duties, I was tasked with finding engineers from places like architecture firms and aerospace companies to come for an event that we were holding for the current summer engineering class for high schoolers. We run the class every year and the kids get to earn college credit and take it to whatever university they end up going to. It's a pretty sweet deal, and I worked hard to bring people to this event that the kids would truly be interested in and fascinated by. After nearly a month of many phone calls, emails, and meetings, I got my 13 high profile engineers and I was quite proud of it.

So finally, the day of the event comes and as planned, we have two tables set up for the kids to write thank you letters to the speakers. A lot of these speakers we want to come back again so we thought it'd be a nice gesture, plus the kids get to write something that they know these people will be reading. The event starts, and everything is running pretty smoothly. We have over 100 students attending and we have them rotating in groups so that everyone gets to hear every speaker. I'm keeping the rotation going, when one of the TAs who was overseeing the thank you writing table comes up to me. He silently hands me a letter written by one of the students.

I read it. In short, it was written like a 5 year old, with huge wiggly letters. The letter itself basically went as follows;

Dear Mr. _____

I'd like to thank you SO MUCH for coming to speak to US! I was SO changed by your SPEECH. Now I plan to become a LIVESTOCK ENGINEER and I can't WAIT to slaughter little piggies using the AMAZING techniques you talked about!!!! YOU ARE JUST SO AMAZING!!!!!

-Chris P. Bacon


This little shit had written out an extremely sarcastic and ungrateful ""thank you"" letter to one of the speakers, clearly in disdain that he had to write out a thank you letter at all. Now, normally I don't care what people do, I'm a very 'you do you, I do me' kind of person. That is...until what others do happens to affect me personally. Had this letter been sent out, who knows what kind of shit storm would have rained down on me for it. I was truly offended. I worked hard to get these speakers here, and they were even so gracious as to bring some pretty impressive swag for the kids to have. That this kid would be such a douchebag about having to say thank you for that generosity really grinded my gears. ESPECIALLY when he's supposed to be ""college age"" and he's acting like a 14 year old brat. 

So I set out on getting some petty revenge on this jerk. I went to one of the teachers of the course and asked if she knew who this could possibly be, and if she could tell me their name. She instantly named him to me, she had already been in a run-in with him being a jerk. In a few minutes I knew who he was, and where he would be sitting when it came time for my revenge. I planned on telling off this kid in front of his peers, and treat him like the ungrateful child that he is.

The end of the event came. We had the kids stay at their last tables to fill out surveys and wait for their group to be dismissed. I made sure ""Chris"" had gotten his survey, and was chatting with the people around him before I began my approach. I came up to his table, and put a hand on his shoulder. ""Hello Mr. Bacon, could you come with me?"" His peers stared, pretty confused. After hesitating for a second, he got up, mumbling, ""sure"".

You know how when you want to lead little children, you kind of grasp the nape of their neck and steer them? That's what I did to this kid. I steered him to an empty table at the front of the room, and while I was walking him there, I said, ""Hey so, I read your letter, and I thought it was *really* funny. SO funny, that I want you to write another one! Except this time, don't be a little asshole about it.""

As soon as I called him a little asshole, he stared in shock with me. I had a name badge that said ""staff"" and I'm pretty sure he's not used to being called a little asshole by the people in charge. But what was he going to do to me anyway? I'm a college student, not one of the certified teachers or TAs. 

Anyway, I get him to the table and I push him down into his seat, and half throw a pen and stationary at him. He starts to write. At this point all of the other kids in the room are giving him the side-eye wondering why I just took him to sit at a table by himself. He finishes the second letter and his survey, and he gets up, rushes by me to get his book bag, and then tries to rush by me again to get out. But I step in his way to make him slow down enough to hear me say, ""Maybe next time you'll know not to be an ungrateful dick"". After saying that, I stepped out of his way, but not before he got to see me crumpling up his shitty second thank you letter and stuffing it into my back pocket. 

**TL;DR** some scrawny little prefrosh decided to be an asshole about having to write a thank you letter to some engineers that I worked really hard to get to come to an event to speak. I let him know that he's an asshole and an ungrateful dick, and treat him like a little kid since he decided to write like one.

1if89g,7,2013-07-16,I m [20] need an opinion of someone besides myself about ex F [20],TheGrumpyBuffalo,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1if89g/i_m_20_need_an_opinion_of_someone_besides_myself/,"OK, this is a long and complicated story, I will bullet point important things at the end because A lot of this i just want to write down so I can see it all at once, any opinions or help is greatly appreciated, I don't mind hearing anything critical either.


So we met within the first month of college, and dated for about a year and a half. The very first time we hung out at college was my roommate, her and some other friends and I watching a movie in my room. Everyone fell asleep except the two of us, we had an awesome deep convo yadda yadda, at the end of the night I (although slightly tipsy), confessed to my roommate whom I had only known for a month that this was the girl I would marry some day. And no it wasn't just a 'first girl i met at college' moment because I had random flings before and after that moment.


Once we started dating it was like a fairy tale. or more like a rom com because for the first time in my life I didn't feel pressured to spend time ONLY with my SO as if I was expected to be their only source of happiness and comfort, but we love each other dearly, don't misunderstand me. 


About 4 months ago, she felt comfortable enough with me to open up about how she had been raped in high school. I knew about the incident, but didn't know how to approach it or whether she even wanted to talk about it, but we finally did. She has been through a lot (losing both a father and a sister to cancer at a young age) so she was already seeing a therapist, and I convinced her to communicate with her professional help about the incident. 


She did.


It didn't take long for the walls to come down, making her act and feel like an emotional wreck most days. I figure this was part of the healing process so I did my best to make sure she knew I was understanding and did what I could to lighten the load--helping her with math homework every day, feeding the hedgehog we own together, taking her out for meals away from the cafeteria, etc, etc. 


But eventually, and rightfully, she was diagnosed with PTSD, and not long after, We had a tear filled conversation that ended with her saying she couldn't handle a relationship right now. I was too relieved to see her taking some form of action to be upset about the relationship ending. She said time and time again that it was a break up, not a break, since she didn't want to lead me on into thinking we would get back together. Secretly, as I learned from a friend of hers, she (at that point at least) expected we would both want to wait for each other. 


So I did what I thought was best for her, I kept up with the things we did together as normal, just without the romantic entanglement. I was a little hurt that when she was going through something so intense, she didn't want me there as a boyfriend, but I wasn't about to question it.


Then the worst happened. I am not proud of this, but one night when she fell asleep in my room towards the end of the year, I went through her phone, and found some sexual texts between her and a mutual friend of ours who is a confidant for her. I was broken. I could barely make it to school without feeling like I needed to puke (which I did actually do once, when I first read the texts) so eventually I confronted her about it, and she told me that she wished she could still have occasional sexual encounters with me without the relationship tag because she has quite the libido, which I can vouch for. She explained to me that J was just an outlet for her sexual desires and that they had even had a talk just a day or two earlier where they agreed to stop the interactions, and she promised nothing physical had happened.


Fast forward two months. It is summer, and we live relatively close to one another, but I live closer to the nearest city, which is also where she works as an intern for an event planning company. As an open offer, I let her stay at my house the night before or after an event so she doesn't have to make the 45 minute trip from her own home early in the morning or late at night. 


We have kept in close contact, which is VERY unusual for me, I am a horrible conversationalist when the person is not physically with me, but we care a lot about each other, and we have both admitted it feels like we are still in a relationship. We have been pretty good about not hooking up while we are not together, but we have had sex a handful of times; either when she is staying at my house, or twice when she texted me past midnight asking for me to drive down to her house. (did someone say booty call?)


I am pretty powerless when it comes to giving her what she wants, but she is (usually) the most morally on point person I know so tend not to think to hard about it. 


But then I had to go and do it again. Asleep in the guest bed, I went through her phone, and I find more. Still with J. things like ""You know I'm crazy about you!' and ""I just wanna bone =["" both sent from her. He seems less responsive, which I appreciate since we are pretty good friends, and he even had one text to her saying ""I just don't know if I trust you...""


But that's not all folks! There is another guy, who she met less than a month after we broke up. It worried me a little at the time how much I saw them hanging out around campus, but I dismissed it as me having crazy-ex syndrome. But she texts M with similar tone that she texts J. M lives in New York, but she met up with him for lunch when she and her mom were there visiting family. Those texts weren't as sexual but were emotionally alarming, ""I wish we had a night to spend together"" ""I miss the walks we used to take"" things like that. 


This time I didn't take it nearly as harshly as I did before, because I've come to a place where I think she just craves male attention, and if she had one definitive source I'm positive she would be faithful. I also think these insecurities and need for attention might be somewhat related to the events that led to her having PTSD. 


I still have faith in an eventual continuation of 'us'. I probably sound ridiculous, but I have my reasons. When we have had sex this summer, she still says 'I love you' during. and every now and then when we are on the phone (which is almost every night) she slips up and says 'I love you, goodnight'. And I also know that some of the times that she has stayed over because of her job, she has made up the reason and just wanted to be in what she calls 'princess land' because my parents are more affluent than hers, and because I am at her beck and call. Even for sex-less encounters, I know in my gut that what she really wants, even if she can't see it herself, is to be with me. 


We've talked about our relationship a lot more often since we've been broken up, and she has even told me she ""feels more loved now than when we were dating"". So naturally she is cautious that if we started dating again I might start paying attention to her less or acting differently towards her. In my mind it isn't not being together that has brought us closer, it is the struggles that we have both been through, and the love we share having been tested and strengthened. 


Now, maybe a lot of people on Reddit will relate with this, but I am not a very social person, I would much rather stay in my room playing games or talking with a few close friends than go house hoping or going to house dances. I also am not very communicative about my feelings. At all. But talking as often as we have, especially on the phone, has helped me a lot. 


Now up to the most recent events. My doctor just adjusted my dosages--I take medication for severe anxiety and depression as well as ADD--so I have been lethargic and fatigued the past few days while the changes set in. She decided that maybe The best thing for her to clear her head (especially since she also revealed to me two weeks ago that she was asked on a date by someone and said yes) is for us to not talk for a week or so and gain some ability to reflect. I wasn't able to answer her calls the day she had this idea, because I was in bed feeling ill and resting. I see the missed calls and messages the next day and call her back. 


She is hysterical, saying she was worried about me and a little upset she couldn't get a hold of me. I laughed and reminded her that it had literally been 36 hours since we last spoke. She tells me about the idea she had about not talking, but also says that she is now unsure, because she could barely manage a full day without having me there to console her. She says that sometimes she feels like I don't need her the way she needs me, and that her freak out was a product of feeling as though I genuinely don't care about whether I hear from her or not


I think this is ridiculous, but I know I am awful at expressing myself and know she is going through a lot. I just want to know what to do. I want to know what I can say or do to make her understand without doubt how much I need her. But I am conflicted because I also don't know if it is the right thing to do. 


She is openly dating other people, is emotionally involved with other people, and wants me to be fully invested in her anyway. 


Do I give her what she needs because she is in a fragile state? 


Or do I try to back away a little so as not to 'let her have her cake and eat it too' kind of deal?


I still feel the same way I do as that night I professed my desire to marry her, if not stronger, but I can't help feel used and unsure. 
I know it is a lot to ask to read this novel of a post let alone respond to it, but if even one person has the time to help me I will be grateful, It has already helped me just to see this all written out like this. 

Tl;DR version

* dated for a year and a half

* broke up because she was diagnosed with PTSD after being raped and couldn't emotionally handle a relationship

* she has been pursuing/speaking sexually with two other guys, one of those within a month of the break up

* I think the above is a result of insecurities created by her PTSD rather than her being an adulterous person

* It still very much feels like a relationship, we talk almost every night and sleep together occasionally

* She wanted to take a weeks break from talking to clear our heads

* Unable to get a hold of me (for literally 36 hours between phone calls) she realizes she doesn't think she could handle not being emotionally attached to me

* tells me she doesn't feel like I need her the way she needs me

What do I do, or what can I say to make her understand how I feel if that is the best approach?

again, I apologize for the Epic Tome, thanks to anyone who answers in advance."
1if40l,2,2013-07-16,Stress preventing me from reaching my GW in the expected time...,polistes,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1if40l/stress_preventing_me_from_reaching_my_gw_in_the/,"Since May, I have been counting calories and since June 1st I have also been running and defined my goal in Loseit. My goal was to lose 19 lbs and Loseit set the time I would make it on halfway August, which fit well with the date on which I am going back to my country (I am doing a study project abroad). It is not a final goal though, when I am there I will see how to continue. I have lost 11 lbs in these 6 weeks, so I thought it was going really well and until recently was thinking positively and happy. 

However, I have entered severe stress-mode now that the end of my internship is nearing. I have to write a big report and I really want to finish my Master's degree by the end of August. So, the pressure is really high. At the moment, I feel incredibly stressed, both mentally and physically. I can't stop thinking about my project and all the things I have to do. Also, my body feels awful, I have stomach pains and sometimes can't sleep for hours because my limbs won't rest (like restless legs but mainly in arms). I go to work tired and I come home even more tired. I have tried taking a day off to just go walking through the city, which made me more calm for that day, but the next day everything came back. And I can't take days off all the time. 

Anyway, back to the weight loss! So far I have been able to keep myself from overeating, but old me is really creeping up on me. In the past, whenever I was studying for exams, I would always eat lots of chocolate to cope with the stress. I felt better after consuming lots of chocolate. Now with this stress I keep hearing a little voice in the back of my mind saying 'you can't work like this! You need the magical chocolate!'. :( I think that I might actually have a fear of failure (as I keep thinking of how I should perform really well and that people expect a lot of me and that I should not disappoint my supervisors) and my way to cope with it in the past was eating. 

Also, my running scheme is losing its structure because of the stress. I am having a hard time motivating myself to go for a run, because I keep thinking that I have to be working on my report. When I am running, I am thinking that I should not be running, but be working. Actually, I just can't relax without thinking of my report in the back of my mind. And I think it is influencing my weight loss. In the last 1,5 week, I did not lose anything, although I had my period last week so not sure if it is really the stress. I am also not gaining anything, so that is good, but I really wanted to reach my goal, as I am not sure how well I will be able to lose weight when I'm back (I will be with family for a while so cannot cook for myself). But the most important thing: **I most definitely don't want to go back to eating from stress and undo my progress!!**

So, if you are still reading this, thanks, and my question is, has anybody been in a similar stressfull situation and found a way to cope with that many stress in another way than eating? Could it really be that I have a fear of failure and what can I do to at least limit the effects for this last month (since I feel that it is not really useful to go to a doctor/psychologist here right now as I am leaving so soon). How can I find time to relax without feeling guilty? And how can stress influence weight loss while still being on the same calorie deficit? "
1if2lc,13,2013-07-16,Doing freelance while going to school?,inaft,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1if2lc/doing_freelance_while_going_to_school/,"I've been doing a part-time ""programming"" internship since last November. It's been good, but it's not exactly an ideal job or even internship. The positives are that I can basically make my own schedule (although I can only work 20-30 hours/week, even during the summer), which is good during the school year. They've basically said that they are willing to keep us on as permanent part-time. The pay is decent, better then most part time college jobs ($14.00/hour).

However, there have been a lot of crappy parts of the job as well. We've gotten hardly any training or mentorship. The company scores about a 2 on the Joel Test. I've got an awful computer that makes it hard to do any work. (A Pentium IV running Windows XP, single monitor setup. Even when I worked in tech support for a cheap company I get better hardware.) The extent of the programming involved is a few Perl scripts here and there. The majority of the job is mixed between data entry and letter composition.

When this next semester starts I'm thinking of leaving the internship and focusing mainly on school, in hopes of finishing sooner. I have enough in savings that I could live off of for about two semesters, and I plan on getting a good internship next summer. (One company in particular I think I have a pretty good chance at, since I've been working towards applying there for nearly a year!)

In order to make this work, I would still need to bring in around $200 a month. I was thinking of doing some freelance work, possible on freelancer.com. I've been browsing the jobs posted there for awhile, and there's a lot of them that I know I have the skills to do.

For those of you that have done freelance work, how hard do you think it would be to make about $200 a month? I have experience with web app development (and web design, although I prefer working on the backend), most aspects of web hosting, have a lot of scripting experience in Perl and Python, as well as some C++/Java. I'm thinking that maybe taking a handful of the smaller jobs each month would be the best, rather then the larger developments.

I'm thinking this would really help my portfolio/resume as well - moreso then staying here for another two semesters.

**tl/dr** - Kind of sick of a subpar internship, but still need to make at least $200 a month to supplement my savings in order to live off of for the next two semesters of school. Thinking of doing some freelance work. Wondering if people with experience with freelance think that's a good idea, or have any advice."

I'm am looking for some guidance, and mostly see what you guys are doing in-terms of improving yourself in the job-marketability. 
Here is what I have so far:

* Mechanical Engineering Technology Student at Central Michigan University. (Going into forth year, five year program.)

* Slightly active member of ASME.

* This Summer I am employed as an intern in the Mechanical Department of Instrumentation (Gauge Clusters) at Yazaki North America. 


I feel like what I am doing is pretty common, and not on a bad track. I was wondering what other things I could do to make me a better, more marketable employee when I graduate.

1ierna,0,2013-07-16,Human Error,getmoni,LifeImprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeImprovement/comments/1ierna/human_error/,"Being human means being fallible. This is a given and if you've yet to discover this truth then you really ought to go bang your head on the closest stone capable of being clutched by you. But I'm confident that you are aware of this and so you ought to continue what you started, that is, reading this article. 

It is acceptable for someone to slip up. In fact it is expectable, since we are only exceedingly advanced animals after all. 

Since I am a human a being and so fallible there is no logical contradiction in my announcing that I slipped up this very morning. So did TFL (that's Transport for London). In the everyday manic morning madness one experience in one's rush to leave the house on time I grabbed my younger brother's Oyster card instead of my own and used it for the bus. It's free, you see. Like an adult or student Oyster card it only beeps once. 

Lady Luck must have had plans that I couldn't have pre-perceived until the moment that a sentiment of doom arrived along with the ticket inspectors. The oyster card beeped once like an adult one but the guy persisted to ask me to see the photograph on it. (Just for jokes?) Anyway, being a twenty year old girl with a tiny amount of facial hair for them to have mistaken me for the bearded eighteen year old boy on the oyster card would taken divine intervention and considering our current worldly woes I think the Heavens were preoccupied. So they confiscated my victimised brother's travel pass and told me that I would receive a letter (after retrieving my contact details from my driver's license). But surely this mistake derived from my HUMAN ERROR. And so I refuse to pay twenty pounds or whatever the fine will be to Transport for London whilst children in Syria are feeding off cats this Ramadan. I also refuse to spend my precious time cleaning car parks with juvenile convicts for an innocent and non-fatal mistake. 

Anyway, I got onto the district line from East Putney to go to Paddington (that's nine stops y'all) at 8:30 AM (I was on my way to the second day of the internship I just quit...I value and respect the gift that is my present time) but I didn't reach my destination until 9:30! Why did it take you that long?! I sense you mentally exclaim fearing for your future underground journeys, shock spiralling in all of your cells if you are not a Londoner. Well, a twenty minute journey obnoxiously consumed an hour of every commuter's time because the train ahead's driver had gone missing for EIGHTEEN MINUTES. 

Now, I can forgive TFL and I can forgive the driver too, maybe he had to take a dump and was constipated? Maybe he got food poisoning and was a victim of what I like to describe as vom-shitting?! I don't know. Either way I can affirm that this was another case of HUMAN ERROR. But he has been forgiven so why couldn't TFL have forgiven me for my human error?

I don't and never did plan on writing any letter of complaint and I sincerely hope that no commuter would consider such a time wasting task because if they do they a) have too much time on their hands and b) don't understand that being human means being fallible and that leaves us questioning the potential progress any population could ever make if its citizens behave like this?! 

Nevertheless, I, personally, can't help but pose the question...what has this country come to? When did we transform into this? The world is one family but there is no sense of fraternity to be seen anywhere. If as brothers and sisters of the same species we cannot help one another because of more powerful brothers and sisters I cannot but despair as I face the darkness into which we have evolved. 

We need to make room for accepting acceptable human error before unitedly un-unify our one world. Everybody is only trying to get by. Existing isn't easy for anyone, so why can't we help one another out? "
1ienlx,1,2013-07-16,looking for advice on how to make her feel 'needed' LONG STORY; NEED HELP me [m 20] her [20/f].,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ienlx/looking_for_advice_on_how_to_make_her_feel_needed/,"OK, this is a long and complicated story, I will bullet point important things at the end because A lot of this i just want to write down so I can see it all at once, any opinions or help is greatly appreciated, I don't mind hearing anything critical either.


So we met within the first month of college, and dated for about a year and a half. The very first time we hung out at college was my roommate, her and some other friends and I watching a movie in my room. Everyone fell asleep except the two of us, we had an awesome deep convo yadda yadda, at the end of the night I (although slightly tipsy), confessed to my roommate whom I had only known for a month that this was the girl I would marry some day. And no it wasn't just a 'first girl i met at college' moment because I had random flings before and after that moment.


Once we started dating it was like a fairy tale. or more like a rom com because for the first time in my life I didn't feel pressured to spend time ONLY with my SO as if I was expected to be their only source of happiness and comfort, but we love each other dearly, don't misunderstand me. 


About 4 months ago, she felt comfortable enough with me to open up about how she had been raped in high school. I knew about the incident, but didn't know how to approach it or whether she even wanted to talk about it, but we finally did. She has been through a lot (losing both a father and a sister to cancer at a young age) so she was already seeing a therapist, and I convinced her to communicate with her professional help about the incident. 


She did.


It didn't take long for the walls to come down, making her act and feel like an emotional wreck most days. I figure this was part of the healing process so I did my best to make sure she knew I was understanding and did what I could to lighten the load--helping her with math homework every day, feeding the hedgehog we own together, taking her out for meals away from the cafeteria, etc, etc. 


But eventually, and rightfully, she was diagnosed with PTSD, and not long after, We had a tear filled conversation that ended with her saying she couldn't handle a relationship right now. I was too relieved to see her taking some form of action to be upset about the relationship ending. She said time and time again that it was a break up, not a break, since she didn't want to lead me on into thinking we would get back together. Secretly, as I learned from a friend of hers, she (at that point at least) expected we would both want to wait for each other. 


So I did what I thought was best for her, I kept up with the things we did together as normal, just without the romantic entanglement. I was a little hurt that when she was going through something so intense, she didn't want me there as a boyfriend, but I wasn't about to question it.


Then the worst happened. I am not proud of this, but one night when she fell asleep in my room towards the end of the year, I went through her phone, and found some sexual texts between her and a mutual friend of ours who is a confidant for her. I was broken. I could barely make it to school without feeling like I needed to puke (which I did actually do once, when I first read the texts) so eventually I confronted her about it, and she told me that she wished she could still have occasional sexual encounters with me without the relationship tag because she has quite the libido, which I can vouch for. She explained to me that J was just an outlet for her sexual desires and that they had even had a talk just a day or two earlier where they agreed to stop the interactions, and she promised nothing physical had happened.


Fast forward two months. It is summer, and we live relatively close to one another, but I live closer to the nearest city, which is also where she works as an intern for an event planning company. As an open offer, I let her stay at my house the night before or after an event so she doesn't have to make the 45 minute trip from her own home early in the morning or late at night. 


We have kept in close contact, which is VERY unusual for me, I am a horrible conversationalist when the person is not physically with me, but we care a lot about each other, and we have both admitted it feels like we are still in a relationship. We have been pretty good about not hooking up while we are not together, but we have had sex a handful of times; either when she is staying at my house, or twice when she texted me past midnight asking for me to drive down to her house. (did someone say booty call?)


I am pretty powerless when it comes to giving her what she wants, but she is (usually) the most morally on point person I know so tend not to think to hard about it. 


But then I had to go and do it again. Asleep in the guest bed, I went through her phone, and I find more. Still with J. things like ""You know I'm crazy about you!' and ""I just wanna bone =["" both sent from her. He seems less responsive, which I appreciate since we are pretty good friends, and he even had one text to her saying ""I just don't know if I trust you...""


But that's not all folks! There is another guy, who she met less than a month after we broke up. It worried me a little at the time how much I saw them hanging out around campus, but I dismissed it as me having crazy-ex syndrome. But she texts M with similar tone that she texts J. M lives in New York, but she met up with him for lunch when she and her mom were there visiting family. Those texts weren't as sexual but were emotionally alarming, ""I wish we had a night to spend together"" ""I miss the walks we used to take"" things like that. 


This time I didn't take it nearly as harshly as I did before, because I've come to a place where I think she just craves male attention, and if she had one definitive source I'm positive she would be faithful. I also think these insecurities and need for attention might be somewhat related to the events that led to her having PTSD. 


I still have faith in an eventual continuation of 'us'. I probably sound ridiculous, but I have my reasons. When we have had sex this summer, she still says 'I love you' during. and every now and then when we are on the phone (which is almost every night) she slips up and says 'I love you, goodnight'. And I also know that some of the times that she has stayed over because of her job, she has made up the reason and just wanted to be in what she calls 'princess land' because my parents are more affluent than hers, and because I am at her beck and call. Even for sex-less encounters, I know in my gut that what she really wants, even if she can't see it herself, is to be with me. 


We've talked about our relationship a lot more often since we've been broken up, and she has even told me she ""feels more loved now than when we were dating"". So naturally she is cautious that if we started dating again I might start paying attention to her less or acting differently towards her. In my mind it isn't not being together that has brought us closer, it is the struggles that we have both been through, and the love we share having been tested and strengthened. 


Now, maybe a lot of people on Reddit will relate with this, but I am not a very social person, I would much rather stay in my room playing games or talking with a few close friends than go house hoping or going to house dances. I also am not very communicative about my feelings. At all. But talking as often as we have, especially on the phone, has helped me a lot. 


Now up to the most recent events. My doctor just adjusted my dosages--I take medication for severe anxiety and depression as well as ADD--so I have been lethargic and fatigued the past few days while the changes set in. She decided that maybe The best thing for her to clear her head (especially since she also revealed to me two weeks ago that she was asked on a date by someone and said yes) is for us to not talk for a week or so and gain some ability to reflect. I wasn't able to answer her calls the day she had this idea, because I was in bed feeling ill and resting. I see the missed calls and messages the next day and call her back. 


She is hysterical, saying she was worried about me and a little upset she couldn't get a hold of me. I laughed and reminded her that it had literally been 36 hours since we last spoke. She tells me about the idea she had about not talking, but also says that she is now unsure, because she could barely manage a full day without having me there to console her. She says that sometimes she feels like I don't need her the way she needs me, and that her freak out was a product of feeling as though I genuinely don't care about whether I hear from her or not


I think this is ridiculous, but I know I am awful at expressing myself and know she is going through a lot. I just want to know what to do. I want to know what I can say or do to make her understand without doubt how much I need her. But I am conflicted because I also don't know if it is the right thing to do. 


She is openly dating other people, is emotionally involved with other people, and wants me to be fully invested in her anyway. 


Do I give her what she needs because she is in a fragile state? 


Or do I try to back away a little so as not to 'let her have her cake and eat it too' kind of deal?


I still feel the same way I do as that night I professed my desire to marry her, if not stronger, but I can't help feel used and unsure. 
I know it is a lot to ask to read this novel of a post let alone respond to it, but if even one person has the time to help me I will be grateful, It has already helped me just to see this all written out like this. 

Tl;DR version

* dated for a year and a half

* broke up because she was diagnosed with PTSD after being raped and couldn't emotionally handle a relationship

* she has been pursuing/speaking sexually with two other guys, one of those within a month of the break up

* I think the above is a result of insecurities created by her PTSD rather than her being an adulterous person

* It still very much feels like a relationship, we talk almost every night and sleep together occasionally

* She wanted to take a weeks break from talking to clear our heads

* Unable to get a hold of me (for literally 36 hours between phone calls) she realizes she doesn't think she could handle not being emotionally attached to me

* tells me she doesn't feel like I need her the way she needs me

What do I do, or what can I say to make her understand how I feel if that is the best approach?

again, I apologize for the Epic Tome, thanks to anyone who answers in advance."

At the moment I'm doing a university degree, an online diploma and I also want to start improving my drawing skills, look for a part time job and get an internship. I know I need to make myself a study schedule but my biggest problem is that I don't think my life really adheres to something strict. I don't always go to class, my daily routine changes a lot and I'm not at all organised anyway (heh) which I feel like would make a rigid time-based schedule pointless.

What's the best thing to do here? Should I try and make it more flexible, or try and force myself into a strict routine? Does anyone have some advice for me?"
1idy4i,23,2013-07-15,"Vancouver ""Work Experience"" Program for High School Students. High School version of unpaid interns?",VanWorkExp,vancouver,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/1idy4i/vancouver_work_experience_program_for_high_school/,"I am a secondary student that will be going into grade 12 next year. In grade 11, I joined a program called ""Career Prep"", designed for students in grade 11 and 12 to get work experience. Any students participating in this program is unpaid. I joined this program thinking I could learn something; web design/programming is something that is a clear #1 career choice for me right now. I recently went on my first job today and I found that what I got was absolutely not what I expected. A little background info on my skill level: in my grade 11 year I was in a program designed for 1st year university students, provided online by Stanford, think of it as online AP Computer Science. I have made many templates website that I think are on par or better than the average website produced what you receive a product at a web agency. I firmly believe I have to skillsets to intern at a web design firm in Vancouver. I wanted to learn how these firms manage their clients/organize and split up work between teams, something I could not possibly learn without going into a real life situation. Instead, what I was assigned was a place that fixes PCs and refurbishes them and what not. I spent all day, from 9 to 6, wiping monitors and installing windows updates. Not only is this disappointing, it also feels like a slap in the face and I felt I was being exploited. I was putting in 9 hours a day and I was getting nothing out of it. I could spend that time volunteering at someplace meaningful or work at McDonalds and make $10 an hour, but instead, I was stuck there installing windows updates. If I learned something, like I expected to, I would not even have thought about making this post.

Not only that, the business practices of this shop was quite shady. They exploit people who are clueless about technology and WAY overcharge for what they are providing. Some examples would be charging $100+ for wiping a hard drive or ""virus removal"". The yelp/google + reviews of this place was also horrible, further proving their poor practices.

To further pour salt on the wound, the working conditions were HORRID. I am certain there are at least multiple fire safety hazards existing in that place. Cables were lying everywhere, mouse traps were set up, probably because they eat their McDoubles in that place and the food drips everywhere, stuff was stacked everywhere, there was no room for 2 people to walk side by side in the back of the shop (where I was the whole day), and most importantly, the only fire extinguisher I saw EXPIRED in 2012!!!!! This is a freaking place with outlet bars everywhere and the guy even warned me chips would spark sometimes if they are plugged in incorrectly!!

I'm not sure how other participants in this program feel or what their experience was. Maybe their career choice provided them with more opportunities, for example if they wanted to get into hospitality or whatever it's probably easier to find a hotel/waiter job for them than a software development/web design job for me, as it does require some specific skill that not everyone will have. Another thing is that I observed that most of the other participants were of asian decent, ESL groups that don't speak english if they don't have to, the type that could be forced by their parents to participate in the program or be told to ""man up"" if they complain. That is purely speculation but I feel it could play a factor in allowing these business to exploit the program.

I think the program's intention is great, obviously, since I voluntarily joined in. Having work experience is valuable to any highschool student(it is also a grad requirement), but I joined the program to get something out of it. After today, I can firmly say that I did not. I asked about what my work will be like for the rest of the week and it is no different than my work today. I don't know how this is allowed if unpaid internships, something I will gladly do if I truly do benefit from learning from people already in the industry, are not legal. I don't know if I am whining or spoiled or what. Maybe I should ""man up"" too. I don't plan on going back tomorrow and I will phone them to let them know. Please let me know if I should act differently.

Very sorry for ranting, thank you if you took your time to read the entire post."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How do you recommend students approach you for letters of recommendations and things like that?  How do you deal with students who seem superficial in making professor-student relationships?  And lastly, how do you recommend students make prof-student relationships?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3gmb5?context=5)|Great question, I was waiting for someone to ask this!!!
 |Here's the important thing -- for me to write you a recommendation, then I need to know you outside of class.  Come to office hours, engage over email, work on a project w/ me.
 |If I only know you from the classroom, all I can really write is Jane/John Doe attended my class and got an A.  The transcript provides the exact same information, so writing a recommendation is redundant.
[As a followup, how do you expect students to express interest in starting or working in a project with you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3htz6?context=5)|Another good question.  Simply come to office hours, or email me.  Tell me what interests you, ask what I'm working-on, and see if there are any projects with which you can get involved.  This is also a great way to get your foot in the door for internships, etc.
[I'm pretty shy, and hesitated to speak up even in my high school classes. Do you think this will be detrimental in college classes? If so, are there ways around that cycle of not wanting to ask a dumb question/not understanding something? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3apqk?context=5)|Ask the professor to explain something in more detail.
 |Try to make a connection between the current topic and something you've previously covered in class.
 |Try to relate the discussion to a real-world example.
[Is attendance a big deal? Do you have to penalize absenteeism? I mean, if a student missed class, its their responsibility to catch up and if they do...I think they did a good job. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3gc33?context=5)|I think attendance is a two way street.  If an instructor requires it, then he/she should provide experiences in the classroom that cannot be replicated elsewhere.
[Have you even been offered sex to change grades- or do something of the sort.  Have you ever been offered sex from a colleague or a student not in your class?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3a1yt?context=5)|Yes.  No.
[Did you agree? Or do you know anyone who has changed grades for sex, money or anything? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3a8fn?context=5)|I have been offered sex by a student directly after returning midterm exams.  
[Did you report them? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3aeye?context=5)|No I didn't.  It was a surreal experience.  The student came to my office, dressed very sexily, closed the door, and started suggesting things we could do.  It was sorta like a scene from a bad movie...
 |EDIT: meant to write ""student"", not ""students""!
[*The students.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3anx9?context=5)|Haha, I just caught that.  It was one student.  He started undressing in my office.  I stopped that in a hurry!
[It was more than 1? How do you turn that down? Does your college have material about this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3anx9?context=5)|Yes, I'm sure my school has policies, but I don't know them.  My policy -- don't have sex with students!
[*He started undressing in my office.*  Ahhh that is hilarious! Did not see *him* coming! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3bd8e?context=5)|)
[Are you a male or female?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3b3g3?context=5)|Male.
[Have you ever had to deal with anyone plagiarizing? What happened? If not do you know any other plagiarizing stories at your school?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3et7o?context=5)|Luckily no.  I mostly teach innovation, so the course work would be very difficult to plagiarize.  That said, I have zero sympathy for academic dishonesty -- anyone caught cheating on an exam or other assignment gets an automatic zero, and possible referral to disciplinary action.  If you want the grade, you do the work.
[What's your opinion about most of the classes that students need to take to graduate?  What is the best way for a student to Get on your good side and be a favorite?  Have you ever given a student a grade that earned but not necessarly earned on paper?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3a3od?context=5)|In many programs, years 1 and 2 are mostly ""filler.""  Almost every major needs to take a stats class.  Why?  Most successful working professionals I know don't remember a thing about stats class and couldn't define mean, median or mode.
[What made you want to become a professor?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3a58t?context=5)|Great teachers gave me a great education, and I wanted to try to continue the cycle.  My students give me very high marks on course feedback, and alums say they learned important skills/information, so I keep at it.
[Back in the day a college education was affordable and there was little federal available for grants and student loans. Now students can get all the money they need  from the feds to pay their tuition and the price is sky high. Is there a connection between high college tuition costs and the availability of federal handouts to pay that bill? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3bddb?context=5)|Yes!  I think it's immoral.  Stafford loans are easy to get, and schools jack-up tuition.  No one really needs a climbing wall in the student rec center or fancy dorms.  But now students graduate with loads of debt, and they don't really understand how much that will limit their choices later.
[I just finished my first year at berkeley, and i've taken some classes where by the middle of the semester, 3/4th of the class does not attend and just show up for midterms/finals. i feel pretty bad for the professor, who has to continue to lecture as if nothing happens. has this ever happened to you? how do professors feel about it, and how do they deal with it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3dgqt?context=5)|I require students to attend class, and at the same time require from myself that we actually do interesting things with that time!
[I am really apprehensive about asking my professors for letters of recommendation for grad school, even though I know that they get asked by many students. Does it annoy you when students ask you for LORs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3i3n2?context=5)|Don't feel apprehensive, it's part of our job.  But first, you must make sure the professor knows you -- see my previous answer about establishing contact outside the classroom...
[Thanks for replying. I've taken 2 classes with the professor I'm going to ask and have done research with her. I met with her every week for 2 hrs with just her and I in her office. That was last fall. Hope she remembers me :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3ibtf?context=5)|She sounds highly qualified to give you a great rec -- and believe me, the people reading that letter will appreciate it -- good luck!
[Do you care about teaching or research more?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3a42q?context=5)|I really enjoy teaching and think it's meaningful work, so that's where I focus.
[Hello thanks for doing an AMA! couple of questions here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb39zmp?context=5)|I mainly teach innovation related classes to CS majors and engineers, and also get many business students.  
[What type of courses do you teach.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb39zmp?context=5)|At my school, the professor has wide latitude in assigning grades...no one would be referred to a Dean for a grade change.
[To get the grade changed why is it always the professor says ""you have to go speak to the dean"", and the dean says ""I cant do anything about it, you have to go speak to the professor"". 3.how can  you convince a professor to change your grade from a C- to a C?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb39zmp?context=5)|You should compare your work to the requirements stated on the syllabus.  Make your case that you met the standard for a C or whatever grade your work merits.  Be polite and persistent. 
[As a computer science student, I am interested in which courses/major I should narrow my degree down to. I'm taking IT and CSC courses, and would like to get into programming. I was hoping to program with a masters degree, but my backup career is networking. What courses should I take to maximize my potential in both areas? Is my current IT-COM double major the right choice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3atc0?context=5)|First you need to choose what skills are most important to you -- Ruby, Python, whatever.
 |Second, and even more importantly, find a few classes to help you translate your technical skills into something commercially useful.  Specifically, how can you help create a revenue generating product?
 |Does your school offer courses in product management, product marketing, etc.?
[I'm currently going to a community college with relatively few options. In the spring, I am transferring to a state U which will most likely offer such courses. If I was wanting to be more technically oriented, would you still recommend taking these seemingly business oriented classes? Also, unrelated, but should I consider independently getting CISCO certified?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3b11p?context=5)|Generally you should use CC to fill as many requirements as you can, and then spend your time at the larger school taking more specialized courses.
 |I don't know the answer about certification -- that's more applied than what most of my students typically do.
[What do you think about the student debt interest rate doubling? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3bjfi?context=5)|Transfer less expensive credits from CC.
 |Work and save in HS and during college.
 |Go after every scholarship/grant possible.
 |Don't buy every iDevice.
 |The last point is especially important.  So many students have expensive iDevices.  You really don't need a MacBook Pro, iPhone, and/or iPad.  And don't go into debt to buy these things!
[This is exactly what I did and suggest to younger people all the time.   GO TO CC - You can really figure out what you want to do or if you already know that save a ton of money on the same units as UNI.  WORK - Don't expect mommy and daddy to handle evertyhing   Apply - Its paperwork and a process but get off your ass.   IPad - IS USELESS AT SCHOOL. If you want to be like everyone else, you may need a macbook. haha.  Back to interest rates - Do you think it is fair to pass on debt from the country onto its college students? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3bvd7?context=5)|Does anyone think it's fair that banks can borrow at 0.5%, while students pay 6.8%?
[Do you think a lot of students are majoring in subjects that will be of virtually no help to them in the job market because they buy into that college B.S. about studying whatever you love?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb39w82?context=5)|This is a major problem.  Students really need to investigate and understand how their field of study will advance their career.  The days are long gone when you can follow your passion into a non remunerative field.  Unless you have a large trust fund.
 |EDIT: grammar.
[In your opinion, are there any practical Bachelor's degrees that aren't related to Engineering or Business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3a6ni?context=5)|Nursing seems to be in high demand.  STEM fields generally are pretty desirable.  Unfortunately, if you want to major in Drama or Comp Lit, it's pretty slim pickings.

[I've heard that while nursing is in demand, it's only for crappy positions at old folks homes and the like, and only a very small percentage get to work in hospitals. Truth to that?  Source: Lots of med school people.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3bjp0?context=5)|I think it depends on geography.  I have friends in nursing who work 12 days a month and make $150K-$200K per year.  You need to pay your dues the first few years, and position yourself for a specialty.

There are many very high quality state schools, so certainly consider them.

[I'd definitely be interested in knowing more. I know that the computer science department at my school deliberately sets the average GPA of most lower division classes to ~2.7. Also, wouldn't a B be ""off the charts""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3kzmp?context=5)|I know more than a handful of CS folks who advocate not wasting your time in school.

Don't kiss-ass, but if you're really interested in the material you'll find that many/most professors will be very generous with their time and want to work with you.
[Do you think the students at your school are just paying for the name on the diploma or do you think they genuinely have a better grasp on what they're studying than grads of less reputable schools? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3ae95?context=5)|Good question.  Most incoming students are already highly accomplished -- admissions are very competitive.  I know a few who decide to drop-out and just start working -- they seem to do fine -- though their parents aren't so comfortable. 
[What courses do you teach? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3aa9k?context=5)|Answered above -- mostly innovation related classes.

The degree costs a great deal, and in most professions you won't see a great benefit w/ having the credential.
[I go to College in Ontario ( the equivalent to a community college in the US\) and I am on a first name basic with almost all my professors.

It helps me tailor the class to their interests/needs.
 |I grade assignments objectively -- don't even look at the names until recording grades.
 |As for active participants, yes that does help increase a student's grade if they're trying to say something constructive, and not just get brownie points.
[How do you feel about tenure? I want professors to have job security of course, but I feel like it can be abused. I've had a rather lazy professor (often cancelled class without warning and wasted our time showing us cat pictures on the internet\) who, when passing out surveys for us to rate the class and professor, sort of implied that it didn't matter what we said because he had tenure. Also, I don't completely understand how tenure works, I know the professor is not completely protected from discipline. What are the pros and cons?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3bbkc?context=5)|Personally I do not believe in tenure.  The ""pro"" arguments typically focus on academic freedom.  That's important, though I rarely see a sincere academic penalized for pursuing rigorous, thoughtful work -- popular or not.
 |On the ""con"" side, yes I agree it can produce laziness and lack of accountability.
 |Look at it from the perspective of most faculty.  They take perhaps 7 years to get their PhD, another 7 to gain tenure.  By that point they're tired, and think they've ""earned"" the right to relax for a while.
 |I strongly believe that tenure, as we know it today, should be abolished.
[Do you have any past students that still stand out in your memory?  How many students do you still keep in contact with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3bivq?context=5)|Yes, I certainly remember past students, and keep in contact with several dozen (maybe 100?).

I don't do traditional PI work -- much more applied.
[Is graduate school worth the extra stretch? Its such a catch 22 in that 5 years from now, having a graduate degree will be as good as having a high school diploma and its almost impossible to get a decent job with one the way the job market is. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3jg3w?context=5)|It very much depends upon your field and the quality of the school -- do you have something specific in mind?
[Marketing Mgmt MBA ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3qz7m?context=5)|Who pays for the degree.
 |If you need to pay yourself, then you will likely only see a meaningful return on your investment if you attend a top 10 school.  Kellogg is probably the best for Marketing, though every top 10 MBA program is great.
 |If your employer will pay, or reimburse you a lot, then attend an evening program.  This is a great way to go -- if you employer is that generous.
[Can you help me to put down one of the long time rumor/myth? Is it true that professors get some sort of disbrusment/compensation (other than loyalites\) from the campus bookstore for sales of the textbook they required? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3a9v0?context=5)|To my knowledge no, this does not happen.  Royalties on textbooks are quite small as a %, which contributes to the high retail price.  I don't like the ethics of this practice, especially when it's required reading and the book edition gets changed every few years.
 |EDIT: grammar.
[I am currently doing a postdoc and I am thinking of going further in academia. My wife and I are considering children, though. In my experience, a lot of professors seem very rushed off their feet and spend a great deal of time in the office.

 |But what are your alternatives?  You'll probably need to work long hours regardless, especially as you establish yourself in your industry.
 |People certainly do work in academia and have families.  A lot depends upon your family's individual circumstances.
 |But, as you already know, a life of the mind requires great time and commitment.
[Is it true that strong LORs can compensate for weaker parts of your graduate admission requirements?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3inm9?context=5)|Yes.  Graduate school admissions are more about understanding your potential and achievements (UG is more about GPA, SAT, and e/c).  You need to craft an honest narrative about yourself that will appeal to the admissions committee.  I've seen students with a sub-par GPA, but great test scores, get good LORs that help explain the academic performance, and endorse a student's potential.  Think about what you offer a program, and how you will persuade them to accept you.
[I screwed up considerably on my first year in uni. Currently, a third year student my grades have improved about 20% since 1st year, but my GPA is still in the low 70s %. Do grad school programs look at improvement, or strictly at the cumulative GPA. Additionally, does admission look more deeply at individual courses to find their class averages (in case the courses is easy\), and the reputation of the institution?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3myp7?context=5)|Knock the ball out of the park in your final semesters.

Many/most have paid internships, and more than a few start at 6 figures, right out of school.
[Do you have any methods that you tried to get students to be more motivated/active in class that either worked well /backfired completely? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3qg0i?context=5)|I love the topics I teach, so bring a lot of passion to the class.  Students know when the professor cares or is apathetic, so most respond positively to my energy and attempts at creativity in the classroom.
[I'm coming down to my last semester and I haven' t really built a rapport with any of my professors due to the fact I manage to get good grades and therefore have never needed extra help/discussion and that I have never really had time anyway to visit a professor during office hours.  I fear if I would ever need a letter of reccommendation or something of the sorts I would have no one to ask.

[How long are your hours during the semester / terms week?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3p821?context=5)|Varies greatly.  If I'm teaching a new class, I need to prep about 10 hours for each hour in the classroom.  Ongoing classes, prep is maybe 30 minutes per class.
 |Overall, I'd guess an average of about 20hrs/wk/class, which also includes high-level grading, answering student questions via email, office hours, coordinating TA's, and general admin work.

That's what you really need to research.  I suspect it's difficult to find employment with only an undergrad degree in either field.  Please, talk to your placement office, alums, and practicing professionals.  
[Sorry yeah.. I was ranting. But school (engineering\) was tough mainly because these two points.

I hope that happens in your case too!  I don't work in the FA office, so can't provide much insight into your question.

To say that interbank transactions are less risky than students loans is plainly false.  Simply look at history.
 |The Fed, and TARP needed to bailout the system.  To this day, banks borrow from the Fed at artificially low rates, so they can slowly rebuild their balance sheets.  Yet students are forced to pay 6.8% on Stafford loans.

I just finished up my 3rd year as a computer science student. I currently work in advertising doing some email development and website development with HTML, CSS and javascript. The job started out kind of interesting as I was doing some python and some work with MySQL, but now web development is all i seem to be doing. The pay is decent, $15 an hour, and mainly took it because it was my first industry-related job that i had a chance at last year which was worlds better than my service job I had had previously.
I had a different job lined up that was going to be mobile development, which seemed a little more interesting, that I was thinking about doing this summer, but I ended up not doing it because the pay wasn't a huge improvement and as apposed to this job I wouldn't have had benefits like medical after I had completely converted to full time. Now I'm wondering if i actually ended up screwing myself over. I'm still not completely sure what I want to do, but I'm not sure I want to develop email campaigns for the rest of my life. I almost feel like i'm wasting my degree here.
But will I have almost typecasted myself into web development by doing this internship as my only professional experience? How far will my own personal projects take me when I apply for a different job? Should I bother trying to find a different job before I graduate?"
1idnxh,3,2013-07-15,Should I [26M] keep hoping for my girlfriend [22F] to become the person *we* want her to be?,DontTryIron,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1idnxh/should_i_26m_keep_hoping_for_my_girlfriend_22f_to/,"I feel like the wrong word choice could distort this delicate topic that's been on my mind, so there could be some edits and updates down the line to clarify things if it comes to that.  That said, some details first...

I am a /very/ tall, thin guy.  I come from a very small, mid/upper-class family in the Midwest.  Parents were frugal, but not cheap.  Pretty normal life.  Moved to go to college at the capital.  With both luck and hard work, I was constantly working good internships throughout college.  Also took loan from parents (now all paid back).  Graduated college in '09, had job lined up at tech company, and moved to Southern California.  I've been successful and independent since then.  $80,000+ per year, nice 1-bedroom apartment, '09 car, growing 401k, etc..  No drugs.

She is a /very/ short, middle-weight girl.  She was raised by a single mother, but within close contact of a large extended family in Southern California.  Single child, and was very spoiled growing up (her own admission).  Tried moving away for college but it didn't work out the first time.  Returned to live at home with her mother, completed some community college, and is going to a more local state college this fall.  Has a very meager, work-from-home, flexible online data entry job, but doesn't bring in enough for her to be independent.  Diagnosed ADD in middle school.  Weed very occasionally.  Has a very poor relationship with her mother (they yell even when I'm around).  This could probably be a much longer section, but I think that summary paints a good enough picture.  

I met her on OKCupid after 2 years of zero success (she initiated).  We have been dating for a little over one year.  This is both my first short-term and long-term relationship (had 3-ish hookups in college that didn't amount to anything).  She has had a few short-term shitty boyfriends, mostly in highschool, but also one that was a large impact on her first failed college experience.

I love her.  She loves me very much.  Probably the biggest thing we share is our geekiness.  Things generally go well when we're hanging out together, and we even just took a vacation back to the midwest that I thought went very well.  Our sex life isn't super active (though she seems much hornier than I am), but I don't think it's bad enough to make it a primary issue.  We haven't had many big arguments.

Our relationship doesn't seem perfect to me though.  This is where I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out exactly what feels wrong.  There's a phrase I've used before that's stuck in my head:  I love her like a sister, not like a girlfriend.  I feel like I spend a lot of energy being a positive role-model in her life, both intentionally and unintentionally.  The relationship feels very imbalanced.  We openly talk about her life a lot, and how it has a lot of issues.  Both she and I want her to be a better person, but I think that's been very taxing on both of us.

For example, her weight is an issue.  She has made constant resolutions to lose weight to varying degrees, but has been for the most part totally unsuccessful.  I have tried almost every strategy, all the way from working out with her constantly and closely monitoring food intake (I lost 20 pounds myself doing this, she lost 0), to being completely hands off.  It feels like it boils down to either, ""you want me to lose weight...do you think I'm fat?"" or ""I'm trying to lose weight...can't you be more supportive?""  That's one of the roughest ones.  But I also spend a lot of energy trying to help her be more productive in internship/job seeking, having better friendships, being a cleanlier person, balancing free time with play and personal development, becoming more independent, improving her relationship with her mother, spending money smarter, etc.

I don't mean for that laundry list to sound like such a bomb-shell, but I find myself thinking about her and those things when I have time to mull things over (like when I'm driving a car or going to bed or whatnot).  Another thing it boils down to, I feel, is that I am a very mature, forward-thinking person.  She is very immature and has trouble making decisions or planning ahead.  This further separates us and it feels like work filling that gap sometimes.  I've had a few of those moments where I've really felt like separating, but when reasoning it out it seemed better not to.  **I think I can objectively say I'm not holding onto the relationship for fear of being single -- I'm a quiet, independent person that does very well on my own.

I've been fairly open about these feelings before, but I don't think I've ever worded it quite as dismal as it may sound in this post.  Still, it's safe to say she knows these feelings to a decent degree, and despite that, we do still have a lot of fun together.  I enjoy the time when we do fun activities or even when just hanging out.  But while the short term is good, I feel like the long term doesn't look good with the way things have been going (i.e., this is not somebody I want to marry *right now*).  Is it ethical to keep this relationship going?  Is it unfair to wait for somebody to change?  Is there change I should undergo that I'm missing?  I hope I can at least get a little dialog here that could help me think about this in a new light.

**tl;dr**:  We're very different people and I think we both want her to change.  Can something like this work?"

I had a different job lined up that was going to be mobile development, which seemed a little more interesting, that I was thinking about doing this summer, but I ended up not doing it because the pay wasn't a huge improvement and as apposed to this job I wouldn't have had benefits like medical after I had completely converted to full time. Now I'm wondering if i actually ended up screwing myself over. I'm still not completely sure what I want to do, but I'm not sure I want to develop email campaigns for the rest of my life. I almost feel like i'm wasting my degree here. 

But will I have almost typecasted myself into web development by doing this internship as my only professional experience? How far will my own personal projects take me when I apply for a different job? Should I bother trying to find a different job before I graduate?"

A few months ago he got a good job abroad and I went with him, getting an unpaid internship which I'm about half way through.

While we were still in University we developed an interest in BDSM and group sex. We had a small circle of friends back in the UK, that I felt quite comfortable doing things with. 

He's a very thoughtful and intelligent guy, and I've always felt comfortable being in a submissive role. I enjoy a certain amount of humiliation and rough play but in the last few months things have ramped up massively.

His job is incredibly stressful with long hours, as the stress increased so did his sex drive. He also found a group of people locally that are into BDSM and swinging. While they're nice enough people they're new to me and at his encouragement things are far more extreme than they were back in the UK.

His sex drive is massively erratic, and if I say no to anything he goes mental. taking it as a massive insult, if I don't respond during sex he goes nuts as well.Any refusal on my part leads to him threatening to break up with me which I don't want.

A few weeks back we had a massive row after a swingers party. I spent the night with a guy that works with my bf. He was a nice guy and I told him about what was happening and he said he'd have a word with him..

What happened was another massive argument. All the things I asked him not to do, he now insists on doing every night. A girl he works with that comes to the sex parties, he's spending more and more time with. We've never been monogamous but up until recently we always had an input into each others partners... now he seems to want to choose his and mine.

She's not in a relationship and seems willing to indulge him in whatever he wants. While we got on initially, he seems to want us to pursue a sexual relationship I'm really not interested in. I never minded having threesomes with her, but she seems to spend all of her time in the apartment now even when he's not here.

I love my boyfriend, the man I love is still there, I just think he's in a bad enviroment... I want the relationship to continue. but it's the sex that's killing it

My boyfriend and I live together, both have full time jobs, and are also supporting his younger brother while he has an unpaid internship. Overall, we are doing pretty well for ourselves.


However, his father has been out of a job for the past two years, and his mother has been out of a job since Christmas. They have been looking desperately for something, to no avail, and now their unemployment is running out. His younger sister also can't find a job (though I can't speak for how thoroughly she is searching.)

We are considering trying to rent a house for them to stay with us for a year until they get a job. There are obviously SO many things wrong with this option, not to mention that there are literally no houses in the area that my boyfriend and I can afford. 


His parents and sister are currently living in an RV park, but even that is now too expensive. I offered us downgrading to a cheaper apartment and using the resulting extra money to help them out, but even that is only enough to pay basic rent (not even including food, gas for getting to interviews- there is NO public transit where they live). 


My mother thinks my boyfriend and I shouldn't be having to deal with this, but both sides of his extended family are psychopaths, so the only option here is us, and maybe welfare, though the welfare may not be approved in time for it to even matter. (oh, they also can't make money via blood donations, because they lived in a country with potentially unfiltered water for several years.)


I don't know what to do, the stress and anxiety this is causing has even caused me to miss a couple days of work. I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, I honestly don't know what to do.

**Edit/Update:**

I'd like to thank everyone for their advice, all of the different perspectives have helped me think about this with a clearer mind. 


I know a lot of people have just told me to drop it and walk away, unfortunately I can't do that. I know I only said he was my boyfriend, but I suppose I should have pointed out that we have been together for a very long time, and are practically married (we just haven't had time for ceremony and such, and are not big on marriage anyway.) I suppose my wording made it sound like we weren't as close as that? That walking away from him and his family was an option at all? If I had said that he was my fiance, or my husband, would that have changed anyone's advice?


I'm going to email his mom directly, as when talking to my boyfriend, the only apparent option, to him, is to have them move in with us. We can't afford that, and I (and I know his mother agrees with me) don't think it will actually help them in the way he thinks it will. I'm going to ask them what kind of help they have searched for (welfare, stamps, etc.) and encourage them to take those routes while we can help them with any extra emergencies (car breaks down, need emergency gas for an interview, etc.) I'm also going to ask her to try and push her daughter harder in terms of getting a job, and will even offer to help find job postings close to where they live (I understand where her daughter is: just graduated high school. In the generation that has almost no clue how to do anything for themselves because her parents or older siblings did everything for her.) Hopefully, between his mother and I, we can convince him to look to alternate solutions that won't completely bankrupt us. "

It's quiet, tucked away in a little corner of my building. Barely anyone walks back here unless they're looking for me. I work independently a lot of the time, and it helps to have my own space with a door that closes. 

That said, sometimes I sit on my office chair in funny ways. It's boring (and bad for you) to sit on your ass all day, so I'll sit cross-legged, or spin the computer chair around and sit on my knees with the chair backwards. Nobody sees. Nobody cares. Whatever. 

So I'm sitting like this (chair backward, knees on seat, leaning slightly over desk to see the screen), when the male intern walks in and says, ""Well, that's a controversial position.""

Fuck. You.

He's a bit of a word vomiter, but seriously? Don't walk into my space and make that kind of comment, kid. Would he have said the same to a man leaning over a desk, with the same implications? I doubt it. 

Sorry for the rant, you gals. But I wonder if it's in a rule book somewhere that, by virtue of my having an ass to look at, I can only sit with it firmly planted out of view. It's not like I put the damn thing out on display, but I'm a human and I need to stretch sometimes."

1ii32g,9,2013-07-17,Veteran Preference in public sector hiring ultimately reduces the effectiveness of those agencies. CMV,[deleted],changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ii32g/veteran_preference_in_public_sector_hiring/,"I apologize for the long rambling post, I'm taking a break from editing my thesis (unrelated to this CMV).

Firstly I am only referring to the US. 

For the purpose of this discussion I will be referring mainly to Veteran Preference points in Federal Hiring (http://www.fedshirevets.gov/job/vetpref/), but will also touch upon local Law Enforcement.

I understand the need to reward returning veterans for their service by easing the transition back into civilian life.  Personally, I just find the current level of benefits unsustainable considering the sheer number of returning veterans.  Providing veterans with both educational benefits as well as hiring preference results in a situation whereby only veterans are being considered for public sector jobs and non-veterans are squeezed out.


How then can this be considered detrimental?

By not considering all applicants and limiting themselves to veterans, these organizations become more homogeneous as each member shares similar viewpoints and cognitive biases.  The drive to conform is also stronger in such environments.

For example, while explicit chain-of-command, ""don't question lawful orders"", is necessary in a military environment, that style of management can be disastrous in a civilian environment.  I recognize that I'm generalizing a bit here, but when considering the already relatively homogeneous environment mentioned above there is reduced bi-directional communication between stages of management to adapt novel ideas into functional strategy.  Organizational mistakes become exceedingly difficult to reconcile.

These public sector jobs inevitably influence their private sector counterparts as those firms headhunt managers who have succeeded in the public sector.  In an effort to reproduce their public sector success, these managers then influence HR to target returning veterans.

As it becomes more evident that only veterans can land these jobs (and avoid the student debt), a positive feedback loop is established as more people enlist go gain that employment advantage.

Even if veteran's preference was abolished five years from now, or if there was a significantly lowered number of returning veterans, it can be argued that future managers (who were veterans themselves) will continue to target candidates with military experience in an effort to preserve their organizational culture. 


Every other day, the front page of reddit has an article highlighting the recent militarization of local police or the war on drugs.  I feel that this is the result of multiple layers of organizations(Think-tanks, consultancy firms, DHS, DEA, ATF, NYPD, Anytown, USA Police force)  which have relied on hiring returning veterans who naturally perceive solutions from a militaristic point of view.  

Novel solutions which may address these problems are only superficially considered as they run counter to those multiple levels of military organizational culture.


CMV.

Some background info about me (DISCLAIMER: It's going to be pretty whiny):

 I am 29 years old and am not a veteran.  I'm from NYC and 9/11 was in my senior year of high school.  I had no desire to run off and join the military and was/am fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to go to university.  There was a large ROTC presence on my school  so I know plenty of people who served (albeit as officers).

I dropped out and got a job in finance right before the recession.  I've been working at a dead end office management job since.  In 2009, I re-addressed my life goals and went back to school part time.   I am currently graduating with two concurrent Master's degrees (Criminal Justice, Forensic Psychology, with a State Certificate in Terrorism Studies from the university affiliated research consortium).  I have spent the last year looking for jobs on USAJobs, networking at career fairs, calling HR reps, pretty much looking to get my foot in the door for a full time position in my field, nation-wide.  

Getting the unpaid internships was easy.  I enjoyed them and learned a lot from them.  I received multiple recommendations and networking opportunities, but can not transition those internships into full time positions as I am not a veteran.  I am not an academic slouch either, I have won merit-based scholarships and grants to conduct independent research which has been accepted to conferences (Currently working on 2 manuscripts to submit for publications)

On paper, I am a stud.  I have relevant work experience and the demonstrative ability to succeed and add value to an organization.  Unfortunately, the only response I receive from employers is that my application is not considered due to the amount of applying veterans.

TL;DR Frustrated, underemployed, non-veteran seeks to resolve his own cognitive dissonance. 

EDIT:  You guys seem to be focusing on why a veteran is more likely to be hired than me, instead of convincing me that it is an effective, forward thinking policy to ONLY consider veterans.  I added my POV, because the submission guidelines encourage the inclusion of all information that contribute to my view.  I guess posting this during unannounced light-hearted week was foolish.

1ihyf7,0,2013-07-17,[ Possible Career Change ] Has anyone switched from engineering to teaching at the high school level?,MrEngineerMan,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1ihyf7/possible_career_change_has_anyone_switched_from/,"Hello!

I'm a fairly recent mechanical engineering graduate that's currently got an unsavory job situation. I'm making about the same as most of the teachers I know, and my job satisfaction is practically nil. During school, I did exceptionally well in terms of grades and internships and activities, but I had to shoe-horn myself into the role.

I'm already planning on heading to grad school in the fall of 2014. So, a change is going to happen. It's just a question of what. I think my best choice would probably just be to continue my education and look for a better job.

I'm also currently considering making the switch to teaching STEM classes at the high school level. I have, by no means, decided this is my only course of action, but I'm simply investigating it as a potential path forward.

**My questions are as follows:**

**1. Does anyone have any experience with this sort of thing? Would you do it again?**

**2. Do jobs get better with more education?** Since I'm already looking at more education, I figured a TA position would be an excellent way to see if this sort of thing is for me. I'm also curious as to whether it would possibly change my outlook on the field.

**3. Would it be better to simply look for a new job?** I've only been at the workplace seven months now, but I've not enjoyed any of my time at the office. That said, the job sites are fairly neat. My company does industrial controls, and traveling for months at a time just isn't appealing to me.


*TL;DR: My current job situation as an engineer is a serious drain. What would it take to make the switch to teaching math and science at the high school level?*"

* In at least some jobs it seems that a P.E. certification can impact salary.
 
* Leading a project of substantial value ($ amount varies depending on job and company) seems like another good one.

1ihmyz,24,2013-07-17,Thoughts on Player Earning Power and the Issues Football Fans Have With Wealth.,npurcell8,nfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1ihmyz/thoughts_on_player_earning_power_and_the_issues/,"In my mind, ""I want to be paid fair market value for my services in a career where my earning ability ends in my mid-30s if I'm lucky and will result in the breakdown of my body"" is a completely fair idea. I know a lot of sports fans (football especially with the hard cap) that take massive issue with holdouts, players talking about their contracts, etc. I personally feel that, if I was an NFL player, I'd fight for every last dollar.

If fair market value means you're making $30MM guaranteed, but you're only getting $5MM, why should you settle for that? I understand you are under contract, but plenty of contractually-obligated employees and at-will employees ask for raises, especially if they have the opportunity to earn that money at another employer (team) and can use it as leverage. A lot of people make the argument that ""you're getting paid to play a game, don't complain,"" but that's not fair at all to the player's mindset. If an NFL player is lucky, he'll play into his late-20s/early 30s at a competitive level. Then, his ability to earn an income is significantly diminished. Even if a guy goes into broadcasting or front office work or what have you, unless he has made some smart money decisions personally and/or has the right people managing his money, he will never earn the type of money he has lived off of for what has constituted all of his adult life again.

I liked the WFAN NY Sports Radio page on facebook a while back (my first mistake), and the Victor Cruz contract scenario always has a litany of comments on any story about it saying something along the lines of ""You get paid to play a game ask a firefighter about their salary then complain."" While I understand the anger of someone who performs a demanding and underpaid job seeing someone play a game they love and be paid millions to do it, it is a completely ridiculous and logically fallacious statement to make. For most of the positions people try and compare to the role of the athlete, the supply of possible labor is far, far higher than the demand necessary for it (as well as the ability to pay for it). But let's pretend for a minute that firefighting was a position with a highly limited talent pool. If you were one of the twenty-five best firefighters in the world, and the other firefighters were all making X, and you are making only a fraction of X to perform the same duties at a similar level, you'd be upset too. People refuse to put that into perspective, and it bothers me to no end. Obviously there is a huge discrepancy between the earning power of the average fan and the average player, but many fans refuse to acknowledge a) the difficulty of the job of a football player and b) that players are, by and large, actually being UNDERPAID relative to the incredible growth and revenue of the industry. They refuse to admit that, in a multi-billion dollar industry, employees (according to the laws of the free market) deserve to make more than those in a public service. (Note: don't take deserve for meaning that their jobs are any more or less important, that's not what I mean, I mean in terms of what is justified relative to how much revenue they have the ability to generate for those who pay salaries).

So in conclusion, working in a field that generates ~$10B/year in revenue, necessitates employees be in peak physical condition at all times to continue working, has, at most, 2880 on-field employees (players), destroys your body and mind to an incredible extent, stops your earning power in your mid-30s if you're lucky, requires you to spend at least two years feeding a separate money machine that also turns you into the physical labor version of an unpaid intern (the NCAA) before you can even have the chance to earn a salary, and playing in a league where, despite the high risk of injury, only the salary guaranteed to you truly matters and the majority of the money you have available to you in a contract is hypothetical (non-guaranteed) based on a number of factors and can be taken away the second you can no longer perform (cutting players), I don't really have an issue with a guy holding out for a larger contract whenever possible. I would do the same exact thing, and so would you if you think like a player and not like a fan.

I want to hear everyone else's thoughts on this. Counter arguments, agreements, debate, all that. I'm really intrigued."

I was a domain administrator in active directory, used group policy, built out remote servers for students, imaged hundreds of clients, budgeted all of our expenses, trouble shooted any question a student had and then managed the lab along with my employees. I loved my job so much that my grades suffered dramatically from it. You have to program a lot in CS and I was too busy working 35 hours a week so I never focused on my work.

So I met a girl back in December.  She was a bay host for a large TopGolf location, and I got her number with no problems.  She was really into me, and I was kinda into her.  The very next night we hung out and had a few drinks, I took her back home with me, and you all know what happened next.  I've never been the type to pursue a one-night stand, but this girl was amazing.  Perhaps the ONS should have been my first red flag.  She was a blast to hang out with, extremely outgoing and personable, and oh my God she had one of the best bodies I'd ever seen.  She was/is a fitness competitor and fitness model and has been in a few fitness magazines.  The sex that night was pretty bad because it was awkward for her since it was a ONS, but that was the only bad sex we ever had.  Everything after that was unbelievably good.

**Growing Closer**

After that night we started going on dates.  She was living in a house with a guy that she called her brother who was really just someone that she grew up with that her family kind of adopted.  I always thought that was a little weird, but I'm a very trusting person so I thought nothing of it.  She was somewhat new to my city so I took her to all of my favorite restaurants and bars.  I introduced her to my friends and she introduced me to hers.  She would randomly show up at my place when she got off work to surprise me (about a 25 minute drive) and would often stay the night.  She was genuinely happy to see me and be around me.  I could tell that she was absolutely crazy about me.  I was very attracted to her and always treated her like a lady.  I'm without a doubt a one-woman type of guy, so I gave her all of my attention (or as much as I could while studying for the Texas bar exam).

**Confessions About Her Past**

During the first month of our dating relationship, she confessed a few things to me that I needed to know before we proceeded any further:

1. She had been married before.  She married a guy several years before that was busted in a testosterone drug ring bust.  FBI raided their house and everything.  I thought that was the reason she divorced him, but I later found out that he cheated on her 2 days into their marriage.

2. She had been arrested for felony theft almost 5 years prior and was on felony probation set to expire at the 5 year mark.  Her co-defendant was her jackass ex husband.

3. Her dad is now mentally retarded as a result of his rampant methamphetamine use.  Apparently she didn't even meet him until she was 10 years old or so.  She is his legal guardian.

4. She used to live with a boyfriend who turned out to be married with kids.  Apparently this guy had to travel a lot for his job.  Eventually his wife found out what was going on, traveled to the city where they had rented a house together, and caught them in bed sleeping.  My ex said she didn't know until that moment.

5. She briefly mentioned in passing to me early on that she was on her way to pick up some meds, but I didn't really ask what for.  I assumed the worst with bipolar disorder, and it turns out I was right.  I later found out she was diagnosed type II bipolar several years earlier.  She used to go to therapy, but no longer did.  To be honest, I didn't notice too many symptoms, but really I probably didn't know what to look for and overlooked what I did notice because this girl could do no wrong in my eyes.

As someone who was raised in a loving, nuclear family and with absolutely no criminal record, this was a challenge for me.  I struggled with it for a few days before telling her that none of it matters.  I promised her that I wouldn't judge her for her past - I would only judge her for what she does from that moment forward.  She appeared to be an amazing person, and I was already falling for her at this point.

**The Sex**

Oh God the sex.  I already mentioned the sex was good, but it only got better and better throughout the relationship.  So good that I wanted to talk about it again.  She was always down to get frisky with me, and I could get her off 7-8 times in a row when she could handle it.  I seriously doubt I'll ever have such great sex ever again.  Shit shit shit!!

**Falling in ""Love""**

So as time went on, I began to realize I was in love with this girl, but that wasn't until the end of April.  We both knew that we were dating, but it wasn't official yet.  I asked her to be my girlfriend at the beginning of May, and she exclaimed ""Finally!!""  She was happy and so was I, and all was perfect.  Soon I began to grow crazy about this girl.  She was absolutely perfect for me, and I knew I wanted her in my life forever.  Somewhere around the beginning of June, I told her that I loved her.  It was genuine, but she didn't say it back.  She joked that I waited to tell her after I already knew she felt the same way.  So basically she told me she loved me without saying ""I love you.""  That was okay with me.  I've been in enough relationships to know that I want it to come natural when she's ready.  The last thing I want is for her to say it and not mean it.  She did say, however, that she had made a personal decision not to tell someone she loves them unless she has decided they were the one she was going to marry.  Not sure why but yeah sure whatever.  She also told me that her therapist said she would never be able to be in a real relationship unless she fell in love with someone before having sex with them.  I always thought that was complete bullshit, but hey what do I know I'm not a therapist.

About a week later we went out of state for my cousin's wedding.  We had separate hotel rooms because I was staying with my cousin and brother, but I visited her every night to snuggle, have sex, talk, etc.  It was on this trip that she sat me down and, with tears in her eyes, told me that she loved me too.  It was completely heartfelt, and it made me cry too (I'm not a crier).  We had already talked a few times about what life would be like together, and this was validation that she seriously considered me to be marriage potential.

**The Rocky Road**

At about the same time, some issues began to arise in our relationship.  She lost her job due to a misunderstanding.  She was still living with her brother, and he was supporting her for the time being.  However, he was a complete asshole to her and they fought constantly.  In fact, he was such an asshole that she never wanted me to come over when he was there.  I met him twice, and he was nice to me at the time, but she didn't want it to get to a point where I had to stand up for her should the fight while I was there.

Anyway, she said that I changed when we started officially dating and began to smother her (i.e., kissing her when I felt like it, touching her, etc.).  It was all stuff she used to love and even initiate on her own.  But for whatever reason she just didn't like it anymore.  At the same time, she would often take her anger out on me.  She would occasionally want to argue just for the sake of it.  She also mentioned a few things that she disliked about my personality:  I'm somewhat arrogant and think I'm always right, I judge people a little bit too much, and I talk over people on occasion.  She was right.  She wasn't afraid to point out my flaws and I loved her for it.  So I sat her down and we promised to work on the issues that we each had.

**Things Start Falling Apart**

And then she began to grow distant, and this is where things get complicated.  While at my cousin's wedding, she got into an argument with her mother on the phone.  I don't remember the reason she told me they argued, but I definitely remember not believing her.  During that phone call, her mom basically disowned her, and my ex was distraught.  More on this later.  We began to get into more and more arguments, and we stopped having sex around the beginning of June.  The wedding was the last weekend we ever had sex.  I knew that she was extremely stressed and had a rough past with relationships, so I tried to be as understanding as I could.  She was trying to find a job, her mother cut her off, and she had been in a few abusive relationships in the past - one physical, a few emotional.  Fortunately for her, I'm an extremely understanding and patient person.

She asked for time and space, and I gave it to her as best as I could.  Keep in mind that I was still completely crazy about this girl.  I was considering asking her to move in with me and began to think about marriage as a real possibility.  I'll admit that asking her to move in would have been, at least in part, an band-aid of sorts as an attempt to bring us back together.  I know, I know, that's not how it works.  Even though I backed off quite a bit, we still hung out with about 2-3 times per week.  We would grab lunch together, take afternoon naps, take her dogs to the park, etc.  But she never would stay the night with me anymore.  Eventually she started working private poker games as a cocktail waitress, and that led to one particular man hiring her as his personal assistant of sorts for the games.  Basically, this guy had a lot of money and played poker up to 5 or 6 days a week.  As you can imagine, I was never okay with any of this.  It was a massive point of contention for me because I saw the whole thing for what it really was.  What scares me is that I think she saw it too.

Around the same time, she moved into another house with 2 other girls.  I helped her move and even built her closet for her at my own expense.  Once she was fully moved in at the end of June, she told me that she had been lying to me about something for a long time.  Her brother she had been living with wasn't really who she said he was.  He was her ex.  The married ex that had a wife and kids.  WTF right?!  I was in total disbelief.  She lied to me for nearly 7 months about who this guy was, and to this day I still have trouble imagining that he's not her brother.  She explained that she didn't really have a choice but she understood if I never wanted to talk to her again.  She didn't have the means to move out until the point she actually did move out.  She's hated the guy's guts since I first met her, they fought constantly, and she had always talked about wanting to move out.  So I empathized with her.  I knew she was struggling to get away from him and understood why she lied about it.  I wasn't okay with it by any means, but I loved her enough that I decided I wouldn't end the relationship over it.  We left two days later on a trip to a beautiful part of Colorado that I had planned for her a few months prior.

**The Poker Games**

Since she no longer had a job, she began to work these poker games up to 5 nights a week.  She moved into a house with 2 other girls and usually got home around 2:00am.  However, at times she got home as late as 8:30am on the weekends if the games went into the morning.  So we were no longer intimate, she wanted space, she no longer would stay the night with me, and some rich guy was paying her to help bring him drinks and give him neck rubs while he played poker.  Can you feel my insecurity?

I honestly believe that everything with this poker guy was strictly professional.  I mean he is a complete shit stain in my book seeing as how he's married but has a few girlfriends on the side and plays poker nearly non-stop.  However, I don't think he was paying her for sex or anything like that.  I knew that she was repulsed by the thought of sex with men that much older than her (he is in his late 40s).  Still, I began to grow insecure.  Actually, I began to grow suspicious.  I didn't think that she had cheated on me, but I can't even begin to explain the terrible thoughts that went through my head about what she could be out doing at these ""poker games"" while I was laying in bed.  Eventually I got to the point where I wanted to talk about what was wrong with our relationship.  We were clearly past the point where some aspects of the relationship were irreparable.  But she didn't want to talk about it.  I would ask and she would shut me down and tell me she didn't want to talk and to quit asking.  That wasn't a good enough answer so we'd fight and I'd leave.  But after every fight I'd eventually realize that I wasn't giving her the space she asked for, so I would apologize and reiterate that I loved her more than I even had the ability to explain.  But I still couldn't help but think that something else might be going on that she didn't want to talk about.

**My Breakdown**

During the past couple of weeks, I began to randomly drive by her house early in the morning to see if her car was there.  Sure, you say, ""But I thought you said you were trusting?""  I am, but I liken this to the old Russian proverb ""Trust but verify.""  I trusted her, but I'm not stupid enough to trust her completely when she's grown so distant and begun to act so shady.  I drove by maybe a total of 4 or 5 times and noticed that she would get home about 2 or 3 hours later than the times she would tell me the next day.

A few nights ago I'd had enough.  The guy that she worked the poker games for had picked her up earlier for a game.  I laid in bed and began to think that maybe he never dropped her back off at home, so I drove over to her place around 4:00am.  I waited down at the end of the street for about an hour to see what time this guy would actually drop her off.  You can probably tell now that my level of trust was dwindling, and I had become completely insecure with my relationship.  I got tired of waiting and did something incredibly stupid.  I knew she was staying with this guy and figured I might as well go ahead and call her to catch her doing it.  I called her and she answered.  I told her to come outside her house because I needed to talk to her about something imperative and it couldn't wait.  She resisted and hung up.  Knowing full well that I'd caught her sleeping at the guy's house, I called two more times until she answered and demanded that she come outside.  She resisted again, but maybe 15 seconds later she opened the front door.  Fuck!!  She came outside and I basically expressed to her that I feared she was cheating on my with this poker guy.  She absolutely flipped out on me (rightfully so) and told me to stay out of her life and never contact her again.

So a few days go by.  I texted her several times to explain that I was beyond words as I tried to express how sorry I was.  I made the biggest mistake of my life, and it was completely out of character.  I betrayed her and didn't deserve her, etc.  But she ignored me entirely for 2 days.  I then sent her one last text message on Sunday night reminding her that I forgave her for lying to me for 7 months about living with her ex while we were dating and that the least she could do was show the same forgiveness for my mistake.

**One More Night**

After sending that text, I laid in bed for a few hours trying to fall asleep.  I also prayed for a good 30 minutes or so.  I used to be pretty religious, but law school has a way of stealing all of your time, and I stopped going to church.  I'm still strong in my faith, but I know that I've been slipping away for far too long.  So I prayed a long prayer and had a heart-to-heart with God.  I apologized for wandering from Him and told him that even though I ultimately wanted his will for my life, I had to fix this mistake I had made first.  I confessed my love for her and prayed that she text or call me that night as I laid in bed.  About an hour later, she texted me and asked to come stay the night.  I knew my prayer had been answered, and I couldn't have been happier.  We cuddled, we kissed, and we were happy to be together again.  I dropped her off at her place on Monday morning and she began to prepare to start her new job on Tuesday (yesterday).  We texted all throughout the day on Monday, but she was short in most of her responses.  She started her new job yesterday, and I didn't talk to her until she responded to a few texts last night.  She told me she was busy and had a lot of stuff to do last night.

So fast forward a bit I'm laying in bed and I get the feeling that everything isn't going to get better as I had hoped.  God had answered my previous prayer, and I got what I asked for, so I thought it only right to ask for His will as it's what I ultimately want.  If she's the one for me, show me and I'll work hard as hell to give her the world.  If she's not the one, show me that too.  And if it turns out she's ever cheated on me or ever will, let me know so I won't waste my time.  And please let her call me as I lay here.  I haven't talked to her all day and am dying to ask her about her new job.

**She Wants to Be a Prostitute**

Sure enough, 3 minutes later she calls me, but I can tell she is upset.  We talk about a few of the things that are making her upset, including her recent financial problems, but it's not until later that she drops the atomic bomb on me.  She said, ""ThrowAway_02468, I'm going to be 100% honest with you because I don't know how else to say this.  I'm going to start sleeping with men for money starting on Friday.""  And there it was.  It was the single worst feeling I've ever felt in my entire life.  She insisted that she was dead set on doing it.  I offered to help her by giving her money or letting her live with me for a while or whatever else I could possibly do, but she didn't want any of it.  She had met a high-class prostitute a few nights before that was a friend-of-a-friend, and I guess this girl must have explained to her all of the positives without any of the negatives.

I still can't believe it as I'm typing this.  I'm in utter shock.  No fucking way am I letting this happen.  I used to work as an prosecution intern for one of the largest cities in the country.  I've taken a few prostitution cases to trial and I've investigated dozens more.  I've seen firsthand what happens when girls start down this road, and I absolutely wasn't going to let the happen to the girl that I love with all of my heart.  Granted, I'm done with her ass at this point.  This was the absolute last straw and is probably the worst thing I can think of that she could do to me.  I would much rather her cheat on me with someone she is attracted to even though I think that would have been unforgivable as well.

**The Confrontation**

So as I said, there's no way in hell I was going to let this happen.  After offering to help, I told her on the phone that I would never talk to her again if she did this to me.  She hung up on me.  I called back and texted, but she never replied.  I texted her that I was on my way and would bang on her door and wake her roommates up if I had to if she didn't come out to talk to me.  She swore to God that she would shoot me if I showed up (hmm felony probation violation for possession anyone?).  So of course like any normal person would I went to her house at 1:00 am.  I love this girl, and I will stop at nothing to keep her from ruining her life.

I must have called her 25 times while driving to her house.  She ignored every single one of them.  I had to say something to get her out of the house to talk to me, so I texted her and threatened to call her best friend from back home for help.  Her best friend is an angel and one of the sweetest people I've ever met.  That got her out of the house.  She asked to see my iPhone 5 to see my call log to see if I had actually called her friend.  Since I hadn't I gladly let her check, and after checking she proceeding to smash my phone on the ground twice.  She yelled at me to stay out of her life, etc.  Perhaps the most hurtful thing was her response when I said, ""You're going to pay for this phone.""  She said, ""That's fine.  I'll pay for it with the dick that's in me this weekend.""  Un-fucking-believable.

So that's pretty much it.  I flagged down a cop and made him follow me to her place to get a few of my things.  I am still in complete disbelief at all of this.  I was nothing but good to her.  Sure, we had our arguments, but I made sure she constantly knew that I was in love with her.  I supported her and stuck with her when she grew distant.  I wanted to marry this girl.  She was absolutely perfect for me.

**Going Forward**

At this point I'm considering going one of two routes:

1. File i) a claim in small claims court to recover the cost of my phone, my various other items in her possession, and my apartment key that I gave her and ii) requested a temporary restraining order (TRO) since she threatened to shoot me, has my apartment key, and threatened to take a baseball bat to my Tahoe.  God forbid she uses that key to enter my apartment with a gun.  If she does, she's dead.  I sleep with my carry weapon and wouldn't hesitate to use it in that instance.  The only problem is that I gave her that key, so I gave her permission to be there.  A TRO revokes that permission and would help me in the 0.001% chance that it actually came down to that, so I'm strongly considering it.

2. Do nothing and move on.  Buy a new phone, let her keep my stuff, and pay to have my apartment re-keyed.

Thoughts?  I'm going to get out of town for a few days to cool off.  Congratulations to whoever read all of this!!


**tl;dr**:  I completely fell in love with a girl that loved me back.  We had the perfect relationship for a couple of months.  She has a shitty family, has a history with bad relationships, was diagnosed type II bipolar years ago without showing many symptoms, and is struggling financially after losing her job.  She also lied to me for 7 months by telling me that her ex boyfriend she was living with while we dated was her brother.  But alas I forgave her because she hated his guts the entire time.  Things eventually began to fall apart as she grew distant, and I grew suspicious as she began to work private poker games late at night.  I stupidly accused her of cheating, and she completely flipped out and didn't respond to my texts or calls for a few days.  I apologized endlessly for what I considered to be the biggest mistake of my life, and she came to stay the night with me as if she was ready to work things out.  Out of the blue, she called me last night and said she was going to start sleeping with men for money.  I've done everything I can to stop it, but she's made up her mind.  I showed her nothing but unconditional love and support, and this is how she repays me.  I'm gutted.  Fuck her.


**Edit 4:30pm CST:**

Haha wow some of you guys really don't like me.  Awesome!  That means I have a lot of room for improvement.  Thank you for pointing it all out to me.  I'll admit that I have been somewhat controlling and narcissistic both in the relationship and when writing this story.  These are things that she has pointed out to me throughout the relationship and things that I have been working on.  Obviously I still have some work to do.

Yes, I know I seem like a creepy stalker.  What's funny is the fact that I felt like a creepy stalker the entire time.  I obviously did not completely trust her because of the fact that she was (1) working these poker games, (2) not wanting to talk about the problems in our relationship, and (3) not wanting to have sex or make out.  I became very insecure with the relationship and, as a result, became overbearing.  I had an unquenchable desire to know what was really going on.  Yes I was being controlling so far as that goes.  More on that in a couple of paragraphs.

I've known throughout this entire relationship that I was way in over my head merely because of the fact that I am not adequately equipped to handle someone who is bipolar.  I've never had any close bipolar friends or or family members, so this was kind of my first real taste.  I'm fairly confident that half of the problem is 1) my inability to understand why she does what she does, 2) 

Anyways, I know this is going to make me really unpopular with some of you, but I actually carried on a small text conversation with her a few hours ago.  It's kind of hard to do because she's at work.  DON'T WORRY, I'm not trying to work it out with her or anything like that.  I just wanted to know her reasoning for a couple of things.  For some reason, having answers to things gives me some kind of closure.  Yes, I know, that is controlling behavior, blah blah blah.  It's the kind of behavior that has likely driven her away from me because I want answers to everything.  Obviously I wasn't approaching this the correct way during the relationship.  But the way I see it, knowing 100% what is going on, regardless of how bad it may hurt, is better than being kept in the dark.  You may disagree, but that's just what sets my mind at ease.  Below are the basic points she made.  I'm not saying that I believe any of this.  I just wanted to present it to see what you all think.

1. She swears up and down that she is **NOT** going into prostitution.  ""Bullshit!"" you say?  Yeah I said that too.  Anyways she said that she was intoxicated.  In addition to that, in my opinion she absolutely had a manic episode last night and went completely bat shit crazy.  IF (big if) she is telling the truth now, then I suspect this is what happened:  she got tired of my shit for one reason or another (the things you all are pointing out) and was looking for a reason to piss me off and drive me away from her.  I don't know if she was trying to end the relationship or just get me to leave her alone.  She has a tendency to occasionally want to argue for the hell of it, so she does it with entirely unreasonable arguments and reasoning.  When that happens I tend not to realize what's going on until it's too late and I've already blown up the situation by trying to find some logic in her irrational reasoning.  Hint: There isn't any!  I'm just going to blame that one on being a lawyer.  The prostitution thing was completely out of the blue, and this explanation is MUCH more in line with what I've come to expect from her.  We've only had 2 or 3 of these types of arguments, but nowhere near this scale.  This was by far the worst episode she has ever exhibited.

2. She says she has never cheated on me.  She says this in the same text message where she says she loves me but wants nothing to do with me after all of this.  So she doesn't want to get back together.  In my mind, this is where she would tell me, if ever, that she cheated on me.  Maybe not, but she has nothing to lose by telling me if she wants nothing to do with me now.  Believe it or not, I'm inclined to believe her on this point.  And for those of you saying she was banging her ex (brother guy), that is not the case.  She absolutely hates the guy and has ever since I've known her.  Every now and then they'll have a very short time period where they get along, but 95% of the time it's volatile.  It's a weird situation, I know.  She got into a position where she was unable to move out and ended up relying on him after losing her job.  My city is not very dog friendly, and almost no one would rent her a house because of her 125 lb. Rottweiler.  When she did find a place, it was ridiculously outside the range of what she could afford.  In a sense she really was stuck.  However, if I had known about it from the beginning, I would have peaced the hell out.  Perhaps I should have peaced out when she eventually told me about the arrangement, but my knowledge of her situation their animosity toward each other was actually comforting for me.  This may not make any sense to you guys, but she seriously fucking hates the guy.

3. She says that I am the biggest source of stress in her life and that I push too much.  Now this I can concede to.  I chalk this up to me not knowing how the hell to handle things when the intimacy stops.  My reaction was to push to find out why.  I just had to know.

**My Question(s):**  This is for all you assholes getting on to me about not asking a question. :)  What do you think about all of these new developments?  Do you believe them *objectively*?  Why or why not?  And for those of you that know, to what extent do you think her BPD has to do with #1 as I suspect?  I haven't had as much experience with this as some of you.


Sooo it appears things have taken somewhat of an anticlimactic turn.  I apologize to all of the soap opera fans.  Maybe she's not really considering being a hooker.  It seemed out of character for her in the first place (yes, even though she was a poker cocktail waitress).  Maybe she's just tired of me pushing her too much and maybe alcohol + manic episodes + my dumb ass = nuclear bomb.  There is a lot more that I have to say, but I've forgotten a lot of it.  I'll be back with another edit later if anyone cares.  Not that you should.  But thanks for reading anyway!"
1ihaqe,4,2013-07-17,"Ok gents, I have a question for you regarding a woman I dated over a year ago that tracked me down on LinkedIn of all places.",[deleted],AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1ihaqe/ok_gents_i_have_a_question_for_you_regarding_a/,"Morning Ask Men!

The summer of 2012 I briefly dated a woman for about 6 weeks. We met on Match and talked a ton but never met. On July 1st 2013 I got a request via LinkedIn to be added to her contacts. I have not had any sort of communication from her since the 1st week of June 2012.

Here is what confuses me. We got along great but she owns a rather large specialty company in the fashion industry. She is Turkish and was recruited by Marc Jacobs to work / intern for his company while attending FIT in NYC. A few years go by, she wants to get out of NC and God only knows why she moved to this shittastic state but she did. She travels a ton world wide and has a daughter so she is gone quite a bit. We never met for personal reasons.

We have no common friends nor work related interests / mutual business associates. She is fashion as I said and I am Fed Government. Due to the nature of my job I cannot &amp; do not have nor use any social media at all but was allowed to keep my LinkedIn for professional reasons related to my job. I accepted her request and sent her a brief message simply saying, ""Hi how are you? Long time. What's up?""

I just don't get it. I am very confident in myself and I don't get intimidated by people but she travels the world for her company to find suppliers and new clients so its hard for me to think that she would contact me for any other reason than a romantic nature. Its also hard for me to think that in the year that we have been out of each others lives of all the people in the world she has met that I would be the one that stood out enough to try to reconnect with.

I replied on July 3rd 2013 and have not heard from since and frankly its really starting to make the mind wander. What does AM think my next move should be, if there should be one? I was thinking if I do not hear from her by Monday July 22nd of dropping her an eMail but I am not sure what to compose yet. My thought is that its over three weeks after she contacted me and if a lady did that to me I would not think she was a creeper or stage 5 clinger. I know she is not on LinkedIn much hence my thought of dropping a note to her personal eMail.

She is almost 10 years my junior [37/27] so I was also inside my head thinking maybe it was a maturity level at the time last year or simply not the right time then. Very curious, especially since it was not initiated by me.

All thoughts welcome.

Thank you in advance.

She is best friends with my roommate who is male and also my very close friend. 

I work from home and we spend a lot of her off time together. I am head over heals, madly in love with this girl. I am 75% sure she doesn't reciprocate my feelings for her.

I can't make a move because it will make things awkward between my roommate, her, and I if she turns me down (for the next 6 weeks). My roommate is also one of my best friends.

Life is bullshit. All I want to do is tell her how much I love her, kiss her, and be with her romantically. Life says I have to fucking act like I am disinterested in order for her to be more attracted to me. If I act on what I feel, it will just push her away.

*Don't make too much eye contact. Don't look at her every time she walks into the room. Don't stare at her like an idiot whenever she is talking in a group setting. Act disinterested sometimes. * FUCK THAT. It's all I have been doing for the last two months. I am in my head all the time. I act like a fucking idiot around her because all I am doing is thinking about my next move, conversation, interaction, etc.

Again, I am 75% sure she see's me as a friend. I want to make a move... but CAN'T. The next month will be HELL if I do and she doesn't reciprocate.

She is all I think about every fucking day. I'm tired. So fucking tired.

She is so fucking picky with men it's insane. Even my roommate agrees. I am a averagely handsome, cute, fun 24 year old guy. I don't have a god damn six pack like every guy she talks about wanting to fuck. Every hot guy she finds some fault with. She is constantly searching for a perfect fucking guy...

I watch her interact with my roommate and it breaks my heart. They are all over each other (touchy feely)... BUT they have known each other since middle school and there has never hooked up. They are just best friends. I want that kind of interaction with her.

She is literally perfect to me in every way. I have met and been with many girls and just want her.

My heart aches more than it ever has."
1igshv,0,2013-07-17,Need help funding Citywide Night of Worship (information inside),crashing_knight,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1igshv/need_help_funding_citywide_night_of_worship/,"So first off, what is Citywide Night of Worship? Citywide is basically an event where we unite all Christians in the Same common goal: to worship god and help the homeless. 

We have typically asked different churches to play, regardless of denominations, and this year, we even asked a few non-worship bands (but still Christians) to play. And while I could go off on the list of bands playing, I would rather not have that distract from the ultimate goal. 

So what do I need help with? We are renting video equipment so that we can A) help promote it next year B) we have been doing an internship at our church and some of them wanted to learn how to worship through videos. I thought this would be a great opportunity. On top of the rentals, we need to pay to reserve the park, pay for the electricity, application fee's, and, of course, food/equipment for the homeless. 

I don't want you guys to feel like this is a scam. So I invite you guys to PM me any concerns you have about this. I don't know how to prove that I am authentic, but I'm willing to try. 

And if you can't give money donations, I would highly appreciate prayers that the weather will be good, the bands will show up, and ultimately, that God will bless the event. I feel like I've been called to do this (my friend did it the first two years), but I've been concerned lately that my heart might be in the wrong place. 

Anyways, if you have more questions, feel free to ask.

Also, are there any good networking classes online?",norski_lab,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1igs6k/what_are_the_main_things_i_should_learn_for/,"I am currently getting my CS degree and have one year left. My college offers CIS which is what I originally wanted to go into but my GPA wasn't high enough. 

I had to settle for computer science as they don't have a gpa requirement. 

My buddy from high school got me a job at a help desk my sophomore year and I fell in love with it. I eventually became the lab manager and over saw everything that went on. I was a domain administrator in active directory, used group policy, built out remote servers for students, imaged hundreds of clients, budgeted all of our expenses, trouble shooted any question a student had and then managed the lab along with my employees.  I loved my job so much that my grades suffered dramatically from it. You have to program a lot in CS and I was too busy working 35 hours a week so I never focused on my work. 

I'm a year behind but I'm on track to graduate in May. 

Currently I got an internship as a software engineer and I don't like it nearly as much as my lab manager job. I wanted it to see how I would like to be a developer and I'm starting to think it's just not for me. I don't mind coding, just not 8 hours a day. Plus I liked the human interaction from my other job and I felt more satisfaction from it. 

So next summer I will be looking for a full time position as a sys admin. My question though is what stuff should I know since I was never in the CIS program? I feel as though I have a good start with my lab manager job and this internship. I can show that I'm able to program scripts and stuff but idk the other major things. I know I should read up on networks but I have no idea where to start with them. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I need you to know.

You destroyed me. 100%, completely and totally. Utterly destroyed. I can’t even begin to express how much it has hurt me to learn some things since you broke up with me… I’ll get into that later.

For now though, I just need to say that I loved you more than I ever thought was possible. I still love you, and there hasn’t been a single day that I don’t wish I could be with you. Just hold you, or hear your laugh, see your smile, hold your hand. Just to be with you again, that’s all I want. All I feel like I will ever want.

Depression – that’s all I’ve felt since you and I got together to return stuff after the breakup. After you broke up with me, it was a lot of pain and hurt and heartache. After we talked that night (thank you for meeting with me to talk, but I almost wish we hadn’t… too late to go back now), I felt a little bit better, knowing that you were happy – but I also felt a pain that I can’t even explain, knowing that you moved on and I wasn’t the reason for your joy, for your happiness. Knowing that you didn’t love me anymore, and knowing that I would never get you back. Holy crap, knowing that I WILL NEVER GET YOU BACK. That alone makes me not even want to go on. That’s one of the main reasons for my utter soul-crushing, paralyzing, and god-damned HORRIBLE depression.

Stephanie, you need to realize this: I know the truth. Not everything, but I know. I know a whole lot more than you think, and probably more than you wish I knew. I know more than I wish I knew. But I know the truth… and I know that you lied STRAIGHT TO MY FACE. I think that’s the part that hurts me the most – you told me you NEVER went behind my back. I KNOW that’s a lie, no matter how much you deny it.

You told me you “met him on the plane”……. What you forgot to mention was that HE WAS WITH YOU IN ST THOMAS during your trip. So Steph, how long was that going on? Did you know right away that you “loved” him and were going to dump me, or did it take you a whole month and a half of going behind my back, talking to him, having discussions on the phone or facebook or whatever, before you decided I wasn’t worth it? Your trip was in the beginning of March - you strung me along until the very end of April.....

You will never understand how much that hurt me. I feel like an absolute piece of garbage, like something that wasn’t good enough so got thrown out to rot. I’m not able to write out how I feel. There aren’t any words that explain that kind of pain, that kind of loneliness, that kind of betrayal. That kind of depression.

Steph, why? That’s all I need to know. Why? What did you experience during that week with him in St. Thomas that made you decide I wasn’t worth staying with? I know that your “reasons” that you gave for breaking up with me were nothing but excuses. I know that now, and it hurts. A lot. A LOT.

I KNOW that you went behind my back. I KNOW that you were with him during most of your trip. I KNOW that you continued talking to him after your trip. And worst of all, I KNOW that you told me you NEVER went behind my back. SERIOUSLY?!! How could you lie to my face like that? Don’t I at least deserve to be told the truth? Trust me, I’ve felt enough pain and heartache since you broke up with me – knowing the TRUTH would have been 1000x easier for me to move on…. But finding out the truth after you told me TO MY FACE???? THAT is what has made this so unbelievably difficult and painful for me.

WHY? That is all I need to know. Why? There are so many unanswered questions, so many unexplained things, so many hopes and dreams that were shattered and destroyed – but none of that matters to me… all I care about is WHY? Why wasn’t I good enough? Why did you let yourself spend so much time with him in St Thomas when you HAD A BOYFRIEND who LOVED you back home waiting for you? WHY did you make excuses not to see me for so long after your trip? WHY didn’t you just TELL ME THE TRUTH?!?!?!

CHRIST Stephanie!! Just typing this, it doesn’t seem real. That you would betray me like that and lie to me after all the amazing time we spent together, supposedly both in love with the other – which I guess it’s pretty obvious that was only a one-way love. Damn. 

You need to know that I still love you, even after the pain and heartache (heart destruction, actually), even after the crippling (yes, CRIPPLING) depression I’m experiencing, even after the betrayal and lies… I still love you for some ridiculous reason. It doesn’t make sense, and it should be so SO easy for me to hate you and [name omitted], but I can’t. I can never hate you, Steph. You meant (and still do mean) entirely too much to me, and I respect and love you way too much to hate you or be angry at you.

Anyway, here’s a fun story… I’m trying to find someplace to start counseling. I need it… I honestly can’t even function in my day to day life without SOMETHING to help me get through this crap and past you. Suicide isn’t an option; though sometimes it seems like that would be the easiest way. That would be the coward way, and you know I’m not a coward.
Honestly, I just want to know why? What was it about me, or what’s so amazing about [Name and his city of residence omitted] (who you met in the Virgin Islands, when you were away from me for ONE week) that he was worth destroying my life for? 

I’m done whining now, at least for tonight. Time to go cry myself to sleep yet again and not look forward to tomorrow. Your sister thought her life was bad, having to drive a beat up old pickup truck to her internship? Trust me, my life is fucking hell.

1igk9l,3,2013-07-16,"Oh no, I said too much. I haven't said enough.",Lydias,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1igk9l/oh_no_i_said_too_much_i_havent_said_enough/,"I'm dating a therapist. Not MY therapist. Just a person who happens to be a therapist. I'm not dating him because I think he can help me with my psychological issues (and I do have them). I like that part of him because I, too, want to be a therapist. I'm starting school in August. I'm going for a B.A. in Psychology and then I'll aim for a Masters in Counseling. There are definite perks to dating a therapist. 
-He can help me with my journey to becoming a therapist and I get some insight before hand on what it's like to be one and what kind of bullshit you have to deal with.
-He's a very emotionally intelligent person. We haven't had a fight or a mere argument. He's compassionate and understanding and an EXCELLENT communicator. I love that.
-He makes me feel like I'm not crazy.

But that's where it gets tricky. 

I was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 13. Before I even met this man, many MANY people told me again and again ""You're not bipolar."" Psychologists that I knew from through friend said ""she's not bipolar"". I believed that I was not bipolar. But I needed therapy still. 

So I saw a psych intern who was fulfilling her hours through seeing people and taping the sessions. The tapes were shown to her supervisor. 

This supervisor, whom I had never met, diagnosed me with Major Depressive Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder. So we began Dialectical Behavioral Therapy which focuses on emotional regulation, distress tolerance, mindfulness, and interpersonal effectiveness. (I found that to be helpful.) 

I met my boyfriend soon after being diagnosed with BPD and I felt comfortable enough to mention it to him. At first he was a little wary but eventually he said ""I don't know about that."" He would always stop himself. I understood why. He's not allowed to interfere. I get it and I respect that. But the diagnosis was causing me distress. I was focusing too much on the label and the stigmas attached to it that I couldn't focus on the symptoms that I happened to have. I met other young women who had this disorder and they scared the shit out of me. I didn't THINK I came off like that, at least I really hoped I didn't. 

My boyfriend knew this was distressing me and I told him ""I get it. You're not supposed to say anything, but I NEED to know what you think."" And he told me he really didn't agree with the diagnosis. He said ""If anything, you MAY have SOME symptoms of borderline and some symptoms of dependency but maybe it's nothing at all. You've been through a lot - who wouldn't have some issues?"" 

Basically saying my issues stem from the sexual and emotional abuse I experienced and the misdiagnosis of bipolar and the countless medications I took in my teens... He understands me so fucking well. 

The problem is: I may have told too many people that he didn't think I was this or that. It doesn't matter if I am or if I'm not. He's not supposed to say anything about that to me. It's conflict of interest since we're dating.

I trust what he says, not because he's my boyfriend, but because he knows more about me than any therapist ever did. I was never comfortable enough to tell them how I felt. I always felt like I had to say certain things and not just how I really felt. I always felt so embarrassed, as if the person was judging me and thinking ""this bitch has no idea what she's talking about"". I'm comfortable with him, so naturally, more will come out. I don't use him as a therapist. I just share things with him because he's my boyfriend. That's totally normal. He doesn't play therapist because he knows he's not allowed, and two - I doubt he wants to take work home with him. 

He can't help it if he notices things because of his extensive knowledge and practice with these things. 

So that's the other problem - I can't just explain these things to people. I feel like this is way too long anyway. 

Someone could report him and he could lose his license permanently - because I was careless. Someone could misunderstand the situation and think that he's MY therapist and that there's a duel relationship. Which is not the case. 

I'm scared I said too much and maybe to the wrong people. 

TL;DR I'm dating a therapist (not my therapist) and he told me he doesn't think I'm this or that and I may have told too many people what he said and he could lose his license if someone reported that."

There are positions for I.T. 1-4, with requirements that the person has at least one years experience as the previous rank before they can move up.

What is the best way to go about discussing with my Supervisor that I would be interested in moving up to an I.T. 2? My opinion carries weight in a lot of decisions made during development these days and my supervisor knows I am dependable for almost any task.

I know a lot of employees in the agency move up by simply changing departments when openings happen, getting assigned I.T. 1-4 based on their experience, but I like where I am at and don't desire to leave just yet.

I had planned to bring it up during my Employee review, but after my 6-month probationary period ended I was told we would have the first one after another 6-months, with each year thereafter.

(x-posted from r/CSCareerQuestions),theguyjb,blacksburg,https://www.reddit.com/r/blacksburg/comments/1ikodx/looking_for_a_job_while_i_finish_my_senior_year/,"I'm a CS major looking for work in and around Blacksburg, and I'm not sure what sort of jobs to seek. I am **not** attending Virginia Tech. My fiancee is starting the PhD program there, and I will be taking my last 7 classes remotely at an out of state university.

I am a non-traditional student. I'm 30, and have worked full-time throughout my collegiate career, first in retail management and then in help desk work. I am currently finishing up a CS internship. I **have** to have a job, with the whole non-traditional student having bills and such.

I'm curious what sort of positions are available for people in my position (that is, older students with some experience but no degree). It seems like taking something like retail again would be a step down, and I'd like to avoid held desk work again if possible. Any suggestions? I have applied for one fall internship, but I can't find any others.

I am everything typical that someone would call a pathetic underachiever.  I am older than I should be, I am living in my parent's basement, i've been through years of therapy and I am back in school.  

As I have slowly been pulling myself out of spending too much time with myself I have just become anxious and like a deer in the headlights when people talk to me at my internship.  Sometimes I can't even think in front of them and I just feel like a stupid moron, which of course is the natural reputation that comes with not being able to think quickly and with alacrity when other people ask you a question.

A lot of it has to do with being prepared or shall I say underprepared.  Sometimes i just resent the experiences I have had with others so much that I just don't want to help out.  I just want to be the person that is known for being slow, stupid and idiotic.  Then I am put in this relentless ongoing battle of turning myself around and forcing myself to interact positively or whatever.

It just seems hard to want to help when you know you have a shitty reputation to begin with.  Blah, thanks for letting me rant.

I'll take you back to Halloween 2011, this marked a year from my promotion to Supervisor. It is one of the busiest nights of the year, everyone is dolled up good, I personally went with a [Punisher Noir](http://i481.photobucket.com/albums/rr172/VIM22/PunisherNoir-Sketchcolours-800.jpg) set up. Hand made mask, nice leather braces, and a pair of my hencher airsoft pistols in shoulder rigs (Raging bull replicas in lime green). I looked epic.

Now I start this tale in the managers office, me and my fellow 2 supervisors are getting the lowdown from Managers, the drinks offers, the ticket numbers, the usual. We go to get the safe paperwork (we have to record the numbered money bags we make cash drops with) and my boss hands a sheaf of papers to MoneyPete the most senior supervisor who has upstairs bar duties. Big Boss mentions he'll bring my paperwork to me later. 

At this time Bono enters, he's a generally nice guy, very good medic. Knows his shit, but a little preachy with his new fitness classes starting up. (I'm overweight, but he can still Fuck Off, i'm relatively fit due to rugby, American football, and shifting stock after hours).

So I leave with my safe keys, my notes on offers and set up my bar. The main bar. I take some pride in this, as I'm still training LittleSupervisor, he's recently promoted after a post freshers drop out, and I'm training him to be utterly boss, he can also handle customers like a pro, and I can't. I'm the stick, he's the carrot of the team. MoneyPete is total balance.

LittleSupervisor joins me and we get shit sorted. The staff arrive in some stunning costumes and we give them the briefing, all is well. We are locked, loaded, and ready to break last years takings :D.

BahamutWings.Face(Game);

The night is a total success, we have an up and coming Rock/Dubstep act on from 12-12.45 and some great local DJ's spinning discs.

My paperwork still has not arrived, so I have made some proxy paperwork and have been filling it out until I get the official sheets. Ladies and Gentleman, I fully recommend getting a rich friend and ask them to hold a fistful of cash. It really does feel good, feels even better when you use about 2 grand to wipe the sweat off your back before you bag it and put it in the safe (finance fucked us off so this was my PettyRevenge).

LittleBoss comes over to check up on us at 2AM. We are all good, I've started rotating the staff onto 15 minute breaks and I've got my usual stash of cigs and ""dropped"" Red Bull for those that want it. I give LB the skinny of it and he nods.

LB: ""Sounds good mate, keep a check on the Red Bull to write off, also, have you got the paperwork for me to check over?""

Moi: ""Nope, BigBoss gave upstairs Paperwork to MoneyPete but he hasn't dropped ours off yet. I've made proxies though.""

LB: ""Sounds good man, but BB just said he gave you the paperwork, you need to find it, soon man!""

My previous certainty is eroding, the look in LMs eyes is pretty serious, he's not normally this uptight.

Moi: ""OK, i'll have a scout for it here, would you mind checking the office once more?""

LB: ""Sure dude, i'll check and come back.""

LB scurries off to the office. I check the usual paperwork places, Behind the Back Bar, and on top of the Safe. No Sign. I have a root along the whole of the Back Bar and along the floor. 

Nope, no paperwork here.

LB returns, empty handed.

LB: ""Mate, it's not in the office, and the printers fucked out of ink, you have to find it or we're all in shit.""

Moi: ""Fuck.""

LB: ""Mate, seriously, BB is fucking furious about this. Bono said BB definitely gave you the paperwork.""

I placate him, promising him i'll find it. BB is normally pretty cool, this is not normal, and LBs lack of trust is burning me right now. They have taken Bonos word over mine as to the paperwork situation. They normally have my back, but it now sounds like he'll hang me out for this one.

I get to one last check along the bar, then I eye the safe. It has a tiny 1cm gap at the back where skirting board prevent it touching the wall. It might have slipped down.

Gotta move it.

I crouch down and use every fibre of muscle at my disposal. My 6""6 frame strains at this safe. Its a half metre cube, solid metal, and after googling similar safe I estimate its weight to be about 150KG. Eventually I manage to pull it a foot out. I have no spent all my energy and am feeling shitty.

Enter BigBoss.

BB: ""BahamutWings, where is the paperwork? Bono said I gave it to you!""

Moi looks over the edge of the safe. It's not there. FUCK.

BahamutWings.Pants(filling);

Moi: ""I can't find it BB . . . ""

Bono saunters behind the bar.

Bono: ""Well BB definitely gave it to you."" Bono.Face(smug);

BB: ""Well if you don't find it we need to have a chat, now put that safe back.""

I crouch again and put my shoulder to the safe, BahamutWings.Engage(ThatPropMode); :D

Bono: ""Mate your pushing it wrong.""

Moi: ""You come over and do it then.""

Bono: ""Don't be stupid, no one can move that safe.""

Moi: ""Well I can, I have, and if you haven't got good advice or help to offer, fuck off."" 

Yeah, Diplomacy is not a strong point of mine, see previous stories at the end for other examples.

Bono: ""No need for that mate."" He raises his face archly and saunters off.

I finish moving the safe back.

LittleSupervisor approaches, he asks if I'm alright, I say no. He's cool, tells me to piss off out back and have a smoke. God Damn I trained him well.

So I head out, have my smoke, ""drop"" a Red Bull and rejoin the action.

LittleSupervisor approaches me, theres some A4 sheets in his hand  . . . could it be?!

LS: ""Hey BW, MoneyPete was given these by accident, it's our paperwork.""

LittleSupervisor.Standing(Skyrocket);

BahamutWings.Pants.(Clean);

YISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS.

I am saved, I grab it off him and give him one o' them [BearHugs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWoom1gpNfo) i'm known for. I start filling it out from my scrap sheets at the end of the back bar.

All seems well.

Then Bono.

Bono: ""See, I told you BB gave you the paperwork.""

I rush to the bar, face up in his grill.

Moi: ""He didn't, he gave MoneyPete all the paperwork by accident. You never saw him give me anything. And you lied, nearly getting me in trouble.""

Bono: ""Well I know what I saw . . ."" he trails off ominously and saunters off again.

Now I did what I do best.

I went out back to the cellar, went out the back doors, picked up some wooden pallets and starting hurling them at the wall.

We all have stress releases, it just so happens mine might be a little more spectacular and destructive than most.

After a few minutes I give up, I've smashed 2 completely and a few more are missing planks. I gather it into a pile and turn to go back in. BB is stood my the door.

He does not look happy.

BahamutWings.Pants(refill);

BB calls me in, and takes me to the office.

I explain the stress I've had over this paperwork. My last 30 minutes, all on the words of Bono the meddling Medic who insisted he'd seen something he hadn't.

BB is sympathetic, then explains that Bono also said I threatened him.

Oh ForFuckSake.

BB shows me the CCTV of me raging at him on his second trip to the bar. It doesn't look good.

I know the score, I've resigned before.

BB asks if i'm alright, tears are running down my face. I hadn't even noticed them, my whole body is trembling like an epileptic at a strobelight convention. 

I can't hack it.

Moi: ""Sorry BB, I can't do this, supervising. Not when Bonos word is taken over mine. I want to stand down.""

Now, we always went down to 2 supervisors after Crimbo because the there isn't enough work for 3 in the second half of the year.

BB: ""Shit.""

Strangely enough, I felt relieved of a burden the second the words came out of my mouth. I love my Job, I love the Bar, My colleagues, and most of the supervisor job stuff. But I can't handle people. Never have been able to. Been working on it since.

BB continues: ""Mate, the position is always there if you want it back.""

I appreciate the sentiment. I thank him. Since then I've supervised when needed. I Love this set up. I cherry pick my shifts now. The other Staff no longer fear me as I've gotten to know them as my equals, not as their Boss.

My smashing of the crates was seen by 2 girls on the bar, SmallLass from a previous story and RubyRed (one of the fittest Goth babes I've ever met). They had called BB thinking I was losing it, I really was.

I know it's been a long one, I hope you enjoyed reading about it.

Bono was told to apologise to me. He never did.

LittleSupervisor went on to be awesome with MoneyPete.

LB nearly shat a brick when he heard I moved the safe, according the insurance he'd just renewed it was meant to be bolted to the ground. He just figured no one could move it.

BB presented me with a bottle of Champagne at the Christmas do that year, a thanks for my year as supervisor.

He then asked if I was interested in becoming Cellars/Stock Manager. All the Bits I loved about supervising, with none of the shit that broke me. 

I said yes, and loved that job most.

I went on to take an internship in Germany.

I go back in September. I got an email today saying my Cellar Manager position had never been filled, and is mine when I get back.

1ijtk8,4,2013-07-18,"Me[22M] very interested in a friend of 2 years [22F], but scared of ruining our friendship",notsurewhattodo3920,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ijtk8/me22m_very_interested_in_a_friend_of_2_years_22f/,"First off, first post, and throwaway, but I feel like I need to write down some thoughts, and maybe even get some advice. For the purpose of this, I will be known as Tom, and female friend will be known as Grace.

So, first I want to say I am a shy person, especially around new people and that prior to college I never had any female friends, nor did I ever care to interact with girls through high school. That being said, I kinda missed out on that early relationship/dating/what-have-you experience during my early youth. And in hindsight, I wish I did go through some of those experiences, cause now I feel lost when it comes to feelings and relationships.


With that being said, as most have figured out then, I have never been in a relationship. I guess it never really bothered me, partly cause I just never really cared and cause I feel like I have never met a girl that has really caught my attention to the point of a relationship. Not going to lie, I have always enjoyed the idea of being in a relationship, and even thought about some people I'd like to be with, but the idea either disappears quick; no girl has ever pushed me to want to actually pursue someone. Come college, I realized I really do what someone in my life, but at the same time I feel I may have even convinced myself that I am just on of those people that isn't meant to be with anyone...... until I transferred to University and met Grace.

A quick fast-forward to after college (yes, I graduated in June :) - Something about college did open me up and I think a lot of that can get attributed to a change of people and scenery as I moved quite a ways from home. I suppose I finally overcame some of my shyness, and maybe even fear, of interacting with females. I don't want to come off as *that guy*, but I feel it has become a personal accomplishment, and self-confidence booster, that I have gained a small number of true female friends in my life. Sooooooo, moving on....

Anyway, though not very relevant, I always get a kick out of remembering how we first met. We were both third years transfers, and our college had set up a big facebook group for our incoming class. During the second week of school starting, Grace asked a question about a class assignment to a class that I happened to be in in our FB group, so I helped her out and suggested we work on the assignment together. She liked the idea, but we never really fully committed on setting anything up. Come the next day, I was working with some other people in a study room, and Grace showed up. I didn't tell her about this study session, but apparently one of my friends invited her. (I use the word friend because ultimately we all became friends as the year went on, but we were all new acquaintances at this moment). When Grace arrived she started talking to her friend, then all of a sudden she stops, looks at me, and goes: ""Oh shit, you're Tom from Facebook!"" I laughed, introduced myself, talked a bit, then began working on said assignment, and all forthcoming assignments throughout the quarter together. 

Annnnyway, something about this first encounter really got my attention and almost instantaneously knew I liked something about her; on top of her being pretty, she had a great personality, open about her life, and spoke her mind. I can't say I really had feelings for her at that moment, but I knew I was excited and hopeful that we would become friends. Like I mentioned earlier, I toyed with the idea of a relationship, but she was already in one, so that idea quickly vanished and I just accepted her as a friend, one of my first friends at school I might add. 

We continued to take classes throughout the year, sat with each other during lecture, and studied together, but never really did anything outside of class because she was always be busy with sorority stuff or students organizations she was in...and, well, I was not involved with that kind of stuff. But that was okay, we already spent a lot of time in class and studying together, and I was just happy to be with her when I could. This remained the general trend throughout our third year.

Come our last year, we didn't talk much over summer, but we had already planned our classes together, so I was excited. I don't know what changed over summer, but our last school year we definitely became even better friends. We did a lot more stuff together outside of class, and that's when I think I really started to realize this is one of the first girls I really care about and sincerely want to spend a lot of my time with. Then I snap out of it and realize she already has a boyfriend, and I just continue to live on. I think I'd be too scared and unsure how to even act on telling her about my feelings anyway even if she weren't in a relationship. 

Faaaaaastforward to our last quarter! We get back from spring break, and I met up with a different friend to head to our first class together. Along the way, we run into Grace. This is the first time I have seen her since being back, and I instantly knew something was wrong. She is a very talkative and perky person, but this morning she was not. Long story short, she broke up with her boyfriend of 3 years over spring break. Part of me was happy because it meant maybe, just maybe, if I stopped being so closed off about my feelings for her I'd have a chance, but at the same time, I hated seeing her so sad and depressed. 

I guess this is where I am confused about. Through the remaining of the school year, Grace and her Ex kept in contact to try sorting things out, kinda like the ""we can remain friends thing,"" but it never went very well cause she was always telling me how angry she is with her Ex. But at the same time, I know she still has some feelings for him, and she even told me that; though that may have changed after graduation (my FB stalking-creeper skills seem to reveal they are no longer FB friends) and maybe they finally cut each other out... I don't know. We don't talk as much as we used to now that we graduated, and especially not about their past relationship. 

So ultimately, I realized after their breakup it has gradually and intensely become clearer that I really am interested in her, and even more so after graduation. I miss her, a lot, and think about her more than I wish to admit; it is a feeling I have never felt for anyone before... but I don't know what to do. On top of that, she has moved to D.C. for an internship program, and is thinking of living their for a couple years after; meanwhile, I am still in CA (where my home is, and hers is too). And, what I am most worried about is that if I were to **actually** listen to my feelings and tell her how I feel, and she denies feeling the same, if it will ruin our friendship. We have spent a lot of time and forged a lot of memories together, and I'd rather remain good friends than lose it over telling her about my feelings. I'm confuuuuuuuuused!

Well, damn. I probably shouldn't be up this late writing all this jibber-jabber and I don't really even care if this gets seen or not, but I will admit it feels good to write down, though probably excessive. Sorry for walls of text!!! I. Am. Going. To. Bed. 
 


**tl;dr**: Summarize with a tldr!

• Never been in relationship/really cared to until college
• Met girl first year at University, became really good friends
• Realized I have feelings about her - don't know if she has the same
• Would *really* like to tell her, but scared of ruining our friendship and don't know how to tell her
• Is potential life-long happiness worth risking a friendship??? I don't know :("
1ijs72,1,2013-07-18,I've come to the realization that my life is spiraling downwards and there's nothing I can do about it.,fuck_this_fuckyou,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ijs72/ive_come_to_the_realization_that_my_life_is/,"Facts:

Moved when I was fourteen to NJ from the Midwest (summer before high school). Didn't have too many friends in middle school but some. I played a lot of video games and stuff like that. I was ways pretty good at math and science but not like... Stellar top of the class or anything 

High school: small catholic high school (400 students total). Even though we were all freshmen, I was singled out because I didn't know anyone (everyone knew someone they went to grammar school with). Not to mention being from the Midwest and being sorta quiet and awkward didn't help my situation. My high school was known the be one of the worst in the district (bad academics if you weren't in honors. I was in honors and AP call and chem). I was too embarrassed to tell my parents I hadn't really made any friends (my commute was also seventeen miles so I never met any kids that live in my town) and that I wanted to transfer so I just stuck with it. Things went okay. I wasn't the most bullied kid but I wasn't loved  by everyone and I took my share of insults (which would still occur every now and then because nobody really respected me. I was just a nice guy. I'm not enormous or funny looking. Just kinda tall and quiet.) Things improved after sophomore year. I managed to make a small circle of friends. We weren't super popular but we weren't complete '' losers'' kinda in the middle. There were six of us and I was dating a girl in my grade. (this was late junior year early senior year). 

One of my friends in the group introduced me to one of his friends that went to the local public high school (today he is ''my best friend'' I use quotes because we will talk about this). And all six of us would play xbox together all summer and hang out and it was fun for a while. 

Near the end of senior year I can't even remember what happened... But we all started hating each other... Or rather... I found out post graduation... Everyone just started hating me and I have no idea why. Only one of the five still remains a good friend of mine to this day. We will call him G. G is the one who introduced me to his public high school friend who we will call T. G was kinda a jock in high school (which was weird because we were good friends... I'm not a jock. More nerdy). G T and myself are still all good friends. But it still bugs me that I lost all my friends for seemingly no reason. And now that I think about it... I repressed a bit... I did get bullied a lot 

Okay so fast forward a few years. Present day... It's the summer before my senior year at college (northern NJ) tech school. I major in mechanical engineering. G is in an armed force (stationed in the US) who comes home now and again. T goes to the local community college for history. By now... The three of us have been best buds for four years now. 

College was better at first, everyone was a little more nerdy like me... Had similar interests so that was cool. I have lots of friends and they're all great. I get good (3.1 gpa... Deans list. If I get a 3.2 by the time I graduate I get honors) grades and we have fun together. I still hang out with T sometimes when I'm home on weekends. We miss G and talk to him... But he never gets to come home really and that sucks. 

Now... Here's the shitty part. 

I have no future. 

I have no hobbies other than video games and reading. I sometimes work out (I've gained a little weight. I manage to look thin but I do have a belly now. I can never stay motivated long enough to make progress) . But alas... I'm scared of graduation because I won't get a job. I have work experience but I don't want to return to my old company. This summer I couldn't find anything medical device related (what I'd like to do) so I was forced to take a research position here at school. I was so depressed about it (all my friends got internships) that I can hardly get motivated to do any work with it. I just sit around feeling miserable trying to get work done but I just can't. 

Spring is going to roll around and employers will ask '' well... What did you so last summer? '' and I can't tell them anything because this work is going nowhere. 

Ontop of all this my parents put so much goddamn pressure on me '' we are so proud of you! You're so smart! Blah blah nlah''

IF IM SO GODDAMN SMART AND GOOD AT THIS...  WHY CANT I FIND A FUCKING JOB. WHY CANT I GET MOTIVATED ABOUT MY WORK. WHY WAS HIGH SCHOOL HELL FOR ME. THE OTHER KIDS ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT ME BEHIND MY BACK... MADE FUN OF HOW AWKWARD I WAS. AND NOW... THEY'RE GONNA WIN. I WONT EVEN BE ABLE TO GET A FUCKING JOB AND SHOW THEM IM WORTH SOMETHING. 

I had a shitty high school experience... Out of shape... All my college friends have internships... No hobbies worth talking about on an interview... Parents who I'm frightened to let down... And a million other problems I won't bore you with. 

So fuck. I've thought about... You know... But that just seems dumb."
1ijk1o,1,2013-07-18,Needed a place to vent,thenameschill,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ijk1o/needed_a_place_to_vent/,"Sorry for the rant guys, I'm just here to vent so I don't mid you guys ignore this.

Now to the story.
 
I've been depressed for about 2-3 years now and I just realized how depressed I was about the beginning of this year. I don't consider it serious at all right now though. 

Let's start at the beginning? Sure. Well, my grandfather passed away and my mother was in emotional pain. Me? I didn't even sob. I don't know why. I didn't feel much at all. Even when a friend suicided, I didn't feel a thing. Always thought it would hit me later. It didn't.

But deep inside, I always have failed. Grades? fail. Always been told I'm not going to college and not going to be a success. My parents pretty much given up on me. And they always think I can't get anything done. Even when I stick whatever I have done into their faces. They just say that's nothing. Probably why I don't want to do anything at all. Never gets acknowledged. 

My social life sucks too. Sure, its great, but I don't have anybody but two people to rely on. The rest are ""friends"". They know me, I talk to them, but always excluded from things. I try to hide my feelings away from people because I don't know how to confront them with a burden. 

My parents always complain how I just sit at home doing nothing. I am forced to take a bus to a train at 8 in the morning to get to an internship I hate every tuesday and thursday of the week. And I have to waste my entire weekend on just my parents dragging me to classes. So, Monday, Wednesday, and Fridays right? nope, spent all onto applying for colleges that I won't even get accepted into and sleeping. No purpose of waking up at all. 

I play video games to escape reality now. It just takes my mind off of things and is somewhat healthier than smoking weed like the rest of the kids. But my parents always blame it and me for any problems. Bad driving? because I don't pay attention and play video games. Bad grades? not because of all the crap I am dealing with emotionally, but video games. Their response is to just take everything I have away, which is just my computer that I bought with my own money.

I've thought about suicide before, but I thought it would cause too much trouble for my family and my friends. Now its just my friends and part of my family.

Thanks for listening guys."
1ijilj,3,2013-07-18,I don't know what I'm doing with my life (common complaint),aaajjjeeennn,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ijilj/i_dont_know_what_im_doing_with_my_life_common/,"My boyfriend was supposed to find an internship for the summer in order to finish college units, and then we could both move in together and get settled in the area easily. He never applied to anything until the very last minute, and then he decided to just take summer classes instead. School is hard work, but I know he's having a lot of fun getting drunk and hanging out in our college town with all our friends while I'm back in our hometown applying to jobs online and studying so that I can to go professional school.

We've both graduated (except for the summer units for him) and I have a lot of general experience from being employed as a tour guide, tutor, office assistant, department store clerk, etc. for my undergraduate career. But now I feel like my experience and especially my degree are all useless. It's so fucking difficult to find a job that isn't retail or food service. I've been chasing a position at an after school program for kids for more than a month and I finally have an interview. It's tomorrow, and I'm already stressed about it, so what's the best thing for my parents to do? Tell me that the area is too expensive to live in and that I should stay at home instead, and then doubting every answer that I give them about how I've planned for things to work out. I know they have a point--the job I have an interview for is only part time. I would have to get a second job in the mornings.

Also, it's been part of my plan to move in with my boyfriend (finally, after a 5-year relationship with no cohabitation). But he still doesn't have a job and hasn't applied to one in a long time. Granted he's in school, but I was still in school when I started pursuing this job that I now have an interview for. I really want things to work out, and we definitely need two incomes to support ourselves. But I don't know if his motivation will ever come through for us. I hate to say that I don't trust him, but I'm having strong doubts lately and I think that they're valid. But I really love him and I have been looking forward to taking this step in our relationship for a long time... I just don't know if it's realistic in the near-future.

Not to mention I can't stop measuring myself against his ultra-successful family. His mom is a doctor and his dad is a professor at a university. His sister just graduated from a better school than us (she's only a year older--we graduated early by a year) with pre-med and just sent out applications for medical school. She has a stellar record, so there's no doubt that she will get into the one she wants. Her boyfriend also graduated and is going to a good master's program this fall. They already found an apartment in the area, and she's looking for a job now, but she still has about 2 months before she really needs to worry about it.

I know I shouldn't compare myself, but it's hard not to. That's another part of the reason I don't like to be at home: I feel like I'm being constantly evaluated by the people around me (particularly parents). Maybe that's not entirely true of everyone, but I can't help but measure myself against them. My boyfriend told me that his sister is scared about the future too but I know it's not the same because she'll be a shoo-in for med school and she's very qualified to work in medical offices since she did that for her mom for a long time. So she has a lot of GOOD options when it comes to jobs. Apparently, I don't.

So my interview's tomorrow, and all of the thoughts that I've been having for months are piling into my head all at once. I have anxiety issues, so this is clearly not good. Or maybe, it's normal for me. Sometimes I wish I had medication because my life might be easier that way. I know it would be worse in the long-term, though. And I know that I should probably go to therapy, but my insurance won't cover it, and I don't want to talk to my parents about going to a therapist.

Another issue related to the anxiety is trillotrichomania. I've had it for as long as I can remember. I pull out the hairs on my head often, and occasionally I'll pull my eyelashes and eyebrows too. Strangely, I hate plucking my eyebrows cosmetically. My friend learned about the disorder in a psychology class, but has not connected it with me. She has brought it up in conversation twice, saying that her roommate would do it, and I have thoughts that maybe she knows I do too... But I have never said anything about it aloud except to a college therapist that I saw for a short time. I have written about it a couple of times on reddit before, but I deleted the comments soon after. I feel embarrassed. My hairdresser has noticed the baby hairs coming through multiple times, and I play it off like I don't know why they're there. Every time something really stressful is happening, I keeping pulling my hairs. I have enough restraint that I don't usually do it around others, but when I'm alone, I couldn't tell you how many I've pulled out. It makes me feel ashamed of my appearance and my behavior. I feel like I'm crazy.

I know that it's common for recent grads to feel all lost and whatnot. I feel really awful. I don't even know why I'm doing all of this. Why am I moving to a place where I don't know anyone, why am I willing to work so hard for no apparent reason except to live with my boyfriend? Will I just be throwing money away? Will it be worth it later on? Maybe I'm doing it to prove something to everyone else. I wish I could just sleep forever."
1ijba7,7,2013-07-17,"People who have done internships, any advice for someone trying to land their first one?",xSleyah,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ijba7/people_who_have_done_internships_any_advice_for/,"I'm a college sophomore pursuing a computer science degree. I'm particularly interested in software design. The past couple of years I have been unable to find paid work anywhere, and next year I'd really like to find a paid internship in my field--might as well make some money as well as do something that's going to help me down the road. 

I've been searching my college's website for internship opportunities, but there's nothing particularly dedicated to computer science. However, I figured pretty much any company would have use for someone who is good with computers if I just look in the right places. My college is close to a medical/engineering/sciences research park, so there should be plenty of opportunities. 

So I guess my main questions are:

How did you get your internship? Who did you talk to, where did you look? What kinds of companies did you inquire at? 

What should I be learning/preparing for in the meantime? I'm shooting for summer 2014 (as a rising junior) if possible. I have experience with Python, Java, and HTML/CSS so far, and will continue to practice and learn whatever other languages I should know.

Thanks!"
1ijb3u,2,2013-07-17,Question regarding web development in .NET,A_Mann,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ijb3u/question_regarding_web_development_in_net/,"Hello everyone, I'm currently in the middle of a development internship where I have been using WPF and C# extensively. I have been tasked with the creation of an, albeit simple, web page for a student organization I'm involved with. I'd like to leverage my experience in these new .NET technologies to make this website, but I have zero web dev experience up to this point. I've done a bit of research, and it has left me with some questions. 

If I were to make a WBA through WPF and C#, would it be natively compatible with chrome and Firefox? The msdn article I read cited the necessity of a Microsoft Web Browser Control in any compatible browser, but a stackoverflow comment from '09 said that IE exclusivity in WBA's was a thing of the past. If I want to work with xaml and C# to create a site, is a WBA a solid option?

My first instinct says to avoid Silverlight, because I know the clientele of this website will not necessarily be the most tech savvy and therefore possibly needing to make a download would deter visitors. I also know nothing about ASP.NET and would prefer to use technologies that I'm already familiar with (WPF, C#) due to the time table that I'm on. 

My understanding is that ASP.NET is traditionally the way to go for web development in .NET. My final question comes down to this, is it wise at this juncture to move forward with a WBA for this website, or should I instead take the plunge and learn ASP.NET? Simply, will a WBA provide a widely accessible product which will meet simple requirements (about pages, hosting a calendar, etc) or is ASP an unavoidable eventuality?

I very much appreciate any insight that you guys can provide. Thanks in advance!"

[Don't Cry For Me Argentina fills the arena as Alan Lightbody emerges from the back, waving an obnoxiously large Argentine flag, wearing a crown and a velvet cape. He is followed closely by El Mondo Loco, to mixed reaction from the crowd.]

Slam: On your feet, Andrews, we're in the presence of royalty!

Andrews: How can a king be elected again? Isn't the point of a monarchy tha-

Slam cutting him off : Silence, plebe!

Andrews: But their Constitution dates back to 1853!

[Lightbody and Mondo make their way into the ring. Lightbody lets out a hearty ""HAIL TO THE KING, BABY"", to the ire of the crowd.]

Laurie: Introducing next, from New Haven, Connecticut, JAMES LA. FON. TAAAAIIIIIINE!

[Muse - Citizen Erased plays and LaFontaine makes his way down the entrance ramp, also to mixed crowd reaction.]

Andrews: LaFontaine looks to build some momentum heading into Gold Rush.

Slam: He's climbed aboard the Hurstville Express, that should be all the momentum he needs!

Andrews: ...

Slam: Get it? Express? Train? Momentum?

Andrews: ...

Slam: Silence, plebe!

Laurie: And their opponent, from Washington DC, Handsom James HARSHAAAAAAWWWWW!

[Tina Turner's Proud Mary fills the arena as Harshaw comes from the back, carrying a stack of 8x10 glossy black and white promo pictures of himself. On his way to the ring he's signing them with a sharpie and handing them out to the fans along the ramp, whether or not they ask for one.]

Andrews: And here comes the Handsome one himself, the star of Santa With Muscles 2!

Slam: Can you believe it's been the highest grossing movie of the summer so far?

Andrews: No, actually, I really can't.

Slam: SILENCE, PLEBE!

[The three combatants begin to circle each other warily in the ring, as the ref calls for the bell and this one is under way! Mondo immedietly rolls out of the ring, as LaFontaine is a step to slow in chasing him. LaFontaine, realizing he can't catch up to Mondo, turns around and eats a picture-perfect dropkick from Harshaw!]

Slam: You can't turn your back for a second in a triple-threat match!

[Harshaw runs the ropes and drops an elbow on the prone LaFontaine. A quick cover! ONE! TW- LaFontaine kicks out! Harshaw stands up and stomps on LaFontaine's left knee a couple times. As LaFontaine writhes in pain, Harshaw flips him over and locks in a single-leg Boston crab!]

Andrews: The Handsome one, going for an early submission here.

[Mondo, sensing the opportunity, climbs the turnbuckles on the far side of the ring, behind Harshaw's view. Mondo leaps thru the air and lands a missle dropkick square onto Harshaw's back, breaking the hold and throwing Harshaw off of LaFontaine! Mondo rolls LaFontaine over and covers him! ONE! TWO! -LaFontaine kicks out after two!]

Slam: Brilliant move by the Argentine Luchador!

[Mondo quickly pounces onto the ropes and goes for a springboard moonsault, but LaFontaine rolls out of the way! Mondo eats mat the hard way, and a recovering Harshaw jumps on him, raining punches onto the prone Argentinian superstar.]

Andrews: I don't think Harshaw appreciated the dropkick, when he had LaFontaine under control.

[After a few moments, the ref pulls Harshaw off of Mondo, admonishing Harshaw for using a closed fist. While Harshaw is still focused on Mondo, LaFontaine has rolled out to the ring apron behind Harshaw. LaFontaine recovers, leans back while holding onto the top rope, and slingshots himself into the ring, flipping and grabbing onto Harshaw's arm in the process, taking him down with a flying arm-drag!]

Slam: The HVX intern's not out of this one yet either!

[LaFontaine quickly follows with a hammerlock on the mat, torquing Harshaw's arm painfully. LaFontaine pivots on the mat, but he sees Mondo going for another moonsault. LaFontaine releases the hold and rolls out of the way, leaving Harshaw to take the moonsault solo! Mondo goes for the cover, but LaFontaine pulls Mondo off, kicking him in the back, dazing the masked Mondo momentarily.]

[LaFontaine, seizing the opportunity, climbs to the top turnbuckle, and turns to see both Mondo and Harshaw making it to their feet. LaFontaine launches himself and both his opponents, but in a rare moment of cooperatation, Harshaw and Mondo both catch LaFontaine out of mid-air! Mondo and Harshaw together hoist the smaller LaFontaine into the air above them, and drive LaFontaine down with an awkward but effective double powerbomb!]

Andrews: That's gotta hurt!

[Harshaw tries to take advantage and drops down to cover the barely-conscious LaFontaine, but Mondo catches Harshaw's arm and a leg on the way down, and rolls Harshaw up into EL SMALLO PACKAGEO!! ONE! TWO! THREE! The ref calls for the bell and this one is over!]

Laurie: Here is your winner, EL MONDOOOO LOOOOOOCCCOOOOO!!!!!

[Harshaw is incredulous in the ring as Mondo rolls out and celebrates on the outside with Lightbody! Don't Cry For Me Argentina plays as Mondo mocks Harshaw from the outside, counting 1-2-3 by smacking his hands together, emulating the referee.]

Andrews: From out of nowhere! Mondo can pull that off seemingly at any moment!

Slam: It's been quite a week for the nation of Argentina, first they elect Lightbody, and now their native son wins again on Battleground! And now it’s time for our RWF Championship Title Match Contract Signing!  Supernova and Steel are going to explode at Gold Rush!

* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExYnV1OyH6o&amp;t=26s begins to play and Christopher Steel strolls out from backstage in a custom-cut and tailored Richard Jewels Diamond Edition 3-piece.  Larry shambles along behind, holding Steel’s Glistening RWF Championship, with several of his sponsor’s logos emblazoned on it, including the side plates being replaced with Jimmy John’s and A.D.I.D.A.S. emblems,  aloft in gloved hands. They enter the ring apparently enjoying the jeers of the jealous and inferior RWF fans*

*Coheed and Cambria's ""Hollywood the Cracked"" hits the PA as RJ Supernova, accompanied by his protege, Hawk Dawson, hit the entrance ramp. The usually energetic Supernova takes a slow, calculated walk to the ring, eyeing his adversary the whole way down. Dawson carries a quill and ink well. As he enters the ring, Supernova throws a feint kick at Steel, then laughs as he takes a seat at the table.*

RJ: ""I guess you're wondering why I called you all here today to this ring. Well, I do suppose there is this matter of a contract, but before we get there, I'd like to address my opponent for my title match in seven days. I hear you, Steel. ""The man you've beaten before?"" That's a little cliche, isn't it? I mean, yes, you have beaten me before. I'm not here to deny facts. The truth isn't a matter of perception. In fact, you've beaten so many of the RWF's top guys there's not even anyone left to face you without a mark on their record. So I guess we should just retire the title, name it after you and all go home right?
You know as well as I do that that is not how this works. Chris you and I both came into this company when it started, and we both were entered into the inagural RWF title tournament. I made my way there by beating a couple of guys so badly that they haven't shown their faces here since. You, well, you made your way there as well, although getting both you and Alex...""Amazing""...in there was as interesting change to what I expected. And that day, you pinned me, and became the champion. So here you sit today, across from me, the only two time champion in this company's history. And, once again, I have to deal with another...obstacle...in my path to defeating you, in the form of one jilted ex-partner of mine.

Chris Steel: Last time we fought, I beat you 1-2-3 for this specific championship. You can spew threats all you want about how much you've improved over the past couple of months but guess what junior? So have I. And evidently... (Chris looks at his championship) I improved more.

RJ: There is nothing that will stop me from righting the biggest wrong of my career. When you beat me you went on to headline pay-per-views, main event battlegrounds, and be the face of this company. I went on to be a face in the crowd, trying to find my place, and struggling along the way. This contract is a chance to fix my biggest regret, and take that title from you. When I come out they say I'm from San Luis Obispo, or they'll mention that I'm from Buffalo, but my real home is in this ring, and I don't say that for the cheers, I say that because it's the truth. My passion and my blood, body, and soul belong to this company. This contract is my chance to take my place atop it, and justify every long roadtrip, every injury, every relationship lost in my pursuit of my dream.

Chris Steel: What if, though... what if I just refuse to sign? I'm not obligated to. I mean, if I defend my title I have everything to lose, and you have nothing. I can turn that 180 degrees around by not signing this stupid contract.

RJ: But you’re proud, Chris. And deep down you *need* to show everyone up. Senor Tigre called you a paper champion. Will you prove him right? I know that you don't think I can beat you, so why not prove it? What will your sponsors think? I’ll tell you what I think; the truth is not a matter of perception, it is a matter of fact, and the facts say that I am the most dangerous man in this company. I won this title match by beating three of the top stars this company has in a ladder match. I've sent opponents to hospitals, to rehab, and to the footnotes of company history. My path of destruction includes the top names in this company's history. There is only one name left to cross off this list in my opinion, and it's yours.

*Steel sneers angrily at RJ, unbuttoning his jacket, and Larry looks ready to burst a gasket, when The tron blurs into static for a moment, then blurs into what looks like smoke. A familiar voice comes over the PA system, words slurred*

Ricardo: Don't you wish you killed me, RJ?

Ricardo Sacramento appears at the top of the ramp, wearing a white wife beater over his wrestling tights. He has a bottle in one hand, a microphone in the other, and no cast on his leg. His face has what looks like a three week old beard growing on it, and his hair is greasy and matted to his face.

Andrews: Ricardo Sacramento is back?!

Slam: His leg healed!

Andrews: But, what's that in his hand?

Sacramento rears back and throws the bottle at Supernova and Steel. It breaks on the contract table, and Sacramento lets out a loud belly laugh into his mic. He starts walking down the ramp, stumbling only slightly as he makes his way.

Ricardo: How's it going jerkoffs? Remember me? I'm the Marty Jannetty to this fine, fine Shawn Michaels here in the ring, ready for his big title shot. I've already taken the steps even, to my own failure. Look at me, amigos, I'm back to where I was supposed to be!

He stops and gestures to himself.

Ricardo: I'm dirty, I'm loud, and especialamente not trying to be the big San Francisco Saint that I thought I was supposed to be!

He sticks a big middle finger up to the crowd, who respond with a loud boo.

Ricardo: Suck it up, whiners, I'm giving you sht worthy of a Daytime Emmy! I'm back! The broken, insecure, drunk little street puto you heard so many stories about is back! The fighting rooster of the Bay Area has finally reared his head and is crowing like the cock he is! It must be dawn!

Slam: Was that a-

Andrews: Don't say it.

Sacramento begins walking down to the ring again, pointing his finger at RJ.

Ricardo: And what a dawn it is! It's so bright, the sun must have exploded! Or maybe that was just RJ Supernova's fragile ego letting out a few cracks, who knows? There's no way of telling with this former King of California. One second, it might be the most ""bro"" moment you've ever had in your life, and the next it might just be the one bump in the Oregon Trail that makes you fall off of the Conestoga wagon!
Sacramento stops at the foot of the ring. He leans forward, resting his head on the apron, looking at both competitors.

Ricardo: Chris Steel, I'm gonna kill you as soon as you think you're ready to try to take me on in a match. And RJ, trust me, you're gonna wish you didn't try to break my leg in that Last Man Standing Match, because you've popped open a bottle of twenty six year old tequila, turned it into a Molotov cocktail and threw it through your own living room window.

Sacramento flips off the two in the ring, then makes for the crowd barrier. He climbs over and begins leaving through the crowd, speaking into his microphone without even looking behind him.

Ricardo: Enjoy your match, putos. I can't wait to bust you open like the one Mexican kid at a birthday party breaks open the piñata.

Dawson hands Supernova the quill and ink well, which contains no ink. Staring at Steel, Supernova jabs the quill into his own hand, letting the blood drip into the ink well. 

RJ: Chris, I don't care about pain. I don't care what you think you can do to me. I feel nothing. My body is but a vessel for my fire and my passion to become the champion. And win, or lose, they'll have to drag my body to the back, because I'll leave every single piece of my soul, and every fiber of my being in this ring. And if you think you can beat me, and send my career to hell, you better be prepared to get dragged there with me.

Supernova signs the contract in his own blood.

RJ: Seven days Chris, be prepared to welcome your destruction.""

*Supernova rolls out of the ring in a flas, walking up the ramp and looking over his shoulder at Steel, pointing his finger at him and pulling the trigger. He smiles and keeps walking, blood dripping from his hand. Steel and Larry are livid in the ring, and Steel stomps around in frustration. The crowd begins to chant ‘Steel’s a P*-ssy! Steel’s a P*-ssy!’ and he pulls an Aurora Diamante pen from his vest pocket and sings the contract, spitting on it in disgust and wiping his hand on Larry before storming up the ramp in a fury*

The typical crowded parking lot and all-the-way-around-the-building ticket lines are shown from a neato helicopter camera, highlighting the massive turnout at the American Airline Center in Dallas, Texas. Screaming fans and crew members alike are all on their tiptoes with excitement, and we go to John Andrews and Rodney Slam live at ringside*

Andrews: Welcome, RWF Universe, to another exciting installment of RWF Battleground! We are just one week away from the hottest thing in professional wrestling, RWF Gold Rush!

Slam: You said it, dillweed! The tension around here is higher than Jack Swagger and significantly less lispy as we present an example, just a little sample, of what we have in store for our fans, and we’re doing it all *live* right here, in Dallas, Texas! With a card like tonight’s, let’s just skip over my partner prattling on and on and get to the action!

*A video package plays highlighting the RWF Women’s Division.  After a brief montage of former Women’s Champions, the focus moves to Lili Lafontaine, Raindrop, and the recent return of Amy ‘The Crimson Tide’ Lightbody*

Andrews: Well ladies and gentlemen, since making her return, Amy Lightbody has been bulldozing the entire women’s roster one combatant at a time. Last week, Grace Stevens was put out to pasture by Amy. But before that, she crushed the leg of our champion, Lili Lafontaine.    

Slam: I can’t wait for tonight because she’s about to do it again!  

Andrews: Not so fast, Rodney. Lili has recovered and is ready to take down Amy. And that match happens now.  

Laurie: This contest is set for one fall...  

*”Mz. Hyde” by Halestorm begins to play as Lili Lafontaine appears on the ramp and hoists the women’s title high in the sky.*  

Andrews: Last time these ladies met, Amy flattened Lili on her way to the ring, but it looks like we’re going to get a full introduction this time.  

Laurie: And her opponent...at 6’3” and 310 pounds...accompanied by Alan Lightbody...Amy Lightbody!  

*”Monster” by Skillet plays as Alan and Amy march down to the ring. Alan swings his arms with a swagger of confidence. He points at Lili as the bell rings.*  

DING DING DING  

*Lili jumps the gun by running center ring and dropkicking her opponent. Amy swings her arms to steady her balance. Lili hesitates, then bounces off the rope and clotheslines Amy, who sways her arms even more...tilting towards the canvas. Lili rapidly climbs to the top turnbuckle, leaps, and connects with a DDT, dropping Amy!*  

Andrews: She got her down!  

Slam: I don’t believe it!  

*Alan Lightbody takes his jacket off and throws it down out of frustration. Lili drops an elbow on Amy, then grabs both legs and goes for an Indian Deathlock. She struggles to move one leg...then gets kicked backwards.*  

Slam: Just too big and too powerful.  

*Lili sees Amy getting up, then springs off the rope and hits a one-handed bulldog.*  

Andrews: She did it again!  

*Lili goes for a cover.  

ONE TWO KICKOUT!  

Amy’s kickout springs Lili into the air and three feet to the side. Alan Lightbody gets on the ringside steps and walks to the side of the ring. The referee goes over to plead with him to move, then then Lili joins him.*  

Slam: King Lightbody exerting his royal authority, here.  

Andrews: King Lightbody?!? He hasn’t won the crown!  

*As the argument continues, Alan marches back and forth arguing with the ref. Amy gets to her feet, then walks to Lili and clubs her on the back. Amy picks up Lili and drops her with a scoop slam. She drags her to the corner, then climbs to the second rope with her back to the ring and begins bouncing up and down on the ropes.*  

Slam: BanzaiiiiI!  

Andrews: Shades of the late Yokozuna here.  

*Before Amy drops, Lili stampers up and clubs Amy in the back. Amy turns around, she eats a Stunner off the top!*  

Andrews: FALLEN ANGEL! 

Slam: No way!  

*Lili covers.*  

ONE TWO THREE!!  

Laurie: Here is your winner: Lili Lafontaine!  

Slam: I Don't believe it!  

Andrews: That is the Crimson Queen's first loss after coming back and King Alan is beside himself.  

*Alan Lightbody looks like he may cry as Lili has left the ring and is celebrating.*

Andrews: A strong statement from Lili Lafontaine on a hot night in Dallas, Rod. The Battle Royal for the Women’s Championship sure to be one of the highlights at Gold Rush in Oakland next week!

Slam: And it’s gonna be hot! Woooo!

Andrews: More Battleground after this.  *[aside to Rodney Slam]* Honestly, Rodney…

Slam: Welcome back, everybody! Up next we have new Television Champion Lord Vecna taking on Stone Foundation ally Joey Knight!

Andrews: Right you are. The mysterious and communicatively-challenged Lord Vecna will be defending his Television Title against El Mondo Loco and James Harshaw in a triple threat match at Gold Rush.

Slam: And Captain America will be part of the 9-man War Games match for the Tag and International Titles as part of Team Stone.

Laurie: The following contest is scheduled for one fall! Introducing first, from West Point, New York, he is the Army of One, Joeeeeeeyyyyy Kniiiiiight!

*A mighty Hoo-Rah echoes across the arena and ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home"" comes trumpeting across the venue. The crowd cheers on Joey Knight as he marches to the ring with the flag on his shoulder.  Joey high-fives and shakes hands with fans on his way down the ramp, climbing between the ropes and waving the flag to each corner and eliciting cheers each time, and a resounding ‘U-S-A! U-S-A!’ chant. Knight hands the flag to the timekeeper and turns to watch the entranceway

Laurie: And his opponent, from the Outskirts of Parts Unknown, which according to Chris Jericho is located in Spain, the Masked Mushmouth, he is the RWF Television Champion, Loooorrrrrd Vecnaaaaaaaa!

* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJskh9ZWjbw filters out through the arena and Lord VEcna appears at the top of the ramp in a long hooded leather coat. His Television Title is on his shoulder, and his head is inclined toward it as it he is listening to it. Behind him Kas follows along looking concerned. He reaches the ring and appears displeased with the Title suddenly; he hands it and the coat to Kas and scurries into the ring*

Slam: This Vecna guy is a weirdo. He can wrestle, but still a weirdo.

Andrews: You should talk, Rodney. You came out of retirement to compete for a stipulation, hoping you could see some ladies in their undergarments! It’s like you’ve never heard of the internet.

Slam: The what?

*DINGDINGDING*

*Vecna and Knight take one long look at each other before colliding in mid-ring. They start with a collar-and-elbow tie-up, and Vecna quickly moves it into a standing armbar. He torques it, but Joey Knight is prepared and rolls forward, reversing the hold and transitioning into a hammerlock on Vecna. Vecna tries to throw a back elbow with his free arm, but Knight keeps his head burrowed into Vecna’s back and the mystery man can’t connect. Instead, Vecna heads for the ropes, holding on and forcing the ref to break the hold.*

Andrews: Smart move by Lord Vecna.

* Joey backs up and the two begin to circle. Suddenly Lord Vecna goes in low and catches Joey with a Double-Leg Takedown, holding on and rolling forward into a bridging Jackknife pin. The ref gets to one, but Knight shakes him off by throwing his mass to one side. Vecna falls to his belly, and Knight quickly slips a hand under his midsection and another over his back, locking his fingers, and stands up, lifting Vecna and then turning and bringing him down heavily with a textbook Kareline Lift. He shoots the half and goes for a pin of his own, but Vecna is up at two and not near done yet.*

Slam: Some nice technical ability from both of these two.

*Lord Vecna moves in, looking for another tie-up, but Joey Knight counters with a quick toe-kick to the gut and hits the ropes, rebounding and taking Vecna to the mat with a Running Neckbreaker! Knight doesn’t let up, immediately hooking a Chinlock on the mysterious Lord Vecna and rolling him over, adding on a Body Scissors to ramp up the punishment. Vecna looks around, hoping to snag a rope and break the hold, but he’s too far away*

Andrews: Nice hold by the adaptable Joey Knight. Vecna is stuck!

Slam: Quick, somebody jam a Rosetta Stone DVD in his trunks so we can understand him!

*Struggling as he lays on his side with Knight entwining him painfully, Lord Vecna finally manages to get onto his belly and tuck his chin down against his chest, loosening Knight’s grip enough to push his hands off. Vecna sends a pair of rapid-fire elbow backwards into Joey’s ribs and gets the separation he so desperately needed. Vecna scrambles to the ropes and steadies himself, pulling himself upright. Joey Knight doesn’t hesitate to press the advantage and rushes at Vecna for a high knee, but the mysterious competitor low-bridges the top rope and Knight tumbles over, just barely hanging on to the rope and saving himself from further punishment. Lord Vecna heads for the far ropes and comes back on the rebound just as Knight has steadied himself on the apron and tries for a shoulder between the ropes, but Knight slingshots over him at the last second and hits a mule kick o Vecna’s back as he reenters the ring*

Andrews: And now both of these men are ramping things up! This is turning out to be a real test of skill and tenacity!

Slam: Cripes, you’re boring.

*Knight lands as Lord Vecna holds his back in pain and positions himself behind, bringing Vecna to the mat with a textbook Russian Leg Sweep. On his feet quickly, Knight launches himself at the ropes and arcs through the air for a Lionsault… but Vecna rolls out of the way! Knight lands belly-first on the mat as Vecna steps to the apron, measuring his opponent*

Andrews: Could Lord Vecna be looking for Faith Ends?

Slam: I thought it was called ""FUaeeay-de-ra AH-ha-te-ku""

Andrews: Check out the big brain on Rodney!

*As Knight gets to one knee, Lord Vecna catapults himself into the ring, catching Joey with a Rocker Dropper (Fame-Asser for you Billy Gunn fans) and introducing his face to the mat in new and exciting ways. Vecna goes for the lateral press. One… Two… but Knight gets a shoulder up! As the two roll into position Lord Vecna hits a modified amateur-style takedown and goes into the Prawn Hold for another pin attempt, but this time Knight is able to push him back and reverse with a pin attempt of his own! One… Two… and Vecna claps his legs around Knight’s temples, stunning him and escaping the pinning predicament*

Slam: Nice series there. Reminds me of a little feud I had with Don Muraco, way back when.

Andrews: Did you win?

Slam: Yeah, but I had a gimmick in my wristband.

*Both Vecna and Knight take a moment to catch their breath, and Knight is the first to move this time, rushing at Vecna for what looks like a clothesline, but he feints and ducks behind the Masked Mumbler. Vecna turns and is met with a kick to the gut and an uppercut that floors him. Joey rushes up the turnbuckle and salutes the crowd*

Andrews: He’s going for the 50-Star Press!

Slam: Hard to tell if this Vecna guy is worn down enough for that. We haven’t seen much of him, and even so he’s, you know, wearing a mask.

Andrews: Joey will have to rely on his considerable instinct, then. This young man gets better every time I see him!

*With the crowd chanting ‘U-S-A! U-S-A!’, Joey Knight takes to the skies and the arena gasps at the image of a man hurtling earthward with such grace and precision… to find nobody home below! Just as Knight leaves the turnbuckle, Vecna kips up and moves deftly to the side, catching Knight’s arm on the descent and forcing him viciously to the mat, where he applies the Taduq Hekrdsyna  (Crossface/LeBell Lock) on Joey. His face showing as much shock as pain, Knight is nowhere within reach of the ropes and is forced, finally, to make a tactical retreat, slapping his hand on the mat until the ref calls for the bell*

*DINGDINGDING*

Laurie: Here is your winner by way of submission, Looorrrd Veeeeecnnnaaaaa!

Andrews: And Lord Vecna pulls out a win against the Army of One!

*Lord Vecna exits, the Television Title apparently whispering not-so-sweet nothings in his ear*

Slam: So the TV Champ will have some momentum on his side heading in to Gold Rush. Knight has a much more daunting task ahead of him, and that doesn’t change with tonight’s match regardless of how it went. So what’s next for tonight?

Andrews: Shouldn’t you know that?

Slam: Catering got here early. Sammitches were had.

Andrews: Who catered? I brought a bag lunch today.

Slam: You brought… um, Quaker Meats. Wait. Uh-oh.

Andrews: The waiting is the hardest part, Rodney. Well, the second hardest. So our next contest features both of Lord Vecna’s challengers, El Mondo Loco and James Harshaw, and James Lafontaine, brother of the Women’s Champion and Hurtsville intern.

Slam: Neat.

The way the process works is after the internship is over they basically ask your manager if you should get the job and their response is pretty much the final decider.

The summer has been awesome so far, it's a really intense program but I've been getting great feedback from my manager and others so I think I'm doing okay. My direct manager has been super involved, always coming by my cube to make sure I'm okay and asking me to go on coffee runs with him in the middle of the day. All is well and good.

A few weeks ago, he started texting me about work things. Then it kind of devolved into talking about random stuff, and he would always talk about how much he was going to miss me when I go back to school. At this point I'm optimistic and figured he just really valued the work I was doing. But recently it's been getting more and more undeniably flirty, to the point where it's a little weird. Today, he texted me something about how he loved getting to spend 4 uninterrupted hours with me and when I didn't answer (because wtf do you say to that?) he then said ""don't kill me for innocently flirting lol"". I replied with some joke about how he deserves a medal for spending time with me, and we ended the conversation. 

So here's my question: what do I do? I know the textbook right answer is to talk to him about how his texts make me uncomfortable, but he's going to be the deciding factor in whether I get a job at this company or not. I feel like having that conversation would shut down any hope I have for getting a job there. I really have no idea what the right move is. Any advice would be appreciated :(

TL;DR - boss at my internship is flirting with me via text, don't know what to do. "

I am thinking about pursuing a career in either **chemical engineering or software engineering**, but I’d love to hear from anyone.  The first 6 questions below are ones that we were given to get answers to.  The last two I came up with because they may provide some guidance for my future.  Just a little about me I am going to be a senior in high school.  Thanks in advance if any of you are willing to take the time.

1. What did you study in college?

2. What type of projects did you have to complete at a college?

3. Were you expected to do an internship?  was it a requirement?   During the school year?  Pay tuition during the internship? Did you get paid for the internship?  Was an internship recommended? Did you do it during the summer?  Which academic year did you do it? (Soph. Jr. Sr.)

4. After graduating with a baccalaureate degree did you go to graduate school?  Was/Would it be beneficial for you to do so? In what ways?   Were/Will your graduate school studies a continuation of your undergraduate studies? More specific? Less?

5. What type of schooling does a high tech industry manager’s job need?  How do management jobs get filled in your company?   How does one climb the management ladder?

6. Are there trends, cycles, or swings that drive your industry?  What causes these swings?  What is the long term expected trend in your company?

7. If you were given the chance to go back through college would you change anything? what you studied? what career you got into?

1inmcw,6,2013-07-19,Self-indulgent whining about my life,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1inmcw/selfindulgent_whining_about_my_life/,"I'm feeling pretty low at the moment. Friday nights and Saturday nights are the worst, for historical reasons. The source of the current frustration is gambling (and to a lesser extent) alcohol problems.

I just want to get off my chest that, my life sits somewhere between ""The universe doesn't like me"" and ""I do things the hard way"". 

From the beginning, I was sexually abused by a boy when I was young (I'm a straight male). My parents were/are alcoholics and my father violently so. My brother developed severe social/mental issues because of this and I guess I did to.

The self-indulgent part here, i.e. what makes me a bit ashamed to be taking your time is that I've read worse here. Someone recently posted about parents and siblings dying and that truly is heartbreaking. As is other things you hear in the news.

Back to my indulgence; I became depressed during my mid-to-late teens that I've finally (I think) managed to shake off. I do have frequent ""dark nights of the soul"" so-to-speak, like now, where I reflect pretty poorly on my decisions.

My school and then Uni work suffered though I went undiagnosed. It was a terrifying and confusing feeling, wondering why you couldn't: get out of bed, look someone in the eye, remember basic information from ten minutes ago, panic attacks in the night... That's where 'normal' people would look down at me. I suppose it's self-inflicted and natural. A guy my age (at the time) would see me as a weakling, inconsequential and he'd be right. I thought (and still do) that perhaps 50% of the adult population have one role in life - to make the lives of others miserable - and I'm not really sure why.

That's when I became violent (only when drunk). I surprised a lot of former friends, those who remembered me as quiet and kind-natured at a younger age. Now pushing around local bars hollering abuse and looking for fights. Christ, I was an asshole and lost a lot of friends those days and I deeply regret it. I remember the thought in my head at the time was ""who cares?"" I guess I wanted accepted as a ""force"", somebody with some kind of merit and power. Looking back it was pathetic and I wish I could explain to everyone I hurt. The only consolation is that I never hurt anyone I knew physically, albeit I hurt strangers in ""square"" fights. I've broken too many bones to remember as a result. I remember peeling myself off the concrete floor in a pool of my own blood at 6am barely knowing why I was there, going back to my accommodation and crying.

Having dropped out of my first choice university course, I managed to pull myself together enough to finish a different course at a lesser University attaining a pretty meagre score, but a Degree is a Degree. I'd kicked alcohol and moved city.

More recently gambling has been my vice, that I've had to go cold turkey having squandered a four figure sum. Again it's just an example of my weakness and I'm paying for it now.

I look back at my brother who I left behind, he doesn't leave the house now and I guess it's like an open secret that he has problems. I feel like the lucky one.

My first job leaving Uni, in a internship type thing, my bosses were horrendous, borderline evil. I was a graduate working ""alongside"" a Business Development manager, with the both of us reporting to a M.D. Their business did not pay me - it was a government scheme, and I was basically a lackie. Blamed for any failings and I didn't have the gall or backbone to standup for myself or even quit. I would be shaking during one-on-one meetings, with anger, fear and incredulation at some of the suggestions against my name. I would work hours overtime unpaid trying to justify my measly existence only to be kicked in the teeth.

I left too late, with nothing lined up but I simply couldn't bear it any longer.

I'm in a better place now, but still paying for past mistakes. I look at many of my peers and see them walk from great job to job, lucky break to lucky break and kind of wonder... why not me? 

At least now I've kicked many of my problems and understand that it's not luck that'll take me far, but pure hard work. I don't think any jumped up shit of a colleague can argue against that.

I'm on the way to turning it around, but like I say... I think a lot about my brother and the crap that life has thrown in both our faces. "

1infic,0,2013-07-19,Advice for a Youth Pastor?,oppossuma,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1infic/advice_for_a_youth_pastor/,"I have been working in youth ministry for almost 10 years now. I have been in my current youth pastor position for about a year and a half. Before that I worked at another church for almost four years.

The church I came from is what you would call a ""mega-church."" This church is where my passion for ministry developed, where I received   the brunt of my ministry training, and where most of my close friends attend, including my fiancee. 

The church I work at now is minuscule by comparison. My youth group hovers around 15, when at my old job I would work with around 300. Both jobs were part-time, but I make considerably more at my current job. However, I am distressed physically, emotionally, and spiritually.

You see, I am torn between wanting to serve God where I am currently at, but I long for the growth and relationships I had at my old church. I am not experiencing any growth or investment at the church I am at. I feel like I am there to fill a position. I have adults constantly critiquing my abilities, and the church itself is stagnant. The kids are great but that is not sustaining me. 

I probably would have quit already, but my mentor, my old boss from my old church, told me that if I want a shot at being a pastor there, I need to show the executive pastors that I am capable of growing and sustaining a ministry. My parents are divided on the issue. My fiancee tells me I should quit, and that i have not been myself since inbegan working there. 

I want to stay. But I want to leave. And I am miserable. 

So what should I do. Should I keep plugging away, hoping and praying that things turn around, while I keep spiraling deeper and deeper into depression? Or should I quit and start from the bottom again as an intern at my old church, make less, but be able to have peace again?

I wish there were an easy answer. "

I need some advice with my girlfriend's dog, a lab shepard mix about 3 years old. She recently left for vacation for about 3 weeks (we've had him for two months) and since then he's acting weird. He's normally well behaved (never barks inside the house, doesn't growl or snarl at people, housebroken potty trained etc). Since she left though, some things have changed. I'm okay with the occasional bark inside the house, but today something odd happened.

My little sister is staying with me for the duration of the time my gf is out of town for an internship she is doing in the area. She is sleeping on a sleeping bag that was placed on top of the mattress that my girlfriend and I shared. I sleep on the floor in a different sleeping bag. For the past five days that she's been here, our dog has been okay with my sister. This morning though, the dog became fixated on her, staring, and every time she moved on the bed, he growled. Finally, when she moved to get off the bed, he lunged at her and growled, at which point I grabbed him back. The interesting thing is that he listens to my sister's commands and accepts treats from her, but when she gets on the bed, he begins to growl and stare.

He was resource guarding in the past, but we made it clear within two days that it was unacceptable to do that (after he nipped me over a piece of rawhide). 

I can sit on the bed no problem, so I'm not sure what it is. What can I do to make the environment safer for me, my sister and the dog? I really don't want to have to board him.

TL;DR Dog is acting aggressively towards my little sister after girlfriend left for vacation.

EDIT: my sister is currently sharing the bed with the dog right now (cuddling with the him) and he seems fine.

UPDATE: I was also told to have my sister tell him to sit, then feed him his dinner. He sat just fine, but as soon as she put the food bowl down, he started growling, staring at her, and getting louder, At that point, I dragged him away. In all other aspects he's an amazing dog. I spoke to the dog trainer my gf used and she said that because we adopted him from the county shelter, and we've only had him for 2 months, at which point my gf left on vacation, he's anxious and my sister isn't my gf so he's trying to establish a pecking order. She works on positive reinforcement, but I am really not the greatest at that, and I really can't risk harming my sister. At the dog park where I take him, multiple people also suggested the pin down technique that appears to be universally derided in this thread, so I'm at a loss."

This one took place less than a decade ago, (2000's) when web conferencing or remote desktop's popularity was still starting to pick up. Our business was still growing and we hired co-op students/interns back then to fill in the tech support void. Our 2 offices were separated by a road, because leasing another office was the most feasible solution for our booming employee base. As such, we had two server rooms --- one for each building.

We had a task for our intern one day: to take some backup tapes out from the server room across the street. He may have done so begrudgingly, as he trundled along to the other office. I was doing some routine maintenance on the servers back then, and heard our IT manager wondering where our intern was after a little while. I did not mind it much, as we know our intern was a bit on the lazy side.

I was working on the servers across the street, and VNC'ed on one of them when I noticed something strange: one of our servers who had a monitor, keyboard, and mouse hooked up on a KVM switch was displaying porn sites on it. Since I was on VNC, I can see that the session is still being controlled by the user who was there locally. I motioned our manager to come see my screen and asked him what course of action we should take next as I let him drive on my workstation. He chuckled a bit, took control of the session, opened Notepad and typed 'Big Brother is watching you.' We saw the mouse cursor move to close the open windows in a panicked motion.

Nonetheless, when the newbie came back from his task, he was a little red-faced. We also replaced our mouse and keyboard for that KVM switch...

TL;DR: Intern gives ""sticky keys"" a whole new meaning."
1imnqo,15,2013-07-19,No insurance. 9+ hours in the ER with pain level between 7-9. Got a shot and a referral and sent home.,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1imnqo/no_insurance_9_hours_in_the_er_with_pain_level/,"About 6 weeks ago I was having swelling and extreme pain in my right cheek. I get in to see my dentist and he sent me to an oral surgeon. The oral surgeon took a better x-ray of my full face. He determines that I have a ""mass"" in my sinus chamber and gives me antibiotics and some pain meds and suggested I see my regular doctor. So off to the doctors office I go. At this time I had insurance, shitty as it was.

I get to see my MD and he takes face x-rays and sees the ""mass"" and decides that I need a CAT scan. The only way for that to be done (I couldn't afford the co-pay for a cat scan, $500.00) was to admit me in the hospital. My pain level was at 9 or better. The hospital puts me on a drip with IV antibiotics and morphine every 4 hours. The morphine wasn't doing much so they gave me percocet too. So now I was getting pain meds every 2 hours. I get the CAT scan and a ENT doctor (who I never laid eyes on) looked at it and said I had a severe sinus infection. The hospital MD that was assigned to me decided to release me with another round of oral antibiotics and pain meds.

Fast forward to now. I got off work around 9AM and was in severe pain. The infection was back with a vengeance. By this time I had a different job and no insurance. So now the only way to get treatment was go to the local charity hospital. I get there around 10:30AM and sit and sit. 8 1/2 hours and many complaints of not getting something for my pain later they finally see me. All this time I had been sitting in the ER in tears. I'm a man and have a high tolerance of pain, yet I'm in tears.

I comes the intern who looks all of 25, which I know he can't be, but he is still wet behind the ears. He seemed intimidated by me and apparently knew I had been complaining about not being seen. He consults the ER doctor after many questions and the poking and prodding that had nothing to do with my sinus problem. They decide to refer me to...an oral surgeon! They tell me I will get something for pain. This is after sitting in a treatment room for at least a half hour. I think finally I'll get some relief. I asked them to please make it a shot of *anything* since it would be faster acting. He said he wasn't sure what they would give me and left. He comes back and tells me that they will give me some pills and the referral. Naturally I got more upset that I wasn't getting any pain relief yet. He said it was the head ER doc's call. I said I wanted to see that doctor. She comes in with an attitude because I dared question her decision. I told her about how much pain I was in and demanded some relief. She said if I wanted a shot, fine, I'd get a shot.

In comes a nurse with a shot and my release paperwork. She gives me a shot of morphine. I then look over the paperwork she had and it was a release form and the referral. No script for pain meds! She told me that I'd have to take an over the counter med. I am Hep C and OTC pain meds aren't good for the liver and I had already been talking ibuprofen every four hours or so.

So all this time in the ER in severe pain and I get one shot and a referral and that's it. Now we all know what a zoo public hospital's ER's are. I'm a 53 year old male who chooses to wear his hair long. I saw people get called back for treatment who showed no outward signs of discomfort. My SO was talking with the lady beside her and she was in for elevated BP. **She** got called for treatment before me and had only been there for 3 hours. This same hospital treats inmates from local jails. At least 8 came and went while I was sitting there in pain. They had *no* wait times at all. 

I feel totally mistreated and think they thought I was there just to get some pain meds like I'm some kind of junkie. I don't think a junkie would sit there for that many hours just to get a fix. I will be contacting the state hospital system and see what can be done about this sort of thing. I'll probably not get anywhere with them, but this is far from over.

If this is the type of treatment we can look forward to when the PPACA is implemented and the system is burdened even further then we are all in a bad way."
1ilt3b,2,2013-07-18,I've led this guy on for far too long and I don't know how to stop without hurting him.,okcupidthrowaway8,OkCupid,https://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/1ilt3b/ive_led_this_guy_on_for_far_too_long_and_i_dont/,"I first met this guy on okcupid a few months ago and we talked on the site for approximately 6 weeks before meeting (he was away at college during this time so we couldn't meet earlier). We met, and we clicked, but I wasn't very attracted to him, it was the kind of thing where I thought I could look past it and be indifferent to it, and when he kissed me at the end of the date I was honestly pretty into him.

A few days after our first date, he was away again the entire next month doing an internship. We skyped almost everyday and we really got to know each other, to the point where he was talking about us being in a relationship. Over skype I was really into him, and when he got home after his month-long time away we saw each other again for our second date. Problem was, I was really NOT attracted to him this time and when he started making out with me at the end of it I tried to make myself like it but I was actually completely repulsed by it. I wanted to like it but I just couldn't... him and I click awesomely but I just have no interest in him like that. It's not that hes ugly, hes really not at all, I was just so not attracted to him after our second date (I don't know why my attraction to him changed so much over the last month but yeah).

Anyway, I've been away for the last 2 weeks on vacation so him and I have been talking on the phone. He seems to be really into me and keeps talking about how he wants me to be his girlfriend, and I keep trying to trick myself into liking him but I just can't seem to do it and I feel awful about it. I especially feel awful because he has confined in me a bunch of stuff he has never talked about with anyone else before and thinks he can trust me and believes I feel the same way about him that he feels about me (this is because of that month-long time when we skyped everyday when I was indifferent to my lack of attraction to him and thought I could get past it). He is truly a really sweet guy, the kind of guy I could see myself being close friends with for a very long time, but I just don't want anything physical with him and I especially don't want a relationship. I don't know how to break the news to him considering he's thought I've been into him for 4+ months now when I'm just not. I don't know how to tell him that I want to just be friends especially when he is going through some really hard times with his family and school and is really into me. I don't want to hurt him and I don't want him to hate me.. I feel awful about all of this and I wish I just liked him but I don't and I can't. Don't know what to do.. obviously I can't keep leading him on but I don't know how to get out of this situation and still make him happy because I care about him a lot but not in the way he wants. 

TL;DR: I'm a total jackass for leading this guy on that I care about immensely but only in a friend way. Don't know what to do without hurting him.. really need advice."

I'm 22 years old, going on my 5th year of college and I really wanted to take school and my life seriously for the first time (probably why I'm going on my 5th year...).  Here are some of the things I started doing.

* Running 5 days a week, 3-6 miles a day.  I was in CC in high school so this is something I've wanted to continue.
* Weight lifting 3 days a week.
* Eat A LOT healthier.  I used to live off Ramen Noodles and Roma Pizza every day.. Now I have cereal and a banana in the morning, a big healthy sandwich with lots of lettuce and tomatoes and onions with whole grain bread and an apple for lunch, and spinach, salad, and pasta at night for dinner.
* Normal sleep schedule.  8 hours of sleep every night, waking up at 8am for my 9-5 internship.

The thing is, even while doing all this, I still felt depressed and down all the time.  What's the reason?  I am still masturbating A LOT.  It's been a problem since I first started back in middle school and I've been struggling with it ever since.  I've always known that it was a problem, but I've always been able to find some excuse or reason to do it anyways.  

It's just so funny how I can keep telling myself how horrible being addicted to masturbation is yet I still time after time after time relapse and find myself right back where I started.  Well, enough is enough.  I'm finally taking a stand against my vice and this subreddit will be a huge support system for me.

Currently at the moment my gf and her family is bombarding me with nonsense such as I should take a job that pays around 8 to 10 bucks to gain income over time. Since it's taking forever for me to land a job being a graphic web / designer.

I graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Communication Design - My gf fails to understand that people with degrees in design require a stunning portfolio in order to land work.

The problem with me taking lower paying job is that I've had one in the past and was barely able to concentrate on design itself. Therefore, the quality of my school projects suffered. And in my final semester I dedicated 120% of my time to improve the quality of my work. Right now I just freelance, but I'm looking for something steady in my field.
I can't be assed with internships and volunteer work. (Done like 3-4 of those already before I graduated.)

I refuse to take lower paying jobs because in the end my skills will stagnate if I get too lazy or too comfortable. Especially from working 40 hours a week.

What should I do reddit? Take the lower paying job? or just keep fighting my way to my career job by improving my portfolio. Also my student loans is at 9k at the moment.

1ipwx1,4,2013-07-20,Last-minute Transfer from Texas,[deleted],NIU,https://www.reddit.com/r/NIU/comments/1ipwx1/lastminute_transfer_from_texas/,"Hey /r/NIU, I've just made a really poorly planned decision to come to NIU this fall.  That's not to say it a bad choice, but I just never expected to change my life direction this much over the course of 4 weeks.  

I guess I should explain what I mean.  I have been attending a two-year school in Texas and earned my AS in computer science last May.  I came to IL in June to complete my summer internship at Fermilab in Batavia with every intention of returning south to attend the University of Texas-Dallas in August.  However, the head of Fermilab's Particle Physics Division offered to keep me as a regular employee if I transferred to a school in the area.  He recommended NIU and UIC, so I decided on a whim to apply.  Unfortunately UIC's deadline for fall 2013 applications had passed, but NIU is still accepting them.  I filled everything out and got a decision in less than two weeks.

So, with the school year starting in about a month, I have A LOT of planning and arranging to do.  I need to secure housing, move my things from Texas, register for classes, actually visit the campus, meet people, etc.  I'm also facing out-of-state tuition with zero savings and no family assistance, so I'm thinking of selling my body (jk... I think).  To add more difficulty to this scenario, I don't have a car and don't have a driver's license (by choice - driving is scary!), so if anyone lives in the Batavia area and would be willing to help me get to Fermilab on the weekends, I would be eternally grateful.

I want a folding bike because I have barely any storage space, and I want to have the option of a multi-modal commute in case I want/need to take the bus, train, or subway.


I just need something that will comfortably make the four mile trip to my new workplace. I'll be an intern, actually, so my budget is limited. Not going to blab about my health problems here, but since I'll need to carry it up a few stairs now and again, every ounce lighter on the bike helps too.

I want the *lightest* reliable folding bike I can get for the least amount of money. $700 tops. If cycling works out for me, I figure I can upgrade down the line... when I have a job that pays more than minimum wage. :P


I've been strongly considering the [Dahon Speed Uno, $402](http://www.amazon.com/Dahon-Speed-Folding-Bike-Shadow/dp/B004YHZ9QK). Only 24.2 pounds! The thing is, I'd need to get a handbrake installed. That is a relatively easy, affordable thing any local bike shop could do, right? I realize that the handbrake adds some weight, but it'll be scary enough adapting to biking in traffic as is, I don't need to get the safety blanket of a handbrake taken away from me too!


The [Dahon Mariner, $599](http://www.amazon.com/Dahon-Mariner-Folding-Bike-Brushed/dp/B005RY1C7Y) is pricier and is 26 pounds, but has both handbrakes and gears ready to go. I learned to bike with gears, but the commute is rather flat, so I'm not sure how much to prioritize them?


The [Tern Link D8, $650](http://www.nycewheels.com/tern-folding-bike-link-d8.html) is even pricier and heavier at 26.6 pounds, but it seems to be touted as a really high quality, sturdy bike for the price. Is a Tern worth it?

My favorite thing to lust after is the [Dahon Jifo](http://dahon.com/mainnav/specials/dahon-jifo.html), but I'm not sure I can justify a $900 bike, and I think I'm correct in assuming that the bitty 16"" wheels would be more twitchy and troublesome on pothole-filled city roads? Yes? Somebody talk me down, because the tiny fold and 20 lb. weight sounds like a dream.


The [Dahon Curve](http://www.nycewheels.com/dahon-folding-bike-curve-d3.html) is a 16"" folder that appears more versatile than the Jifo, but at 25.4 pounds and $700, I wonder if I wouldn't be better off getting the cheaper Dahon Uno and putting some brakes on it.


Or am I just being a total nutcase about buying my first bike, and would be better off buying one of the 20 year old Dahons I always see pop up on Craigslist for $125ish?


Thanks for any thoughts, warnings, or suggestions you have, they'll be much appreciated!"
1ippg3,5,2013-07-20,Feeling desperately low today: how do I make sure a setback doesn't trigger depression?,Fireddown,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ippg3/feeling_desperately_low_today_how_do_i_make_sure/,"I have had depressive periods in the past, but I am generally better at coping with stress than I used to be. Today though, I feel lower than I have in a long time. I was fired the other day, for no reason other than they didn't want to pay anymore and so replaced me without warning with an unpaid intern. 

On top of that I'm feeling quite lonely and rejected by my friends. I'm in the middle of moving house (big stress) so I suggested a house warming party. Despite seeming interested originally, literally no one has even bothered to click yes to the event on FB (easiest way to give directions etc). Now I know this is a petty thing to be sad about, I'm not even that into Facebook but I just feel like, I'm not even worth a click? I feel like the whole world has rejected me. 

Now, I'm not currently depressed in the medical sense of course, a day or two of sadness over something is a whole different thing, I know that, but I'm worried that this could set it off again. My pattern was always that I would get very stressed and overwhelmed, and isolate myself from the world. I'd feel too anxious and overwhelmed to solve whatever small problems I had, so I would ignore it and get increasingly anxious and depressed until I couldn't get out of bed. 

I'm starting to feel the beginnings of this again. I have pretended that I'm ok with being fired but I'm so hurt by it. I feel humiliated, even though it was not my fault. Having to look for another job feels like an impossible task. Everything feels impossible. I feel like I don't want to talk to anyone or deal with the world ever again, it's too difficult. You can do everything right and the world will just slap you in the face. I'm in bed surrounded by half packed boxes and I just want to sleep in my messy cocoon forever.

I've been down this road before though and it doesn't go anywhere good. How do I motivate myself to go on? How do I nip this in the bud and make sure this is just a shitty couple of days rather than something bigger?"

So when i see all the hatred towards Palestinians on this page I'm confused did you not live side by side with them in peace until the Zionist movement? did they ( the ottoman empire) not protect Jews when the majority of the EU made them wear red hats and spat in their faces? , my great grand mother breast fed Moshe Dayan and my family had many jewsh friends and there was nothing wrong with that. now after the war has passed and such monstrosity's as the holocaust have accord and you have gained your own country after thousands of years of exile is it so much to ask that you not make racist comments towards your cousins  the sons of Haggard. the international community backs the 67 line, you can dispute this all day but its on the books and it is a fact. you say oh well we won the war! do you see the US taking Baghdad for them self's? 

why can Israel not stop obsessing with the idea of war with the Arabs and breeding hatred from when they are younger ( and i know Arabs do the same thing, but Israel gives them plenty of ammo to use as propaganda ).

Give back the land from the 67 green line INVEST in creating a society that strives and has hope and you will intern win the hearts and minds of the Palestinians and grand your self a more stable future free of war.... 

Do you really think there is any other option? lets be real here. how long do you think Israel can afford to be on the offensive? time is not in your favor.

and another note ..... as a Palestinian american and an Arab from a Muslim background. i feel another holocaust coming but thing time i think the genocide's victims will be the Arabs. you say some one is anti Semitic so easily when some one dare judge the Israelis, but when people call my race cockroaches and insects that are subhuman does any one yell anti arab?"

1ip9ji,17,2013-07-20,Hi everyone,[deleted],stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ip9ji/hi_everyone/,"I'm new here but I've been at this for a little bit now.

I'll try to keep my story short. Last year around April I moved out of my parents house, I was 20. I used to drink and party, and I would always try to get as drunk as possible when I would go to parties. This ended up with my blacking out a lot, I had been doing this since I was 17 years old.

I don't know why it was the final straw, but one particular night I black out and puked all over a co-worker's carpet, then woke up at 5 in the morning and just left. I was so embarrassed, I decided that was enough for me. In my mind I was absolutely out of control and could not handle alcohol. I wouldn't do this daily, just every or every other weekend. But I simply stopped anyways.

I've always had a penchant for exercise, so this went hand in hand with it. I went on for about seven months without a drop while training my body as hard as I could, I was never happier in my life. My confidence was through the roof.

I met a girl a work about 6 months in and we had a small fling. I've never had a relationship or been with any girl before so I got way too attached and it ended up not working out. I also had to move back into my parent's house. My 21st birthday was also approaching. So all that, coupled with having to see the girl that I failed with every single day at work, sent me into a downward spiral.

My 7 months meant nothing to me, I drank on weekends at bars, I bought bottles and drank on weekdays. I stopped exercising and all the work I put into my nutrition and body went to the shitter. I was so utterly depressed, I could barely function at work because I was just so down. I lost an extremely good female friend of mine over this(who I still don't talk to), and I was almost fired from my job. I thought I would never leave the funk.

Fast forward to the end of May, she left her internship and I never have to see her again. It left me a bit sad at first but I realized that I could never be happy seeing her. So when she was gone I finally felt like myself again. On the 1st of June I made the commitment to my body once more and now I am currently trying to re-gain my former glory."

Well, I am 2 and a half weeks in, and I am just starting to get sick of them.

I have never felt like this before. I am not an angsty teenager. I love my mom, I love my dad, I am fond of my brother....

The first week was okay. It was frustrating, but that was simply the beginning of the internship, and me not knowing what was going on and getting frustrated by that. But I was fine, grandparents-wise.

Now, after another two and a half weeks, I am no longer frustrated by work, but I find myself getting frustrated with my grandparents every time they do something or open their mouths. 

It is pretty much every thing that annoys the crap out of me. My grandma puts waaaaay too much butter on the pans or in the pots when she is cooking. Peas aren't supposed to be dripping in grease. When she is driving me to work or if we are walking somewhere, she constantly nitpicks other people. ""I wonder if she's ever even held a comb"", ""did you just see that man trip? God, get a hold of your feet"", ""Ew, that man is carrying a bag of dog-shit"" NO DUH. HE IS WALKING A DOG. I would be more worried if he wasn't carrying a poo-bag.

And stop touching me. God. I hate it when people touch me. In the morning on the ride to work, she'll randomly just stroke my chin. Holy fuck that pisses me off. Personal bubble. Respect it.

And then my ""grandpa"" (He's not my grandfather, they just got married a couple years ago) is just a lazy ass. He is retired. He does practically nothing all day, and yet we get home and have to make supper after a full day of work. Also, you don't have to rinse every single thing before putting it in the dishwasher. That's what a dishwasher does. It washes dishes. Let it do it's job.

And please just shut the hell up when watching TV. Oh my god. I wait until you guys are done watching your shows before I ask to watch mine. Know why? Because I pay attention to the things I watch. This is my hobby. I dissect the shows. I find the themes. I practically write a fricken thematic text in my head. But I can't do that when you talk about football the entire time.

It seems like every time they say something, in my head I respond ""No shit.""

I hate having this attitude, but I can't help it. Nothing has ever frustrated me as much as living with them. And it's such a bunch of little nit-picky things. God, I hate this. I just wish I had chosen to live in residence as opposed to living with them, because this is seriously impacting how I feel towards them."

So far. 


When someone in the past would ask me a question I would usually give a short answer. That was usually boring and never led to much more conversation, I guess you could say I was uncomfortable with the attention of talking, afraid that I would say something stupid or hurtful.

Now? 

I have had a few conversations (complete strangers, I just got to NYC and am here by myself looking for intern work in recording studios) over the last week, someone would ask me a question and then I'd just launch into it. Half way though I'd catch myself.""look, they are hanging on every word.... I have their attention &amp; I'm no scared and I'm going to finish this story""

For me this is a huge deal. I have carried a massive amount of fear through my life. Now, I'm making calls to strangers asking them for things, meeting them..... Impressing them, and as of today I have gotten what I want, my internship.

I start tomorrow, now I can impress the hell out of them and get the job I'm after. 

Thank you people of nofap, you have been an inspiration to me.... 


If anyone reading this has any doubts about doing it, don't.  You can do it. I know it is scary when you begin but you can absolutely do it and benefit yourself and you primary relationship."

I was having probably the best college semester of my life. Was getting good grades, starting to get involved with a girl, and making great memories with friends. Then an unfortunate event took place which was completely out of my control involving our Fraternity being suspended from campus (I am not a typical frat guy, although my friends are). The girl I was getting to know stopped talking to me after this which lead to a fall in my grades and overall a depressing end to senior year of college. I credit my fraternity to a lot of my success in college such as opening up opportunities to meet girls and friends through parties or on campus events. We have not lost our charter yet but things are not looking good. Luckily for me I did an internship a few semesters ago (full time at the ESPN headquarters in CT) and I still have a semester of classes to make up before I graduate. I was depressed for a lot of the summer about how something going so good could take such a dramatic turn and I could do nothing about it. Then I realized I am on a college campus with 20,000 other kids my age for one more semester majority of which are not in Fraternities and still manage to sustain great experiences.  There are 10,000 girls walking around campus everyday that I can open my mouth to speak to and maybe start something with but everybody just simply does not. To all Redditors how did you live out your last semester of college before the real world? No matter what school you go to college means the same thing to all of us and I would love some insight how to make the best of this bad situation and go out on top with a memorable last semester. "

&gt; * You get paid way more in the states than you do in Vancouver. Then again, all jobs in Vancouver have shitty pay.

&gt; * The pay is almost 40-50% less than the states and will never match what they have. But it does raise fairly quickly if your good. Starting you can expect 40-50k, but after 5 years or so, you can easily hit 75k or so. In the states, you start from 60-70 and go into 6 figure easily. From my friends' experience, there's an abundance of poorly paid contract jobs here in Vancouver, so I'm surprised to hear about the generous benefits. Contracts have no benefits at all.

&gt; * One particular company I can think of pays its CS devs roughly 40k as a co-op, but that doesn't go up by much once you're out of school and working for them as an intern. Full-timers get paid around 60k+, sure, but that's nothing if you're comparing to the states. If you're talking about the big silicon valley giants, you'll be making 60k as a co-op/intern and I have a few friends making 100k+ once they went back to the company full-time which apparently isn't hard as long as you don't fuck up. One took a pay cut when he requested to work out of the Vancouver office (it's hard to beat living in this city).

&gt;* From friends that work in the industry, all CS graduates. One in particular has 2 years worth of co-op and just got out of a 1-year contract paying 60k. He had offers from 4 different companies, all of them refused to match and would only offer 40-45k. He's now a dev at a consultant company making a little less than 50k.

Locals, *please* tell me it's not as bad as it looks, because if it is, I may very well leave this town after graduation."

Who you are: recent graduate (or anyone) interested in an internship with a Santa Monica-based app development startup. You have two hands, the ability to get to our office, a brain (and the capacity to use it...though if you're on Reddit that answered that question), and an interest in app development, smartphones, and general technology.

Who we are: said development firm with one app on the market and working on that and a second new app. We're closing a round of funding by the end of the month and are making several key hires, including more developers.

Who I am: the project manager, who also is the IT, HR, Product Manager, Customer Support Center, Social Media Manager, Quality Assurance Lead, and Analytics Analyst.

Please let me first of all apologise for not getting this thanks post out sooner, please don't think it a sign of lack of appreciation, that is not at all the case. 

I've been thinking long and hard about what sort of thanks post I could create that would do your incredibly generous gift justice. The problem was, nothing at all seemed adequate. How could I do just my normal approach of happy/enthusiastic/silly drawings or photos? 

Now, weirdly this almost goes against my attitude to receiving gifts. I feel very much that regardless of what gift somebody has kindly chosen to give me, I am phenomenally appreciative regardless - I try to therefore put equal effort into all thanks posts (where possible with time available etc.) 

That said, when this mystery, surprise package arrived one morning. Honestly, it was an absolutely mind-blowingly wonderful surprise! I was so utterly shocked and excited I was speechless for a good half an hour, I didn't know what to do with myself!

In fact, the comment next to it on my WL was even ""Absolute dream to get this at some point."" I had thought of asking for it as a birthday/Christmas present from my family and so kept it there to remind me, I certainly wasn't able to get it for myself any time soon and not for a minute did I ever expect to receive it as a gift from anyone on raoa!

(Opps, side note, anyone wondering [this](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-Ultrathin-Keyboard-iPad-Mini/dp/B00BARWIL6/ref=wl_it_dp_o_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=OX3CQGWM8ZEY&amp;coliid=IBZIZ2KFWUUYR) is what 'M' gifted me!) 

Genuinely, not only have you made me wonderfully happy with this amazing gift (honestly, what on earth did I do to deserve this? Whatever it was, I hope I keep doing it!), *but* you have absolutely without a doubt made a big change to my daily life for certainly the next two years. 

I'll be able to travel, go to work at my internship starting end of August and then to lectures in my last year of uni 2014/15, all while being able to type documents, emails, take notes *insanely* more easily. It will make a phenomenal difference not having to lug my laptop around, it hurts my back to carry it for ages! My little iPad mini is fabulous, but my little hands are not little enough to touch type on the on-screen keyboard which had made it not as helpful... Until *now* that is! :D :D

Anyway.. I'm rambling. Writing a short thank you letter felt like the best way to properly articulate my enormous appreciation and absolute delight at your gift. **Thank you so very much**. I only wish I knew who you were so I could thank you more directly!

With lots and lots of love and many thanks &lt;3

My parents are still alive, and this book is not to lash out, but to educate. Also, I don't want to be known as the guy you will read about. Circumstances had me doing things I am ashamed of. I am a very good person, and timid. Fifteen minutes of Fame would honestly kill me. 

 I have reasons I need to write this book. I need to get out my story, in my words. There is a lot of residual shit I deal with daily. I am too dissociated to assemble, and outline. I don't write well, though I am smart. Also, to (shameless) make some money. I am way below the poverty line at 12K a year.

 I hope to make enough money to get the proper treatment for the mental illnesses I was left with (if my story is worthy, or interesting). I have PTSD, Agoraphobia, post-institutionalization and a Borderline Personality. You can imagine this comes with depression, raw anger, and anxiety in my everyday life. I am not looking to get rich. Crazy as it sounds, I'd like to have at least one person cry for me. Sounds emo, and trite, but it is not. I get empathy, but there is a little boy in pain. That little boy needs to be validated. I need someone (who knows all the details) to say, ""Wow that does suck, and you were robbed. What are you going to do now""?

 I am in middle age, and I am so sick of being on Disability. I am grateful our Country gives people who have worked insurance, SSDI. It isn't much. I maximize it. Problem is I had a heart attack this year. I fear my time is running out. I need better in my life.

 I want the rest of my years to not live in the ghetto, forced there because of my low income. My Mom is poor. My Dad is not, and helps. If I were my parent though, I'd realized the damage I've done, and give my child some funds to help. That could be the truth, or my mental illness talking. To covet is a problem for me. This is reality, and the world owes me nothing. My parents in reality, could give two shits, and not have any guilt. Idk. They've moved on, I never did. If there is a way out of this fucking place, I've got to do it. Me. The Fuck-up.
 
Not that easy for a guy like me. I need treatment. If it were as easy as ""get the fuck over it"", it would have been done. I was a POW, but as a child, in my own home. I need a safe environment. I need to exceed my baseline. That takes more money than I'll ever have. The people I see now, are in a clinic for people of low income. They are understandably overbooked, but under talented (interns). 

 Once I have had some education of this outside world, I hope to work, date, have sex, drive again, be better off financially (spending $10 is like an average guy spending $100), and sleep through a night peacefully. The American Dream, or at least mine. It is hard to still have the mind of a teenager, while my friends grew up, got married, and some even have kids. I feel left behind. I feel powerless over many parts of my life. 

 I am able to live life without too much help. Of course, I can read. I am diligent with bills. I keep my 400sq. ft. apt very clean. I keep myself tidy. I have two cats I rescued, that keep me getting up every day (less likely do do stupid shit when you have lives to be responsible for). I am an excellent owner, and provide for them. Thing is, I hardly venture out. I can go days without talking to one soul (except perhaps the internet, like now). It's normal for me, as I'd been neglected. Normal does not mean I don't secretly yearn for meaningful human interaction. I do. 

So, there you go. I mean like, would you want to read it?"

I could be potentially getting an internship with a university I had originally applied to study computer science with. 

I was wondering what sort of skills and whatnot would be important to put down, as someone with no experience doing sysadmin work. I've finished CompTIA A+, finishing Network+ next month (feeling confident about that at least), and I'll probably continue down the certs line. 

I can go through the info in the sidebar, particularly the power level stuff, but I'd like to know what some of you ( particularly the younger sysadmins who just got their foot in the door, are in internships, can relate to my scenario etc ) have found the to be the most beneficial and sought after skills you have brought to your employer, as a day 1 mentored n00b.

I'm hammering into Zed A. Shaw's (the absolute legend from Learn Code The Hard Way)  CMD Line Crash Course [Powershell]. 

I have a particular interest in privacy and security. I like to keep up to date on privacy tools at least, and loved the bolstering interest that Snowden brought with his revelations.

Essentially, my question is ""What is the most relevant information I can give them, as a newb, and how can I present myself in the best light?"" 

Also, it'd be real damn cool if some IT HR/ Hiring Managers could throw their two cents in. In this hypothetical scenario, you can potentially hire a sysadmin intern which your business makes money from because of government schemes etc. (cost isn't an issue with them, essentially). What **exactly** are you looking for in them? What are the key words you'd look for in their cover letter and CV, from someone with no experience and a few certs? 

Thanks in advance. I would have asked in the IRC channel, but it just seems like too much info for that sort of thing. "
1irbo8,2,2013-07-21,"Tired of being alive, too scared to kill myself",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1irbo8/tired_of_being_alive_too_scared_to_kill_myself/,"A short preamble to begin:
I am a 17 y.o. high school senior and college app season is stressful. I am aware of that.
I am volunteering at some organization during the days. I hate volunteering and I hate the people with whom I will have to deal. I am aware that this too is stressful.

I'm not sure how to organize this, so I'll just go:

Physical pain
     After a weight-lifting accident 2 years ago, I though that I had broken my back/shoulder/leg, so I went to see my doctor. He opened a binder and ran me through some tests, measured a few things, and, to my great surprise, told me that everything was fine, and that if I wanted to lift weights, there was no reason not to do so. 
     So after that, even though it hurt like hell, I lifted again, and again felt like I broke something. I continued to lift for a month or so until I could bear it no more and went to see my doctor again, and he gave me the same tests/response. 
     Because of this, I have had back/shoulder/leg pain for about two years and I have no way to ameliorate my situation. As far as I can tell, I won't ever get this fixed and I'll have to live with this pain for the rest of my life because doctors these days are too scared of malpractice charges to give any diagnoses. So that's part 1.

   Part 2 is that about a year ago, my orthodontist fucked up an adjustment on my braces and one of my teeth has been extremely painful ever since then. During my next appointment, I told them about it, and they said that there was nothing wrong and that it should go away in time (it hasn't), and my dentist would be better suited to diagnose the pain.
     So I went to see my dentist and he ran a bunch of tests to see what triggered the pain and what didn't. After completing the last test, he told me that he was not sure what was causing my pain and that if it doesn't get better in time, I should see him again. And about a month later, I went to see him again; he ran a bunch of tests (some same, some different) and again told me that he was not sure what was causing my pain. 
     I have had this pain for a year and again have no options to ameliorate this situation. Again, I doubt anyone will ever help me because they are scared of malpractice. And what sucks even more about this one is that my parents have had to pay (grudgingly) several thousand dollars to get my teeth straightened and to diagnose the pain and all to no avail. They think that I'm faking and they don't trust me with almost anything anymore. They constantly bring this up whenever I want to buy anything.



insomnia
     It takes ages for me to fall asleep. Before I took sleeping pills, I spent 3-5 hours every night tossing and turning before I fell asleep. Now that I take sleeping pills, I spend maybe 1 hours every night tossing and turning, but this is getting longer and I fear that I may be developing a tolerance to the pills. 



Education
     I hate school. My GPA, SATs, Class choices have been alright but I doubt I will get into any good colleges because I have terrible ECs. I haven't done research, I haven't had an internship, I haven't had a job, and I haven't made a philanthropic contribution to the world (travel to Africa for example). Pretty much everything that I do to get into a good college, I hate. (not saying that I spend most of my time doing useful things, just saying that of the useful things that I do, I hate most). For example, the aforementioned volunteering is just doing tons of trivial jobs with a bunch of people who are rude, racist, and vain.
     My parents have always stated that if I get into a top college, they'd be willing to help me pay for college, but I'll probably only get into a state school so I'll probably have to take loans and get a job for college (especially after the dental incident, they've been especially stringent about helping me to pay with college).



life
     But apart from that, I'm still pretty sure that the rest of my life will be boring and meaningless. As I see it, I'll go to a state school (I have absolutely no idea what I'll major in), get a mindless job doing gruntwork for bosses who treat me like crap, pay my debt, buy a apartment and car, retire and die. So in the long run, I see no point in living.
     In the short term, nothing is fun anymore. Whenever I play video games, I get headaches. I can't (or can barely) exercise because of the aforementioned pain, and I have had no friends pretty much since elementary school because no one has similar interest as those that I have (because I have pretty much no interests). Watching videos/movies is only enjoyable for short periods of time (~10-20 mins) so usually, I just spend my free time playing video games. 


My parents won't take me to see anything that is not covered by insurance. So I have 1 doctor, and 1 dentist to see. (the orthodontist was completely out of pocket and hence extremely expensive). Psychologist, Physios, and any other health care professional is pretty much out of the question. They don't trust me anyways.

   I don't really care about Ivy league school or any of that shit, but my parents would disown me and send me into foster care if they thought that I stopped ""trying"" to get into a good school. My deadbeat volunteering labor is a part of this so I can't quit that. Also, in the past I have told them about being unhappy and wanting to kill myself and they told me to ""stop making excuses and study harder."" However, as much of assholes as my parents are, I think foster care would be worse. 

   I don't even know how I would being just ""going out"" and doing something. I don't have a car or a license. No friend who are willing to drive me places.

So pretty much I hate my life. This isn't something that I've felt in response to the recent stresses of college apps and volunteering (at least not completely). I've felt this way for a long time and actually seen my school psychologist for it, but my school psychologist is just some psychology student who is forced to spend time patients before he is allowed to practice by himself. He just gave me generic advice and didn't promise any privacy so I stopped seeing him.
      Sometimes I think about blowing off my senior year and just trying to find something fun to do, and killing myself at the end of the next summer so I don't have to go to / pay for college. I have no idea what I'm doing and the only thing stopping me from killing myself is that I'm too scared to kill myself.

What do I do from here?

My mothers family loved him especially my grandfather. They became good friends when I was a baby and remained close for years. The problem is my father is a high functioning alcoholic. It has never affected his job as a lawyer but it has destroyed his relationship with his family. He is the most verbally abusive person I've ever met. I honestly think he would have become physically abusive except for the fact I have been larger than him since I was 12. I can't tell you how many nights my mother has cried herself to sleep because of things he has said or done.

It's been getting worse the past few years. His body is failing and it takes less for him to get drunk. As his children (my sister, brother and I) get older he has gotten only worse to us. He has threatened to kick my sister out because she talks back to him. My mother has refused divorce him because we cannot survive without his income. My mother was a divorce lawyer for 20 years and when we where kids she worried about him getting visitation. Now that we are older and in college she worries about our college tuition. 

My sister is 22, my brother is 17, and I'm 20. Apparently after 21 he is not responsible for child support and won't need to split my college costs. We had planned on keeping him around until my brother turned 21 and graduated college. Last night he forced our hand.

Since I didn't have a proper father my grandfather stepped in. He raised me, took me to my sporting events, talked to me about how to be a man, called me every day so we could talk. I loved him more than life itself. He died 2 weeks ago and I was devistated. He asked me to take care of of his car after he died. Its 18 years old and he wanted me to have it since we have such a history together. 

Last night while I was at work my father decided to visit my grandfathers grave. He went into my room and looked through my things until he found my set of keys then took my grandfathers car. We don't exactly know what happened but it ended with him driving into a building and getting arrested for DUI. We think he got upset at my grandfathers grave and got drunk then tried to drive home. 

I don't want him living in my house anymore. I cannot stand the sight of him and I truly don't ever want to speak to him again. I was forgiving of his alcoholism because he is my father. I cannot ignore what he has done anymore. He stole my car, he put my families future in danger, and put my mother through hell. 

Here's the issue; we need him. My mother makes a good amount of money but we cannot afford our house without his help, I cannot afford my college without his help, my sister cannot afford her internship in Chicago without his help. We need his money but I can't stand him anymore. I don't know what to do.

I'm going to be a college senior in the fall and I'm currently interning over the summer at a company. At this company, they will let us interview for returning full-time positions at the end of our internship, which I've done. I haven't gotten the offer yet, but feel like I have a pretty good shot at it. The job would be in the field I want, and I'd be getting around a 90k/yr salary.

My question is, how do I figure out if this is the right company for me? I really have a lot of other options so I'm allowed to be picky (I'm 100% sure I will get other job offers later in the year, and if I don't get any I like, I'm just going to go get my master's). Sorry if that sounds arrogant, but I'm one of the best candidates at a great school with a highly in-demand major.

My main concerns are working hours. The story I hear from others is kind of inconsistent. Some people seem to work 80 hour weeks non-stop, others seem to usually work a more normal 40-50 hour week. I have no desire whatsoever to work 80 hour weeks consistently. Occasionally would be fine, but not all the time. I don't care about the pay as long as I'm getting a ""good"" salary for my major (i.e. I wouldn't mind being paid much less than this company offers).

My concern is with the inconsistency. It seems to really vary depending on the team and manager you are hired on. I'm also not sure if I'm ""allowed"" to ask what the expected working hours are? If I ask will they just think I'm lazy/don't want to work? How do I find out this info without them dropping me from consideration..."

So I know if you read the title and saw ""high school"", you would've automatically thought ""oh this again"", and to be honest, I understand that this relationship isn't going to last deep into my life either, but I feel so conflicted and I don't know what to think. 

Our back story is that we go to school in a private boarding school on the Florida. My SO and I have been dating for around 8 months, and we have currently been ""long-distance""-ing it since I'm overseas visiting family and at an internship. 

Anyways, our relationship was really good, and we were ""in love"". She was very and still is very in love with me, and when the year ended, she was very upset and spent a lot of time crying. Since the summer began, I have been overseas w/ a time difference and been talking to my SO through Skype and phone calls. Besides her, I can not recall talking to a single other person my age (I have talked to co-workers and friends of my brother that are older than me). It has been roughly 2 months now and I have been talking to her every single day. 

My problem is that, since a month ago, I have just kept on thinking/imaging what it would be like to meet other girls at where I'm at. I can't help but see the occasional pretty girl and think what-if I went over to talk to her. I went to one of my friends parties the other day (my first interaction w/ people my age) and I had a good time but didn't do anything. However, I can't shake this feeling of getting ""bored"" and I was constantly thinking about what if I just got to know some of the people there better.

I know my relationship won't go past the college stage, if even the high school stage. My SO has had a previous history of abusive boyfriends and she holds me very close to her heart, and after 5 months maybe, she started talking about maybe going to school in the same city (I want to go to USC) and maybe even living together. She has mentioned marriage as well, but I keep telling her that she should know that's ridiculous and you'll never know what will happen in years time. She says she still wants to hope.

I really care about this girl, as I've known her for a long time and would be heartbroken to see her sad. I know that the longest our relationship will go is probably until college, but I can't help but feel like maybe how I'm feeling is a sign. I'm not sure if I'm ""falling out of love"" or I'm just plain lonely over here. I know that I really do and will always care about her, even if I don't love her anymore, but I never thought I would feel like this so early.

Two weeks ago I started my internship and since then I'm using Linux on my laptop (firstly Ubuntu, then moved to Mint as it was more Windows-like).  
  
Yesterday decided to remove Windows from my desktop (completely) and install Mint 15. Well I love it, some things feel better. But I really miss Photoshop and will miss Word when I need it.  
  
What's the best/easiest way of running Photoshop now? By using Wine, Virtual Machine, Dual booting Windows or removing Linux and returning to Win.  
  
Wine sounds like a cool idea (if it won't be too slow), but I have troubles using it. Do I need the Photoshop CD to install it or?

  
And can I dual boot Win7 from Mint, or I have to remove Mint, install Windows and then dual boot Mint?  
  
Thank you!

1ir2se,1,2013-07-21,It's his birthday today and it's almost been a month... starting to see that it gets better [21F],xyggz1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ir2se/its_his_birthday_today_and_its_almost_been_a/,"Back story: Me 21,F Him: 21,M. Dated a year and a half. Both of our first serious committed relationships. Were best friends for four years beforehand. The relationship was great for the first 8-9 months but things started to get rocky around the one year mark - a lot of contempt, fighting over just about anything, both of us in stressful situations, I had a real problem with his weed smoking, etc. We were going through the motions of the relationship ending for the last six months, but neither of us was quite ready to relinquish the comfort and stability. Then we find out he's got an internship requiring him to leave for four months and it forces our hand on something a long time coming.

How I've been dealing:
Not so great at all. I had trouble with no contact at first - but eventually stopped texting him just because he was so unresponsive (as he should be). It took me a while to accept that I couldn't go to him for comfort anymore. 

It feels weird losing contact with him completely after almost six years of being so close. Even before dating we were such close friends - it feels like a part of me is missing without him in my life. I know we were wrong together and I know this is the right thing but it's still hard. I had never felt love like this before him and when we were at our happiest we both deluded ourselves into thinking this was going to last forever. Everyone says it's so cool that we were best friends that started dating, but now I feel I never want to date a friend ever again. Because the loss is doubled. I haven't just lost my significant other, I've lost a close, close friend. 

But it's starting to get better. I realize more and more that it is not him specifically that I miss but the comfort of the relationship. I realize that at the ugly rate things were going, this internship was a blessing in that it broke us up before we hated each other. 

The other day I started to write out a list of reasons we would never work if we got back together and it absolutely floored me how long it was. I was at 4 pages when I stopped, and not because I was out of things to say. We just weren't working anymore. We were unhappy. 

Today is his birthday, and to add to that, I dreamt about him last night. The dream was like any other time he'd stayed over and had to get up in the morning before me. I was groggy, looked over to him and reached my arms out for him and we just hugged for what felt like an infinite amount of time in dreamworld. The combination of the fact that his birthday last year was one of our more romantic memories, and this dream in which he was giving me this comfort should have made me not want to get out of bed this morning, but I woke up, and I was okay.

I am finally accepting this is over. There is no longer a future there. And more than that, I am starting to feel optimistic. Yes, I'm sad now, but I think it's a good thing. The fact that I'm sad means I really loved him and I look forward to loving someone new one day, someone who is right for me. 

**TLDR** Life doesn't have to stop because it's over, and I'm starting to feel like I will be okay. The feeling is just too welcome.

edit: I realize there isn't a question in the post. My friends aren't really great to talk to about this stuff so I wanted to get it all out somewhere! **I guess what I would like to hear about is how others have dealt with their first big breakup?**"

I hate it and feel that I'm really falling behind my peers in the professional aspect. It's really difficult to get internships of this caliber, if one is not living in the USA.

The part that saddens me however, is my fathers response. Many lectures were to be had and the eventual conclusion to them all was ""tough luck. I work here, and don't feel like moving. You want this? do it yourself."" 

I'm not deluded enough to think that I can support myself at my current age, so that pretty much shuts off that avenue of doing things. I *really* want to do more. I love working, and I love talking with people that share my passions, but for now, all of those people are in the USA.

You see, none of this would be a problem, if I didn't want to go to a top-tier college and to a top tier job. But I do, not just for money, but for the chance to have some really intellectually stimulating conversation with some very smart people. I could just sit on my haunches and bide my time, but the chances of me getting what I want become less with each passing day, as I cannot accept opportunities that I would otherwise like to, putting me behind the curve, when I think I can be ahead of it.

I have been trying to figure out what to do for a long time now and I haven't made much progress. I'll be going into my senior year and will graduate with 136 credits by spring 2014. I plan on being eligible for the CPA by the end of a fifth year but my issue is how should I go about getting the remaining 14 credits? 

I know that I don't want to go for a masters in accounting. While I can see how it would be great (especially for tax, I am interested in audit though), it just wouldn't be something I could happily commit to and I don't see myself staying in accounting for too long. 

An MBA and community college have been the options that I have given the most consideration. An MBA just seems like it would cost too much and take too much time. While community college would save a lot of money and time. 

I was thinking that I could look for an internship in the summer of next year, take a semester or quarter to get the necessary credits, and then start full-time come January. Would this be a worthwhile option? I am not very familiar with full-time positions offered in the winter, would that be possible?

Thanks in advance for any help or advice!

1iq2ql,3,2013-07-20,"What's the next Snowden-like crisis of confidence- Is this one? (Not secrecy related, healthcare related)",christ0ph,snowden,https://www.reddit.com/r/snowden/comments/1iq2ql/whats_the_next_snowdenlike_crisis_of_confidence/,"**Is Obama Care Setting Itself Up To Be ""A One Way Street To Privatization"" With No Available Other Options Should it Fail?**

My reading of the GATS indicates that may be the case. So, in that case, **Obama-care could never have been a step on the road to single payer, instead, it appears to have been from the beginning, a stealth strategy to block single payer far into the future, even should both the Democrats and Republicans be ousted from office.**

Definitions of Investor State:

 - [Investor-State Attacks on the Public Interest](http://www.citizen.org/Page.aspx?pid=5329) (Public Citizen)

 -  [Investor-State Dispute Resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor-state_dispute_settlement) (Wikipedia)

A week or two ago, there was an obscure article in the New York Times [British Company Is Awarded Contract to Administer Health Rollout](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/05/health/british-company-is-awarded-contract-to-administer-health-rollout.htm) A British company, Serco, (along with several other companies, one of which is Snowden's old employer) have been awarded a contract to administer Obama-care. Here is my fear. 

As far as I know, getting any *foreign firm* involved in a service sector, makes Obamacare ""world trade"" and as such, covered by the WTO Services Agreement (GATS) and therefore vendors would get an IRREVERSIBLE entitlement to remain in this market, forever.  It Triggers provisions in GATS which create an irerversible entitlement.

This danger was best detailed in the most detail in a 2009 article at Int J Health Serv. 2009;39(2):363-87. entitled:  **[The potential impact of the World Trade Organization's general agreement on trade in services on health system reform and regulation in the United States](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19492630).** by PNHP and Citizen.org intern Nick Skala  (now deceased)

~~Northwestern University School of Law, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.n-skala@law.northwestern.edu~~ (Nick Skala is now deceased)

Abstract:  ""The collapse of the World Trade Organization's (WTO) Doha Round of talks without achieving new health services liberalization presents an important opportunity to evaluate the wisdom of granting further concessions to international investors in the health sector. The continuing deterioration of the U.S. health system and the primacy of reform as an issue in the 2008 presidential campaign make clear the need for a full range of policy options for addressing the national health crisis. **Yet few commentators or policymakers realize that existing WTO health care commitments may already significantly constrain domestic policy options. This article illustrates these constraints through an evaluation of the potential effects of current WTO law and jurisprudence on the implementation of a single-payer national health insurance system in the United States, proposed incremental national and state health system reforms, the privatization of Medicare, and other prominent health system issues. The author concludes with some recommendations to the U.S. Trade Representative to suspend existing liberalization commitments in the health sector and to interpret current and future international trade treaties in a manner consistent with civilized notions of health care as a universal human right.**""

In order to see what mechanism would prevent the US from switching to a public healthcare system if Obamacare should fail, after opening the healthcare insurance financial service sector to globalization, irreversibly, people should look at what happened when the US tried to withdraw from the online gambling market. We were sued under the investor-state provisions of the GATS in WTO court by Antigua, a tiny state in the Caribbean. We lost that dispute and have to pay an enormous penalty. That dispute serves as a reminder that these free trade agreements have teeth. 

**It may already be too late**, but anyway. I think some serious media attention needs to be focused on this issue to avoid disastrous consequences for Americans in terms of health care options and affordability, even if we were to completely replace all the politicians in Washington, these changes would be impossible to change as the WTO overrides local laws..

[Proof that European nations have requested the ability to sell one insurance across state lines](http://www.citizen.org/documents/usa.pdf) (another way by which they could enter the US insurance market and thus gain an entitlement to stay forever blocking single payer. In order to work, saving money, single payer needs to be the (only) single payer, which would require the ending of that market access - that would be required to save money - See what happened [in a similar situation in Canada with similar provisions](http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/lwp/nafta.pdf) in NAFTA- (see Page 9)

Here is the thing - i work in a lab with two grad students and a PHD. The PHd seems to be very close with my advisor (also supervisor of the lab). My advisor herself is 30+ but below 40 ,has 2 very young kids and was hired as assistant professor in 2011.

The PHd guy lives near her home and does all personal work for my adviser. Like he goes and moves her stuff  when she is changing homes,she brings kids to lab when her husband is not there and he babysits them. He also helped her husband mow his lawn and gives her greeting cards at  9AM in her office ,when it is her birthday. 

Now ,me and other grads in lab don't like this behavior of his . I always thought if we like someone ,we should  help them professionally by spending more time on their projects so that they are more successful.

She is a new prof. and gets very less funding ,so she initially approaches sponsors and offers them to develop products voluntarily. We always have done exceptional work -sometimes spending multiple nights in lab and this has resulted in her getting more funding from them.

So far we 3 grad students  have got her 4 projects purely based on the work we did . The Phd guy is working on project which is funded by college .But whenever we screw up things or deliver anything late by 1-2 days , we get scathing emails from her but this guy always seems to get a free pass when he does the same. 
He is almost 2.5 years into program ,has published 1 journal paper in some shit journal( not ieee or acm , some recently launched journal in singapore),hasnt written his proposal yet but my advisor seems ok with that. 

Whenever we ask advisor to recommend us to internships to our sponsors ,she says we should first ask ourselves .But my advisor gleefully recommended this phd guy to her previous employer( a large corporate) without any qualms.

What is the best way to deal with this situation,which is turning out to be really depressing?

I just joined as intern for a company to make their mobile app. My main task is to design an app for a shopping/search website (need to start immediately) and it's my responsibility to outline the pros and cons of using each of the technologies mentioned, and finally decide which one to use. It'll be just added benefit that the app can work on other mobile platforms.

So, my main problem with native app dev is that I have no experience with Java and will need to learn it from scratch. However, I am familiar with C++, Python, HTML, and CSS. I am willing to learn Javascript if that is what it takes to make an app. But what I need right now is a quick solution (a total app I can design myself in a month or less of work). The app I need to make will just include basic functionalities but since it is for a to-be-major app, I need it to look absolutely perfect with an awesome UI.

The largest factor I'm trying to take into consideration is internship availability, recruiting on campus from companies, how helpful the career/internship centers actually are, alumnus connections, and if co-ops are easily available.

I'm probably going to be chemE, with a fair amount of programming under my belt. Assuming I keep adequate grades, and care about my activities, how helpful is UNM with setting students up with co ops and internships?

I'm really excited and happy for our marriage and our wedding.

But it's brought up some issues in my life as well.  Mostly that I don't have any friends I can invite to our wedding.

I had friends that I ate lunch with in high school and I was in band so that helped.  But I was always that person everyone was fine with, but that was about it.  Basically, my 'first tier' friends had me in their second or third tier, if that makes sense.  I still talk to them occasionally on facebook and have visited once or twice in the past 6 years but we're not terribly close.

College was not a fantastic time to make friends for me because I moved every 4 months (co-ops and internships) and I also worked two jobs while going to school full-time.  I hung out with people in classes and at work, but they never quite made it over the threshold of friend.

Now in grad school, I'm just not very comfortable with my classmates, and they're not terribly comfortable with me.  Basically, I'm in engineering and female.  Most men lose interest when they learn I'm taken (and I'm the only female in any of my classes or my lab).  Additionally, the majority of students are foreign and talk to each other in languages I don't understand when not forced to speak in English.

So, basically, tons of excuses.  I get along fine with my SO's friends, but they're his friends, not mine.  I am very close with my family (mostly my mom and my brothers).

But it's just hard.  Objectively, I know there's nothing too objectionable about me and I know I should have tried harder to make friends but it still stings.  And I feel like even if I would invite those couple high school friends I keep in touch with, they'd find it odd because we're having such a small wedding (50 people, max - likely around 30) that they're invited even though they're 'not that close'.

Sorry, I just wanted to get that out.  It really is the only thing about the wedding I'm remotely sad about.  We've already agreed to no wedding party but it feels like the majority of people that will be there are for him.  And it's difficult."
1iu2jf,2,2013-07-22,"[28M] My fiancée [27F] has brought our ""open relationship"" into our bedroom and I hate it.",mcjewel,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1iu2jf/28m_my_fiancée_27f_has_brought_our_open/,"A little background.  I met my fiancee ""Claire"" while she was a senior in college interning at my workplace that I had been at for two years.  Truth be told we hit it off very fast and started dating soon thereafter, and when her internship was done we entered an exclusive relationship.  Everything was GREAT at first.  Hardly ever argued, great sex, cuddling, and we had so many interests in common like the same food and bands that we always had things to talk about.  The relationship continued to go just as well even as she started her new job after graduation, not where I worked by the way, and despite less time to see each other we still made it work.

The first bump in the road so to speak came one day after Claire had gone out with a few colleagues to a bar for a round of drinks.  This wasn't the first time she'd done this, and I understood workplace politics, so I never had an issue with it.  I had invited her over for dinner which I usually did two or three times a week, but she didn't come over until well after an hour I had expected her to and was much more inebriated than usual.  I confronted her about it gently asking her what had happened and she was very defensive at first.  She yelled at me that I was being ""too fucking nosy"" but eventually started crying.  I stroked her hair and she broke down and told me that one of her co-workers, ""Jeff"", had insisted that she stay a bit longer and continue drinking with her.  She explained how Jeff had seniority over her and that she didn't want to appear to be anything but a 'team player' and had left early on previous occasions and gotten flack over it, so she stayed.  Claire told me that she and Jeff continued to drink for another hour or so and Jeff was progressively making the conversation a little more flirty.  She felt nervous and a little bit intimidated but followed suit so as to not make things uncomfortable.  Eventually Jeff started to get a little handsy and Claire was so nervous that she just kind of froze up.  After they finished and they were walking out, he even reached in for a kiss.  At this point in recounting the story Claire was crying so much that I just continued to stroke her hair and listen even though I was a little bit annoyed.  She was so petrified as Jeff went in to kiss her that she just stood there and let it happen, and then once they separated vomited into the nearest trashcan.  I reassured her that it was not her fault but that I would strongly prefer that she not see Jeff outside of the work environment.  She told me that she would avoid one on one interaction but it wouldn't be possible to avoid him entirely as he is almost always part of the group that goes out for after work drinks, and she can't stop going to those.  I was a little mad about it, but I agreed and compromised.

A little more than a year later and things are seemingly going as well as ever.  Claire still does after work bar excursions with her colleagues, but she was recently promoted in part because of it and Jeff left to work somewhere else!  So that was a relief.  We had since moved in together, which just felt right and resulted in us feeling as close to each other as ever, at least emotionally.  To be honest I thought we'd be having sex more often than before, but in actuality shortly after the novelty wore off we were having it less and less, even though we would still cuddle as often as before.  The real problem came up about 6 months after she had moved in, when sometime in the mid afternoon I got an unexpected picture message from Claire of her nude in a bathroom.  This was really weird because for one we never sexted.  My phone was one provided by my work and as such it was against company policy for any kinds explicit texts to be sent to it which I had told her in the past.  I didn't want to say anything in case this was a big surprise and she was feeling rather amorous, but when she got home she didn't so much as bat an eye at me or bring up the picture, which I found very odd.  I know I shouldn't have broken her trust like this, but when she went to use the bathroom and took her phone from her purse, and looked up her messaging log.  While the timestamps for the pic matched my and her phone and the numbers, unfortunately I saw an extensive conversation with a guy she had under her phone as ""Mike"" which had been taking place that day, and for a few weeks it seemed, that was very sexually explicit.  No mention of an actual encounter thank god, but a lot of talk from him about how horny he was and how he was jerking it to the thought of her, and texts from Claire, which really hurt to read, about how wet she was thinking about it and such, along with another nude pic she had sent to him last week.  I didn't say anything about it to her until dinner, when I brought up the nude pic that she had sent me, and she said she had no idea what I was talking about.  At that point I told her I had looked through her phone and had seen all her conversations with Mike and the pic that she had sent him.  Instead of defending herself however she suddenly got furious and was screaming at me about violating her privacy and looking through 'her' stuff and being too controlling, and slammed the bedroom door in my face.  After a half an our or so I went in there to talk to her after not hearing anything and by this time she was on the bed sobbing into the pillow.  She told me how sorry she was and that she'd never let it happen again and that they'd never actually slept together, much to my relief, and that the whole thing had escalated when Mike, another more senior co-worker, had called her hot and started sending flirty text messages, and she felt compelled to not making any waves, and had gotten caught up in everything.  I rubbed her shoulders as she told me the truth and forgave her.  She decided to spend that weekend up visiting her mother to clear her head, and I agreed.  She agreed not to have any more contact with Mike beyond strictly work related talk, so that was a relief.  We kissed but didn't make love that night, but held each other close instead.

Funny enough, I felt the catharsis had made the relationship better than ever, despite the roadbump.  However, a nagging part of me was still a little bit concerned.  I wanted to really tie up any loose ends and cement our relationship as permanent.  So I went out, bought a ring, and proposed to her shortly after she came back from her mother's house.  Much to my relief, she didn't hesitate and said yes, and we got engaged.  This was back in 2011.  Unfortunately, things have gotten much worse in the last nine months.  Last september, right after we had just finished making love, which unfortunately we seemed to be only doing once a week at most, she started crying again.  While I was holding her head to my chest she confessed to me that she had had a moment of weakness and slept with Mike twice over the summer, and she felt like killing herself for it because the guilt was too much.  Surprisingly my emotions of fury was overcome by concern over the talk of suicide, and I told her that I still loved her very much.  She went on to explain that she thinks she might be a nymphomaniac and that sometimes she gets so aroused at work that a primal part of her brain takes over, and that's why she had gone home with Mike those two times during lunch because of it, and she was sickened by it.  Unfortunately she made it clear she still had those feelings and didn't know what to do.  She told me she loved me more than anything and that sex with Mike was just sex for pleasure, not like making love to me.  She told me the urges were making her consider suicide because she couldn't stand what she was doing to me.  She had cut herself in the past so I was very concerned hearing about any suicidal tendencies.  For her safety, I agreed to an open relationship stipulating that if she can't help it, she could see mike for sexual satisfaction as long as she used protection.  She told me how sorry she was, and that she'd seek therapy as soon as we could afford it, and that she'd quit her job after we got married and stop seeing Mike.  It was a really hard choice to make because I felt sick thinking about her in the arms of another man, but I really love her and I didn't want to risk losing her.  For the first few weeks she only slept again with Mike once, and for the first time in a long time we started making love more often.  It did not last long however, and earlier this year our lovemaking frequency dropped precipitously and while I didn't ask how often she saw Mike, I suspected she was seeing him more often.  

The painful part came at the start of the spring.  She broke down and started crying as we were discussing wedding plans and told me in addition to Mike, she had started sleeping with ""Chris"" recently, a guy she apparently met at a conference that she and Mike attended in the city.  She told me she felt like a slut and a whore for violating our agreement and that she didn't deserve to marry me and that she felt like killing herself again.  I was pretty mad about the revelation she had slept with someone we hadn't agreed to or talked about, but again my love for her and out of concern with her safety, I forgave her.  She told me she hated the feeling of going into their apartments and it made her feel awful and uncomfortable.  She told me she'd feel much better if she could bring Mike and Chris here into our home instead, so that it felt more sanctioned and under my control.  I really put my foot down, but I just couldn't get over how sad she was still in tears, and patted her head and told her it was okay.  This is the part I kind of regret now.  At first she'd bring over one of them while I was at work, but in the last six weeks she has brought Mike or Chris over in the evening while I was here cooking!  I haven't talked to her about it because I know how fragile she is about the situation and I don't want to make her uncomfortable.  I almost lost it when she brought Chris to the table for dinner I had prepared afterwards, but I didn't want to say anything, and he did seem like a nice guy.  If she has them over late i'll sleep on the couch and wait until they leave to enter the bedroom, where Claire is usually crying.  Sometimes we'll make love again even while she's still in tears.  Even this I could stand, it wasn't until last week when I was already sleeping, that she brought Mike into our bedroom after midnight and they fooled around as quietly as they could next to me.  I pretended I was asleep at first but didn't bother after her hair kept falling into my face, and just held it for her until they finished and Mike left, and cuddled with her as she started crying again.

I'm writing this because last weekend she told me she really wants to set the date for our wedding and get the invitations out.  I couldn't say it to her, but at this point i'm not sure if I can go through with it.  I could deal with her self medicating by seeing other men strictly for sex, but it's too close to home at this point.  I don't think I can marry someone with nymphomania.  I am deadly afraid to tell her because I really don't want her to do anything to herself, but at the same time I can't deal with her bringing men into our bedroom anymore. 

What should I do reddit?  Insist that she get psychological treatment before we get married?  Set a hard limit on where she's allowed to see Mike and Chris?  Delay the wedding?  I'm afraid either way of how she'll react and I still love her more than anything and don't want her to hurt herself."
1iu1j5,6,2013-07-22,"Want Your Kids to Learn Computer Programming and Computer Engineering? If Yes, What Would You Pay a Tutor to Teach Them?",Ganrao,dayton,https://www.reddit.com/r/dayton/comments/1iu1j5/want_your_kids_to_learn_computer_programming_and/,"I am considering offering computer science and engineering tutoring in my spare time. The sessions would be in-person, with a lesson plan, and focused on Linux and Python (or HTML/CSS and JavaScript, if the parents / child were more interested in web development). The target age group would be from 6 to 16, with a different approach and pace for each age group to the material. As well, because all of the tutoring would be in person I would be able to customize the lessons to the interests and speed of each unique child. 

I am a 10 year veteran of the US military who is about to graduate from Wright State University's Computer Science program and receive a bachelor's degree (3 classes to go). This summer I had an internship with a well regarded aerospace firm, also. I've always wanted to teach, and I get along great with kids. I have an 8 month old baby girl of my own also that I can't wait to start teaching about the world. This is not a call to action and I am not looking for customers today, however.

**I just want to know, as a parent:**

* What would you be willing to spend (per month) to get your child a head start in these very employable skills? 
* How many days a week would you want your child to be tutored? 
* Would you prefer 1 hour or 2 hour sessions?

Thank you in advance for responses!"

[Hi, Peter. I love your coffee column but what I want to know is why you spend so much of it talking about football?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7xrfx?context=5)|Well, when they pay me to write about Peet's Major Dickason's Blend, maybe I'll change my focus.
[I read you for years (I don't currently but that is more to do with how much I read about football period.\)  Anyways, I often thought about it would be interesting for you to do a piece on workplace relationships in the NFL. Between the salaries and the bravado there is so much an anonymous piece could tell. I am not talking about sensationalism I am talking about the little things. Whats it like to have a guy beating you out of a job? Whats it like to have a coworker make 10x as much as you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7yo31?context=5)|An excellent idea.

[Hi Peter! What would say is a prediction you got absolutely wrong? (i.e thinking Jamarcus Russell or Brady Quinn would be great\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7ynja?context=5)|I get 20 predictions a year horribly wrong. Hard to keep track of them all. I picked the Browns to get to the Super Bowl one year. Is that bad enough for you?
[Hi Peter, I was wondering if you could tell us who you think the loftiest player in the NFL is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y0p6?context=5)|I don't know what that means. I would if I could.

[As online reporting grows and print slowly dies, what's roughly the current revenue split between SI's online and print side?  Related, outside of the SI network, what sports blogs do you read regularly? Deadspin, SBNation, Grantland?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y3vh?context=5)|I know nothing about the revenue at SI. Sorry. Re the blogs, I read them all at various times. I love the job Florio does at PFT; he's not only become the wire service for the sport, but he's got a great, irreverent take I appreciate.
[Why did you go with TheMMQB?  I suspect that ""Kinglandia"" was already taken. There was a not-insubstantial portion of your readership who were really hoping for Kinglandia.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7xyxa?context=5)|There wasn't a lot of deep thinking that went into it. It was never going to be Kinglandia. We all agreed that the MMQB name was pretty recognizable, and just added ""The"" to it. 
[Where is Royal Baby on the depth chart? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y1wf?context=5)|Fighting for a spot on special teams.
[Peter - big fan of SI, and have always had an admiration for the mag. With that said, the sports journalism (and everything journalism\) scene has changed rapidly, with sites like the hilarious Deadspin and terrible Bleacher Report popping up; where you you picture your new project landing?  EDIT:  Formatting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y3kk?context=5)|Thank you. I hope we provide a different look at pro football. Read Greg Bedard's story this week about the read-option, and going to Stanford to learn how to defend it from the defensive coordinator there, Derrick Mason. Read our long piece Thursday on what it's like to be cut. We have Jason Garrett's 35-minute pre-training-camp speech to him Cowboys up on the site right now. I hope we can find a niche in what I'd call experiential coverage.
[Peter, are you intimidated by the mustache of Shad Khan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7yoiu?context=5)|I think it weighs more than I do.

Sean Payton is doing the right thing--treating the 2013 season as thought it's his first year with the Saints. He'll be tough on them. Biggest issue is whether Rob Ryan can find a pass-rush.
[How will Percy Harvin do in Seattle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7xugy?context=5)|If he stays on the field for 16 games, which is always an issue with him, he'll be one of the most dangerous three or four weapons in football.
[, Thank you for doing this.  I'm sure you've met a lot of interesting public figures through your sports dealings. Could you list some of the people outside of sports that you never would have thought you'd have met?  Who were/are your favorites?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7xvae?context=5)|Richard Nixon. Saw him as an intern at the Cincinnati Enquirer in Hyden, Ky., when he was trying to make a public comeback from Watergate. And I met him the Giants' locker room in 1986. ""Wish I had your job,'' said Nixon. Said he always wanted to be a sports writer.
[If you weren't covering the NFL, what sport would you want to focus your column around?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7yns0?context=5)|Baseball. Big baseball fan. Have the MLB app. Watch a lot of games on the road.
[What is the motive behind the new MMQB website? Is it SI.com's attempt to capture the sincere sport follower like Grantland.com has? I like the simple format you have followed for a few years now. You should know that the attention span of an internet user is more comparable to a five year old.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7yc10?context=5)|The motive was pretty simple. My contract was up, I had some options, this is something I've wanted to do, I thought it could bring a different media voice to the game, and SI agreed. I am lucky they did.
[Who has been your favorite interview and why? (can be non-football related\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y33l?context=5)|Probably the three days I spent in a bus riding from Cal to NYC with John Madden. Never thought I'd talk Steinbeck with John madden, or go smell wildflowers, but both happened.
[You are one of the voters of the NFL Hall of Fame. If you had the ability to add one player and remove one player from the Hall of Fame today, who would you choose?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7xy7n?context=5)|Mick Tingelhoff, center, Vikings. Starter every preseason, regular-season and post-season game for 18 years (I think it's 18) and played at a very high level. Out because he was shaky in a Super Bowl game once. He absolutely belongs. Re the ones who I'd want out, I don't do that. Don't think it's fair to the guys who got in for a voter to say, ""He doesn't deserve it.""
[What was it like getting to cover the Parcells-led Giants back in the '80s? Had to be one of the more interesting teams to cover, no?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7yegw?context=5)|Incredibly fortunate. The Giants were a good combination of great skill, really smart coaches, and some great stories.
[With the Pats, isnt it likely that Brady will make one of these younger underdeveloped WRs into a great target? Did it with guys like Branch, Welker and even Gronk/Hernandez.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7yokg?context=5)|Yes, or Shane Vereen will become the kind of weapon we haven't seen in him yet.

Yes. Practical and conducive to winning, no.
[Why has it taken you so long to answer a question?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y0gw?context=5)|I am 56, after all.
[Thoughts on the Cardinals training camp being moved from Flagstaff? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y4qg?context=5)|Don't like it at all. I love Flagstaff. Loved making that trip. Beautiful place.
[Who wins a Super Bowl first: the Chiefs or Eagles? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y6eg?context=5)|Eagles.
[Hello Peter. Can the St. Louis Rams surprise everyone this year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y4uv?context=5)|Maybe it's just me, but I wouldn't be surprised to see them win 10 games. Les Snead and Jeff Fisher have taken a bunch of chances in team architecture, but if Tavon Austin plays well this year, 10 wins is defnitely possible.
[Do you listen to Howard Stern?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7yemv?context=5)|I have often in the past, but I don't have Sirius in my apartment. So not right now.

But I am dubious.
[Hi Peter, what do you think the Texans chances of going to the SuperBowl this year are?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7xvsl?context=5)|They're in the top six or eight in football right now. It all comes down to Schaub, I think.

When I tell people my average off-season column is about 4,000 words on football and maybe 600 words on non-football stuff, it never seems to help. Don't know why.

1itw36,3,2013-07-22,Girlfriend [20/F] and I [21/M] were talking marriage a week ago. She now tells me she wants a break and can't guarantee me anything. Help me find the words.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1itw36/girlfriend_20f_and_i_21m_were_talking_marriage_a/,"My GF and I have been dating almost 11 months. We go to the same University and we have unbelievable chemistry and a ridiculous amount in common. We've even been talking about getting married for a while now (perhaps a bit premature but the relationship was moving at light speed, something that we handled just fine). We've been living about an hour apart this summer due to internships and see each other only on weekends which has been a bit tough on us. There was also an incident this summer where she decided to take a co-op in the fall and I was upset that I wouldn't be able to see her much in the fall again (long story short). I was definitely in the wrong about that whole situation and am very remorseful. She told me last week that she thinks it's best if we take a break and spend some time apart, mainly because I didn't show enough support for her taking the co-op. She said that I shouldn't wait for her to come back and we should treat ourselves like single people for the time being. But she also said she would definitely consider getting back together, that i'm her best friend and she still loves me.

I know for a fact that the two of us made each other as happy as we've ever been while we were seeing each other every day at school (we were basically living together). I also know that  I want to marry this woman. But I'm terrified that she won't want me back.

She agreed that I made her very happy. When I asked if she wanted that back, she said yes but she doesn't know if can ever get back to the way it was. She said even if it could, she's not sure she wants to because of how she was hurt (the co-op thing). 

I know what I want here but the best I can get out of her is uncertainty. How do I get this amazing girl back and make her believe I can make her happy again.

TL;DR: Amazing girl and I were talking marriage. She wants a break due to long distance relationship and my lack of showing support. Help me find the words to get her back."
1itugj,70,2013-07-22,(M)y first (f)reshman in college,throwaway45867,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/1itugj/my_first_freshman_in_college/,"Throwaway because even though it's a big college it's a small world.

I was in my second year of college and it didn't look like I was going to get an internship lined up for summer so I had to find something else to do. A buddy of mine signed up to be a freshman orientation advisor for our college so I signed up too. It lasted most of summer with decent pay and I figured I could get a peek at the incoming talent for the new year.

Orientation is basically a time where incoming freshmen stay on campus for a few days, meet their new classmates, get their college questions answered and sign up for classes before they leave. We had a strict policy of no physical contact with the incoming freshmen. I'm sure there could have been legal issues if anyone was &lt;18 but it was more of a program policy to avoid problems. As you can imagine this is the first real college experience the majority of the students are having. This orientation is supposed to be low-key. It's a chance to meet new people, make friends, and leave behind old stereotypes. But of course there are some girls who are looking for a first college screw. They are the ones who show up on day one in a mini skirt and platform flip flops. I saw it as my job to keep an eye out for them and picking them out was like finding the sick or young animal in the herd.

So the program got underway and the students started coming. We had different activities planned and my coworkers and I had shifts managing the activities. A few weeks in I had a shift where I had to take the students out for a social function. On the way to the destination I chatted it up with different groups of students, just being friendly and helping get people to talk. Of course I come up on one wearing a tight pink mini skirt and platform sandles, tight body and medium boobs, probably a small b. She was a little over 5' about 105 lbs, short brown hair and a nice round ass. I won't mention the activity we had scheduled (because it would probably reveal my school/identity) but her outfit was inappropriate. I start talking to her and her friends and we hang out the rest of the night.

We head back to the dorms and I offer them to come back to my room and hang out. There was the girl and her two friends (m/f) who were a couple. We hang out chatting for about an hour. She's giving me looks and I know we want each other but I'm trying to not be obvious in front of her friends. I don't need word getting back to coworkers/supervisors. I basically just hold her gaze a little longer than is normal. Eventually her friends say it's getting late and that they are leaving to go to bed. The girl doesn't say she is going and since her friends probably know she's slutty, they probably know what's going to go down.

Right after they leave we look at each other with the ""Now what"" look. I'm not sure but I think she asked a question about why my bed was raised. Dorm beds can be adjusted and I had mine at about my belly button height. Basically she took it as a challenge to get on and so she jumped up. She was shorter so it wasn't easy. She asks me to get up with her and we start making out. I do have to say she had slightly detectable upper lip hair but I didn't let it throw me off course.

I'm sure many of you (guys) have been in this position before. Trying to move fast but not so fast that she shuts you down. Moving the hand close to the boobs but backing off if you sense her hand coming up for the block. Same thing with the thigh. Eventually one too many attempts at her couter and she stops kissing me. She says I'm not getting lucky but that she'll hike her dress up a little more so I could feel more of her leg. We go like that for a little while longer and we agree it's getting late and she has to go. We agree that I'll help her with registering for classes tomorrow night.

Fast forward to tomorrow and the day's activities are over. It's the last night and she has to create a schedule to sign up for classes the next day. She shows up to my room around 8 or 9 pm in a tank top, workout shorts and sandals. We take about 30 minutes to select her classes. I've been doing this for weeks and most schedules are pretty much the same so I breeze right through it. I think she noticed I was doing most of the work because she apologized at one point for asking questions and slowing things down.

We finish and she hops up on the bed. She didn't even skip a beat. I get up there too and we start making out again. I keep going for the boobs, the couter, but keep getting shut down. I just figure oh well and leave it alone. Its about 11 or so and she asks if she could sleep over, for at least for a few hours then sneak back to her room so I don't get busted. I say ok. I lay on my back and she cuddles up beside me.

In a bold move, to this day I don't know where it came from, I say, ""I only sleep naked (which is false). Is that ok?"" I'm comfortable with my size but never done anything like this. I forgot to mention I'm also a virgin. Anyway, she says something like, sure. I pull everything off and she goes back to cuddling. I have a raging boner at this point and it's obvious. She tries to not notice and lays there with her eyes closed and her leg on my cock.

About 30 seconds later she rolls up on top of me and starts kissing me. My hands go to her hips and she's grinding. I sit up, she gets up on her knees and I start to pull her shirt up and she lets me. I pull it off, suck her nipples and she drops her head back. I'm feeling all over her body and she's loving it. Since she's on her knees I use my hand to direct my cock toward her leg and the opening of her shorts. She's breathing hard and looks down at it. Then she says, ""Do you want to switch positions?"" I say, ""Sure.""

I thought she wanted to make out more and so more grinding but when I got up and she layed down, put her head back and with one hand moved her shorts to the side and spread her pussy lips. I just sat there thinking wow. Kind of like how you feel if you accidently step on the lever that opens a door to a secret passage. I had the tiger by the tail now. All this build up and now I have to shit or get off the pot.

Thinking fast and wondering if she really wants this (looking back I was so stupid) I say I don't have any condoms. She says no worries because she on the pill. I say I don't have anything to clean up with. So she says don't worry about it, I'll take care of it. She then gets up, pushes me on my back and takes my cock with one hand. She then blows me like a champ, swallowing everything I've had bj's before but nothing sequel beyond that. She said something about how there will be less cum now that the first round is out of the chamber.

Now she gets back down and we go back to making out. I start to get hard in no time. I've got two fingers in her couter and she's stroking me. Then she pulls my cock toward her with one hand and spreads her lips with the other. Her legs are wrapped around me and pulling me closer. I put the tip in. I just remember wet, hot and tight. I push in slowly and she moans. M in disbelief I'm nailing this 18 year old. She's grabbing my ass and pulling me inside. I'm just thinking how awesome it is and how I definitely can't cum first. Even though I just blew a load I knew I wouldn't last long so I put it all the way in and left it there. I just grind on her clit since I'm balls deep and she's goes wild. She's not screaming but not quiet either. I'm hoping no one is walking in the hallway outside because I'll get busted. I stay all the way in for what felt like forever because I'm really just trying to not blow my load early. Her eyes are closed and I'm glad because I probably have the deer-in-the-headlights look of a guy handing over his v-card. I reach down and there are juices everywhere. She's dripping all down her ass and onto my bed. Eventually she gets quiet and starts shaking and all I can think is ""Yes! I got her!"" Since she's cumming I start thrusting and I go in about 15 seconds. Biggest nut ever. Right inside her."
1ittkn,0,2013-07-22,My fiancee has brought our open relationship to our bedroom and I hate it,mcjewel,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1ittkn/my_fiancee_has_brought_our_open_relationship_to/,"A little background.  I met my fiancee ""Claire"" while she was a senior in college interning at my workplace that I had been at for two years.  Truth be told we hit it off very fast and started dating soon thereafter, and when her internship was done we entered an exclusive relationship.  Everything was GREAT at first.  Hardly ever argued, great sex, cuddling, and we had so many interests in common like the same food and bands that we always had things to talk about.  The relationship continued to go just as well even as she started her new job after graduation, not where I worked by the way, and despite less time to see each other we still made it work.

The first bump in the road so to speak came one day after Claire had gone out with a few colleagues to a bar for a round of drinks.  This wasn't the first time she'd done this, and I understood workplace politics, so I never had an issue with it.  I had invited her over for dinner which I usually did two or three times a week, but she didn't come over until well after an hour I had expected her to and was much more inebriated than usual.  I confronted her about it gently asking her what had happened and she was very defensive at first.  She yelled at me that I was being ""too fucking nosy"" but eventually started crying.  I stroked her hair and she broke down and told me that one of her co-workers, ""Jeff"", had insisted that she stay a bit longer and continue drinking with her.  She explained how Jeff had seniority over her and that she didn't want to appear to be anything but a 'team player' and had left early on previous occasions and gotten flack over it, so she stayed.  Claire told me that she and Jeff continued to drink for another hour or so and Jeff was progressively making the conversation a little more flirty.  She felt nervous and a little bit intimidated but followed suit so as to not make things uncomfortable.  Eventually Jeff started to get a little handsy and Claire was so nervous that she just kind of froze up.  After they finished and they were walking out, he even reached in for a kiss.  At this point in recounting the story Claire was crying so much that I just continued to stroke her hair and listen even though I was a little bit annoyed.  She was so petrified as Jeff went in to kiss her that she just stood there and let it happen, and then once they separated vomited into the nearest trashcan.  I reassured her that it was not her fault but that I would strongly prefer that she not see Jeff outside of the work environment.  She told me that she would avoid one on one interaction but it wouldn't be possible to avoid him entirely as he is almost always part of the group that goes out for after work drinks, and she can't stop going to those.  I was a little mad about it, but I agreed and compromised.

A little more than a year later and things are seemingly going as well as ever.  Claire still does after work bar excursions with her colleagues, but she was recently promoted in part because of it and Jeff left to work somewhere else!  So that was a relief.  We had since moved in together, which just felt right and resulted in us feeling as close to each other as ever, at least emotionally.  To be honest I thought we'd be having sex more often than before, but in actuality shortly after the novelty wore off we were having it less and less, even though we would still cuddle as often as before.  The real problem came up about 6 months after she had moved in, when sometime in the mid afternoon I got an unexpected picture message from Claire of her nude in a bathroom.  This was really weird because for one we never sexted.  My phone was one provided by my work and as such it was against company policy for any kinds explicit texts to be sent to it which I had told her in the past.  I didn't want to say anything in case this was a big surprise and she was feeling rather amorous, but when she got home she didn't so much as bat an eye at me or bring up the picture, which I found very odd.  I know I shouldn't have broken her trust like this, but when she went to use the bathroom and took her phone from her purse, and looked up her messaging log.  While the timestamps for the pic matched my and her phone and the numbers, unfortunately I saw an extensive conversation with a guy she had under her phone as ""Mike"" which had been taking place that day, and for a few weeks it seemed, that was very sexually explicit.  No mention of an actual encounter thank god, but a lot of talk from him about how horny he was and how he was jerking it to the thought of her, and texts from Claire, which really hurt to read, about how wet she was thinking about it and such, along with another nude pic she had sent to him last week.  I didn't say anything about it to her until dinner, when I brought up the nude pic that she had sent me, and she said she had no idea what I was talking about.  At that point I told her I had looked through her phone and had seen all her conversations with Mike and the pic that she had sent him.  Instead of defending herself however she suddenly got furious and was screaming at me about violating her privacy and looking through 'her' stuff and being too controlling, and slammed the bedroom door in my face.  After a half an our or so I went in there to talk to her after not hearing anything and by this time she was on the bed sobbing into the pillow.  She told me how sorry she was and that she'd never let it happen again and that they'd never actually slept together, much to my relief, and that the whole thing had escalated when Mike, another more senior co-worker, had called her hot and started sending flirty text messages, and she felt compelled to not making any waves, and had gotten caught up in everything.  I rubbed her shoulders as she told me the truth and forgave her.  She decided to spend that weekend up visiting her mother to clear her head, and I agreed.  She agreed not to have any more contact with Mike beyond strictly work related talk, so that was a relief.  We kissed but didn't make love that night, but held each other close instead.

Funny enough, I felt the catharsis had made the relationship better than ever, despite the roadbump.  However, a nagging part of me was still a little bit concerned.  I wanted to really tie up any loose ends and cement our relationship as permanent.  So I went out, bought a ring, and proposed to her shortly after she came back from her mother's house.  Much to my relief, she didn't hesitate and said yes, and we got engaged.  This was back in 2011.  Unfortunately, things have gotten much worse in the last nine months.  Last september, right after we had just finished making love, which unfortunately we seemed to be only doing once a week at most, she started crying again.  While I was holding her head to my chest she confessed to me that she had had a moment of weakness and slept with Mike twice over the summer, and she felt like killing herself for it because the guilt was too much.  Surprisingly my emotions of fury was overcome by concern over the talk of suicide, and I told her that I still loved her very much.  She went on to explain that she thinks she might be a nymphomaniac and that sometimes she gets so aroused at work that a primal part of her brain takes over, and that's why she had gone home with Mike those two times during lunch because of it, and she was sickened by it.  Unfortunately she made it clear she still had those feelings and didn't know what to do.  She told me she loved me more than anything and that sex with Mike was just sex for pleasure, not like making love to me.  She told me the urges were making her consider suicide because she couldn't stand what she was doing to me.  She had cut herself in the past so I was very concerned hearing about any suicidal tendencies.  For her safety, I agreed to an open relationship stipulating that if she can't help it, she could see mike for sexual satisfaction as long as she used protection.  She told me how sorry she was, and that she'd seek therapy as soon as we could afford it, and that she'd quit her job after we got married and stop seeing Mike.  It was a really hard choice to make because I felt sick thinking about her in the arms of another man, but I really love her and I didn't want to risk losing her.  For the first few weeks she only slept again with Mike once, and for the first time in a long time we started making love more often.  It did not last long however, and earlier this year our lovemaking frequency dropped precipitously and while I didn't ask how often she saw Mike, I suspected she was seeing him more often.  

The painful part came at the start of the spring.  She broke down and started crying as we were discussing wedding plans and told me in addition to Mike, she had started sleeping with ""Chris"" recently, a guy she apparently met at a conference that she and Mike attended in the city.  She told me she felt like a slut and a whore for violating our agreement and that she didn't deserve to marry me and that she felt like killing herself again.  I was pretty mad about the revelation she had slept with someone we hadn't agreed to or talked about, but again my love for her and out of concern with her safety, I forgave her.  She told me she hated the feeling of going into their apartments and it made her feel awful and uncomfortable.  She told me she'd feel much better if she could bring Mike and Chris here into our home instead, so that it felt more sanctioned and under my control.  I really put my foot down, but I just couldn't get over how sad she was still in tears, and patted her head and told her it was okay.  This is the part I kind of regret now.  At first she'd bring over one of them while I was at work, but in the last six weeks she has brought Mike or Chris over in the evening while I was here cooking!  I haven't talked to her about it because I know how fragile she is about the situation and I don't want to make her uncomfortable.  I almost lost it when she brought Chris to the table for dinner I had prepared afterwards, but I didn't want to say anything, and he did seem like a nice guy.  If she has them over late i'll sleep on the couch and wait until they leave to enter the bedroom, where Claire is usually crying.  Sometimes we'll make love again even while she's still in tears.  Even this I could stand, it wasn't until last week when I was already sleeping, that she brought Mike into our bedroom after midnight and they fooled around as quietly as they could next to me.  I pretended I was asleep at first but didn't bother after her hair kept falling into my face, and just held it for her until they finished and Mike left, and cuddled with her as she started crying again.

I'm writing this because last weekend she told me she really wants to set the date for our wedding and get the invitations out.  I couldn't say it to her, but at this point i'm not sure if I can go through with it.  I could deal with her self medicating by seeing other men strictly for sex, but it's too close to home at this point.  I don't think I can marry someone with nymphomania.  I am deadly afraid to tell her because I really don't want her to do anything to herself, but at the same time I can't deal with her bringing men into our bedroom anymore. 

What should I do reddit?  Insist that she get psychological treatment before we get married?  Set a hard limit on where she's allowed to see Mike and Chris?  Delay the wedding?  I'm afraid either way of how she'll react and I still love her more than anything and don't want her to hurt herself."

[Has Wayne Brady choked you at any point? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7vblf?context=5)|Why, is Wayne known to choke a bitch?

[I have to say, I've seen you on Improvaganza and the last Whose Line episode and I hope that you become one of the regulars. I'd be perfectly content with a cast of Heather, Ryan, Colin and Wayne.  Really I just wanted to tell you that I think you're great. But to throw a question in here. How does Colin Mochrie smell?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7v9wi?context=5)|Like a follicle holocaust.
[How much fun was it to work on Drew Carey's improv-a-ganza and how different is it from Whose Line Is It Anyway?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7vbpj?context=5)|Las Vegas crowds are drunker than studio crowds and thus the atmosphere was looser. The people in the WLIIA audience were screaming like banshees, and the atmosphere was HYPE.
 |I owe both shows in some way to Drew Carey. If he hadn't cast me in Improv-a-Ganza, I doubt I would have had the confidence I had in my Whose Line audition. It changes your life when someone believes in you. I probably would have thrown up if I'd known how much that one afternoon audition for IaG was going to mean.
[Favourite Whose Line performer? Be honest! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7v9q6?context=5)|I think that big plastic tube did some phenomenal work in Prop Tag.
[Heather, always enjoyed your game journalism. I saw you mentioned to my friend Myles on Twitter that a piece you wrote on The Last of Us was the first thing you've done since Play. Any plans on getting back in to that field? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7v652?context=5)|If I write about games, it's only going to be when one really strikes me. It was soul destroying to play terrible games to completion and then write an article about the few good things I could find in an otherwise terrible RPG or whatever.
 |I think the last two games I've written about were Dark Souls and The Last of Us. So I'll write about games as often as game companies can produce content of that caliber. 
[How did you get into improv and performing in the first place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7v5cv?context=5)|I went to a religious school that didn't have a theater program, but we did after an after-school club that would play in the cafeteria. The director, Ian Gerber, introduced us to short-form. I had watched Whose Line on TV, so I knew the basic idea of how the games worked. One night, Gerber took us to iO (then Improv Olympic) in Chicago, and introduced us to Long Form improv. Insanely enough, Miles Stroth was in the first show I saw at the theater, I believe in a group called Monster Island. After that, I kept coming back to the open set called The Jam, until the theater owner suggested I get into classes and start really young as a sort of experiment.
 |And that was that.
[How crazy is working with the same group of people that you watched growing up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7wcma?context=5)|CRAZY. Probably the weirdest part about all of this is that when I saw my first episode of WLIIA, it looked like Forrest Gump. How the hell did I get edited into that show?
[Hey I really loved your performance on the series premiere on CW. What was it like being up there with the seasoned veterans. Were you intimidated at all or was everything hunky dory?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7v8ey?context=5)|I'd actually performed with everyone except Wayne before; Drew Carey's Improv-a-Ganza was where I really had to deal with the shock of performing with improvisers that I grew up watching on TV. And we did DCIAG in front of a Vegas crowd, too, at the MGM. After that, Whose Line felt like a reunion of sorts.
 |Truth be told, the set itself was the most intimidating part of being on Whose Line. When you grow up watching SNL, and imagine yourself on the show, you imagine it'll be with the people you're watching on TV right then. Like Will Farrell or Jimmy Fallon or whatever. But when you get there, it's all strangers and the set looks a little different, because SNL changes all the time. With Whose Line, I ran onto the stage of my childhood, and the same people were sitting there. That was when it hit me. So insane. Really a dream come true.
 |Intimidating isn't the right word. It was awesome, in the moon-walking sense. I felt awed. 
[Hey Heather. I'm a big fan and think your performances with Miles Stroth at UCB are really great. I've been doing improv through high school and now through college.  My questions is what advice can you give someone like me who's about to be thrown into the real world and wants to continue doing improv professionally? Do you suggest UCB? iO? LA? Chicago?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7v43n?context=5)|Well, if you want to make improv a part of your life, you have to live somewhere that has a robust community. Chicago, LA, and New York are home to big improv theatres and active indie groups; in any of those cities, you have the opportunity to perform every single night of the week. I'm a fan of both UCB and iO, but am theater agnostic -- I think the best work is done by people who've gone through every program available.
 |The thing about improv is there's no real way to be professional at it. You can do it all the time, but that doesn't make you a pro. Heck, none of the improv theaters pay the performers -- you have to do it because you like the work. You'll need a real job. I'd suggest monetizing your leisure time; that's part of why I decided to become a games journalist. 
[What's your game of the year so far?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7v7t2?context=5)|The Last of Us may be my game of the last three years.
[Ultimately, which of the following do you think factors in most if you want to be successful in a creative field such as yours?  Level of passion? Constant hard work and action?  Luck?  Talent?  Networking and/or knowing the right people?  Nepotism?  Personality?  Likability?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7x0ru?context=5)|HA!
 |What is success? Is it money? Is it fame?
 |I think success is how proud you are of a thing you've made. If you're proud of a thing, then a show for 10 people feels like a show for a million. If you're embarrassed, and a million people watch it, then you wish only one person had seen it.
 |As far as employment, I think you get work if you've worked on something you're proud of. Sure, it's easier if you have [Rich Parents](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nloyQuxpFTg) than if you have to [deliver groceries](http://www.yummy.com/) in your spare time -- who knows how much faster I could have gotten representation if I wasn't spending all my free moments delivering eggs and liquor to rich people in the hills. But I ended up in the same place as people who were born to be there. And that comes from one thing: Not Quitting.
 |Everyone I know who has made it has simply not quit. Eventually, they work. 
[""...success is how proud of a thing you've made.""  I have felt this definition of success, and it has been a source of happiness and purpose, which causes me to make more things to be proud of in order to feel that level of success again.  So let's say the definition of success in this case is happiness, which then leads to having the goal of earning a living making ""more things to be proud of"" because this means that most of the time in your life is devoted to what generates happiness and purpose.  But even if I'm proud of the things I make, this doesn't factor in if the things I make could suck, which likely means I will never make money from it and won't be able to devote all of my time to it.  How does one maintain a healthy level of delusion to keep going?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7ymy1?context=5)|Everyone fails. Some people stop when they do. Don't be one of those people.
[I'm majoring in broadcasting and am hoping to get into the TV part of it (not as an actor unless I turned out to be good at it, but in the production/writing side of it, do you have any advice on breaking into it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7v7g4?context=5)|The best advice I have is probably kinda obvious: YouTube. Self-published material is the best business card you could have in the industry. And it doesn't go away. If you make something good on the internet, people will see it, and eventually that will lead to work. All phones can shoot in 1080p, so your stuff can look as good as you want it to, for a minimal initial investment. I've gotten a lot of work from my involvement with [The Midnight Show](http://www.youtube.com/theucbmidnightshow); some of the rooms I've sat in were with executives who didn't even know I wrote for SNL -- instead, I'm there because they saw a video we made. As soon as you can, start putting shit out there. Work attracts work.
[Thank you for the reply! I appreciate the advice, and with a follow-up question: what about getting people to watch my videos? I've assumed it is a lot about timing; getting a video up when that subject is hot, of course. Obviously a Harlem shake video now wouldn't do anything. But what about other ways? Are there certain websites you recommend posting to? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7vzus?context=5)|Write something topical, or write parody to start. That way, the Big Advertising Agencies are doing your leg work for you. If your idea is clear, then your take on it will naturally come from your point of view. One of the first viral videos I wrote was Twilight With Cheeseburgers. I had no interest in Twilight, but watched it because I wanted to write about it. Subject yourself to stuff you're not interested in, but is popular, and it will be easier to defamiliarize. And post to YouTube and FunnyorDie. Just keep making them, one will pop.
[Are you still writing for SNL?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb85ohv?context=5)|No, I'm back in gorgeous Los Angeles, writing for FOX's ADHD. Which goes up against SNL starting NEXT SATURDAY NIGHT.
[Your Whose Line episode was amazing and I hope you come back if they do a second season. :\)  Also, do you prefer improv or standup?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7v9da?context=5)|I prefer Improv, but more than improv I prefer sketch. The strength of both of them comes from live relationships on stage. Talking about a relationship isn't as active as seeing one unfold, which is why both sketch and improv appeal to me. And I'm not talking about romance when I say relationships; I'm talking about the relationship between a doctor and a dog he's about to put down, or two co-workers who are fighting off zombies, or a little girl who is smarter than an astronaut. That stuff is great, and you explore it best with sketch or improv.
[Now for the question: What advice can you give to an amateur improver?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7v9da?context=5)|My advice would be: Move to a big city, start taking classes at as many theaters as you can afford (join internships to get free classes if need be), and perform perform perform. The best work is done by the people who are working all the time. Meaning, it's more likely that a great scene will happen if someone is doing 100 scenes a week than if that person is only doing one scene a week. So play at every theater, even the less popular ones. Do open-improv sets, like The Jam. Just keep performing!
[G'day from Australia, and thanks for doing the AMA! Just a couple of questions, out of curiosity.  Do you plan on writing, editing etc. for magazines such as *Play Magazine* and *Geek Monthly* again?  Will you be part of CW's Whose Line is it Anyway for the entire season?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7v7x4?context=5)|Writing for a game magazine takes a lot of time, and I work full time at FOX now. I write almost all of the shorts there, like [Scientifically Accurate Spider-Man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnE3uyj9Grg) -- and do a bunch of the voices and singing, too. The reason I plug this isn't just because my bosses would want me to, but because I believe that good games journalism means really playing a game to completion, digesting it, and trying to figure out how it fits into the larger body of work of the developer as well as the industry. It's not something you can do on the side if you're going to do it professionally. I don't have the time I'd want to dedicate to games if I was to work with them again.
 |I have another episode on the 6th of August! There are a bunch of FANTASTIC improvisers taking the 4th chair. So, I guess I'm a part of the show for the season -- but so are other people?
[What's the absolute worst incident that you've fumbled on an improv?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7yuz7?context=5)|I farted on stage once and thought I would die.
[Can you give us a postmortem on the epic, record-breaking, sure-to-be-legendary Heather and Miles run at the UCB LA Cagematch? How did you feel going through that year? How do you feel about it now, a few months after it ended? What did you take away from it? Any thoughts.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7xk5s?context=5)|For those not from Los Angeles, the Cagematch is a competitive improv show where two teams do twenty minutes and the audience votes one of the shows back for the next week. I did a two man show with Miles Stroth that lasted 50 weeks, which with breaks was more than a year of shows.
 |Here's the thing: the shows themselves are some of the best improv work I've ever been a part of. I love performing with Miles and found some real moments of serendipity, responsibility, and mirth in those shows.
 |But there was some real ugly shit that happened around the periphery of those nights, from the kinds of things I heard about the theater wanting us gone, to links people would send me of blogs that were trashing the shows, to formerly respected friends calling our work shallow or pandering -- honestly, we went into each night just wanting to perform with each other. That's it.
 |Miles and I were trying to do a show in that moment. We weren't making Facebook events and trying to pack the house -- hell, Miles school had 25% of the students it has now when we started, so it wasn't an audience full of his students, because they didn't exist yet. But we were accused of fraud and all sorts of weird shit. It was theatre drama at its worst. And considering that Miles and I did the exact same show for one or two person houses at another theater, the evidence wasn't there that we were trying to be dishonest. I work with Miles because of the work. Cagematch was amazing, but it would be amazing to have anywhere to perform with Miles.
 |I guess it's a side effect of the very concept of competition that will bring out spite in people you knew and loved, but I was grossly shocked by how quickly the community devolved as a result of us showing up to do twenty minutes of improv.
 |The people who were there out of love and joy have become some of my trusted friends. Months later, that sticks with me. But so does the alacrity with which the ugliness came out.
 |EDIT: I loved it. To be clear, it's going to be one of the things that flashes before my eyes if I'm ever dying.
[Hi Heather! One thing I've always meant to ask you: of all the sketches you've written that were filmed and put online, which one is your favorite or do you feel best represents your taste and sensibilities? Also can we make a tv show or a movie together now please?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7vicx?context=5)|Let's make a tv show! Let's make a movie!
 |I really like Immortal Dog, man. I like the idea of sketches from the future, or like things that have the atmosphere of a punishing police state. Immortal Dog feels like a sketch from the world of Robocop. Like, it's what a sketch comedy show in Neo Detroit would be. So, thank you. Thank you very much.
 |I also like that so many of my friends french kissed animals because I wrote it down on a piece of paper. That's like the sketch version of the [Stanford Prison Experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment).
[What is the best improv class or workshop you have ever taken? and Why? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7va8k?context=5)|I don't think any one improv class has been ""the best,"" because if a teacher is good, they're probably very different from everyone else. Improv is basically one person's point of view on how to attack a void. I've learned a lot from different teachers, but the ones that gave me the most interesting things to work with were the ones that had the most specific points of view.
 |JD Walsh at Ultimate Improv had some very interesting ideas and workshops, which were often based on how frustrating he found improv to be; he wanted the work to be faster, more fearless, and without the awkward ""where-are-we-whats-going-on"" moments that plague the beginning of scenes.
 |Miles Stroth taught me one class a million years ago that stuck with me, which was exceptionally mathematical.
 |Pep Rosenfeld at Boom Chicago was about the showmanship of an improv scene, and how to present yourself in the best possible light; I also had a week of workshops with Tom Gianas there, and that was enlightening. Gianas taught us about the piece, as opposed to the individual moments.
 |I really liked learning from Jerris Donnovan, who directed a show I was in for years and loved pulling emotional play out of her performers.
 |And then there was the weird two years I spent in the cult of Chris Barnes, who teaches a RADICALLY different version of improv based on the enneagram.
 |All of the best classes came from anchored points of view. A great teacher has a single idea on how improv works, and they give you that tool.
[You do so much work! Do you have a system for getting it all done? Do you wake up early in the morning? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7wxjc?context=5)|I don't wake up early! And the system is: every minute, you can work. When it's time to relax, and I'm watching VICE or something, I keep a Google Doc open to write down sketch ideas inspired by what I'm watching. If I'm listening to the radio, or playing a video game, it's the same. If I hear something funny said in a deathmatch, I'll write it down. It's not really a lot of work at once; it's work spread out over every minute. Much easier that way. This last hour and forty five minutes is probably the least I've worked in weeks, because I can't type these answers and write other stuff at the same time.
[I loved you in Improvaganza. How was that experience compared to WLIIA? And why is it that I never hear or read about Improvaganza, as if it didn't happen? :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7wtaw?context=5)|How many people talk about anything that happens on Game Show Network?
[Who was the best improv comic that you've ever got to perform with?  And were they able to teach you something about your craft, that you hadn't already known?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7w7r9?context=5)|I've performed with so many of the most extraordinary people that I feel like I'm learning from them every time I go on stage. And that's not the political answer, either. What I learn from Ryan, Colin, and Wayne is totally different from what I've learned from Miles Stroth or the things I take away from Last Day of School (my weekly LA show). I learned things with my college team that I haven't replaced, and I learned things from people like Colton Dunn, Jordan Peele, and Jim Woods (who is working as a sort of director at Boom Chicago in Amsterdam) that I couldn't get from anyone else.
 |Everyone improvises differently, so I feel like you have to evolve every time you get on stage. To say someone is the best implies that everyone is improvising the same way, and that one man or woman is better at it than everyone else. It's just not true.   
[What's it like to work with Colin Mochrie? He seems like the funniest most genuine guy. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7wj4g?context=5)|He's fantastic.
[I'm putting this one in a few hours early for the 5PM answers.  Thank you for doing this AMA — Like you said in an earlier answer: ""Improv is basically one person's point of view on how to attack a void."" It's the best explanation of improv teaching I've heard.  Thing is, life is full of voids if you think about it — you're always venturing into the unknown. Do you feel that your improv skill set has helped you outside of performing and writing, in personal or other professional situations? If so, do you have any anecdotes you could tell us about how your improv skills helped in an unexpected or unlikely situation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb82lvm?context=5)|Yes. My first paid gig as a video-game journalist came from basically playing the character of a video-game journalist. I got into E3 because of pieces I wrote for The Gamer's Quarter, and went with one goal: writing for Edge magazine. Knowing that my last name is Campbell, and that one of the editors of Edge was named Campbell, I walked into the Edge on-site office and played the character of someone who should be there.
 |I came back at three and had an appointment because of the way I said my name, and the way I acted -- like I was supposed to be there. Colin sat down with me, confused; he asked, ""What was this meeting about?"" Again, improvising, I said, ""You were meeting with me to hire me as a writer."" Which is what I would say in a scene if I was playing the plucky young journalist.  Colin realized what was up and looked frustrated. So I handed him my portfolio and said, ""If you read this, I guarantee you'll give me a job. I promise, because it's that good.""  I didn't hear anything for a while, and then they called me and asked me to be a Los Angeles correspondent. As soon as I wrote a single article for Edge, I immediately set a meeting with Play Magazine. And that's the story of how I improvised my way from grocery delivery into Games Journalism. It starts with the work: If my portfolio was empty, that would have been the end of it. But I had something to show once I got in the meeting.
 |""Can you tell him Heather stopped by? Heather *Campbell*.""
[What was the hardest part of improv to get a handle on? i.e. justifying your ideas, confidence in your moves, commitment to a character?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7vgws?context=5)|The most basic element of improv is commitment. Commitment to the reality of a world, an idea, or a character. Nothing kills a scene faster than someone who is winking to the audience, or ""performing"" a scene as opposed to being **in** a place or **being** a person. Justification comes naturally if you're committed, because you're just saying what the person would say if they were in that position. And you don't have to have any confidence if you're committed; you're not doing anything, the person you've become is making those choices. If you can commit completely, improv happens on its own. Improv is a random encounter, commitment is the Limit Break.

Now a days, I'll read the forums at [Select Button](http://www.selectbutton.net) for really enlightening discussion of game design.

1itqyg,1,2013-07-22,"[28M] My fiancée [27F] has brought our ""open relationship"" into our bedroom and I hate it.",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1itqyg/28m_my_fiancée_27f_has_brought_our_open/,"A little background.  I met my fiancee ""Claire"" while she was a senior in college interning at my workplace that I had been at for two years.  Truth be told we hit it off very fast and started dating soon thereafter, and when her internship was done we entered an exclusive relationship.  Everything was GREAT at first.  Hardly ever argued, great sex, cuddling, and we had so many interests in common like the same food and bands that we always had things to talk about.  The relationship continued to go just as well even as she started her new job after graduation, not where I worked by the way, and despite less time to see each other we still made it work.

The first bump in the road so to speak came one day after Claire had gone out with a few colleagues to a bar for a round of drinks.  This wasn't the first time she'd done this, and I understood workplace politics, so I never had an issue with it.  I had invited her over for dinner which I usually did two or three times a week, but she didn't come over until well after an hour I had expected her to and was much more inebriated than usual.  I confronted her about it gently asking her what had happened and she was very defensive at first.  She yelled at me that I was being ""too fucking nosy"" but eventually started crying.  I stroked her hair and she broke down and told me that one of her co-workers, ""Jeff"", had insisted that she stay a bit longer and continue drinking with her.  She explained how Jeff had seniority over her and that she didn't want to appear to be anything but a 'team player' and had left early on previous occasions and gotten flack over it, so she stayed.  Claire told me that she and Jeff continued to drink for another hour or so and Jeff was progressively making the conversation a little more flirty.  She felt nervous and a little bit intimidated but followed suit so as to not make things uncomfortable.  Eventually Jeff started to get a little handsy and Claire was so nervous that she just kind of froze up.  After they finished and they were walking out, he even reached in for a kiss.  At this point in recounting the story Claire was crying so much that I just continued to stroke her hair and listen even though I was a little bit annoyed.  She was so petrified as Jeff went in to kiss her that she just stood there and let it happen, and then once they separated vomited into the nearest trashcan.  I reassured her that it was not her fault but that I would strongly prefer that she not see Jeff outside of the work environment.  She told me that she would avoid one on one interaction but it wouldn't be possible to avoid him entirely as he is almost always part of the group that goes out for after work drinks, and she can't stop going to those.  I was a little mad about it, but I agreed and compromised.

A little more than a year later and things are seemingly going as well as ever.  Claire still does after work bar excursions with her colleagues, but she was recently promoted in part because of it and Jeff left to work somewhere else!  So that was a relief.  We had since moved in together, which just felt right and resulted in us feeling as close to each other as ever, at least emotionally.  To be honest I thought we'd be having sex more often than before, but in actuality shortly after the novelty wore off we were having it less and less, even though we would still cuddle as often as before.  The real problem came up about 6 months after she had moved in, when sometime in the mid afternoon I got an unexpected picture message from Claire of her nude in a bathroom.  This was really weird because for one we never sexted.  My phone was one provided by my work and as such it was against company policy for any kinds explicit texts to be sent to it which I had told her in the past.  I didn't want to say anything in case this was a big surprise and she was feeling rather amorous, but when she got home she didn't so much as bat an eye at me or bring up the picture, which I found very odd.  I know I shouldn't have broken her trust like this, but when she went to use the bathroom and took her phone from her purse, and looked up her messaging log.  While the timestamps for the pic matched my and her phone and the numbers, unfortunately I saw an extensive conversation with a guy she had under her phone as ""Mike"" which had been taking place that day, and for a few weeks it seemed, that was very sexually explicit.  No mention of an actual encounter thank god, but a lot of talk from him about how horny he was and how he was jerking it to the thought of her, and texts from Claire, which really hurt to read, about how wet she was thinking about it and such, along with another nude pic she had sent to him last week.  I didn't say anything about it to her until dinner, when I brought up the nude pic that she had sent me, and she said she had no idea what I was talking about.  At that point I told her I had looked through her phone and had seen all her conversations with Mike and the pic that she had sent him.  Instead of defending herself however she suddenly got furious and was screaming at me about violating her privacy and looking through 'her' stuff and being too controlling, and slammed the bedroom door in my face.  After a half an our or so I went in there to talk to her after not hearing anything and by this time she was on the bed sobbing into the pillow.  She told me how sorry she was and that she'd never let it happen again and that they'd never actually slept together, much to my relief, and that the whole thing had escalated when Mike, another more senior co-worker, had called her hot and started sending flirty text messages, and she felt compelled to not making any waves, and had gotten caught up in everything.  I rubbed her shoulders as she told me the truth and forgave her.  She decided to spend that weekend up visiting her mother to clear her head, and I agreed.  She agreed not to have any more contact with Mike beyond strictly work related talk, so that was a relief.  We kissed but didn't make love that night, but held each other close instead.

Funny enough, I felt the catharsis had made the relationship better than ever, despite the roadbump.  However, a nagging part of me was still a little bit concerned.  I wanted to really tie up any loose ends and cement our relationship as permanent.  So I went out, bought a ring, and proposed to her shortly after she came back from her mother's house.  Much to my relief, she didn't hesitate and said yes, and we got engaged.  This was back in 2011.  Unfortunately, things have gotten much worse in the last nine months.  Last september, right after we had just finished making love, which unfortunately we seemed to be only doing once a week at most, she started crying again.  While I was holding her head to my chest she confessed to me that she had had a moment of weakness and slept with Mike twice over the summer, and she felt like killing herself for it because the guilt was too much.  Surprisingly my emotions of fury was overcome by concern over the talk of suicide, and I told her that I still loved her very much.  She went on to explain that she thinks she might be a nymphomaniac and that sometimes she gets so aroused at work that a primal part of her brain takes over, and that's why she had gone home with Mike those two times during lunch because of it, and she was sickened by it.  Unfortunately she made it clear she still had those feelings and didn't know what to do.  She told me she loved me more than anything and that sex with Mike was just sex for pleasure, not like making love to me.  She told me the urges were making her consider suicide because she couldn't stand what she was doing to me.  She had cut herself in the past so I was very concerned hearing about any suicidal tendencies.  For her safety, I agreed to an open relationship stipulating that if she can't help it, she could see mike for sexual satisfaction as long as she used protection.  She told me how sorry she was, and that she'd seek therapy as soon as we could afford it, and that she'd quit her job after we got married and stop seeing Mike.  It was a really hard choice to make because I felt sick thinking about her in the arms of another man, but I really love her and I didn't want to risk losing her.  For the first few weeks she only slept again with Mike once, and for the first time in a long time we started making love more often.  It did not last long however, and earlier this year our lovemaking frequency dropped precipitously and while I didn't ask how often she saw Mike, I suspected she was seeing him more often.  

The painful part came at the start of the spring.  She broke down and started crying as we were discussing wedding plans and told me in addition to Mike, she had started sleeping with ""Chris"" recently, a guy she apparently met at a conference that she and Mike attended in the city.  She told me she felt like a slut and a whore for violating our agreement and that she didn't deserve to marry me and that she felt like killing herself again.  I was pretty mad about the revelation she had slept with someone we hadn't agreed to or talked about, but again my love for her and out of concern with her safety, I forgave her.  She told me she hated the feeling of going into their apartments and it made her feel awful and uncomfortable.  She told me she'd feel much better if she could bring Mike and Chris here into our home instead, so that it felt more sanctioned and under my control.  I really put my foot down, but I just couldn't get over how sad she was still in tears, and patted her head and told her it was okay.  This is the part I kind of regret now.  At first she'd bring over one of them while I was at work, but in the last six weeks she has brought Mike or Chris over in the evening while I was here cooking!  I haven't talked to her about it because I know how fragile she is about the situation and I don't want to make her uncomfortable.  I almost lost it when she brought Chris to the table for dinner I had prepared afterwards, but I didn't want to say anything, and he did seem like a nice guy.  If she has them over late i'll sleep on the couch and wait until they leave to enter the bedroom, where Claire is usually crying.  Sometimes we'll make love again even while she's still in tears.  Even this I could stand, it wasn't until last week when I was already sleeping, that she brought Mike into our bedroom after midnight and they fooled around as quietly as they could next to me.  I pretended I was asleep at first but didn't bother after her hair kept falling into my face, and just held it for her until they finished and Mike left, and cuddled with her as she started crying again.

I'm writing this because last weekend she told me she really wants to set the date for our wedding and get the invitations out.  I couldn't say it to her, but at this point i'm not sure if I can go through with it.  I could deal with her self medicating by seeing other men strictly for sex, but it's too close to home at this point.  I don't think I can marry someone with nymphomania.  I am deadly afraid to tell her because I really don't want her to do anything to herself, but at the same time I can't deal with her bringing men into our bedroom anymore. 

What should I do reddit?  Insist that she get psychological treatment before we get married?  Set a hard limit on where she's allowed to see Mike and Chris?  Delay the wedding?  I'm afraid either way of how she'll react and I still love her more than anything and don't want her to hurt herself."

1itiss,5,2013-07-22,I'm really starting to hate this. [rant?],TotalJester,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1itiss/im_really_starting_to_hate_this_rant/,"Just some background, I'm sixteen and I've been having a lot of trouble with school the past few years, especially after hitting high school. Got diagnosed with ADHD (inattentive) a couple of months ago right as school was letting out, and recently I upped my dosage from 27mg to 36mg because it was wearing off too fast.

At first, I was actually really glad to get diagnosed. I finally had a real reason for the sudden drop in my academic performance other than sheer laziness, and I was going to be medicated, which was even better, since I felt like I could finally fix it. And for a while after I started taking the meds (Concerta), I really did feel better and felt like my future was going to be brighter now that I had something to help me.

But the side effects are fucking killing me. Every day, as soon as the meds wear off in the afternoon/evening, I get so pissy and reclusive that I can't even stand sitting down to dinner with my family or talking to my friends. And when the meds are active, I'm boring, I get headaches, and I can't even drive normally because I constantly zone out and look over minor details that I was able to take in before.

But it's even worse when I DON'T take the meds. Before I started up on my prescription, I was lazy and couldn't focus, sure, but I was friendly, mostly happy aside from episodes of severe depression, and I could socialize without slowly going insane. But now, whenever I don't take my meds, I feel like a completely different person, and not in a good way. For example, this weekend was my first break in three weeks (work's a bitch), so I thought, hey, I don't need to take my meds, I can finally relax. But over the course of the weekend, I started having really abnormal surges of anger. Little things ticked me off so bad that I would go upstairs and throw stuff around just to vent. I stuck to cardboard boxes and unbreakable things like that, but another day and I feel like I would've really started causing some damage, considering how many times I had to physically restrain myself from punching a hole in the wall. I even managed to get into a fight with my dad (who also has ADHD) simply because I was frustrated that my internship hasn't been going the way I hoped it would. I never fight with my dad.

I hate this. I hate this so fucking much. I hate that I have to take a goddamn pill just to feel normal now. I hate that without a fucking pill I'm intolerable and lose my mind, and with it I'm dull and perpetually tired. Before I got this fucking diagnosis I was fun, I was energetic, and even though I did terribly in school I was at least happy. But now I'm depressed half the time and feel like I'm going crazy whenever I'm not taking my medicine. I actually had a bit of a freakout a month or two ago when I was first starting to get adjusted to my meds, when I didn't take them first thing in the morning and went for a run instead. I ended up three miles away from home in the middle of some neighborhood, storming up and down the street just about ready to attack the first pedestrian I saw. Took my mom a solid fifteen minutes to find me after I called her, and I'm afraid that if I was left alone for much longer I could've done something really bad. I'm scared that something like that will happen again.

How do you guys deal with this sort of thing? Or am I the only one who reacts like this? Should I talk to my doctor about getting a new prescription? Does it get any better after a while? The last thing I want to do is go back to school in a month and freak out there where everyone can see me. But I don't know if there's enough time at this point for me to get adjusted enough that I can be normal on and off of my meds.

Edit: Forgot to mention this, but another thing I'm really hating is that my mom keeps blaming my mood swings and all that shit on my ADHD. I mean, she's probably right, but I still resent that it feels like she's basing all of my behavior on this stupid disorder. Maybe it's just me, but it sometimes feels like my entire identity is being based on one problem in my head, and that just makes me angrier."
1itfx5,1,2013-07-22,Applied for a gov't IT job and got a rejection email for having the wrong TYPE of experience... should I submit a written request to be re-evaluated?,jshrlzwrld02,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1itfx5/applied_for_a_govt_it_job_and_got_a_rejection/,"I applied for this job some time ago and just today got this email saying that I was rejected because I have the ""Incorrect TYPE of Experience.""

&gt; EXPERIENCE REQUIRED FOR LEVEL 1: Two years of full-time or equivalent part-time paid experience installing, supporting and troubleshooting computer hardware, software and/or network connectivity. 

&gt; EXPERIENCE REQUIRED FOR LEVEL 2: Four years as described above. 

The email states that if I don't believe my qualifications have been correctly evaluated that I have fifteen days to submit a written request to request a review. I realize that several months ago when I applied for these positions that I was not prepared as far as the resume department and had a couple different resumes and only changed my education experience to tailor each resume to the position.

The above being said, I have more than two years of practical experience that I am quite sure would qualify me for government IT work. I did a 480 hour internship at a major ski resort on the east coast that had me performing the IT duties like answering the help-desk line, switching out hardware in busted PCs, and setting up networking and A/V stuff for big conference groups.

I've also built my own PCs several times since high school, set up my own home networks (printers, wifi, etc), troubleshooting the IT stuff for my mothers family businesses since 2004, and built custom PCs and cluster PCs during my networking classes in college including a machine submerged in mineral oil and a 5-node cluster PC also submerged in mineral oil for cooling.

So I'm wondering if I should bother requesting a review and maybe sending them an updated resume that showcases these experiences? Or at this point would it just seem like I was fabricating experience? I am more than confident that I could perform the work required, maybe needing a little bit of training with certain things, but for the most part I would be okay. I am beyond desperate for a real job right now and if there is a chance that I could land this I would be ecstatic."

Personal Projects

Relevant Skills and Qualifications (which is  programming languages, dev. tools and processes etc.)

Awards and Leadership Experience

Activities and Interests




This is currently the order in which I list them on my resume, but I have seen some people advising that you should put Work Experience first and Education last.  I know that is definitely true for established professionals, but is that true for new grads as well?  I feel like as a new grad my school and GPA are a bit more relevant now then they will be twenty years down the line.


Also, should I move the Relevant Skills and Qualifications section to the top?  I don't know how important knowledge of different languages is for a new grad.

This, after both Barack Obama and Eric Holder have called for a re-examination of these laws in the wake of the Zimmerman incident.

The problem is that Stand Your Ground laws had nothing to do with the Zimmerman case.  (Explanation in a post below)

---

To those of us who understand the law and the Zimmerman case, Mr. Holder, Mr. Obama, and Mr. Durbin are clearly and unambiguously exploiting public fervor over this situation in order to attempt to limit self-defense law across the country.

**We must respond.**

**I.  Call your federal and state senators and representatives and urge them to SUPPORT stand your ground laws.**

The call should be brief and to the point.  You're talking to an intern who is just writing down your position.  ""Please encourage Senator/Representative X to oppose any attempt to repeal or change Stand Your Ground legislation.  Stand your ground laws are GOOD laws, and have nothing to do with the Zimmerman case.""

If your state doesn't have SYG laws, ask your legislator to introduce them!

[Find your representatives here](http://www.usa.gov/Contact/Elected.shtml).

You can also use the GOA tool to send them an e-mail about this, but *please* call as well.  They need to hear our voices.  [E-mail link.](http://capwiz.com/gunowners/home/)

**II.  Get your friends and loved ones involved.**  If they're like minded, get them to call like you did.  Get your husbands, wives, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters calling.  Let them know how important this is to you.  If they're not like minded yet, take them shooting.  Educate everyone you can.  The senators need to hear from as many *different* voices as possible.  

**III.  Call representatives who are on the fence, under pressure, or calling for change about SYG laws.**

[Dick Durbin's Contact Information](http://www.durbin.senate.gov/public/).  (Durbin is calling for SYG hearings).   (202) 224-2152

[Bob Goodlatte](http://goodlatte.house.gov/contacts/new) is under pressure to have similar hearings in the house.  He is pro-gun, but needs to know he has our support.  **(202) 225-5431**

[John McCain](http://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Contact.OfficeLocations) has called for review of SYG laws.  **(202) 224-2235**

[Shelia Jackson-Lee](http://jacksonlee.house.gov/contact/officeinformation.htm) will be introducing [legislation](http://dailycaller.com/2013/07/24/dem-congresswoman-introduces-bill-to-cut-funds-to-stand-your-ground-states/) to force states to switch SYG language to duty to retreat language or risk losing federal funding.  **(202) 225-3816**

**IV.  Educate as many people as you can about SYG laws.**  This is fairly straightforward; people who oppose SYG laws generally don't know what SYG is.  Use the resources linked above to inform them, and attempts to mislead on the topic by those opposed to SYG laws will be immediately transparent.  Link to [this SYG explanation](http://www.husseinandwebber.com/stand_your_ground.html) on Facebook and explain how Zimmerman's case does not relate to SYG.

Thanks for reading.

**EDIT**:  Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee will introduce the [Justice Exists for All](http://gopthedailydose.com/2013/07/24/democrat-sheila-jackson-lee-filing-bill-to-cut-funding-to-any-state-that-doesnt-change-stand-your-ground-laws-to-duty-to-retreat/) bill, which will seek to cut federal funding to states that don't change SYG laws to Duty to Retreat laws.  **CALL YOUR REPS DAILY**.

1itbap,5,2013-07-22,I have constant fear of losing people I love and also not choosing the right path in life,throwaway81928,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1itbap/i_have_constant_fear_of_losing_people_i_love_and/,"I'm a 25M, and I'm currently in a 2 year wonderful relationship with my 27F fiancee. I graduated in computer science, and also got my masters degree. She's months away from graduating in materials engineering. I'm currently in a well paying job, but I have no contract.  The project has an estimated duration of 18 months, with a possibility of extending that time. She's doing an internship, before she can get her diploma.

Since we're thinking about getting married soon, I'm constantly afraid of the future. She's living away from me now, in another state. My fears are whether we will find good jobs that we love in the same place. Whether I will be unemployed for too long when my project ends. I'm even worried about retirement, because since I don't work under a contract, I don't have some rights, such as a retirement plan and unemployment insurance (remember I'm not in Europe or North America.) I mentioned our degrees because people say that we can't be unemployed with our degrees. But the salaries for someone with my degree in my country are not so good.

Besides those fears, since she's living in another state, I'm constantly afraid that she is in danger. It might be silly for someone else, but it's a big deal for me. For example, I'm afraid someone might do some harm to her even when she says she will do the most usual things, like taking the bus, going back home from work. Going to places alone at night.

One example was a couple of days ago, when my flight was having a connection in a city next to where she lives. She could go to the airport by herself and meet me there, but I told her to go to the mall, and I took a taxi from the airport to meet her at the mall. That's because I was scared of her going to the airport and going back home alone at night.

Does anyone else have these same fears? What would you suggest to soothe my always worried mind?

Thank you for your attention!"

Oh well. This is long, but I really hope someone can give me some sort of advice.

So I've been dating a guy for a few months. Because he's away for an internship this summer, we aren't technically exclusive but for me at least, feelings have developed pretty quickly and up until recently, I thought the same was happening for him.

Being that we hadn't seen each other for about a month at that point due to the distance, I went on a trip with him and his friends for the 4th of July and **I** had an amazing time. I'm just coming to find out that for him it wasn't quite so amazing... The first night there I got drunk and ended up crying about how much I like him already and how it scares me because he's graduating in December. I ended up bringing up his ex, who he had dated for almost two years and had only been broken up with for a few months. My (drunken) point in doing this was to reassure him that I knew he had some history that he wasn't completely over, but I didn't care. What I apparently did was cause a crisis in his life with that one conversation.

When we got back from the trip I felt closer to him than ever, only to notice that he seemed more distant. At first I blamed my issues with anxiety and depression making me see things that weren't there but it started to become more and more clear that something was different. 

Friday night while drinking with friends I was texting him and finally told him that when I send him messages and get no response, or no response for a while, or a very vague response, it makes me feel like I'm more attracted to him than he is to me. No response. Saturday I knew that he was spending the day with his dad and didn't want to be anymore obnoxious than I had been when I was drunk, so I didn't talk to him. Finally Sunday I apologized for being drunk and annoying, only to have him tell me my concerns were valid.

We started talked about it and he told me he doesn't know what he wants in his life in general. I told him that I was here to talk if he needed to, and he told me that part of it involved missing his ex. Ouch. Okay, but I still wanted to be there for him. After a 4 hour long phone conversation, this is what I know: He and his ex were long distance and broke up because he took an internship in his hometown rather than finding one where she is. Since I brought up his ex that one night (really wish I hadn't) he's realized that he misses her, or at least the idea of her, and is now trying to decide if he wants to move up there after he graduates and try to be with her or to get a full time job with the company he's with now and be closer to his family (and obviously this option would involve me but I told him not to make me a factor in something so important when our relationship is so new).

I'm at a loss for what to do. I'm really really hurt that he may still has feelings for his ex, and have no idea what advice I can give him other than he needs to figure out if he just misses her since they haven't been broken up long and what would be their anniversary is coming up, or if he actually wants to be with her. He doesn't know, and obviously I don't know. Even worse is that I want to be there for him, but listening to him talk about the situation is breaking my heart. I know he likes me a lot, but I can't compete with the memory of someone he was with for two years and planned a future with and he can't move forward with me until he knows how he feels about her. On one hand I'm afraid of pulling away because 1. he really needs someone to talk to right now and at the very least I can be a good friend to him and 2. If he decides that he doesn't want to be with her and is just doing the normal mourning after the end of a relationship, I don't want to ruin my chances of there being an us. On the other hand, obviously this is killing me and even if he does chose to stay in his hometown, how can I feel like anything other than the consolation prize? And if I keep getting close to him, it's only going to hurt me more if he chooses to be with her....

---

**tl;dr**: The guy that I've been dating for a few month may want to get back together with his ex from a long term relationship. I have no idea how to be there for him, if I even *should* be there for him, and no idea where we stand. Please help. "
1it5k0,329,2013-07-22,I want you to stop. I've gone 44 days without PMO and brought on myself a tsunami of new energy.,sark9,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1it5k0/i_want_you_to_stop_ive_gone_44_days_without_pmo/,"Hi everyone,

this is my first post and I've gone 44 days without PMO. Like most people I started watching porn at the age of 13 or 14. Since then, I've watched porn many times a week, sometimes masturbating several times a day.

Today it's my 21st birthday. My social anxiety forced me to stay at my college dormitory most of the time and even when some social event came up, I turned it down, saying ""Sorry, I got to study, exams coming up soon"". But I never studied, I was lying to the people and to myself, I was looking forward to the prospect of me being alone at the dorm and I just fapped to porn till I had enough. And even if I went to a social event, my social anxiety blocked my speech and I was unable to make the first contact, especially to the girls. I'm 21 years old now and I've never had a girlfriend, I tried but several times I was rejected which caused my low self-esteem. Because of masturbation I even rejected two girls who showed an interest in me. I started ignoring them and eventually lost them. I regret my past behavior and I have to accept the consequences. My behavior was foolish and pathetic. Since then a lot has changed - I’ve been 44 days free.

**MY JOURNEY:**
==
**1ST WEEK:**
The first week was certainly the hardest. There were many temptations on the second day, especially in the shower, but I managed.

I was reading a lot of the stories here on reddit and yourbrainonporn.com. The stories increased my motivation and determination to get through the challenge effortlessly.

On day 5 I noticed my confidence got UP and when I went shopping, I was going down the street with my head held high like a Mr President.

On day 7 I was having a lunch with my family in a restaurant and I told them a good joke and all of us had a good laugh. I was really surprised at my behaviour. I never told jokes before.

**2ND WEEK:**
I was more positive and confident. I started exercising - running on a elliptical machine, doing pus-ups and sit-ups.

I broke my life-record. I did 85 push-ups, not at one go, but I did 20 push-ups, then rested for a minute, again 20 push-ups, rested, and so on. I never thought I could do so many.

On day 11 - I caught myself starting a small talk with the receptionist at my college dorm.

On day 12 - I contacted my two friends from high-school, they are both girls. We went for a pizza together.

Day 14 - I almost relapsed because I went online to chat with people and after several minutes it led to a sexting, which got me horny. But when I realized what I was doing, immediately I turned off the computer, got dressed and went out to see my grandparents at their cottage. At least I was in the company of people and that brought the urges down.

**3RD WEEK:**
I started wearing contact lenses, which made me feel good about myself. I met several people, had nice conversations, basically I was the one leading the conversations.

I saw a movie “The Pursuit of Happyness” with Will Smith starring - I can highly recommend it! Inspirational and motivational at the same time.

On day 21 I was feeling a bit depressed and moody. I started exercising to lift my mood and it really helped.

**4TH WEEK:**

While studying I am also an intern in one company, on this week they offered me a promotion but I had to decline the offer. My decision was not, however, irrational. I did a lot of thinking.

My sister asked to go party with her and meet her friends. So I DID go with her and had a great time meeting amazing people. The next day my sister told me I was pretty cool at the party. I was saying hi to the people first. I was the initiator of many conversations and people practically liked me.

**5TH WEEK:**

My will to do things increased tremendously. When I want to do something, I just do it. I procrastinate less than before. I watch TV shows less and I read more.

**6TH WEEK:**

Totally by accident I spilled a cup of coffee all over the floor. Funny thing happened. It didn’t make me angry or anything. I just laughed at myself being clumsy and went back to having a good time. 

I learned that it is us who make the decisions, nobody else. It is totally up to you how you react to the things that happen to you. 

On day 40 I was so energetic and happy. Before I was even anxious to make a simple phone call. Now I’m not afraid anymore. I just stepped out of my comfort zone!

On day 42 my sister asked me if I want to go to a music festival with her and her friends. I said YES. It will be great to get out of the house. I will be sleeping in a tent. I haven’t done than in years. I’m so looking forward to it. I might meet some cool girls there.

**7TH WEEK - NOW!**

Today on July 22nd it’s been 44 days. I am doing extremely fine. I’ve been reading a lot, boosting my vocabulary, listening to great songs, watching meaningful movies, going out meeting people (more than before), smiling a lot.

The great thing is that I’m not afraid to travel anymore. Now I just get on the train and go somewhere.

I must say that my life has changed so much in the last 44 days and the first person I would like to thank is Mr Zimbardo, the famous American psychologist. I found his book on Amazon by accident - The Demise of Guys - I bought it immediately and was dumbstruck at the effects the porn has on the brain. I watched his video on Ted talk site, I did some research, found yourbrainonporn site and eventually this reddit. So thank you every one!
 

### Books I must recommend:

* The Demise of Guys - Zimbardo - he talks about the effects of porn and computer games on the human brain

* The Four Agreements - Miguel Ruiz - this book changed my life as well. It describes why we do what we do. It changes your view of the world.

* Think and Grow Rich - Napoleon Hill - another great book, some really great chapters even on masturbation (called Sexual Transmutation)
[http://www.sacred-texts.com/nth/tgr/tgr16.htm](http://www.sacred-texts.com/nth/tgr/tgr16.htm)

Then read any books you want to increase your vocabulary, to become a better conversationalist. I recommend getting a Kindle or any e-book reader so that you can read anywhere.



### Activities that helped me get through the first days:

* Exercising - running on a treadmill for at least 40 minutes.
* Doing push-ups and sit-ups
* Boxing - this was really helpful and effective. Recommended for everyone.
* Reading books - reading personal growth books always cheered me up
* Getting out of the house, even if you wander the streets, it’s still better than sitting in front of your computer
* Reading famous quotes (there are many motivational quotes)
* Contacting friends you haven’t seen in a long time
* Watching meaningful movies - The Pursuit of Happyness, Lo Impossible (about family surviving tsunami) - I shed several tears at the end of the movie, Million Dollar Baby (inspirational boxing movie), Yes Man (Jim Carrey comedy)
* Read something about positive thinking :) When I was feeling angry or just low, I started repeating positive affirmations and it really helped to boost my confidence! See this video [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAv8u4FhcoE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAv8u4FhcoE)
* Do something you wanted to do for years. I learned to tie a tie for example :) I never knew how to do that, always had to ask my father to do it for me.
* Learn languages :) I started learning French and have been making good progress already :)
* Make others feel special by giving compliments
* Stop using Facebook, use it only in emergency. It's much better to do face-to-face conversations :)
* Learn how to dance - girls will appreciate that!
* Be proactive as much as possible - take responsibility for your actions :)
* A lot of people recommend taking a cold shower when having urges :)
* Get out of your comfort zone as much as possible! [Here are some tips.](http://personalexcellence.co/blog/ask-celes-comfort-zone/)
* Learn to cook some delicious meals. Not only will it make your mood better because you've learned something new, but also your partner will appreciate it :)
* Get better at non-verbal communication - this is really useful. I mean it's so great when you talk to someone and you spot microexpressions on their faces. You can see their mood (happiness, anger etc.), you can see if they are lying, you can see if they disagree with you but are afraid to tell you :) To be good at non-verbal communication, I recommend watching the TV Series Lie to Me, which is based on the actual research of a psychologist Paul Ekman and it's 90 % accurate :)

**I think the KEY to my SUCCESS and why I managed to go 44 days without any major problems is the realization of the effects the porn has on your brain. When you understand what happens to the brain, it will certainly help you get through the urges or temptations to masturbate. Whenever the urges come, think of the effects and you will be fine.**

That of course doesn't mean I will stop. I have committed myself to do NOFAP my whole life. I will make my uture girlfriend really happy. I can already see my future without any relapses.

I will write an update when I reach the day 90 and tell you about what's new and what happened in my life :)

Have a great day fellas!!"
1ispbz,147,2013-07-22,[Series] PMM eats a cow is vanquished by a small child,jerserkerp,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1ispbz/series_pmm_eats_a_cow_is_vanquished_by_a_small/,"Hello, my dear PMM and PDDs! (PDD is the male form of PMM, also the name of a fluffy league player, but that's not pertinent in this story.) I've been at work for the past week as well as attending intern training and seminars, so I haven't had a lot of time to observe the PMM in its natural habitat. 

Although I've found a rather alarming amount of junk food wrappers strewn around my house, that's the extent of my interactions with her since I work from 9-6 and get home at around 7 and am usually too tired to even deal with her, so I go to my room and finish whatever work my company decides to send to me, go over my work for the next day, and then work out in my room, shower, and sleep.

However, this weekend was my grandmother's birthday, and I decided that, since I was making a relatively stable and decent amount of money (for a college freshman, I'm pretty satisfied by anything above minimum wage) and decided to take her and the family out to lunch because she's awesome and she raised me when I was little. 

My grandma is tiny--perhaps peaking at around 5'0"" and recently fought off breast cancer as well as some pancreatic issues (completely healthy now, tough little woman) and she's also a huge fan of steak, preferably extremely rare steak. I took the family (including PMM) to a famous Shanghai steakhouse, Bullfighter. This is where PMM eats a cow and much more. 

&gt;Be me, 18/f/5'5""/105lbs

&gt;Grandma's birthday, steak lunch aww yis

&gt; Grandpa, aunt, uncle, cousin, and PMM tag along

&gt;Had to go with mentor to meet business client earlier

&gt;Take cab to restaurant

&gt;Get out of cab

&gt;Cab behind me pulls up

&gt;Out comes PMM alone

&gt;Uhh, I had a cab sent for grandma, not you

&gt;The restaurant is ten minutes away walking distance

&gt;Grandma just got out of surgery, I don't want her walking in heat

&gt;On her birthday

&gt;Called for a cab earlier before I left for work

&gt;Why is PMM in cab

&gt;Without grandma

&gt;WTF.jpg

&gt;""Oh she said she wanted to walk so I took the cab""

&gt; Uh no I don't think so

&gt;I think **you** wanted the cab and grandma was too nice to refuse you

&gt;Also she could've fit in the car too why didn't you bring her

&gt;*Well she said she wanted to walk*

&gt;Ok lardtubbins

&gt;By now I'm livid

&gt;It's 90 degrees (roughly 34-35 for you non 'muricans) out with humidity

&gt;You did **not** just make a 80+ year old woman walk here in this heat

&gt;On her birthday 

&gt;While you took your tubby ass over in a cab not meant for you

&gt;Cab is still parked next to us

&gt;ohfuckno.zip

&gt;She didn't even *pay* for the cab not meant for her

&gt;Looks at me expectedly

&gt;""Aren't you going to pay for the cab?""

&gt;Uh, I wasn't the one who carted my tubby ass five minutes over in a car not ordered for me

&gt;I'm not fucking paying for your entitled, fat ass

&gt;She tells me she doesn't have money

&gt;Ok

&gt;I pay for her cab because the poor driver had to deal with the fat terror and I feel bad

&gt;Don't even talk to her

&gt;Go to the plaza and take the stairs to the second floor where the restaurant is

&gt;Of course PMM takes the elevator

&gt;It's fucking one flight of stairs

&gt;Fucking ugh

&gt; Grandma somehow got here already

&gt;Waiting with aunt and uncle and grandpa

&gt;Well I guess the car was crawling because of the terrible weight it was bearing

&gt;I give my name for reservations

&gt;Wait for PMM because everyone has to be present to be seated

&gt;Sludge of pasty fat slowly makes its way out of elevator

&gt;Small child bursts out from side of her fat

&gt;Takes her time getting over to us

&gt;Despite the fact that everyone is waiting on her

&gt;Doesn't say hi to anyone

&gt;Doesn't tell my grandma ""Happy Birthday""

&gt;Stands there sulking because she knows I'm angry at her

&gt;Ok whatever, grandma's birthday, I want her to be happy

&gt;Get seated

&gt;Menus all around

&gt;Everyone is ordering

&gt;I'm helping my younger cousin with the menu

&gt;She likes the pretty pictures

&gt;Waiter comes around

&gt;Holyshitthisman

&gt;Early 20s, college student, attractive AF

&gt;PMM seems to think so too

&gt;Eyes are bulging out of her fleshy face

&gt;Tries to start flirting

&gt;Charm.on

&gt;Vomit.ready

&gt;Hair twirling, non-existent eyelash batting, smexyface

&gt;Ohgod.no

&gt;Waiter is also about to puke

&gt;Takes our orders

Now, I'm going to explain how BullFighter works. They have a ""meal deal"" kind of program where you order the steak and there are unlimited drinks, appetizers, desserts, salads, soups, you name it. Don't get ahead of me. I'm getting there.

&gt;I order the New York Strip, rare for myself with a side of garden salad and a iced cucumber water

&gt;I also order for my little cousin, get the smaller steak (I'm not clear what it exactly was, but it was basically marinated filet mignon). I spoil my cousin, she's tiny, it's ok. 

&gt;Everyone around the table orders, adds at most an appetizer, a soup, and a drink

&gt;No one orders dessert yet, the waiter will take those later

&gt;Or not.

&gt;PMM begins to order

&gt;Waiter braces himself for impact

&gt;PMM orders the deluxe filet mignon (two steaks, huge platter), medium. Orders cream of corn soup, cream of mushroom soup, garlic bread, buttered rolls, potato and shrimp salad, chocolate cake, cheesecake, caramel pudding, blueberry mousse, and creme brulee. Also orders a large watermelon juice.

&gt;Everyone else at the table is staring

&gt;Waiter is also staring

&gt;Opens his mouth to speak, decides otherwise in case he is swallowed by the behemoth

&gt;""I'll be back with your food shortly""

&gt;Everyone is chatting around the table

&gt;Grandma's having a good time with her grandchildren, happily showing off the black pearl necklace I had given her last night

&gt;Little cousin is happily coloring on her placemat (and occasionally stabbing my arm) with her crayons

&gt;PMM is sulking again because no one is paying attention to her

&gt;I guess everyone is peeved about the taxi incident

&gt;She kicks me under the table

&gt;WTF.WUT

&gt;""Oops sorry^teehee""

&gt;Are you fucking kidding me

&gt;I know you did that on purpose

&gt;Ignore her

&gt;She kicks me three more times

&gt;Food finally comes

&gt;PMM's attention has been diverted from destroying my shin to the food

&gt;Poor waiter is being buried with food

&gt;Hands out salads, soups, and drinks

&gt;I'm eating my salad and making sure my little cousin doesn't wear her soup bowl as a hat

&gt;PMM is on full hambeast mode

&gt;No tact whatsoever

&gt;Scarfing food down

&gt;Bits of soup and bread flying everywhere

&gt;She finished her two soups, bread, and potato salad faster than me. I'm halfway through my salad.

&gt;Now has her piggy eyes fixated on the little cousin's garlic bread

&gt;""Is she going to finish that""

&gt;Are you fucking kidding me

&gt;""She doesn't need that much food""

&gt;You don't either, love

&gt;I'm sure your arm alone weighs more than she does

&gt;Little cousin is a sweet thing

&gt;Offers her bread to PMM

&gt;PMM doesn't even say thank you

&gt;Snatches it up

&gt;Swallows it whole

&gt; Everyone else is just staring in different degrees of disgust and disbelief

&gt;Aunt tells her she should save some space for her steak

&gt;PMM glares at aunt as if she killed her firstborn and rubbed the blood all over her face

&gt;""What are you saying I'm fat?""

&gt;Aunt doesn't even blink

&gt;""No I'm just saying you shouldn't eat so much before the steak arrives""

&gt;""YOU'RE SAYING I'M FAT""

&gt;I'm not even sure how that logic works

&gt;Aunt just rolls her eyes and goes back to showing her daughter some cartoon on her phone

&gt;PMM starts sulking again because people are still ignoring her

&gt;Steak arrives

&gt;MM, bloody meat

&gt;Delicious delicious meat

&gt;I start cutting the steak for my little cousin

&gt; PMM cuts into her steak

&gt;I'm surprised she didn't just unhinge her jaw and swallow it whole

&gt;Roars in indignition

&gt;*This steak is raw*

&gt;I look over

&gt;Steak is barely pink in the middle

&gt;I mourn the death of such good meat

&gt;""No, PMM, that's medium, just eat it, it's good""

&gt;NO I'M GOING TO DIE BECAUSE IT'S STILL RAW

&gt;I show her my steak

&gt;Pretty much still raw, bleeding in places, delicious juicy meat

&gt;She huffs like she's doing me a huge favor

&gt;Takes a bite of her meat

&gt;*This is disgusting*

&gt;Takes another bite

&gt;*I can't believe I have to eat this*

&gt;Finishes both her steaks in record time while complaining the entire way through

&gt;I ignore her

&gt;Grandma's really happy with her food, that's all that matters

&gt;Little cousin is happily spearing her meat with her fork and eating it

&gt;I'm trying to enjoy my steak while PMM complains that's she's starving

&gt;You just ate two steaks

&gt;And a shitton of other food beforehand

&gt;You'll survive.

&gt;Everyone is pointedly ignoring her and enjoying their meal

&gt;PMM has her beady little eyes fixated on my little cousin's meat

&gt;Oh hell no

&gt;Little cousin finishes half of her steak

&gt;Puts her fork down

&gt;""She's done right, she's full, give that to me""

&gt;Are you kidding me

&gt;She puts her fork down for two seconds and you're on her ass 

&gt;Do you have no shame

&gt;I'm glowering at her, aunt pipes up

&gt;""OP, give PMM little cousin's steak, I don't want her to eat too much, she'll have a stomachache, it's not good for kids to eat so much."" She directs the last line specifically at PMM

&gt;At the behest of food, PMM doesn't notice

&gt;Snatches up the platter

&gt;Pushes her meat around a little

&gt;""I can't eat this shit""

&gt;Hails over the waiter with a rude wave of her hand

&gt;Shoves the platter in his face

&gt;""Go cook this again""

&gt;Are you fucking *kidding* me

&gt;I had cut the steak into little pieces. PMM wants the waiter to bring up a shredded steak to cook again

&gt;Waiter is gracious, brings platter back to the kitchen

&gt;Brings it out again after ten minutes

&gt;Meat is grey and tough, I cry silently for the loss of such good food

&gt;PMM spears all of the dead food

&gt;Cleans plate in seconds

&gt;By now everyone else is done with their meals

&gt;Waiter comes over to clear table and take dessert orders

&gt;PMM orders another chocolate cake on top of her behemoth order in the beginning of our meal

&gt;Waiter swings by ten minutes later with desserts and after-meal coffees

&gt;I share a creme brulee with the little cousin because I'm not a fan of sweets and she can't finish one herself

&gt;Also ordered a small hot cappuccino for myself, drinking that while everyone else is enjoying their desserts

&gt;PMM is scarfing her bakery of cakes, mousses, and puddings

&gt;Everyone is disgusted

&gt;Waiter comes around with the check

&gt;Oh god he's cute

&gt;PMM is once again trying to flirt

&gt;Even less affective because she's covered in chocolate sauce and remnants of blueberry mousse

&gt;Waiter tries very hard to not cry

&gt;I go to the front register/bar to pay the bill

&gt;Cute waiter is there

&gt;Asks if PMM is my sister

&gt;ohHAILno

&gt;""Oh, haha, I didn't think so, you two are so different""

&gt;I will take that as a compliment

&gt;Thanks for dealing with our large table, etc, etc

&gt;We're chatting while I'm signing the receipt, punching in my pin, etc

&gt;He eventually tells me his name and asks to scan my QQ code (it's a QR code that works for a social networking site similar to facebook).

&gt;Aww yis

&gt;Cute boy

&gt;Tells me he'll talk to me when we both have time

&gt;Hurhurhur

&gt;I get back to the table, everyone is packing to leave

&gt;I leave a tip under the plate even though a China doesn't tip

&gt;He had to see PMM

&gt;I'll tip you for that

&gt;Plus you're cute hee^hee

&gt;PMM waddles out of the restaurant empty handed

&gt;Everyone else is carrying Grandma's bags, umbrella, etc.

&gt;Even my little cousin has a little bag she's carrying for grandma

&gt;Come on, you're a pig

&gt;Waits impatiently for everyone at the door, huffing and puffing like we're a huge inconvenience

&gt;Aunt and Uncle go with grandma and grandpa downstairs to hail a cab and go home

&gt;I'm taking the little cousin to pick out a cake for grandma's birthday

&gt;PMM wants to take the taxi too

&gt;I tell her the only way she's going to get a taxi is if she walks to the bakery with me (which is, by the way, in the same indoor shopping mall as the restaurant, just on a different floor) first

&gt;She immediately starts sighing like I asked her to give me a kidney or something

&gt;""Fine, that's such a pain in the ass though""

&gt;No, you're a fucking pain in the ass

&gt;Say goodbye to aunt, uncle, and grandparents

&gt;Go to bakery

&gt;Have little cousin choose cake

&gt;She chooses the cream one with the pink roses and whipped cream

&gt;Ok, I guess grandma's going to be a princess today

&gt;No problem

&gt;I have the cashier wrap up the cake and go to pay

&gt;Counter is small, so I ask PMM to hold the cake for two seconds

&gt;Glares at me and tells me to have the youngest hold the cake

&gt;Are you fucking KIDDING me

&gt;She's five. She can't hold a cake the size of her head

&gt;Huffing and puffing starts again, muttering under her breath, but lifts the cake for two fucking seconds while I pay

&gt;I pay for the cake, get the candles, and take the cake back

&gt;I give my blazer to my little cousin to hold so I can hold the cake

&gt;Little cousin wants to visit the hello kitty store one floor down

&gt;Ok, why not, you've been good

&gt;PMM is moaning and groaning that she's too hot and she's tired and her feet hurt and she wants to go home

&gt;We're sitting in a AC shopping mall, she's wearing tennis shoes

&gt;I've been running around in four inch heels because I didn't have time to change my shoes after meeting with the client 

&gt;Shut up

&gt;Bring little cousin to hello kitty store

&gt;She's squealing and running around

&gt;Pulling me around by the bottom of my dress 

&gt;PMM is yet again sulking

&gt;She looks like the fat Batz-Maru statue sitting in the corner of the store

&gt; Little cousin is chattering to me about hello kitty characters and showing me the different stuffed animals and little kiddie bracelets

&gt;She's doing the kid thing where she's not-so-subtly hinting she wants something

&gt;Ok, I'll bite

&gt;End up buying a little hello kitty mermaid doll and some random beaded bracelet thing

&gt;PMM is now livid because apparently we're wasting her time

&gt;Wasting your time to do what, go home and eat some more?

&gt;Ok, ok, let's go

&gt;Little cousin is happily playing with her doll while carting around my blazer on her head

&gt;She looks like a little darth vader

&gt;PMM is yet again empty handed

Sorry guys, apparently it's getting too long. I'll add the rest of it in the comments section, sorry about that. :c

I (19F) just discovered this subreddit and felt instantly relieved about how many are having similar experiences. My boyfriend (19M) and I go to the same college so I have him for most of the year. Due to the fact it is summer, we aren't able to be together. His home is in California, but he is in Ohio for an internship this summer. So he is only an 8 hour drive away! We have visited each other twice already this summer and it was wonderful. In only 6 days, my family and I will be driving to pick him up. Then we are going to Cedar Point for a few days. Then we will drive back to my home. After that my boyfriend and I will head up to Chicago for Lollapalooza! Once Lolla is over, we will sadly part ways until I move into my apartment at college on August 24th. So even though it wasn't bad this summer, I know it will get harder the next few due to the fact he will probably stay in California. I don't know what the future will hold. But we will get to that when the time comes. I just wanted to share my excitement and wish luck to everyone! "

I just graduated from Comp Engg and am applying to colleges in the US and Netherlands for my Masters in CS (Fall 14). My academics are strong, and I have done 2 internships, but they weren't 100% technical. The colleges I'm applying to are among the top 50's in the US, and one of the top 3 in Netherlands.

Now my questions- will it be easy for me to find a job there after graduating, assuming I keep up my grades? I know CS grads have loads of opportunities available to them, does this ring true for citizens of other countries? I'm a Sri Lankan national.

Are there certain states/cities that are better suited for CS students (California, New York, Washington etc)?

I am applying to those 2 countries as I believe they offer more scope for knowledge, research and career growth compared to my own country. Additionally, US education is a lot more expensive and I'd hate to be stuck with a student loan and no job prospects on graduating. Any advice is welcome.

Thanks!"
1isjjm,3,2013-07-22,Negotiating starting salary at top/huge companies?,throwaway402935,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1isjjm/negotiating_starting_salary_at_tophuge_companies/,"I've heard some people say it's very difficult/near impossible to negotiate starting salaries at the bigger companies like MS/Google/Amazon since they have set packages for new employees, but I've also heard people say it happens often. 

I'm at a rising senior at a top 3 cs university.  I'm interning for one of the big-name companies (Google/FB/MS/Amazon/Apple/etc) this summer and will be considering full-time options for after graduation soon. The only reason I mention this is that I'm curious if these facts make any difference to the negotiation potential.

1. Is it possible/realistic to negotiate starting salaries at the larger companies (MS/Amazon/Google)?

2. What if I my internship goes well and the company extends a full-time offer, would there be more room for negotiation then?

3. Is the situation any different for medium-size companies like FB/LinkedIn?

4. I'm assuming there is often more leeway for negotiation at small companies, but one also shouldn't necessarily expect the higher salary offers that the big names offer right off the bat anyway, right?

Unrelated Bonus: In terms of big-name companies, I know salaries tend to be higher by x% in Silicon Valley vs. Seattle because of cost of living, but with those higher salaries taken into consideration, which area is the better deal financially in your opinion?


Thanks for reading!"
1isdmg,4,2013-07-21,Underwhelmed in high school,puurbliss,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1isdmg/underwhelmed_in_high_school/,"I'm going to major in CS and I'm entering 12th grade. I'm really excited for this career and I was inspired by many people in it. 

I took AP CS (Java) and I went to a summer camp on computer science. I've been into computers all my life but I don't know what else. I don't know how to use Linux, I don't know anything other than Java, I don't hack anything in my free time... I'm just a good student who feels like her 4.0 is nothing. 

So I don't know anything more. I scored an interview at Microsoft but I didn't get the internship. Another internship passed me at Caradigm (another girl at my school got it). I didn't apply, thinking I needed to teach myself SQL... then the listing disappeared.

People think I'm on the right track, but I'm just not far enough.

Am I on track to get a degree in CS, as a high schooler? What can I do now to look more competitive when applying for internships? I don't want to fall behind... What should I learn? What can I do?"

I work as an intern at this company that is directly relates in my major.  There might even be a good chance that I get a full time job there after I graduate in 2 years.

There's this girl that works there.  She's 23.  She's a full time employee doing what I will be doing when I graduate.  Obviously, I like her.  I think she might like me too.  But I'm not sure.  I'm good at talking to her but I don't know what signals I've gotten from her.

She comes over and talks to me at the office and I do the same with her.  If I don't go over to her by lunch time she will call me out on it.  The other day we were talking and she was telling me how she doesn't have many friends here and never does anything on the weekends.

Was that a signal that I should have taken that she wanted to hang out with me?  Should I have pursued it?  How exactly would I ask her to hangout and maybe see if this can become a relationship?

Is any of this even a good idea considering the work situation?  I mean, I'm an intern and she's a full time employee.  If she says no and I got completely mixed signals, then this could be a real awkward experience and this job never works out.  If she says yes and we somehow start dating, then that could be a conflict of interest at work.  I'm just an intern though.  Would she even go for me?

Really any advice would be much appreciated."

1iwyj0,4,2013-07-23,What to do now after the breakup with my (22m) girlfriend (22f) of 2.5 years.,throwdisawayokay,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1iwyj0/what_to_do_now_after_the_breakup_with_my_22m/,"So about a month ago my (22m) girlfriend (22f) of 2.5 years broke up with me. She sorta said she thought we had become more like friends, like she wasn't excited to hang out with me anymore. We both just graduated college and are about 20 mins apart now, after basically living with each other for the last three school years. I think one problem was we were a little too codependent at school, and when we moved home she kinda realized that the relationship was just habit more than anything else. Another thing to keep in mind, this is both of our very first relationships.  We were very in love, we would spend days together, we were each other's ""firsts.""

The thing is, initially I thought I somewhat agreed, and although I was miserable about the breakup, I thought she had a point.  We got along better than two people I've ever known, but we were somewhat of an opposites attract situation.  I guess if you asked me years before to describe my future girlfriend, it would've been quite different than this girl, even though during the relationship I was pretty sure I would be with her forever.  I think as someone with divorced parents, I recognized that even if this wasn't like my absolute dream girl, I knew that I finding something that good was rare, even if it wasn't a perfect match.  I know it sounds fucked up but I was really content with someone who I considered ""good enough""  

Fast forward to now, we just came back from a camping trip with friends. (we've been trying ""just friends,"" since our friends are all the same, we'll be seeing each other at least each other once a week all of next year for an internship kind of thing, hard to explain, but NC isn't an option.)  I spill the fact that at some point I'd really like to try it again. 

Over the past month I'd realized a bunch of smaller reasons I pushed her away, and I brought those things up. They were honestly very fixable things, and I told her I think things would be a lot better if we tried it again. Our relationship was pretty damn near perfect besides a few little petty things that I was just weird about. (I avoided doing things with her family, I sometimes acted like I didn't care if we spent holidays together, I didn't embrace some hobbies of hers she wanted me to try, etc)  Overall I think I was a good boyfriend, but the more I looked back the more I realized I was sometimes just a little selfish about things that were important to her.

She admitted the little things did add up and in fact cause the breakup and her loss of feelings, but didn't want to try again because she's content as friends and she still doesn't know if the excitement will come back and she doesn't want to hurt me again.  One thing I know for sure is that she is an absolutely GREAT person, and I know breaking up killed her even if she wasn't in love with me, she still loved me and didn't want to hurt me.

After a month apart, I'm 100% sure I want her back and I know we could make it work. Everything I thought initially about this maybe being a good thing is completely gone. While dating I wasn't completely sure she was the one for me (but I knew things were good enough that I'd never break up with her, that sounds weird, I know.) but now I am.    But by now she's content the way things are and won't give it another shot. She wants to move on.

I know Reddit really likes to tell everyone to move on and find someone new, so I know what I'm getting myself into, but I had to write this out, at least for me.  I took things for granted and didn't realize what I had, and even though things could be fixed, she's pretty clear on the fact that she's just content the way things are.

Since the breakup we've texted every few days, just small talk nothing more.  Before we dated we were friends, so even if nothing ever happens again I hope I can get over her and still be her friend.  When we're together, we still get along super great, we joked and talked to and from our camping trips 5 hour drive.  She insists she doesn't want to get back together, she thinks if it was meant to happen, it'll happen again eventually, but I think she means after moving on and seeing other people.


TL;DR

I was selfish and only considered my girlfriend ""good enough"" and I think I pushed her into breaking up with me.  I now realize what I lost and want to make it work, but she wants to move on.  What should I do?

I have been in tears all day, and I just need to... talk?  Vent?  Whatever this is.

I am living with some family right now, but I can't find a job, and I owe them a bunch of money.  I have a deadline for an internship application coming up (which I really, *really* want to do, plus it pays!) but every time I sit down to do the cover letter, all I can think is I'm not good enough, and they won't give it to me anyway, and then I burst into tears agin and can't write it.  

I just want to talk to somebody, but my mom called last night to chat, and while I was explaining how I was feeling a little low because my best friend just landed his dream job (I am incredibly happy for him.  I really am.  I just have spent the last 3 months unemployed, and it just kinda hit close to home), she told me to quit feeling sorry for myself.  So now I feel like I can't call her, and everybody else is busy.  

I am just so scared.  I feel like I'm stuck in a rut, and I'm trying to get out, I really am, I just don't know what else to do.  "

[Hey sounds like a fantastic way to get rid of your debt. What type of issues do you repair/what are your limitations? Do you offer any warranty on the work? Finally, what is your screening process for employees? Work that puts people near personal data can be risky. Keep up the great work. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8mvof?context=5)|We repair absolutely everything that can be repaired. Believe it or not, even iPhones that have been run over (a surprisingly common occurrence) can be fixed most of the time. The biggest permanent killer is liquid damage where the phone had never been dried out.
 |We offer a 30 day warranty against defects with any repair.
 |As far as screening, I've only hired friends so far who I really trust. It's been a blast training them. As for the future when I hire non-friends, I will have to screen because data safety is super important and I think it isn't emphasized enough these days.
[""Oh shit bro that's awesome, can you change all my electronic devices into microwavable snacks?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8utcn?context=5)|Yes I can, bring me all the electronics in your house, I'll buy you anything you want at 711.
[How did you learn to fix the phones?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8nc4u?context=5)|Really the only way there is, taking one apart and putting it back together over and over. It all started when I was in high school and somebody gave me a broken iPod!  There's plenty of tutorials online, but many of them are TERRIBLE and skip crucial steps. However if you watch lots of them and have the phone in front of you, you'll get the hang of it.
[Very cool. To follow that up, can most of the phones be fixed without replacing parts, or do you have to find replacement parts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8pp0l?context=5)|I can usually fix buttons without replacing parts, but I need to find replacement parts for cracked screens and such. Finding reliable parts is terrible, by far the hardest part of the job. I have to stay up at like 3am to talk to suppliers in China who know English at a pre-school level. I got a Christmas card sent to me from a supplier in June.
[Nods- That makes sense. Have you ever tried buying broken phones online or anything for salvage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8q7x3?context=5)|Yep, that's the plan with SellMyOldTech.com! The goal is to make it the easiest way to get money for old or broken devices by shipping pre-paid boxes with return labels. Buying phones on eBay to fix can be costly and unreliable since people lie a lot and there isn't much protection for people buying broken things.
[What would people lie about re: a broken device? Just wondering.  Any idea how hard a broken DSLR would be to fix, in general? Or is that question too open ended?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb961gy?context=5)|I was going to answer but oribia's answer is perfect! Sorry I don't know anything about repairing DSLRs, but I heard it's a good market.

 |Yes.
 |Did hot coeds ever flirt with me in hopes of getting a free phone fix?
 |No.
[Wow congrats! What sort of problems did the iPhones have? And when you first started out, was it hard to get people to trust you to fix their devices?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8n0iz?context=5)|[Link to fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net](https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/163445_1530243175953_5963660_n.jpg)
[Haha that does sound like a very nerve wracking way to gain people's trust but it's great to hear that it was worth it in the end!  were there any mistakes that you made when you first started out and what did you learn from them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8s8rt?context=5)|Thank you! As far as mistakes, the biggest was trusting other people's opinions. People will always try to discourage you. I had so much self-doubt that slowed me down and should not have been there. You're not gonna accomplish anything until you believe that you can.
 |Also have receipts for selling things. Before I had receipts this one evil girl sold me a phone and then told me she was reporting it stolen so she could pay her sorority fees. I had to give it back and take a $100 hit because she her lawyer dad threatened to sue me and I would not have had time to deal with it.
[How do you make a profit? I was under the impression that the screens are quite expensive. I tried to get my nexus 7 screen replaced recently and it would have cost less to buy a new one but of course I went to the manufacturer. Is there a cheaper place to purchase?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb944pn?context=5)|I'm not familiar with Nexus 7, but there's always cheaper places if you look hard enough!
[Wait... So she had a LAWYER dad who would take you to court for a phone all because she couldn't pay for her sorority fees?! What a giant jerk!!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8wyca?context=5)|Yep, I was really scared when it happened, hands down the biggest problem I've had with a customer. It really was a wake up call to me that not everyone is a good person.
[Dear god...Was it a UMBC sorority girl or UMD? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8w25o?context=5)|UMD. You know, this type: [Link to gawker.com](http://gawker.com/5994974/the-most-deranged-sorority-girl-email-you-will-ever-read)
[Still a biohazard. I just wouldnt do it. There's a reason why big companies like Dell dont.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8ru5h?context=5)|To make $70 in 15 minutes one might reconsider. But yeah it is gross! It's also not common, unless people aren't telling me the whole story...
[I would record all future interactions with customers if something like this happened to me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb97z6n?context=5)|Probably a good idea, but I feel like it could creep out customers. We did record the interactions of me returning the phone to her.
[Are you familiar with /r/Entrepreneur? We would love to have your input over there.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8pjyw?context=5)|I am not familiar with it, but I just checked it out and it looks awesome! I definitely will be internet chilling over there in the future.
[What kind of prices did you charge? Did you experiment with pricing as your reputation increased or stay at a fixed cost the whole way through? How did you reach these prices?  Interesting story man!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8ok1g?context=5)|Thanks :D I made sure to have the absolute lowest prices around, I could afford to since the business model is kids on bikes picking up/dropping off the phones instead of a store location. Experimented with changing prices for a week, but realized business is best when it's a no-brainer, aka being the cheapest with genuine parts.
[This is totally awesome, congratulations! Do you think society (American society, college, what have you\) is changing to encourage this kind of behavior? Did you run into a lot of bullshit trying to do things unconventionally?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8qn6k?context=5)|Thank you! I do not think the government encourages this kind of behavior. The amount I need to pay in permits and taxes is INSANE.  Nor did my college initially. When I applied to the business school I had already repaired hundreds of iPhones and was making good money, yet the admissions people did not care AT ALL. It's all about GPA when you're in college. And it's hard to get straight A's when you're working all the time, so it's a double-edged sword. But I think society encourages small businesses. If I could thank anyone it would be my customers aka society, the people who trusted and supported me enough to make this happen. They helped pay my tuition and there's nothing I've ever been more grateful for.
[What kinds of permits do you need?  Whom do you pay taxes to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb963zd?context=5)|Postal service permits, pay taxes to the state and federal government.
[Can you explain the postal permit? Why do you need it and what does it allow you to do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb9bzbx?context=5)|It's a $835 permit that allows me to send a pre-paid label. It was HELL to acquire, took over a month to get. It's new so most post offices still don't know what it is.
[So this permit allows you to send prepaid labels all over the US and internationally?  Is this $985 cost in addition to the cost of paying the postage for the labels?  I don't understand why they make you pay for a permit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb9j6qf?context=5)|Only US. It's actually $835, brain fart on my end, still super expensive though. It doesn't cover postage, it's just so you can send out return labels. Technically you can't without it since USPS requires you declare the day you ship something before you ship it. That won't work if you send someone a label in the mail.
[So what's the best way to dry out a wet phone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8or5d?context=5)|NOT RICE.  It has to be taken apart and submerged in alcohol immediately, then air dried. I cannot tell you how many people bring me phones they have had in rice for days, and then the inside is still soaking wet and corroded/destroyed. Especially bad when it is a sugary drink. Believe it or not if you powered off an iPhone, dropped it in water, then opened/dried it within an hour, it'll probably be fine and work for years to come. But don't try it haha.
[Would something like vodka or Everclear work in a pinch, or would you recommend sticking to a specific type (i.e. rubbing\) alcohol?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8qw7v?context=5)|RUBBING ALCOHOL! I should've clarified haha, do not use the kind that makes you drunk. I suppose it's kind of ironic most phones liquid damaged are beer/alcohol related, but it takes alcohol to fix them!
[What parts should be submerged? All?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb9465k?context=5)|I'd say everything but the screen, battery, and vibrator (lol yes they call it that)
[So where did you go to school and what was the value of the tuition? Did you have any scholarships, grants, etc.?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8oev6?context=5)|I go to University of Maryland. The only thing from classes that helped me was knowing basic math to make the algorithms on my site for pricing iPhones. Almost all other classes did not help at all. Intro marketing and Comm classes were the dumbest things I've ever seen.
 |UMD recently admitted me to their entrepreneurship program (it isn't a major, it's like extracurricular-ish) and it actually looks like it will be a great resource! UMD also published me in their official university publication for staff/alum, it was really cool to fix my professor's phones!
[You call making algorithms ""basic math?"" Boy, you college kids are smart. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8tbmc?context=5)|Nah dude it's really just high school algebra, I'm not that smart!
[Congrats!  Do you have any advice you can share on starting your own business either for college students or anyone who is interested in one day starting their own company?  Did you do a lot of planning prior to getting your business off the ground or was this something you were doing on the side for friends that eventually turned itself into the business it is now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8ovlk?context=5)|DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE IN YOU.
 |Hammer that into your head. I was devastated when I was rejected from my campus' business school. I applied for a business development program on campus, was rejected from that too and was even more depressed. I almost gave up entirely on business because nobody believed in me. Even my parents looked at me like I was nuts when I said I wanted to start one. So glad I did not give up, because now I have the highest grossing UMD student-run business of all time.
 |There wasn't much planning starting out, but when it started to take off it took A LOT of planning. It got to the point I was spending more time talking to customers and suppliers than fixing phones. Unfortunately I've had to pull all nighters working and then go to class many times.
[Congratulations on your success, your post is very inspirational and I am not even a business related major ;-\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb9izlm?context=5)|Thanks, I appreciate the kind words!
[Correction: You got into the business school but decided not to go. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8wfjb?context=5)|I was not accepted to the College Park business school, I'm not sure why you think that. I was actually accepted to the Shady Grove business school, but that is not on my campus so I would have to move and give up finishing my econ degree, so I could not do it.
[Ever have anyone come-a-knockin while you were makin the bed a rockin? Lol i would imagine you always were busy no?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8mj35?context=5)|Yeah I didn't have the social life everyone else did that year, but it was far from lacking. It's all about time management, you'd be surprised how much time you can make if you adhere to using a calendar religiously.
[Thanks! I always undercut the competition and I tell my customers I'll price match and beat by 15%. My only issue is that I don't have any money right now to buy a stock of parts, that is making it harder to do business. Damn ""takes money to make money"" and all that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8ra37?context=5)|A problem with price matching is there are people who use TERRIBLE counterfeit parts so can do it for what half you do. And they don't advertise they use counterfeits, so people will demand you match them because they don't understand. Only price match legitimate businesses.
[Did you ever mess up a customers phone? If so, what did you do to rectify it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8ra37?context=5)|One had a motherboard that started giving errors after a screen repair because it was liquid damaged and unplugging the connectors was enough to destroy it. I had to buy him a new iPhone the next day, it would have happened to whoever opened that phone, but it was my responsibility so I made right on it. Kinda sucked but it only happened once.
[If you encountered a customer whose phone had similar damage (i.e. whoever opens it to fix it is gonna be the one who breaks it,\) what would you do? Would you try to fix it anyway?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb966jf?context=5)|There's really know way to know how bad the inside of a phone is until it's opened. Most phones seem to have tripped water damage sensors anyway 
[Any ideas of expanding your business after you graduate? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8njhl?context=5)|Yep! That is what the plan for SellMyOldTech.com is. If I expand just doing repairs to other campuses, I'd be afraid of hiring someone far away to do something that involves lots of room for error. So this way I can have the devices directly mailed to me and people don't need to wait to go without their phones, since they are old phones. Then we can do repairs all day!
[Well done, sounds like you things worked out pretty well for you! But did this not take up a lot of your time? Where you still able to go out and do things with other college students?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8p0ui?context=5)|Thanks! It took up ALOT of time, but you'll adapt to using a calendar religiously. I was never an organized person but it forced me to be. It's not hard to spare a few hours on friday and saturday night if you stick to a calendar. But there were many times I pulled all nighters fixing phones/doing management work and had to go to classes the next day.
 |Even though I was a national finalist in the most recent TBS National College Comedy Competition, I pretty much had to give up on stand-up after the competition ended. Only a few shows a year now, but I love it.

[Wow, a business major who can do math?  You're gunna go far, son.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8npoa?context=5)|Nah I'm not! I'm econ because I didn't get into my college's business school haha.
[Will you adopt my baby?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8q89z?context=5)|Can he fight?
[I live overseas, how can I buy one from you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8nd5r?context=5)|The plan is to sell directly to wholesalers, so you may not be able to get one from me directly, but it could be a phone I fixed!
[Me too. We have something in common. Do you want to be my friend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8mipm?context=5)|Sure! Message me because I'm definitely curious to hear what you did!
[How did you put your business out there? in other words how did you spread the word, using social media, print advertisement,craigslist,etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8r5cb?context=5)|Originally Facebook and word of mouth! I then donated $500 to TerpThon, which went to kids with cancer, and this not only was an AWESOME cause, it brought a lot of publicity! Craigslist people are very hard to work with because many of them don't speak English well. I'm trying print ads soon!
[What's the best way to open an iphone/itouch/ipad without damaging the case?  Also, I'm an econ major too!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8plvv?context=5)|It varies from generation to generation, so I can't really give a general answer besides just to be careful. Some open easy, but then there's the first gen iPhone, good luck opening that without leaving a mark. It would be hard to pry that sucker open even with a machete.
[Thanks for the reply!  Do you get your replacement parts off Ebay, or somewhere else?  Do people ever say that it's official but it turns into a cheap knockoff?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8tn0r?context=5)|I get them from China. A lot of people say their stuff is official but it is cheap knockoffs. I may have to start offering the choice between knock offs and genuine parts because as someone using only genuine parts my price can't compete with people using knockoffs, and the people using knock-offs don't advertise they are knockoffs. A real iPhone 4S screen is 960x480 and many knockoffs are 480x320. It's dumb but most customers don't even care and aren't willing to pay more for a genuine ones, which is why unfortunately I must offer both.
[Do knockoffs usually break more often than official parts, or are they just generally not as good?  Also, do you go through a specific website or just pick and choose parts?  I wanted to fix a 2nd gen touch, but finding a replacement 8gb hard drive is impossible.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb99n4z?context=5)|Knockoffs break far more than original parts, there is actually no such thing as a 2nd gen iPod Touch hard drive.
[Thanks! So if the storage device on the 2nd gen isn't working, would I just replace the entire logic board?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb9c7n8?context=5)|That would work, but nobody ever does that because the logic board is the only thing in that device worth anything, so the cost of the board would be more than the cost of the device.
[Have you ever heard of the company Gophermods? They had a similar start as you, one kid fixed PS3's in his dorm, now they have two locations and repair smartphones, tablets, consoles and laptops. You should check then out. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8t8kv?context=5)|I have! I'm thinking of moving away from repairs. The new MacBook Pro's are superglued together on the inside and are near impossible to repair. Same with the HTC One, my current device. Not a good sign. Devices can be made cheaper and more durable if unrepairable, so that's my prediction of where the industry is going.
[What else are you planning on doing if you're moving away from repairs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb90itc?context=5)|I'm looking to go into selling them overseas, and if that doesn't work well I would love to start an elderly care home someday.
[Selling repaired phones or manufacturing new ones? (I assume repaired\) And good luck to you. either way, I'm sure you'll be a success!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb9ge5k?context=5)|Yep repaired phones!
[The Baltimore Sun? What school do you go to, if I may ask?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8t4o0?context=5)|No problem, I go to UMD! Transferred from UMBC.
[What are your suggestions for advertising on Facebook? Did you actually buy ads or just get your friends to share your posts? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb9bn40?context=5)|Friends liking posts. paid Facebook ads were sooo bad, literally drained money faster than my ex-girlfriend. It ended up being like $4 per click or something insane like that.
[Facebook ads are even worse than google ads. just so expensive for nothing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb9i80m?context=5)|Yessir, unfortunately I learned that the hard way...
[I have an iPod touch and a nexus 7 that have a specific issue. Sound will come out of just one ear bud. Although jostling it and holding it in place will sometimes make it work. Is this something I could even attempt to fix?  Maybe I should just send it to you since I'm at Umbc haha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb949z5?context=5)|Hey I used to go there!
 |Those would need to be soldered. I can fix the iPod and maybe the Nexus, pm me and I'll give you my info!
[I'll try a trial, if it doesn't work do you do a service where I ship you my phone and fix it for a price and then ship it back? I mean you seem like a straight shooter from reddit from what it sounds like, not trying to just gain an iPhone I would hopefully presume.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb9jfc9?context=5)|I don't do repairs over the mail usually since the demand is low as people don't like going without phones, but PM me and I'll see what I can do!
[ I'll try it at home. But a question before I go drenching my connector in alcohol. How should I do it so that the alcohol doesn't get to deep into the phone and mess other parts up? And then how do I dry the alcohol out after soaking?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb9lz4w?context=5)|Turn off the phone and use a toothbrush on the connector. I'd use canned air to dry it out. Try not to use too much alcohol, just enough to clean the connector. And if you're feeling brave, you can use an exacto knife to try to scrape grunge off the contacts.
[I've heard that if you have someone that isn't where you bought your ipod touch/phone from to fix your screen you lose your warranty. Do you lose any business from this ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8s4lh?context=5)|Apple doesn't check the warranty well, I've never done it but I have had a lot of customers who I've fixed there screens say their Apple warranty still worked. I also fix them at like 1/3 the price of Apple, so people don't seem to mind.
[Was this allowed at your school? Where I went, it was strictly against school policy to operate any sort of business out of your dorm room.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb915vc?context=5)|If I wasn't allowed then that is news to me haha. But to be honest I totally would've just ignored that rule and done it anyway.
[Did you end put creating an LLC or something like that? How much of a pain in the ass was that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8uqpy?context=5)|I'm a sole proprietor currently because I haven't turned in the LLC forms yet, but I will soon. It's pretty annoying, I know other small business owners use legal zoom but I have been told it's not worth it since there aren't THAT many forms.
[Woahhh i grew up in the same city that as you, and almost went to UMD. im starting a biotech company, and i was wondering how you started all the technical/legal aspects of your company (the website and LLC\). im assuming that you got a lawyer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8yas4?context=5)|Nice, congrats on starting a company! As far as the website, I did 99% of it myself. Had to learn a little CSS, html, etc but there were also plugins that made it a bit easier. As far as the legal stuff, since law is based on precedent I can just use the legal section that all the other repair sites use. I'm no legal expert but I then ran it by one of the UMD legal advisors and they said it looked good. Currently a sole proprietor until my LLC form goes through.
 |The biggest legal worry I have is people trading in stolen phones, which I am using CheckMEND for (that is the gold standard currently). No stolen phones yet, but if one ever does come up as stolen, the customer won't get their money and it will either be returned to them or given to authorities, as per our legal section.
[Who do you host your site with, and why did you pick them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb9c0k1?context=5)|Hostgator, as I had a friend who had pretty good luck with them.
[Have you had any problems with Apple? I assume you are not in any way authorized by them. Do you tell your customers that any warranty they have/had will be void once you finish working on their phone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb98xw0?context=5)|Nope, no problems with Apple. I tell customers the warranty is void, but they don't care usually because that's why they are coming to me in the first place. But I've been told by many people Apple still takes them even after I repair them.
[Hey man, i think you are doing something awesome! just wondering,has it ever occured to you to make a youtube channel for fixing iphones,androids,etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8uxin?context=5)|Thanks! I don't really encourage people to fix their phones themselves, a lot of people bring me iPhones they tried to repair and have permanently damaged things. Or they tear cables, lose screws, etc. and it makes my job a lot harder. I suppose I wouldn't know if they have repaired them successfully though because they wouldn't come to me.
[EDIT: I also have a psp with a messed up screen. do you fix them too? I would love to do buisiness with you sir ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8uxin?context=5)|And sorry but I do not do PSP's currently, as they can't really be repaired cheaper than it is worth. We do buy broken ones though!
[How hard is it to replace a touch screen? I have two broken devices: one, an iPod that went through the wash and destroyed the screen, and two, one that swam with me in a river.  The one that swam seems beyond repair because it gives 0 signs of life, but I got the first one to restore and has a functional battery/display, just no touch screen. File system seems intact too, wifi I can't speak for.  TL;DR: what goes into fixing a touch screen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8yyyp?context=5)|It is more likely a motherboard problem than a touch screen, and either way the cost of repairing an iPod usually exceeds what it is worth:( If you PM me the details of the generation of each iPod then I can try to help. We do buy them for parts though!
[How did you end up featured on the news? Did your reach out to them or how did they find out about you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb9nnjd?context=5)|They just found out about me! I think it was from someone's tweet 
[Where I went to school the dorms had explicit rules against running businesses from them. How'd you get around that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb94fzn?context=5)|If I wasn't allowed then that is news to me haha. But to be honest I totally would've just ignored that rule and done it anyway.
[Do you need any specific tools to do this job? I'm curious about your expenses going into this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8ynke?context=5)|Not too many expensive tools actually, I've been using a dollar store screwdriver for years. The expenses are essentially parts, permits, taxes. Parts are a lot, when you're doing several a day you need to have thousands of dollars in parts on hand, especially because it can take awhile to get them. You'd need several of every iPhone component from every current model, it's like a worst nightmare of a grocery list:/ Soon I'll probably have someone build a database to make it easier.
[Isn't there a bunch of dangerous chemicals inside of an Iphone? I have always wanted to learn how they work, I just don't want to poison my self with chemical x or something.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cba00jx?context=5)|I'm pretty sure that you should be fine as long as you don't touch any broken LCD liquid or anything leaking from a battery, but I'm not a scientist so who knows what kind of crap I exposed myself to:/
[How much would it cost to get all the tools to do this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb9e07j?context=5)|Very little, perhaps under $100. Unfortunately the cost of parts is where the risk is, as the parts are both hard to acquire reliably and fragile, plus need to be stocked in advance because of how long they take to get here from China.
[I'm tempted to just buy the tools. Then when it comes to replacement parts just make people wait for them to come in. Then just not charge extra for the parts until I start to get a decent profit/reputation. Your thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb9fn2y?context=5)|I tried that originally, but the issue was how high an amount of defective parts there are. The parts are pretty reliable assuming they come working, but you'll find yourself in lots of scenarios where the person will wait a week for the part to come and then you'll install it but it won't work. The older the iPhone, the harder it is to get the parts, as the real Apple ones are drying up and the counterfeits come defective a lot.
[I just submitted the info about my PSP for consideration! Very cool site, can't wait to hear back from you guys. How many employees do you have?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8yxyb?context=5)|Thanks! Mostly just me right now, but I have a marketing intern and people I trained who will be helping me repair them during the school year.

I actually use superglue on the buttons while Apple has a machine that crappily dabs a very small amount of glue, so it will be much more durable than the original.
[This kind of service is awesome when you don't want to spend a lot of money fixing/replacing a phone that you plan to upgrade when your contract is up. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8sjge?context=5)|Thanks for the kind words!

1iwucz,9,2013-07-23,"Struggling with School, can't motivate myself, medicine I've recently started taking is making things worse.",[deleted],ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1iwucz/struggling_with_school_cant_motivate_myself/,"Hey, r/ADHD. First post here after lurking the subreddit for a while. I need help, bad.

A little history:
I was diagnosed with ADHD-C when I was very, very young. Sometime during the 2nd or 3rd grade. I was immediately put on ritalin, and jumped back and forth between ritalin and adderall for several years until, between 9th and 10th grade, I had a major surgery on my back for scoliosis. I decided to take the rehab time to go off my meds and learn to be a productive human being without them. And it worked pretty well. High school rolls around and while it's a struggle at first I slowly managed to learn to harness all this nervous energy and bring my grades up (nothing amazing, mostly B's.). Then I take on a two-year internship, during which I start to develop some bad habits. Near the end of the two years I would find myself without any work to do and would spend hours browsing the internet and generally slacking off, and as a result got in the habit of doing this whenever I actually had real work to do. Internship ends, and I sign up for college. Just one class for now, to get the hang of things. During this time I had been taking an antibiotic to keep some acne I had around the still-sensitive scars on my back under control. Deciding it was time to start taking something to clear things up once and for all, I get a prescription for Isotretinoin(Accutane). Those of you who know about this stuff probably know, it's pretty hardcore. It has some serious side effects, and needs to be taken every single day for several months. Well, one of the side effects is 'Difficulty maintaining focus and concentrating'. Great thing for someone with ADHD, right?

It's been a few months, and I'm halfway through my Accutane treatments. I thought I could tough it out and just deal with it, but it's gotten to the point where I am constantly missing class because I don't have any of the homework done. I've started taking some vitamins that I've heard help with ADHD, and it is helping, but it's not enough. On top of that, when I finally manage to focus, I don't have the motivation to do anything with the focus. I'm at my wits end. I don't want to stop taking the Accutane when I'm so close to being done with it, but I don't want to fail this class. Has anyone who has been in this sort of situation give me some kind of advice to take control again?

**Tl;DR - Haven't been medicated for a long time. Was doing well until I took a drug for some painful acne that is making it harder to focus. Don't want to go off of it but I'm failing my college class.**"
1iwqkb,6,2013-07-23,Where should I spend money?,[deleted],SEO,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1iwqkb/where_should_i_spend_money/,"So about 3 months ago I got thrown headfirst into taking our 9 month old website for a large retailer from being completely unranked to ranked.  I had very limited experience w/ my own personal sites so basically I had to do a very fast crash course.

So far, so good.  We got involved w/ the BrightEdge platform (tracking 500 keywords) which initially was great, but now I'm finding it limited and end up ignoring recommendations half the time because they are going to do more harm than help i.e. spelling brand names wrong on landing pages in hopes of grabbing those who typo terms.

I made sweeping changes for anchor text, url, title pages to all items and updated ~1000 items out of the ~3k we carry online.  Tons of terms are popping into the first page of google now and/or making the slow climb from being unranked to 2-3 pages in and moving up each week.

Now sales have been up, budget is up, and there is money to be spent on SEO/SEM.  I've brought up buying more adwords, increasing more social media, blogging has been started, mobile site almost finished, increasing backlinks through partnership etc.

I just have no idea what would be most feasible and I'm not particularly afraid to try something even if it fails I just don't want to throw money away with blinders on.

My main pet peeve is getting terms that I can't get ranked anywhere on the radar moved.  I've been tweaking, changing, adding content etc. week in, week out and they refuse to move.  These are terms that go to big landing pages (think ""work boots"" would land on a page w/ all of our work boots) and I'm at a loss as to how to make it appear other than to pay for ads.

I do all the SEO practically by myself as well and basically I wear like eight hats otherwise and after I lose my interns in another month I might poop my pants.

What can I do now in the immediate that will give me some bang for the bucks available whether the return is sooner or over the course of the rest of our fiscal year?"
1iwkqz,13,2013-07-23,"In Regards to 'Proposal: Promote the Daily Writing 'Write Off, Write Now' posts to a new subreddit'",talkingbook,Screenwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1iwkqz/in_regards_to_proposal_promote_the_daily_writing/,"To the author of this post, let me say thanks for taking the time and energy to so eloquently express yourself about your feelings. 

You and the other posters bring up a great point and deserve to be heard. 

The thought of diminishing anyone's experience here is troubling at best, and upsetting at worst. This sub-reddit is and has been a valuable resource for writers/filmmakers worldwide. You'd be as surprised as I was to learn just how many working professionals frequent it in their down time. 

Now, about the 'Write Offs'. I won't say anything in their defense aside from what's been stated to me, for some of the writers who've participated, it's motivated them to get behind the keyboard for either their first time ever, or their first time in a long time. By design it's meant to be easily accessible and very low stakes. The fruit of these events is so ripe that it's hanging off the trees and dangling by a thin thread that requires nothing more than the lightest of touches before it's on your plate and delivering sustenance. There's feedback to be had but it's neither guaranteed nor mandatory. There are no elaborate rules or mandates aside from the very few designed to force the author to think on their feet. Regular participants of this exercise are going to be clutch when the next round of 48 hour film festivals rolls through their berg. There's even been something of a self appointed 'celebrity' judge, which to me is a bit like a barnacle on a ship telling the other barnacles they suck at being fish. But it's STILL awesome. As the old saying goes, iron sharpens iron, people sharpen people. 

The moderators, whom I've had no direct contact with, seem to be wisely assuming a wait and see posture. Apparently because this kind of endeavor springs up often enough to be a trend. Sort of like Neo was the 6th Neo and Zion was the 6th Zion (and now we're into Matrix sequel analogies...and we know how well those pictures worked out). The mod's know sooner or later the Matrix will reset itself and some intern at Slate, or Salon, or Huff Post will read Save the Cat for the first time and write an article bemoaning how all films are the same and then this sub-reddit will be about that. Also, in time, those writers will have kids, and those kids will be on the 2045 version of reddit complaining that the latest Hollywood Blockbuster Hologram, that's a gas you inhale, is tired and derivative, and that will be the subject de jour. So it goes, on and on, business as usual. 

Now, before that happens, while we're still in a comfy, cozy, transitional bubble that's fertile with creativity, I hope the consensus is we make hay before it pops. And to do that the name of the game is compromise. Actually, compromise is not the best word because it implies mutual sacrifice. I would rather propose mutual improvement. Benefit for all. So, perhaps instead of being segregated into a marginalized dark corner of an ALREADY marginalized dark corner, maybe it would be agreeable to streamline, compress, and improve the 'Write Off' experience. 

Provided writers still want to play the game and take the challenge, there's no reason 'Write Offs' couldn't be improved by limiting them to no more than 1 post per day (accept for maybe the occasional odd timed super late night session), no more weekly wrap ups, and no more results posts. Again, low stakes, few rules, and nothing more than a single entry. 

If I understand the message being communicated in, 'Proposal: promote the daily ""Write Off, Write Now"" posts to a new subreddit' it's that nobody is opposed to the activity, simply the overwhelming number of posts it's producing. That's a fantastic sentiment because it provides an easy to accomplish challenge and a way to make the overall experience better. And that's ALWAYS a good thing. 

Thank You

My internship was in audit but I've also done a few in tax at some private companies, and feel like I liked that line of work better, especially because I found tax (even though it was just taxation of individuals) much more interesting in school. 

It's not that I don't like audit, I just never really got the feeling that I want to do it for the next 5 or 6 years of my life. I like the fact that I can be at different clients and that you work closely with a team, but I'm not a huge fan of how much the job involves investigating and inquiring about everything.

What it really boils down to is that I'm nervous that if I choose tax as my full time roll, 1) I'll be in the main office the whole time so I won't meet as many team members / external clients for networking and 2)I'll be stuck doing taxes for the rest of my life, whereas if I chose audit I would have more of an option when (and if) the time to change positions and companies comes. Can anyone offer any guidance??"

We're trying to consolidate into one single WIKI engine and I'm struggling trying to get the business to understand the importance of consolidating this information. 

I've spent a few days trying to script the migration but the biggest WIKI is ancient and uses rich text and it's beyond my skill level to script it. The Dev department spent some time trying to script it as well and lost interest/backing after a few man days. We've determined that it will be easier/cheaper just to hire some intern style folks to do it manually. It's only going to cost like $3k so we're not talking huge money here. 

Frustrated with trying to find info, I spent a week setting up Sharepoint 2013 to crawl and index all of the intranet sources/wikis. This universal search engine is working pretty well but I see it as just a crutch to aid during the migration. People seem to be happy with the search engine and stopped complaining about WIKIs so I'm afraid I shot myself in the foot :-)

How do you guys gain support for consolidating knowledge into a single location? Am I just crazy and nobody cares? What tips do you guys have for calculating ROI on these things?"
1ivpnb,8,2013-07-23,Olery looking for a frontend and a backend developer.,yorickpeterse,Amsterdam,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/1ivpnb/olery_looking_for_a_frontend_and_a_backend/,"Hey all,

Some of you may have seen me around, either here on the subreddit or on
meetups. Either way, the company that I work for (&lt;http://olery.com/&gt;) is in dire
need of a frontend and a backend developer, both a full-time position.

So what do we do? Well, it comes down to that we aggregate a lot of data from
various review sites such as Booking, Tripadvisor and others, perform analysis
on this data and present it in a web application. This data is taken by
scraping websites or using APIs where possible. To give you a small idea, we
currently have around 35 million reviews.

Most of this, if not all, is done using Ruby. Our web framework of choice is
Rails.

Team wise we're quite varied. Although the majority is Dutch we also have some
co-workers from Scandinavia, the USA, Greece, Germany and Russia (we're with a
total of 15 if I counted correctly). Our primary language however is English so
although knowledge of Dutch is a plus it's not required. The development team
(of those 15 people) is currently still fairly small: 3 devs, one intern and
one doing support who'll be switching over to development in the coming weeks.

## General Setup

Management wise, at least in the development team, there's a flat structure.
Although there's an official CTO the opinions/ideas of others are considered to
be just as important. In other words, my own decisions have just as much
influence as the ones of somebody else.

For development we use Git in combination with Github as our version control
system, FogBugz for issue management and various other applications such as
Airbrake/Rollbar for error reporting and Kibana for process logging (as in,
what step a particular scraper is currently at).

We also frequently go to conferences (or will help sort tickets out if somebody
wants to go), sponsor them from time to time (e.g. we'll be sponsoring Rails
girls in the Hague this September).

## Frontend

You'll be dealing with Coffeescript/Javascript (most of it is in the former)
SASS and HAML (our markup language of choice). Framework wise we use jQuery
quite heavily and have some AngularJS code in various places as well.

Experience wise we're looking for somebody with preferrably 3+ years of
experience. If you have less experience than that but have been hacking on the
side (e.g. with open source projects, which we're a big fan of) that also helps
a lot. Knowledge of Ruby itself is not required but it's a pre, if not we'd be
happy to teach you. Knowledge of Javascript however is obviously required,
Coffeescript knowledge is a big plus.

## Backend

Backend wise you'll spend most of your time dealing with Ruby and associated
technologies that we use such as MySQL, MongoDB (which we're not the biggest
fan of), Amazon AWS as our server platform and various others. We also take
part in an FP7 project of the European Union with the end goal of developing a
proper toolchain for language/sentiment analysis (something we use quite
heavily). This particular project involves Ruby, Java, Python and Perl.
Knowledge of these languages is not required but would be nice to have.

Our setup consists of various scrapers and daemons that aggregate/schedule
data, 3 Rails applications (of which one is an internal management application)
and a whole bunch of RubyGems that we use across the various
repositories/projects (in total we have around 125 repositories on Github).

In terms of experience we're looking for somebody with at least 3 years of
experience, but similar to the frontend position if you have less but have been
hacking on side projects that's fine too.

The corresponding job advert for this one can be found on The Resumator:
&lt;http://olery.theresumator.com/apply/GiWlXB/Ruby-Developer-Senior.html&gt;.

In case you're interested you can send your CV and cover letter to
&lt;jobs@olery.com&gt; (don't forget to mention the position in the subject). When
doing so tell a little bit about yourself, your experience, etc. If you have
any further questions you can also ask them here in the comments, applications
in these comments however will not be looked at for organizations sake.

p.s. I verified this with the mods and they gave me the green light. Lets hope I don't trigger a massive recruiter spam run."

Need help.,throwaway_4years,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ivdmf/20f_i_think_i_need_to_end_my_four_year/,"This will be a long one I think, so TL;DR: I am no longer feeling like I am part of the relationship, and don't know how to end it, or even if I should.

We have been together since high school, 16 and 17, and moved from a smallish town into a very big city together. We have done all the milestones together, and neither of us have been with anyone else seriously. 

We currently live together in a flatting situation and have lived together in an apartment previously.

The main thing for me at the moment is I feel like I am ""missing out"" on being single, which I have barely considered before. I think that I think (?) the relationship is stopping me living life properly, and I want a break.. I have felt this for a long time (4 months +) and have thought about it a lot. 

Also, he has had some troubles with getting accepted into university, and also with finding work, and I have fully supported him (financially and emotionally) through unemployment and some rough jobs. He now has a very stable job, though he doesn't fully enjoy it, and is beginning his first papers at university this semester. I do think this has had significant impact in our relationship, and I am starting to feel it more and more. I am in my third year of a four year degree, and will soon be looking at postgraduate study and am currently applying for internships with graduate employment. know this seems to be a lot of irrelevant information, but essentially,  I think that we are reaching very different points in our lives and careers, which is putting much added strain on the relationship. 

So I guess overall the situation is that I am in a relationship that I am no longer happy in, but due to time and inexperience, I honestly don't know what to do. Is it a phase? Or do I really want out?

1ivars,2,2013-07-23,"In over my head, not sure if this is the right place?",help_me_macro,excel,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/1ivars/in_over_my_head_not_sure_if_this_is_the_right/,"Gonna preface this by saying I've never used excel before except for basic physics labs and whatnot and have 0 macro/vba experience whatsoever (although I do code in Python/VB6/Java/Scheme).  

First time posting here because I'm completely lost and need some help.  Basically I'm in the middle of an internship in the corporate division of a F500 and I've been handed the task of creating an excel macro to graph their sales forecasting.  Not sure if that made any sense but here's a basic run-down of what I (think) I'm doing for the few weeks left:

I am given a huge spreadsheet of data in excel (2007 if it matters).  This spreadsheet has about 55 columns and a little over 500 rows.  It is all given in a pivot table such that I can sort the data according to about 20 different criteria such as model #, customer, plant location, etc. and I have to make an area graph of the data sorted by each category (so one using model #, another using customer, etc).  What I've done for the first one is basically sort the ""supplier"" column alphabetically, and use the subtotal function.  Then I click the ""2"" on the top left corner so that it shows only the subtotal rows along with each row being ""[supplier] subtotal"".  This is where I encounter my first problem.  

Since I'm only adding the totals for certain columns (i.e.monthly revenue) and not for other columns (i.e. customer name and monthly volume) how can I hide all the ""empty"" columns so that I can just get one neat table of whatever data I'm sorting by on the left and subtotal for monthly revenue of each row?  What happens right now is that there is a ""monthly volume"" column between each ""monthly revenue"" column and I was wondering if there was a way I could get rid of that so I could just copy and paste all the monthly revenue at once into another sheet.  

Another question (maybe way out of my league) is how to completely automate this process for the 20 other columns.  How I have it planned in my head (never really used excel macros before) is that I would select/highlight one column, run the macro, and a sheet would show up with the graph of the data organized according to the data sorted in that column.  

Would appreciate any help or pointers in the right direction.  Thank you!"

I still wont use names to respect privacy, but I have witnessed a stimulant psychosis (we believe) episode that still freaks me out now 3 years later.
I was studying abroad in Switzerland and sharing a room with 3 other Americans from my program. There were about 25 of us total in the apartment complex that lived and took classes together. One of my roommates, we'll call him Dave, was an absolutely normal kid. Being 20 years old in a foreign country we did our fare share of drinking and messed around with some adderrall, but nothing harder than that. Most of our classes didnt start till around 7pm so kids could intern at NGO's (nongovernmental organizations) in Switzerland. One particular night we all sat down for an economics class. Dave seemed to be sweating profusely. As the professor went on, dave repeatedly interupted him with profound statements on faith, humanity and god. We all thought he was messing around until it got to a very awkward point. He was asked to leave. At some point we learned that that day while at his internship, dave had to be escorted out by security because he looked up ""jesus"" in their international database and could not find him, so he freaked out asking all the employees where he could find jesus. After being kicked out, dave continued this in the streets of switzerland, asking folks where he could find jesus. Someone, hoping to help, pointed him to a church where dave took a bible (not written in english) and he brought it back with him. The 2 of us in the class that lived with dave, myself and another, left when he got kicked out having known something was up. We walked back to our apartment and got him to calmly tell us the story about work, but in the sense that he was still looking for jesus, still obviously crazy. As the night continued we spoke with our advisors and pushed for the need to call an ambulance. The program didnt call, they wanted to wait out the situation, unaware of how seriously ill Dave was. My roommate and I stayed in our room with Dave, terrified as he preached about jesus. We attempted to sleep but were awoken by loud yelling and vomit. Dave was projecticle vomiting all over the room from his bed. My roommate and i sprang to action. He ran to wake the advisor telling him we HAD to call for an ambulance. Meanwhile I was left alone to try and calm Dave. He had run into the hallway yelling, ""I am God"" and preaching the need for everyone to forgive, yelling at the top of his lungs in the middle of the night, vomit still dripping from his mouth and his eyes wide open, dilated pupils staring me in the face. Its an image that I still cant get out of my head no matter how much i try to repress it. My roommate and the advisor come back and we are able to role play with Dave long enough to keep him calmed down. We ask him questions about faith etc. while we await the ambulance. When the paramedics arive we brace for an altercation but Dave seemed to understand he was sick. He went willingly, with a confused grin on his face, knowing something was wrong, but still believing he was god. He even told the paramedics he was god and that he would be fine.
Fast forward, dave stayed in the hospital for several days, i believe it started one morning and lasted between 2.5 -3 days. We had initially hoped it to be a small issue but it tool several days for him to come back to earth so to speak. He had come back to the apartment to apologize and say goodbye to us, the program was kicking him out, having suffered the embarassment of the issue at the NGO. They were really awful with the whole situation and it really made it weirder and worse for everyone. I havent spoken to dave or even about dave since he left. It was just so surreal at the time that I just burried it, but I think about it every few months, and while the sequence of events has gotten a little fuzzy, ill never forget that moment in the hallway. Just me and him, wide-eyed, yelling to me he that he was god."

Old Fashioned Policing, these guys are more patrols and response along with line of command style responses.

Lone Star Constable: 1, Lone Star Sergeant: 2, Lone Star Lieutenant: 3, Lone Star Captain: 4, Lone Star D.I.: 5, Lone Star Commissioner: 6

Other workers in Lone Star

Lone Star Detective:2-5, Detectives/Investigators do more legwork so you won't typically see these guys out on patrol, but you may see them at the scene or visiting persons of interest. Though that said high ranks of regular cops won't go on patrol either, but instead will be busy doing paperwork and answering calls or making public appearances. 

Receptionist: 1-3, Receptionists and variety of other paperwork positions exist in any organisation. Despite holding only a little power they will hear a significant amount of what is going on.

Forensic (Specialty): 2-5, Forensic staff. Just yes. Specialties can be found quite handily here http://tinyurl.com/kjwa4rx. Depending on seniority and qualifications the connection rating will go up. Everything from Fresh Interns to Doctors are to be expected.

Janitorial and Cleaning Staff: 1-2 &amp; 4, Janitorial staff may not have much more than access and gossip, except of course for the crime scene cleaners.

PR Representative: 2-4, PR Representatives have to control how the Corp is seen and this requires and a clever release of information and misinformation.

SWAT Member: 2-5, Whilst not being seen on patrol they will be on the field. Typically found in high priority areas except when called in for emergencies.

Driver/Pilot: 2-4, Pilots are necessary for transportation of police via helicopter or any higher end vehicle. Depending on social standing they may have more influence.

Accountant: 2-5, Money is power and accountants know some level of where it is going. 

Techie: 1-5, From Spiders to Tech Support computers control the bulk of the information running through Lone Star.

Recruits: 1-2, Whilst maybe not embroiled in Lone Stars politics they may know all sorts of gossip that the older cops take for granted.

Now you have to consider a similar collection of possible contacts for K.E. this list barely scratches the surface of potential people you could have in your contact list even for Lone Star alone. Feel free to use your imagination to come up with more than your typical contacts and flesh them out some a paragraph of backstory on each of your contacts can do a lot.

I'm thinking I'll wait til later and go through some contacts for some of the other major groups. Feel free to add your own Lone Star Contacts, request the next group or complain."

**The Setting:**
I'm a young chap working as an intern at a medium-sized MSP. I shouldn't need to explain what that means here, right? :) Anyways, one of our clients requested an install of Microsoft Dynamics CRM on their PDC (Genius idea that we fought but the client insisted upon it.) They hired a local consulting company to do the installation, customization and training for it and they just needed us to supervise / provide access to the servers.

**Rising Action:** The consultant came in today and said she had a meeting with my coworker. I'd just been gone on vacation so I was still re-familiarizing myself with what was all going on. Coworker and consultant go into the conference room, I don't ask any questions. An hour or so later, I get a call from the client asking about the server being down, so I go poke my nose in. They had to restart the PDC to make some changes, not a huge deal. I go back on the horn with the guy and tell him it should be resolved soon and to just hang tight. 

You can almost taste the foreshadowing here.

**What Next?:** A few hours later, Coworker comes in and slams her hands down on the desk. I hear the front door open and someone shuffling out of the building.

""What was that all about?""

She turns to me, the fires of a thousand suns burns behind her eyes.

""That dumb b*%#&amp; ran sysprep /generalize on the production domain controller while I stepped out to get coffee, a page she found on google told her to do it for some reason.""

Whoops.

Five hours later, calls to her manager, the VP of the company, the client, Shadowprotect, we finally bring the production server back up as it was last night. The VP of the company was surprised my Coworker even picked up the phone. Apparently, the girl didn't even flinch or show remorse after making such a huge fuckup. 

""I just did what Google told me to do.""

**Questions for your thought:** Why don't you take ESX snapshots before every damn change? And since when is sysprep a viable tool for installing Microsoft Dynamics?"

This shows because I only meet up with them individually maybe once every two months, and even then, with such a long time of not seeing each other, it's still a pain to keep the conversation going for an hour. Usually, without fail, the conversations cover the following, in no particular order:

1. School/work/general life - ""So how's your internship going?""
2. Current events - ""Did you hear about the plane crash at SFO?""
3. Common interest - (usually only NBA) ""How about them Lakers?"" Barring that, I try to talk about some interest I know that they have.
4. Activity/event where we met - ""Ready for the next volunteering event?""
5. Other experiences - When my friends sense the convo is starting to die, they restart it with all the other social experiences they've been having, eating at this place or doing that thing with some other friends. Of course I got nothing because the sitdown at that very moment is literally the only real socializing I've done the entire month.

I guess it follows the FORD topics to an extent, but I think they're best when you meet someone new and not as something to regurgitate with real friends after already knowing them. I guess the only topic I could see talking about on a daily basis is the common interest, but realistically I could maybe talk for 5 minutes about the Lakers each day before it gets real old. I don't have to be talking with every person every single day, but I know to develop close relationships I have to at least do that for the people who I want to get close to.

So instead of more conversation techniques that are general, I just want to ask you what specifically you talk about with someone who you converse very regularly/consider a real friend. How did you get to the point where you have inside jokes and are cracking insults at each other in good fun? I apologize if this question sounds stupid, I'm just woefully inept at socializing. I cannot imagine how some people are able to have 5+ hours of phone conversations with the same person several times a week. I have thought about taking someone's phone and just poring through and analyzing all their text conversations, but I'll have to settle for asking this question lol.


**TL;DR**: What *specifically* do you talk about with your closest friends or people who you talk almost daily with? I'd like to know because I have a terrible time keeping conversations fresh.  "

In January, I figured it would be a good time to try a new diet since I had to move away for an internship. I tried calorie counting, my goal was 1500kcal/day. At the same time, I started taking new medications for depression (I had what my therapist described as a ""suicidal gesture"" the month prior), and it proved quite effective. Unfortunately, I started to slowly gain weight, despite a seemingly sensible diet and exercise. I stopped taking the meds and the weight gain stopped, but I have to deal with some pretty profound changes in mood.

Fast forward six months to now. I've stopped gaining weight, but I can't lose it. I've had to take what I can describe as the nuclear option: a very low calorie paleo diet. On the plus side, I'm learning how to cook, but I still haven't lost any weight after a few weeks. I really wanted to try losing it before I graduate, but it looks like that isn't going to happen. I am so tired of being disgusting, but it doesn't seem like I am able to change it.

But anyways, I just got out of high school and was having difficulty deciding a major. I just last month decided I was way too into computers to let that go for med. school. So I changed my major to computer science. Anyways, I guess I'm a little behind on my math (partly because I didnt try in high school as much as I shouldve). So freshman year of college im going to be taking intermediate algebra and then precalc. And since im behind on my math I cant take any courses for Computer science. Next summer I plan on taking my Calc 1 class so I can start my basic CS courses my sophmore year. 

This is getting lengthy, i apologize, but my question is, will i be super behind because I cant take any CS courses till sophmore year? Will it be harder for me to get summer internships at companies like Microsoft and Google? And also do you guys have any suggestions on website and books I can use to atleast start learning on my own this year?

 I grew up in a Christian family, 15 years at a CMA church, the next 7 at a Church of Christ church as well as attending and graduating from a small Bible college during 4 of those years. I grew up believing pretty standard Protestant stuff: 6 day creation, homosexuality is even, everyone is going to hell who isn’t a Christian. During my 4 years at Bible college a lot what I believed in changed. After spending years studying the Bible hermeneutically, have countless conversations with professors and just studying the Bible from other perspectives, my thinking naturally started to change from what I had grown up on.



I have been dating my SO for over a year now. We met during my senior year of college. I recently graduated and moved back to my parents house because it is close to where I am doing my internship. This required me to move about 2 hours away from where my girlfriend lives. This hasn’t been too difficult for us as we know it won’t be a permanent thing.

This is where her parents come in. They are your pretty standard Fundamentalists. They believe in 6 day creation, homosexality is a sin, certain music genres are evil, etc....you get the picture. I have no problem with this whatsoever, I can respect everyones opinions on things. During my college years I subscribed to evolution as the method in which God created the world. They have HUGE problems with this. They claim I can’t really be a Christian if I don’t take the Bible completely literally because by believing in evolution means “I don’t know where I come from”. Also they think Satan created evolution. This is just one example of what I have been dealing with.

Just last night her father told her that if I was to ask her hand in marriage right now he would say no. His reasons were that he doesn’t know me very well and that he has some red flags about me. I have always been open to talking and discussing things with her parents but they have made no real effort to do so. 

I am posting this to ask for advice and prayer as to how to go about conversations with her parents in a respectful manner. Is there any possible way I can get them to respect my opinions? Is there any possible way that they will let their daughter marry a man who doesn’t read Genesis literally and l listens to metal?

If anyone has advice who has been or is in a situation like mine, advice would be greatly appreciated!

It takes great idea’s, hard work, and knowledgable people. Four years ago, two University of Waterloo students had the same idea to create a game in the mobile industry, which was just sprouting. It was that common goal that lead to the creation of InfiniDy.

At InfiniDy we truly pride ourselves on taking co-op students under our wing and shedding knowledge on them. Developer Andrew Burger is one of those students.

There comes a point in everyone's life when they have to grow up, figure out what they love to do, and make a career out of it. What could be more fun for an individual's career than being a part of creating games? Although Andrew is very active and enjoys outdoor activities such as off-roading, and biking, gaming was his calling. He came to Kitchener to attend triOS College and study video game programming. 

Being a local company, InfiniDy was an obvious choice for Andrew. Our successful portfolio of games ensured Andrew that there would be plenty of opportunity to learn, as well as challenges that would give him the optimal co-op experience. 
 
“My internship at InfiniDy has given me the opportunity to get into the programming field relatively quickly, giving me not only an educational background, but also a practical background in game development.”  

“I wanted to be somewhere where I would learn a lot, but also be able to put some of my own idea’s into the game. I’ve gotten that experience and it has been great!”

Andrew enjoys the fact that at InfiniDy he is able to implement his own ideas and complexities in the game. He also enjoys that we not only work as a team, but hang out as a team as well, whether it be events where everyone games, or bowling and pizza. 

Andrew is ambitious and wants to make a strong impact in the mobile gaming industry “The complexity of mobile gaming has showed me that I love challenges. I want to get to that higher level of game development complexity in the future.”
If you want to test and develop your skills and talents, then join the InfiniDy team. You will be given challenges, tasks and most importantly, opportunities. 
“I really enjoyed spending my co-op term working at InfiniDy. I am going to go back to school with skills that I never expected to learn. I am going to miss it here [at InfiniDy].”
There you have it, wise words from Andrew Burger, Student and Developer at InfiniDy.
At InfiniDy, we don’t just welcome developers, we encourage applicants with a variety of skills to apply. Let us know what type of interests, skills and education you have. Anyone can apply! If you’re interested in living the dream like Andrew, tell us a bit about yourself, your interests &amp; passions. Email us - jobs@infinidy.ca and send over your resume!

1. How likely/easy is it to purchase a house as a 21 year old (I have a credit line of ~15k, just started building up my credit) with no equity or previous landowning experience, and no income (short of internships during the summer)?

2. Is it even possible to find anything local/in the area in So-Cal to buy a property so cheap that with a 50k down payment the rent would offset the mortgage and other fees/issues?

I have a Bachelor's in Bio with courses heavy in microbiology, with a little statistics and no CS. 

I've always thought I'd continue on to a molecular bio Ph.D , but recently I've starting losing interest in that route and started thinking about getting a masters instead (shorter commitment, no interest in becoming a PI, etc). I looked at various biotechnology masters programs, but bioinformatics/comp bio programs also caught my eye.

I've always been interested in genetics/genomics, especially in the context of microbio (metagenomics, microbiomes, etc). Problem is, I haven't taken any CS courses which are prereqs for all these programs. Right now I'm trying hard to learn programming concepts through Coursera and other sites, and I feel it's very challenging/fun so far.

I guess my question is: Would a master's in bioinformatics be a valid choice for me, and if so what would be a good way to gain CS and bioinformatics experience? Are online courses for credit such as [this one](http://www.extension.harvard.edu/courses/intensive-introduction-computer-science) at Harvard Extension School recommended?

1)  32-38 year old lawyer.  pretty girl, talked to her for 25 minutes.  there was a lull and i started looking around some, and she said well ill let you do your rounds.  so i figured that was disinterest on her part probably due to age gap. so i left and didnt reopen. 

2)  26 year old law intern- talked to her for 10 minutes. kinda boring conversation, maybe due to me.  maybe due to her being sober and kinda nerdy.  wasnt that attracted.  so i kinda just left midway thru convo. 

3) 8/10's- i opened with an acquatance and talked for a bit with one and she kinda turned her shoulder towards me a bit  and looked at her friend and my acquatance after 5 minutes. when i combiend this with her being 7ish years older than me, i figured i may as well just bail. so i left.

4)  6/10 party girls- opened and went well for 20 minutes. then kinda faded... as i couldnt sustain, so i walked away.

5)  bulgarian girls- opened went well for 20 mintues but i couldnt tell if it was disinterest or language barrier that was making it harder to talk towards the end of the 20 minutes.

i opened them again later and they were somewhat warm again, but once again i couldnt tell if they were just being friend and not interested or the language barrier was making it a more mild conversation.

6) 6/10 blonde- went well for 20-30  minutes. she went to get a drink and this random guy hit on her and got her number within 4 minutes.

she came back and said ""she was leaving but had a nice time meeting us and hoped to see us around again..."" i feel like this was her possibly trying to get me to ask for number.  i didnt because she was very very borderline on what id do looks wise and the random guy getting her number turned that into a no

7) 6.5/10 country girl- her friend was 250 lbs. the 6.5 was very country so i ejected as im not into country girls unless they are southern.

8)  5/10 at bar- got shot down immediately lol

9) 37 year old- talked to her for 30 minutes and went well. but she was 37 so i just said had fun and left.  felt 0 reason to ask for number. she was very attractive for her age, but i wouldnt make time for someone 10 years older than i am.

10) 8/10 punk rock- talked to her for 10 minutes and she felt like tense. but wouldnt leave lol. so i said id let her get to it with her friend and left.

then i hit on the 37 year old above, i reopened the 8/10 punk rock and she wasnt near as warm, but not rude. so i didnt pursue.

11)  super drunk party girl- got shot down immediately while she danced all over every other guy lol. was kinda confidecne debooster

12)  7/10 30-36 year old ish-  she was at a table with 2 guys who obviously werent dating her. so i went and sat down next to her and talked for 30 minutes and it was a good talk.  so i asked for her number and she said she was kinda seeing someone.

idk if she was legit or not.  idk why she would talk for 30 minutes though if she wasnt single

13)  married puerto rican girl- didnt know she was married.  but she kept talkign to me after i started so i regreted it

14) blonde college girl- instant shut down

15) 7/10 party girl-  walked up to her and started talking and her friend just stared at me like i was raping babies lol. she was friendly but awkward as her friend did not want me there and wasnt friendly when i tried bringign her in the conversation. so i left quite quickly"

1iyfnr,24,2013-07-24,Financial independence is key!,apstories,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1iyfnr/financial_independence_is_key/,"My mom is without a doubt the number one contributing factor to the problems I’ve had to go through growing up as an ABC. Luckily, my life does not seem anywhere as tough as some of the stories I’ve heard on here. My mom’s side along with my dad (his family stayed in China) fled to America pretty early, around their early 20s. My mom is the youngest out of her siblings so you could say our family is more open-minded than the rest. Relatively speaking. For example, I have never had a curfew. I could hang out with whoever I wanted, as long as I never dated Black or Hispanic girls, which I’m not going to obey if I do happen to meet someone of that race that is compatible. Grades were important but I never got my ass beat for getting some B’s now and then. 

I started school in Chinatown and was deeply ingrained in the typical Asian culture. Fortunately for me, I was naturally good at academics in elementary school, definitely not the case now in college lol. I enjoyed reading, played the piano, even picked up the violin. 

But, I was removed from this culturally sheltered life when I got accepted at the age of 10 into one of those academic program for “gifted” minorities. Now like most Asian parents, every other minority (not white people though) was inferior. In Cantonese, the word “monster” is attached to each race. So for example, “Black monster” or “Hispanic monster.” This program was like 30% Asian, with the rest being Black or Hispanic. Now I still hung out with other Asian kids but I was exposed to a completely different culture. I was no longer trapped in this exclusive mindset of Asians’ being superior. After that, I was placed into an independent school where the population was about 90% upper class whites. The school designated itself as “progressive” and was a very liberal school. That’s when I started having troubles at home.

Originally, I was like most other Asian kids who obeyed their parents without question, disregarding the logic, or lack thereof, behind the commands. Now having experienced two mind-opening environments, I started to see the ridiculousness of some of the things my parents said, most notably the manipulative passive aggressive statements my mom made that really just pisses me off. She is never wrong and when she realizes she is, she throws a huge tantrum. Lose lose for whoever opposes her. When I question my parents, they usually responded with “because.”

“What do you mean because?!”

“*Scoffs* What do you mean what do I mean because?”
And so on.

I could go on for days about the problems I encountered, mostly due to communication issues and a quick temper, but I eventually just zoned them out when we had such problems. The problems all culminated one day when I realized my mom had put all my birthday, Christmas, Chinese New Year, etc. money in her own bank account for safekeeping. 

I got extremely pissed off and came to really hate this “bullshit communist” attitude, as I called it, where everyone was expected to share everything. I opened my own bank account and credit card the first chance I got and just saved up from my internships and jobs. The main takeaway here is how financial independence allowed for me to separate from my parents’ overbearing control. It shows that you're an adult and that you control your path, whether they like it or not. I haven’t had to ask them for money in years and I never to plan to ever again. I see stories of people sharing housing payments with their parents and I will never do that in a billion years.

My relationship with my parents has gotten better as this financial dependence connection between us  has been severed. I’ve learned to control my temper and realize that saying nothing is usually better than arguing. I’ve learned to not bring up my somewhat liberal views in front of my parents and if I do, it’s in a reasonable way. All this being said, I’m very lucky to have such accepting (again, relatively) parents, despite my mom’s manipulative tendencies. I’ve had a pretty privileged life and I understand they love me. It’s just their methods can be very irritating sometimes. 

Sorry for the rant. Just discovered this subreddit.

TL;DR: I’ve had it pretty good with my parents. Financial independence was a huge turning point for me. Sometimes, it’s better to just be quiet than try to reason with them.

Last Wednesday, I had an interview with the NASA Johnson Space Center regarding internships. On monday, I got a call telling me I was accepted. And just now, I found out what my assignment will be!

&gt; The Human Interface Branch at the NASA Johnson Space Center is developing wearable technologies for use in human spaceflight. The WEAR Lab is focused on wearable display, control, and sensing systems for use in shirtsleeve environments such as the International Space Station or Lunar/Martian habitats. This requires embedding electronic components into everyday garments. The student will join the WEAR Lab team and assist in development and integration of wearable computing components using advanced electronic and garment manufacturing techniques. The student will be responsible for prototyping and testing wearable technologies based on published research and lessons learned by the team. Wearer comfort, mobility, and performance are critically important, and will be evaluated in user studies. The student will work side-by-side with NASA employees on ongoing projects. 

&gt; The student will produce prototypes in line with ongoing WEAR Lab projects and report on their performance. 

&gt; Wearable technology R&amp;D requires a diverse range of skills that won't be held by any individual student. The WEAR Lab team will identify specific tasks that leverage the students' abilities. WEAR Lab needs: Software development (Python, Arduino, MatLab, C, C++, Atmel toolchain, and others), Electrical engineering, Embroidery, Garment manufacturing, Human factors evaluation 

&gt; This opportunity is for how many students per session? 	2 

This is going to be fun O= ^(in a weird engineering sort of way)

That said, all the jobs I have really been able to acquire within the IT world are at Help Desks.  Since school is expensive, I need to replenish my bank account a bit.  Anyways, before I go off on tangents, my question is with regard to my INTJ mind and the job function.  I must always wear my customer-service face with those who are not skilled in the IT field and tend to blame those confounded machines.  I enjoy going back and performing research on the problems and then actually solving them as well as streamlining processes to make the job more efficient.  The social interaction is quite taxing on my mind, though.  I am constantly on caffeine, which helps make me appear as though I thrive on socializing.    Are there any other INTJs who have had this job, and what were your thoughts on the matter?  It seems like this is the only realm where employers are willing to hire me despite the fact that I have knowledge of computer science from a university... (that's not saying much, but, I was looking for internships or anything that would allow me to develop the skills more (w/o the formal degree completed, it did not work out at all)).  

TL dr: What are your thoughts and analyses with regard to the job function and the INTJ?

Please excuse any ambiguity in the synopsis.

**Edit:**  I have also been doing IT work for ~5 years in this capacity because I could not get a job as an analyst with my History degree :)  My CS degree is still in progress, but is not exactly helping me get entry/intern level stuff yet (for some reason (still working on that part, of course)).

It's basically a huge red flag for HR to see that, and silly me didn't realize that until it's too late.  Had I known that earlier (over a year earlier), I might not be in the situation I'm in today.

I've applied to all kinds of jobs: office type work that I have experience in, retail jobs that I don't want though I will take, part-time positions that barely pay anything, and even a few internships (and I hate the idea of internships, but I need something).  I've gotten like 5 interviews, only two in person and the other three over the phone, and this is in the course of nearly a year.

My family can't help me, my friends can't help me and ultimately I can't help myself.  This is my fault because I quit a steady job I despised that didn't even pay much with the hopes of starting my own business.  My business failed and since then I've been applying like crazy.

However, it's gotten to me and a few months ago I gave up.  People think I'm still trying to look for a job or that I'm working on a project of sorts, but that's all a lie.  Oh yeah, did I mention I'm 29 and still live with my parents because I am fucking broke.  Oh, but what really tops it all off is that I actually was trying to work on a project, which I borrowed a large sum of money for, and now I have no idea how I'm going to pay that back (plus interest).

So I'm basically screwed and I don't care.  People will tell me I need to ""play the game"" or kiss everyone's ass in the hopes of maybe getting a free/low-pay job or go back to school or I don't fucking know....

I'm sure people hate me for refusing to bust my ass to work for no-pay or low-pay, but to be honest I hate people like you.  I feel you're to blame for this problem because employers see all this desperation and prey on it, which in turn affects everyone.  

But hey, whatever, it doesn't matter to me.  Either talk shit about me, ignore me, or pretend you can help me because it's the same in the end."

I thought she was cute and interesting so I asked her and her friend (M) if they wanted to hang out sometime and I got their numbers.

She also previously agreed to watch a different horror movie with me.

Anyway I am kind of concerned that this girl thinks of me as just a friend as she asked me to do something with her friends instead of just with her. On the other hand she was not brought up in western culture, doesn't own a car, I'm probably too much in my own head etc. This girl is not in my department so I'm not exactly ""shitting where I eat"", but I still want to tread somewhat carefully here.

So basically I'm looking for advice on what to do next with this girl eg say ""its a date"" when I ask her to do something with me, just hang out with her and make a move? 

Thanks for reading this and any responses I get

1ixt9c,4,2013-07-24,"Going into my final year of college, I feel aimless, regretful, and burdened with debt",throwitaway_0,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ixt9c/going_into_my_final_year_of_college_i_feel/,"Not really sure why I'm doing this, but I feel like I need to get some of these thoughts off my chest.

When I graduated high school, I had no idea what I really wanted to do, but I knew that I had to go to college. I went with a major that I thought I loved, but after four years of studying it, I now realize that I don't think I have the creativity to make it a career. I picked up another major, but I feel like I did it so late that I don't know how to get started with it. 

To make matters worse, I'm straddled with debt that worries me nearly every day. I come from a household where financial problems were always present, and money was always an issue. I pride myself on typically being financially responsible, but with less financial aid than I would've hoped, I signed on to a private loan with my uncle as a co-signer. He has his own financial problems now, and I constantly feel remorseful; if I can't pay back these bills when I graduate, the burden falls on him. 

I planned to spend this summer finding an internship to explore opportunities, but the few I actually did early on didn't call back, and I get so trapped in this cycle of regret that it's become easier for me to ignore these problems for ""one more day""... fueling the process all over again when I realize I've accomplished nothing. 

I know that I made some poor choices in picking a college I couldn't afford and a major that I ended up not being suited for. I dread nothing worse than family events when relatives ask the dreaded question, ""what are you going to do with that when you graduate?"" I felt pressured and nervous, and if I could do it all over again I'd make a lot of changes. 

On top of all that, I deal with what I think is anxiety, social anxiety, and having recently just come out to my mom as gay. Thankfully the latter went better than I expected. I've lost contact with my aunt and uncle when they found out via social media, which was more devastating than I initially realized, and the catalyst for me coming out to my mom. I don't know where I'd be emotionally today if the same had happened with her, but I'm still worried about coming out to my stepdad for a number of more complex reasons. This has all been so much that the only person I've really seen this summer has been my boyfriend. I've turned down a number of chances to hang out even with a friend who lives down the street from me. When friends from back home do convince me to hang out, I often feel uncomfortable and irritated when just sitting around with them. I'm constantly judging myself and worried that others are doing the same, and I fear silence. I feel awkward and uncomfortable in my own skin. 

I think all I really want is to get back to zero and have control of my own future. I want the dark cloud of debt hanging over my head to be erased so I can work something I'm passionate about. I want to be completely out of the closet and be who I am in front of my entire family without worrying about the repercussions. The weight of all of this has been hanging so heavily recently and I dread graduating after these final two semesters. "
1ixs9y,4,2013-07-24,[21m] girlfriend[21 f] seems disinterested is this normal for a relationship? feel like something is wrong,thebigvoc,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ixs9y/21m_girlfriend21_f_seems_disinterested_is_this/,"Ok so I have been dating a girl for about 8 months now with a week of a break up(really more of a big fight I guess) around the 4 month mark. She seems like a great girl at times but there seems to be something inherently wrong with our relationship and i was wondering if i am just looking too much into things and being paranoid or if i have a legitimate reason for being unhappy with the state of our relationship. (I apologize in advance for the long post)

so a little backstory leading up to the current issue. after about two months of dating my girlfriend started getting a significantly decreased interest in sex, seemingly out of nowhere. after numerous fights over it over the next few months we hit a point where I thought things were too bad so I suggested we break up. She said something about needing to sort out her head and just needed time to be herself and be single (she claims this wasn't anything to do with wanting to hook up with other guys which i choose to believe) and asked if i could ever possibly take her back in the future, so I told her she had a week to decide if she wanted to be with me and on the last day of the week she shows up at a party that my friends and I were throwing(some of which were mutual friends) and wants to get back together with me. 

things are going fine at this point, I really missed her and wanted to give things another shot so I do and everything is fine for the next 6 weeks or so(what remained of the semester before I had to move 200 miles away for an internship). anyways it's around the 2 month mark where I start noticing that she is beginning to pull the same stuff she did that caused us to start fighting initially. there were times where I would be visiting and she will be feeling fine, we have the house to ourselves and I would try to initiate something sexual and she would decline in favor of watching t.v. or a movie(what we end up doing a lot of times, she isn't much of going out type). she claims it isn't anything i do wrong, I satisfy her and she enjoys sex but claims its too much energy sometimes and she would just rather not do it. I understand not being constantly up for sex all the time, as i know her libido isn't like mine, but when i only get the chance to see her once every few weeks when i get the chance to drive down to visit her I would think that she would be all for having as much sex as possible while we had the chance. It has gotten to the point where I basically have to beg my own girlfriend to have sex. although she claims its nothing personal and i should just not worry about it it's still very frustrating because I do have needs too and it seems like for awhile she was just as hungry for sex as I am and then just lost interest all of the sudden. 

To add to the problem, she has a tendency to not like showing any signs of affection towards me when anyone is around. when she sees her guy friends she will jump up and go give them long hugs hello and will occasionally do this when we are just hanging out with them, but if I go to hold her hand when we are walking or something she just dangles her hand there as though she is embarrassed to be seen holding my hand or doesn't want to, and I just get the typical quick hug when I see her that you see most girls give to their guy friends. it's like the things I would expect a girl to do for her boyfriend she does for her guy friends and vice versa when it comes to any kind of public displays of affection. it's bad enough to where when my friends first met her they thought she was dating one of her friends and not me. 

i've talked to her about all of these problems and she just gets angry that i ""just expect sex"" from her as though having a consistent sex life with my girlfriend is some irrational expectation, and claims that I shouldn't take the other stuff personally and just not sweat it because she is just like that. 

Am I really being unrealistic for expecting physical romance and expecting her to be more (or at least as)affectionate with me than she is with her friends when we are in public? I tried to just let it go but it is the first time i have ever had a girlfriend that acted this way, and it just strikes me as a pretty serious problem, especially since we ended up temporarily breaking up over almost the exact same problems just a few months ago.

any thoughts on the matter are appreciated

1ixqym,3,2013-07-24,Which SharePoint certification program is the best of my needs to enter IT market for someone who doesn't have any existing certifications?,jessech,InformationTechnology,https://www.reddit.com/r/InformationTechnology/comments/1ixqym/which_sharepoint_certification_program_is_the/,"I am a college graduate with a BA in history and an MA in an international affairs-related field, but now I am considering working in IT instead. In 2008 I worked a single IT internship but I never got any certifications and was unable to get any IT internships in subsequent years. Even though I now have my MA, while I am considering getting a PhD in a related field I am also thinking of a Plan B in case my social sciences-related job prospects turn out to be not so good.

A few weeks ago I had lunch with a friend and asked her what kind of certification would be good, and she thought A+ wouldn't pay that much but that Sharepoint could be promising. I looked over Microsoft's page at https://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-us/sharepoint-certification.aspx If I do MCSD: SharePoint ApplicationsSolutions Developer I would have to brush up on HTML and learn Javascript and CSS3. And if I do MCSE: SharePointSolutions Expert I would have to learn how to install and configure servers. Which certification would take fewer hours and/or expenses to complete? Would it lead to a promising career?"
1ixq70,7,2013-07-24,Some thoughts on the first month of being an A/R clerk...,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1ixq70/some_thoughts_on_the_first_month_of_being_an_ar/,"I graduated last May from a local private university close to my house with a degree in accounting. Unlike most of my fellow accounting graduates, though, I didn't have a Big Four gig lined up (mostly due to my poor interviewing and networking skills), so I spent a good month looking for jobs, while improving my resume-writing and interviewing skills.

Honing my interviewing skills paid off. I hit my lucky break in early June, when I interviewed for an A/R clerk position at an e-commerce company downtown. I landed an offer a few days later, and started in mid-June. I knew that A/R clerks don't really do ""real"" accounting, but I didn't have any work experience besides a litany of retail jobs, and plus, I saw on Glassdoor that this company was a great place to work and was growing aggressively, so why not?

One month in, I've been assigned the following duties:

1. Reconciling payments with revenue through the usage of the company's internally-built reconciliation tools. 
2. Assisting with month-end reporting by hunting down variances between our bank deposits and our stated revenue (usually involves playing with big spreadsheets and a litany of SUMIF functions to find stuff that doesn't match). 
3. Helping the customer service team with refunds, returns, and other customer finance inquiries. 
4. Reviewing the checks we receive in the mail, cashing them in, and logging them in our system.
5. Dealing with credit card disputes when the customer's bank comes to arbitrate them. 

There are a couple of more duties that I take care of, but I think these five duties constitute a core part of what I do day to day. My boss, the A/R manager (and ex-PwC auditor) tells me and my fellow coworkers in the A/R team (most of whom are also recent college graduates with degrees in accounting) that he wants us to start doing general ledger work and some financial reporting duties in the future, but since we are all still new and still learning a lot of A/R stuff, he's holding off on that for now. 

Even though the work is mundane and tedious, I find some odd pleasure in carrying out my day to day activities. I guess it's because I am mildly OCD. **Ever variance quashed, every refund processed properly, every reconciliation carried through without errors, and every credit card dispute I win on the company's behalf are victories to me, all in the name of keeping the company's books in order.**

The work environment is very pleasant, too. The kitchen is stocked with oodles of granola bars and plenty of coffee. The dress code is very relaxed (I recall the controller coming in one morning in her pajamas). Everyone is friendly and collaborative, always willing to lend a hand when I didn't understand a process or how to do something. There is even an informal Magic: The Gathering club that plays during lunch, and I have taken part in a few games.  

For example, when my boss decided to take a few days off about a week ago, I asked the controller for help with some issues I ran into with a reconciliation, and she was more than happy to help me out. Even the uber-gruff CFO (who is always on the phone, muttering about needing better lawyers and a better investment bank) helped me review a purchase order for a very big amount that needed his attention. 

Currently, I report directly to the A/R manager (who has been around for about a year and worked as an auditor for PwC prior to his current role), one other A/R clerk (recent college grad like me), and two interns. 

The team used to be a bit bigger, with one manager, four clerks, and two interns year-round. But, many people have left as of late, and I hear that they bringing at least one other newbie in soon. 

Furthermore, going beyond accounting, it's also mildly exciting to work for a company that is expanding pretty rapidly. I'm not going to mention what we sell (because that will identify the company), but we have a couple of warehouses in the United States and I've heard rumors of an expansion into Europe soon (I saw some vague internal job listings for roles in Ireland, the UK, France, and Germany). There even rumors of a possible IPO, but that is years away, and I'll probably won't even be working there anymore by the time that happens. 

But, I do not envision myself being at this company forever. I am going back to school in the fall to get my MAcc (while taking night and weekend classes exclusively). I also plan to take full advantage of on-campus recruiting so that I hopefully land a full-time position in audit with a regional CPA or a Big Four firm. Hopefully, my work experience counts as something, and my improved interviewing skills should help me out a bit.

Perhaps one day, I'll do actual accounting and make a bit more money. Perhaps, if I am ambitious, I'll grow to be just like the pajama-wearing controller or the gruff CFO that needs better lawyers and a better investment bank.

But, I am an A/R clerk, and all is well in the world. For now.

And that is my story. "
1ixpvq,4,2013-07-24,"High schooler with a decent (?) amount of programming experience, useful for college apps/internships?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ixpvq/high_schooler_with_a_decent_amount_of_programming/,"I'm about to enter my senior year and college apps are coming up soon, and I'm wondering how my programming experience can add to it.

To give an idea of where I'm at, I started programming with Java at a summer camp when I was 11 or 12, though I can't say I learned very much (besides a hate for Java's syntax that exists to this day). My first real foray into programming was an incomplete platformer game around two years after that, with scrolling, gravity, physics, the basic stuff, made with Python and Pygame. I've made a few other projects with Pygame, in which I've learned to how to structure code and work with general design patterns (MVC, Observer, Singleton patterns, event managers). I would consider those to be my most challenging projects.

I've worked in C++ with WPILib for a robotics competition as the only programmer on my team. That was a very simple job - most of the problems I had were not software related, as WPIlib practically does everything for you.

I've also made a few web apps/websites for friends' businesses, so I'm familiar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I've used Phonegap and Cordova to turn those into native mobile applications.

I've done other small stuff on the side, like using praw to make reddit bots (this account being one of them), a somewhat-functional Latin utility program (I'd like to have it work with an existing one but Ada looks terrifying), and tinkering with computer stuff in general. I'll also be taking AP Comp Sci this year.

Python is the language I'm most familiar with, though I'm comfortable with the syntax of most statically typed, C family languages. I'd love some kind of internship opportunity (southern california), either during the school year or in the interim before college, though my bigger priority right now is getting into a good one. I apologize if I sound too wordy or conceited, I'm not great at conveying tone in text."
1ixf8j,1,2013-07-23,Internship or go to Japan?,socialanxietymonster,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ixf8j/internship_or_go_to_japan/,"This summer I am working at an internship with a great company; however, I have just been offered a trip to go to Japan!

Another factor to consider is that I've been studying Japanese for 6 years, and have never been to Japan. I really really really want to go, but I know it might not be the most responsible thing to do, to skip out on my work.

Advice? I plan on telling my boss about this, but how do I go about it? My social anxiety is really getting the best of me on this one. I need advice. "
1ixcxw,0,2013-07-23,"Would like advice on whether it would be good for me to study abroad or not, keep going back and forth on a decision",emberskye,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1ixcxw/would_like_advice_on_whether_it_would_be_good_for/,"This coming spring we (my class/year) have the option to study abroad in Italy for a semester as part of our academic program (architecture). Normally about 75% of the kids go, I would say. I don't know if I should go or not. There's a shit ton of factors that play into it, but I'll try to explain as best I can.

The semester would cost about $20,000 and I would have to take out loans to go. I am currently a year behind in my program, so after this coming academic year ('13/'14) I still have one more year, but my scholarships will run out - I'll have to pay the full cost of tuition for my final/5th year of college (academic year '14/'15).

Right now I have a good deal going for me with being a Resident Assistant (free room and board). If I study abroad I will lose the free room and board for spring semester, and would not be able to be an RA my 5th year (would not be eligible for rehire). However, if I don't go and stay here for spring semester I can continue to be an RA for the rest of this academic year AND for the following year, hugely decreasing my costs.

If I stayed, I would also be able to easily interview for summer internships and have a better chance of landing one. It would be much more difficult to try and land an internship while studying abroad. And having a summer internship would allow me to save more money that could be put towards my 5th year (since I'll be paying full price).

Also, I have no friends in my class. My boyfriend and the only friend I made in my program are both a year ahead of me in my original class, since I took a year off and am a year behind. I don't mind being on my own but I really don't want to be in a foreign country with absolutely not a single person I'm familiar with, no one I can even travel with.

Another thing is that I have already been to Italy twice before because I have close relatives there. So it's not like this is my only chance/reason to go.

Lastly, if I stayed for spring semester, I would be able to get ahead in my classes. Way ahead, enough ahead that I won't need to take more than 6 credit hours my final semester which would be amazing.

So there's all the info, I think? Might be thinking too far into it but I jsut can't reason myself into a decision. I would love to go but I think it makes more sense for me not to basically, I don't know.

Any advice appreciated - I apologize for the length. Can't really do a tl;dr."

And I was explaining that the directory to build out of should be empty, because the script to build will populate the directory with the right files from elsewhere on the system, but won't check if you've got the most up to date versions of all these files.

So I was explaining that he should run:

\ls | grep -v build_script | xargs rm -rf

A coworker shouts from across the room ""WAIT WAIT WAIT"" and he goes on to explain how bad an idea using rm -rf is. Intern gets lectured for 5 minutes that he should always ALWAYS **ALWAYS** check the directory before executing this command. 

He runs the command in the correct directory and we kick of the build, he proceeds to open another terminal window to tail a log file and he hits some button combination to paste a command onto the command line One he assumes he's copied from somewhere containing the path to the log file. So he's pasted this command and without reading to make sure he's on the right system he hit's enter.

But of course he's run the rm -rf in his home directory. And he smashes on ctrl-c as fast as he can, so now I feel equal parts, bad for him, responsible for the act, and annoyed that he would do that."

Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using. Try to list as many games/applications that you'll be using as you can, as well as your performance goals for those programs.

* Gaming, development (either via virtualization or dualbooting linux, preferably the latter. I'm a CS major). All the usual big games (skyrim, borderlands, etc). I plan on doing a lot of android development, and maybe using it as a media center or home server.

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

* $1200-$1400.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

* In about two weeks after my internship ends

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

* **It might be easier for me to say what I already have. I have the following, and need to buy anything other than these.**
* Speakers
* 27"" 1080p ASUS monitor (HDMI and DP)
* Das Keyboard

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

* USA, near a microcenter

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

* I have [this](http://www.amazon.com/Asus-VE278Q-27-Inch-Integrated-Speakers/dp/B0043T34RK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374784577&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=asus+27%22) ASUS monitor

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

* No, maybe later

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

* USB 3.0 for sure, preferably a front panel with a couple USB ports and headphone jack, as well as a rear panel with more USB ports

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

* Quieter the better, my macbook pro is obnoxiously loud.
* No preferences on the tower. Don't mind it looking cool, but internals are more important to me :P
* Prefer space over compactness, and option to add another hard drive(s) later

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

* I have an OS already, windows 8

&gt;Extra info or specifics:

* It would be really great to have hardware that's ubuntu-friendly so I can dual boot. 
* 16GB of RAM (for development/server purposes, preferably 4-way if it's not too expensive)
* SSD would be cool, but just big enough for the OS's. I'd prefer getting better non-SSD hardware than splurging on a larger SSD."

I intern for the marketing division, and I'm in charge of most of Naughty America's social media sites. Why'd I choose to intern here? Well, it's pretty damn funny, that's for sure. I wake up in the morning and see a giant penis or vagina on my screen. And then I watch as the girl yells out profanities while I'm asking myself if it really is THAT GOOD. Lol I crack up all the time, getting paid to laugh? Hell yeah!

Most of our office is full of computer programmers, web developers, and designers.
[What exactly do you do there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cba6j4e?context=5)|I take care of the majority of Naughty America's social media sites.

I never watched porn before...I guess I just never had any interest and I thought it was all really fake. Now that I've been learning that a lot of the stars are really having the time of their lives in each scene, it just makes the whole idea of porn so much more of a turn on.
[Is there a dress code in the office?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cba76pn?context=5)|Most of us dress business-like.

I'd just rather them not know. I really have no clue how they'd react if they found out, that's why they aren't going to haha.

I have so much fun working here, it's a super chill environment, and even though we deal with porn all day long we get to be creative on how we market and expose it to our Naughty America Fans.

Also, I've had a boyfriend the whole time I've worked here, and he knows all about what I do (which is only behind the scenes work/social media management!). We joke about the stuff I see all the time.
[What's the gender breakdown at the office? More men that work there? More women? About even?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbah12l?context=5)|I'd say the gender breakdown is pretty 50/50.

How sweet is that?! If you follow us on twitter @naughtyamerica you'll get to see exactly what I choose to tweet at whatever time I'd like! Love this company.

But all of a sudden she left the set to do something and everyone was like ""WTF?!"" I think she just badly had to go to the bathroom or something lol. When she got back she went right back to work.

Almost everyone watches porn, but most people try to hide it. I get paid to market it. I get to be creative and  have fun helping people find their sexual fantasies. It's all entertainment, and entertainment is fun!

[You know how in the ""regular"" film industry, every scene is scripted and requires rehearsal and multiple takes?

But I'm sure there is some improvisation in there - I mean, if they're feeling good, I doubt they can help keeping calm and collected...if ya know what I mean?

Pls tell me if u know.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cban7yw?context=5)|To answer your first question, beautiful girls are the ones who get asked to be porn stars, and they are usually the ones who get paid the most. Makes sense right? So money is definitely what brings them to this field.
[2\) Most of porn i have ever watched on my life time have just 4 stages  a\)handshake b\)deep throat c\)bang bang bang d\)facial only scene changes. Why is it so..?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cban7yw?context=5)|For your second question, I can only assume that those 4 types of scenes are the most sought after ones, which is why there are so many of them. Whatever sells is what the industry will produce.
[What's one thing your learned about porn industry that you didn't know about before? Something that you were surprised to learn? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbb062f?context=5)|Definitely the fact that there are different pussy types.

It's true, I have no idea what I'm going to do, where am I going to be in 5 years, 10? I have no idea. He told me today to think of a place you want to be and make it happen.

 I'm interested in getting a well-rounded internship. Ideally, I was thinking either Palo Alto, Austin, or any other area with a lot of tech companies. It appears that a lot of students apply to the big companies like Google/Facebook/Amazon so those seem quite competetive and possibly really hard to get in to, but what would be some good companies to apply for? What should I be looking for pay-wise? If you move far away, will companies typically provide housing?"

1j16ez,13,2013-07-25,Me[26M] worried sick about my two brothers [22M+25M] and where their downward spiral is leading them,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1j16ez/me26m_worried_sick_about_my_two_brothers_22m25m/,"I'll try to give the maximum honest information. ask me if you need more details.

My youngest brother (let's call him B) is a plumber with 2 years experience. He quit his job last month because he felt it was too annoying to not have the time to do his job properly. The other one (let's call him M)  struggled in his studies and is about to stop because he can't (and don't bother) finding an internship that would enable him to pursue in his field.

As far as I know they have been smoking weed for at least 3 or 4 years. B was even caught when he brought back a girl home to smoke among other things and she got sick while using (some sort of bad trip, we never talked about it) and they had to call the police or the firefighters (I wasn't there when it happened). I smoke weed about once every month and I love it but I'm nowhere near their consomation.

B is very introverted and recluse, while M is massively extraverted and outspoken. M constantly bitches about the greed of corporations/religious institutions/politicians/etc.., how everybody in the world is out there to get something from you and how all the people in the world are either assholes or dumbasses or both. He basically thinks he's smarter than most people. He uses this to legitimate this big fantasy project to become rich by abducting children, make protitutes out of them, make them pregnant, sell their organs, sell their meat and go infinite with the new baby. ""It's still not as shitty as Monsanto"". Provocative stuff like that. We can't carry the weight of the entire world misery on our shoulders, nor can he.

We are treated with one of his preaching at pretty much every family meal we have. It might sound annoying but it actually gets funny after a while since it's so ridiculous. His credibility is pretty bad because he fall too quickly into extremes when we talk about something serious, only B really gives him credit in our family. He seem to have a real influence on B.

M basically thinks the world is shit and doesn't want to live old so he eats a lot of bad stuff and doesn't exercize while he used to do martial arts. He is like that after his girlfriend of 3.5 years and him broke up 2 years ago for an unknown reason (he doesn't talk about it) but she's anorexic now and he became very misogynist. He gave up on relationships and doesn't even bother with girls interested in him.

B wants to be left alone does not speak about himself a lot and gets upset very quickly when things don't go his way. He can scream when he gets high ping for example.

We all have been playing video games a lot for the major part of our teenage years and even now. We've always pretty much been hardcore gamers which probably got in the way of our social lives and most certainly of our academic success (we did good and it's alright, but we could have done better). We've developped a strong rivalry which made us strive to become than each other better at games. Basically it's one of the core aspects of our bond as brother.

A year ago they met a weed dealer (let's call him J) and he's been providing them with top notch chemically enhanced weed. Very potent stuff that blows my mind after 3 tokes. All of their friends smoke too. My brothers and J smoke continuously all day all night. They are never not high.

B and his friends often complains that weed makes it hard to focus after a while and that they forget stuff that happened just 5 minuts ago. This doesn't happen to me and worries me.

Recently my parents went in holidays just before B quit his job and left us the house. They come back in 3 weeks. J moved in and basically lives here nowadays. He sells his weed in our house in the company of my brothers as most of his customers come in day and night.

Because of work I'm not there often (I leave very early and come back at 7-8PM), but they are always in front of the computer playing games and waiting for customers whether it's 6AM(when I wake up), 8PM(when I come back), or 2-3AM(when they wake me up because of video games excitement).

The house is a mess, I sleep badly and they don't respect my complaints (they forget after a while). Selfishness runs in the family.

I don't really care about the weed dealing but I'm pretty sure it won't end well. They certainly don't seem to have the intention to stop since M doesn't want to be a corporate slave and B is following his footsteps. They might even be involved in the drug dealing. What if cops come and arrest them?

I have a hard time believing my parents are unaware this is hapenning yet I'm sure they would have done something by now. I'm pondering if I should tell them everything, but at the same time I know that if I do I will lose my brothers' trust.

Writing this I also realise I don't know a lot about my brothers and key events in their lives, mainly because I studied abroad. Except for video games we're not close. How do I bond with them on meaningful matters?

I really don't know what to do, but here's what I thought might make this move forward :

* talk to them and tell them how I feel about all this =&gt; they will talk it off like it's no big deal / just run away from the conversation.

* talk to J =&gt; this guy scares me. I don't know what's his agenda.

* talk to the parents about this =&gt; either they already know and have no more clue than I do about how to deal with this or they don't and I'm an unforgivable traitor.

* go to the police? =&gt; I don't see how my brothers could understand and I take the risk of drowning in guilt.

* explain my situation to a 3rd party like reddit and see what advice comes up.

I don't know what to do and I feel like whatever I do (or don't do) I'm a shitty big brother.

---

**tl;dr: I feel like my little brothers are engaged in a very steep downward spiral (weed dealing + not moderate use + not giving a fuck about anything + quitting their jobs/studies + not sleeping/playing video games all day literally) and don't seem to realise it nor have any intention to act on it. We all live at our parents' house (they are away on holidays), and I don't think my parents know about the drugs. I'm very worried. What can I do that won't make me lose them?**"
1j15zn,1,2013-07-25,Frustrated Intern,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1j15zn/frustrated_intern/,"So I'm a CS major that just transferred from a Community College to a nice 4 year University as a rising Junior. I was able to score an internship through family connections which I thought was great....at first. I'm being paid a measly amount as it's not a programming related internship. They have me doing regular office management duties (formatting word docs, distributing documents etc.) but on the CS related side I am being asked to eventually document an API that the development team is using on their project.

Problem is, being a very inexperienced and young CS major I found myself well behind on the terminology and architecture they are using. The API is a RESTful API so I've been doing a lot of research on that and I've finally got the hang of the concept. I just feel like even despite these little victories I'm getting no help from any of the technical guys! They're all pretty introverted and I find myself lost in a wealth of information. 

For example, I'm learning the console of our project now (to better familiarize myself with it) but I want to start actually looking at the API and playing with it myself but I don't even know how!!!! I am very frustrated with both myself and those around me. I know I should be able to research this on my own but its hard to swim in the ocean if you don't know which direction is up. 

Maybe someone can knock some sense in to me or help point me in the right direction."
1j14n2,70,2013-07-25,[NSV] Me and my Frankenbelly,square--one,xxfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1j14n2/nsv_me_and_my_frankenbelly/,"I originally posted this as a comment in a post I made in /r/gore, of all places. Looking back at it, it's not the usual kind of progress story, but it's one that I am proud of.


Two weeks ago I was at work minding my own business when suddenly I felt a cramping pain in my guts. Most people would assume this was food poisoning but I knew that this was the feeling of a blocked small intestine. This had happened to me once before...it took over 24 hours of cramping pain and being diagnosed wrongly with appendicitis and gallstones before someone figured out what was up - scar tissue from an operation to remove ovarian cancer tumours from 2 years ago had gotten all up in my business and was strangling my guts. Nothing got through, including gas, and I couldn't eat, drink or poop for the 2 weeks it took in hospital to get sorted out. But back in May it did sort itself out and I went on my merry way. Now I had it again.


After a week in hospital nothing was changing in the slightest. The non-surgical route wasn't going to work this time and now a second operation to fix me was my only hope. So I went back under the knife.  


[This photo album shows my scar at different times [NSFW]](http://imgur.com/a/fOJra). I wasn't in shape at all before I got the first scar. You can see in the second picture in this album I posted. I was bloated and stretch marked, I weighed 183lb at my heaviest and I had very little lean mass. I don't hesitate to say I was and still am proud of my body at that time all the same - it had done a decent job of pulling through 4 rounds of chemo and now a 9 hour surgery and I was just happy to be alive and have all my inside bits still on the inside (before the op I was terrified of waking up to find I had a colostomy bag).


It took 11 days to recover from the first operation enough to leave hospital. I was only unable to eat from the date of surgery until about 4 days later when my digestive system kicked back in again. I took 4 days to stand up without help from physio, at least a week before I was walking with a zimmer frame and left the hospital using a cane for support.


After that first surgery I decided to get fit. I started with pilates and swimming and then did the Couch to 5k. I switched to astanga yoga and after discovering places like /r/fitness and this subreddit, I started to strength train following Stronglifts 5x5 and trying to build up to full push ups and unassisted chin ups. This summer I ran my first proper 5k and I was riding my bike 16 miles every day to get to work, 5 days a week.


As a result, the second time round having surgery I recovered so much faster. I starved for a week before going under the knife because again the scar tissue blocked anything from passing through, even water or gas. I had to have IV fluids. 3 days afterwards I got myself out of bed with no assistance. The next day I was able to walk unaided and have a shower by myself. I was out of hospital 6 days after I was operated on and yesterday (day 7) I took my dog on a 10 minute walk.


I lost 13lb during the past 2 weeks bringing my total weight loss in 2 years down to around 45lb. This is not good weight loss! I inevitably lost muscle during this time because I was starving but at least the extra muscle I had on me means that I am now a much smaller 138lb person than I was the last time I was this weight (when I was 14!). Despite the fact my belly is swollen right now from the surgery.


I am 100% determined to get my strength back as soon as possible, to replace the muscle I lost. I'm going to start yoga again when I hit the 2 week mark, and get running again at the 4 week mark. I fully intend on going camping in a couple of weeks and I want to finish off my internship next week as well. When I go back to uni I'm hitting the gym (yay for free gym!). For major abdominal surgery, I'm not doing too bad! The experience I've had is exactly why fitness is so important, it gives your body the ability to put up a good fight and I know that it will always be a part of my life from now on.


Also when I can swim again nothing is going to stop me from breaking out the bikini, because I am proud of my Frankenbelly!


TLDR; my digestive system sucks but getting fit is awesome and helped me recover from surgery faster :)"
1j10u1,6,2013-07-25,can being 5'10 415 pounds prevent someone from getting a job?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1j10u1/can_being_510_415_pounds_prevent_someone_from/,So I was talking to my old high school buddy who use to weight 250 back  in hs and now he's 415.  I ask him what's he up to he saids hes been trying to lose weight.  He's qualified for a lot of jobs and gets interviews but never gets the actual job offers because he thinks its his weight.  He's trying to get a job in IT because hes a computer science major.  He has internship experience that hes gotten through connections but his weight is preventing him from getting a job because he thinks employers will see him being overweight as a liability.  Hes trying to lose weight now.  Is he being realistic or just making up excuses?  I understand jobs like law enforcement or military wouldn't take him but for cs job i think experience is more important than a guys weight.  If he's being realistic about this how fat/skinny does a candidate have to be to not be discriminated against for their weight?
1j0z9v,56,2013-07-25,Michigan - Call/write to your reps about the recent NSA voting (easy info inside).,Befall,Michigan,https://www.reddit.com/r/Michigan/comments/1j0z9v/michigan_callwrite_to_your_reps_about_the_recent/,"Hey all,

Though we live in an age of slacktivism, we should try our best to make it obvious to our congressmen that we give a shit what they're voting. The recent [vote to DEFUND the NSA program](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/07/24/plan-to-defund-nsa-phone-collection-program-has-broad-support-sponsor-says/) was narrowly defeated, and thanks to [this wonderful graph](http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/113/house/1/412), it's easy to know who. For simplicity, I've gathered the congressmen, their vote, and their contact info here:

|Name | District | VOTE | Phone Number|
|:-----|:------:|:-----:|:--------------|
|Justin Amash (R) | MI-3 | YES | (202) 225-3831|
|Kerry Bentivolio (R) | MI-11| YES | (202) 225-8171|
|John Conyers Jr. (D) | MI-13 | YES | (202) 225-5126|
|John D. Dingell (D) | MI-13 | YES | (202) 225-4071 |

|Tim Walberg (R) | MI-7 | NO| (202) 225-6276 |

I implore you, it's quick and easy to make a difference in the interest for our personal freedom. Give a call to their numbers, and 99% of the time, I find you'll leave a message with a secretary or intern.

For those voting **YES**, thank them for fighting for your personal and private freedoms, and if you feel inclined, say whatever else (you've helped my vote, I'll spread the word, etc).

For those voting **NO**, express disappointment for choosing to limit your privacy and personal freedoms, express lack of interest in voting, etc.

Whatever you say, MAKE IT COUNT. We need them to understand that their choices are public and that it makes a difference to us, *especially* when something this important is separated by 12 votes.

Good luck, and thanks for making a difference, Michiganders."

During this time, I am planning on visiting the US for a long weekend to visit a friend who goes to UVA.

UK citizens can visit the Bahamas for 90 days without a visa, and can also visit the US for 90 days without a visa (using the ESTA, and under the VWP). Would coming from the Bahamas to America and then back to the Bahamas cause any problems provided that my overall stay for the trip will no exceed the 90 days in either country (or even the combined time of the two of them.)

This is my first time travelling abroad solo, so any help, and any other tips about visiting either of these places would be very much appreciated. Thanks!

1j03fb,0,2013-07-24,How to organize a bidding war?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1j03fb/how_to_organize_a_bidding_war/,"Hello everyone.  I'm going to try to explain my situation as briefly as possible, but feel free to skip to the questions to get the gist of it.

I'm a CS major about to wrap up my final semester this fall.  I am currently interning for a local company making pretty decent money doing some moderately dull work.  I am fairly certain that this company would like to hire me upon graduation.

Before starting at this company, I worked at a different company making similar money, doing slightly more interesting work.  This company would also like to hire me upon graduation.

I was recently contacted by a recruiter for yet *another* company that I had expressed interest in at a job fair in the past year or so, and we have begun discussing the possibility of starting an internship (at similar pay) to move into a full time position upon graduation.

It feels a little early to be looking for full time positions.  I was only planning on reaching out to companies maybe half way through my last semester, so I would be interviewing as the semester came to an end.

**Questions Start Here**

How early is too early to start looking for full time positions?

And from a more devious standpoint, is it feasible to try to organize many interviews and negotiations in parallel such that I can bounce offers and counteroffers back and forth between potential employers?  I've heard of this technique being used to get a good deal on a car, by calling local dealerships and just asking everyone if they're willing to go lower than the current lowest offer.  Does the overhead of interviewing and going through the various motions mean this is unfeasible for a job search?

And finally, how much time do employers usually allow for a response before an offer expires?  Will a company be offended if they give me an offer and I say ""sounds decent, just give me a month or two to talk to a bunch of other companies before I give you an answer""?

Thanks in advance everyone, I always get good responses here."
1izzbc,0,2013-07-24,My Experience Playing the XBox One,Rubbersoulrevolver,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1izzbc/my_experience_playing_the_xbox_one/,"Today there was a big Microsoft Employee fair, where a bunch of future products were demoed to the full time employees and interns. They showed off the new Skype stuff, the new Lumia (which was cool), but most importantly, they showed off the new Xbox One.

[Here's a pic of it!](http://imgur.com/gJuuCm2)

The first thing I tried was a short demo featuring the controller. The controller itself was very nice; it fit nicely in my hands, and the grips were really... grippy. The coolest thing was the rumble packs near the triggers. It felt really immersive.     

I asked the employee manning the demo whether the Xbox needed the Kinect to be plugged in. She told me emphatically no. 

I then went over to the Killer Instinct booth. I'm not a real big fan of fighting games, but it seemed fun. They didn't implement any rumble in the controller, so the gameplay felt very unimmersive in my opinion.

Then I watched a demo of Project Spark by one of the developers on the game. It was super awesome! It was demoed on a big touch-screen TV, and the dev indicated that it will work exactly the same on Smart Glass. They also showed off a Limbo skin, where they made the game look exactly like Limbo; art style, gameplay and all. I'm very impressed with it.

I also saw people play Ryse. I didn't play it myself because the line was too long, but everyone was having a lot of fun with it. The graphics looked great, despite being in beta!

I went up and asked a second Xbox employee whether they knew if the Kinect needed to be plugged in. She, too, said it won't have to be. Indeed, she indicated to me that the first demo I tried didn't have the Kinect plugged in, and it still worked.

If you have any other questions about my experience, feel free to ask!

1j4h96,2,2013-07-26,Girlfriend problems,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1j4h96/girlfriend_problems/,"I realize that this is really long, but if someone could take the time to read through all I've been through with this girl, and give me any kind of advice I would be SUPER grateful. I am truly lost. I have no idea what to do. 

**Part 1**

Ok. This is a really long story, but I will try and keep it short. I love my current gf to death. I would do anything for her. When we met we connected almost instantly. The trouble was she had a bf at the time (one who treated her very poorly), however we still became insanely close. Once I realized I had feelings for her I committed to waiting out her relationship. She eventually picked up on this, but it made no real difference. Just as she was about to break up with her old bf, he was in a bad automobile accident. This made her feel obligated to stay with him, which she did. For another 6 months. During this period she even told me that she loved me a couple of times. She eventually broke up with her bf, and it should have been the end, but it wasn't. She got back together with him a few months later. This carried on for another year almost. This was pure TORTURE to sit through AGAIN, but I was convinced she was worth it. Before I had her in my life, I was never happy, and super depressed all the time. Finally, her bf made a huge mistake , and she was able to end it for good. 

**Part 2**

One would think that almost 2 years of waiting would be enough hell to put someone you love through, but apparently not. I didn't pressure her at all after she broke up with her bf because I figured she would need a bit of grieving time, which she appreciated. However one night she kissed me and it led to things getting a little intense, followed by us sleeping together. So logically the next day, I figured I should probably bring it up. And she said that she felt like she needed more time... This was a pretty crushing blow, as it made me feel like I messed up. However, she continued to be extremely flirtatious with me and maintain her status of being single. But I eventually got wind of her leading another guy on, who had a crush on her in high school. When I asked her about it, she assured me that it was nothing, and that they have always had a playful relationship (even though the entire time she had a bf, that guy never talked to her, but the day after they broke up, he started texting her). This continued for about 7 months. It was pure and utter anguish. I have never felt so terrible in my entire life. Yet somehow, I kept waiting. 

**Part 3**

FINALLY, she wised up, and realized that she was slowly but surely killing my capacity to love and ended up asking me to be her boyfriend. I was elated. It had finally paid off. Things were amazing for a while. But then things started popping up. I was able to brush them off for a while, but they began to become problematic. I couldn't go anywhere without her, or she would get upset or sad. I basically had to give up my social life to avoid hurting her feelings. She began to stop spending time with any of her friends and wanted to be around me 100 percent of the time. This put a strain on me, because I was constantly having to drive between my place and hers. She never really came to my place. 

To solve this problem we ended up moving in together after about 6 months of dating. I figured that if we lived together, she would be more comfortable with me having some alone time, since all my free time would be at the apartment with her. WRONG. The problem got so much worse. She expected me to be available at all times, and stupid me obliged her. I don't blame her, because I should have had the balls to tell her straight up that I'm going to go hang out with people other than her, but I always put her happiness ahead of mine, so I never did. This began to lead to lots of arguments, which would always be resolved by the end of the day, however it was still bothersome. The trend I began noticing is that basically anytime I wanted to do something that clashed, even slightly, with her plans or wishes, she would guilt trip me by pouting. She was also clingy to the point of suffocation. It has become a huge issue. 

Well, she left to go to Italy mid-june to study abroad. I was hoping that would make her happy. Nope. She complains a lot about very small things, and lets the fact that she misses me ruin her day. I miss her too, but I try to make the best of it. I don't want her to be unhappy. But she has it great compared to me right now. I'm currently working 7 days a week for 8-12 hours a day at an apartment complex. I just finished an internship as well. I have had a non existent summer. But I manage to keep it positive for her, but she can't do the same. This has led to arguing on the phone as well. I feel bad, but I just can't find it in myself to have to make someone feel better every single day when they are fortunate enough to be doing something so amazing that I was never able to do. This leads to her getting mad and thus, the arguments. 

**Part 4**

Since she has been gone, I have been hanging out with a friend from high school who happens to live at the same complex. I used to hang with her all the time before my gf, but very rarely did I see her, aside from the occasional lunch, once I got with my gf. Well since my gf has gone for Italy, my friend from high school is basically the only close local friend I have, we started hanging out some. At first it was just every now and then, but the last few weeks it has been almost everyday. The sucky part is I feel like I have started developing feelings for her. I don't want too, but she is awesome in so many ways. For example, I don't even bottom playing video games with my gf, because I am very competitive, but in a joking manner. My girlfriend is SUPER sensitive, and it takes all the fun out of it. HS friend, however, trash talks right back to me. We stayed up for 4 hours the other night playing Mario Kart 64. It was the most fun I have had in AGES. Things like that. I feel absolutely horrible for developing feelings. I also feel horrible for wanting to break up with my gf. Because I truly do love her more than anything. I have given her all I had to give. Been patient, loving, and kind. But it just hasn't helped. The thought of her reaction and the hurt she will feel (as well as the hurt I will feel) if I break up with her almost brings me to tears. I don't know if I can (or should) go through with it. Am I the problem here? Or would it be best to end it? It breaks my heart to think about it, but I don't see too many more options.

Not sure what to do.,ineedajobthrowaway,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1j4au8/i_need_to_pay_bills_but_am_conscious_of_what_my/,"I am trying very hard to get out of the nanny industry and put my education to use in a more corporate setting.

I graduated in 2013, then spent 13 months abroad living and working as a nanny. I also nannied all through college. I have realized that no one is impressed at all with this experience. The pay was high compared to my friends making $9/hr or working unpaid internships, but I'm kind of in a panic right now.


 I've been searching for administrative positions but haven't found anything. I'm running out of money and will need to move in two months. I have an interview for a high paying nannying job that is only temporary, 3 months, while their current nanny is away.

I REALLY don't want to take a position like this, but it's kind of getting to the point where I need to. I need the money to stay afloat. What should my next steps be from here? The job would be 50 hours per week and leave a little time for volunteering, but there is a legal clinic I would love to volunteer with, and hopefully form some connections there.

Any advice or direction would be appreciated"

I am going into my second year of law school and currently work a full time unpaid internship and work weekends. I've been using Mint.com to maintain a steady budget. Basically to make sure I don't spend more than the amount of money I take out in loans. 

Here's some more information about my current finances:

I have about $30,000 of undergraduate debt.
When law school is done I will have about $45,000 of debt from just Law School.
I own some stock valued at $150 of which I invested $100. 

The way my school loans work is that I receive financing for 9 months that I am in school and I stretched the money out to last the entire year. 

Since I will be graduating with a lot of debt I want to put myself in the best position I can given my circumstances when I graduate. I've been toying with the idea of getting a part time job during school to make things a little easier. I would appreciate any suggestions, advice, or testimonials. "
1j425p,26,2013-07-26,Supervising undergraduates: is he underperforming or are my standards too high?,[deleted],AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1j425p/supervising_undergraduates_is_he_underperforming/,"I've been here before asking for some advice with working with my summer (undergrad) student.  As of today, I am sort of at the end of my rope.  I don't know if I am being unreasonable (definitely possible) --  I went to college in the 90s and things were pretty different -- or if he is just not making the grade..  He goes to a very high ranked SLAC and upon interviewing him he greatly impressed me with his interests and focus in science, especially since they had everything to do with research and answering questions, and nothing to do with curing disease or going to medical school.  He is going into his senior year now and has no research experience at all.

He is working full-time and I have him on three projects (all connected) to keep him busy during the day.  One project is experiment-based, but he can only run one or two experiments a day at best, which take about an hour to prepare (but hours to run), so to fill the rest of the time I gave him a sort of literature review project and one where he edits some already-produced data of the type he is producing on the bench.

My experience with him as been as follows:

(1) There is almost nothing I can simply ask him to do, he must be shown and given very explicit directions about everything.  I don't mind this when it comes to the science, but it's also just basic research skills, he couldn't write an outline for a paper or do a literature search for a recent paper without me showing him exactly how to do, and essentially doing it for him.  For his literature research all he ever did was read the books I gave him and summarize the information, when I told him explicitly they were just to get him started.

(2) If he doesn't do something immediately after I teach/show/discuss it with him (even after repeated instruction), he completes it in a way that seems sort of half-assed.  I will show him how to do something, then I will watch him do it, then he will do it on his own and do very well.  However, when I repeat the same process with the same task, but I let him take a few days in complete the task on his own rather than immediately after we have done the teaching session, it is clear he has forgotten a lot of how to do things.  It isn't just the science either, it's even simple steps in data entry.  I've asked him to take notes when we talk and I give him my own directions, but I don't think he looks at them.

(3) He doesn't seem to want to troubleshoot/figure things out on his own (this may be related to (1) above).  I admit that when I give him things to do, sometimes I leave some information out hoping he will look it up on his own so gets the feeling he is learning and accomplishing something, not just connecting the dots.  I mean this is real research and the age of Google, there is someone on the internet somewhere who has had the same question.

We have a meetings every day for half an hour so I feel he has plenty of time to ask me questions and we can go over things, plus we work in the same office and he can talk to me any time other than that.

EDIT: Since this thread is still alive, I'll add some information.  First, thanks for such an interesting discussion.  The student is doing a summer internship, and he is almost completed it.  Midway we had a talk where I said it was good time to switch from ""school"" mode (I give him assignments, grade them, and then return them) to ""project"" mode, where he takes time to think about what needs to get done, how to do it, and how much time he thinks it will take (all with my counsel).  A lot of people are saying here that it is unreasonable to expect a student to be able to do a literature search, but when I taught freshman (at a university) they wrote papers with current literature, and when I was in college -- before the real internet, when it was much harder to do this type of search -- I wrote plenty of papers from year one using journal articles.  Thus none of my experience, on either side, ever indicated that doing a literature search would be so daunting as to be impossible, it seems this is a skill that is passed on very unevenly in undergrad education."

The company I work for decided to hire an IT company to design a Sharepoint intranet, and I was handed responsibility of the project after the person originally in charge of it decided to resign. I've only been an intern for a couple of weeks, and it's a major project I've been given (usually interns do not get such projects to run, but they are short on staff in the purchasing department so they handed it to me.)

I was hoping you could give me a few things to include or push for in the contract between my company and the IT company we have decided to give the job to. For example:

1. What would be a good way to measure 'milestones' or 'phases' of the project in a way that our IT department can confirm that they are delivering on time? We plan to pay them after the completion of each 'phase/ milestone' but it hasn't been decided how to specify what these are.

2. An offshoot of the previous question: How do I include the concept of monetary or other form of 'penalties' in case the contracted company falls behind planned output? 

3. Should I ask them for some particular features/ add-ons to include to the intranet project? My company is a mid-sized, global engineering manufacturing firm, if that helps.

4. Please give me any other suggestions you have. It's my first main project, and I do not want to mess it up. 

5. Are there some things that I can get them to add for free or at really low cost, that would be quite helpful? 

Thank you for your help.

I’m a longterm lurker and just joined last night.I was told to move this from /TIFU to here 


Hi! I love Breaking Bad. Very much so. Obsessed would be a great word. Malcom in the Middle is another show that I love (Bryan Cranston is pretty great overall, just saying!).I love geeky things. I love animation and art. I love animals. I think that, by now Gambit should have his own movie and I think that Avatar was a little overrated. Disney is wonderful and Lilo and Stitch will always be my favorite movie.


There’s usually a smile on my face and laughter leaving my lips. Not now, though.


My beautiful relationship with the most wonderful man came to an end.


I sense some of you leaving already.


But, please, let me share my story.


He was my best friend, my partner in damn near everything. He was the man who made me laugh, made me smile, and the first to treat me like a princess.


You see, at times I have very low self-esteem. It’s something I have to work on. But he made me feel beautiful. He showed me how talented I was and how much I had to offer the world. It’s because of him that I got the courage to apply for an internship at a pretty big media company and I got the internship! It has been an awesome experience and the connections that I have made through it are great.


He stood by my side through thick and through thin. He was there for two surgeries (one being a back surgery) and was my comfort when I was sad, in pain, or discouraged. We shocked everyone by doing what we could with our relationship with the three-thousand miles between us. He would come to visit me and I would go to visit him. We even traveled to go see our favorite band together on a mini road trip once I healed from my surgery. We went hiking through a redwood forest because, being a New Englander, I had never seen them before. He laughed and took pictures as I ran in to the Pacific Ocean in Northern California in January because I wanted to swim! I was with him for his first Broadway show where we drank wine out of what we called “Broadway sippy cups”. On our first Valentine’s Day, he got me a Vermont Teddy Bear because flowers die and chocolates don’t last forever. Last year he got me a dipped silver rose because he knew how much I loved roses but didn’t want to give me one that would die. He made me a necklace with gold flakes in it that he panned in Alaska. I could call him whenever I needed to. He taught me how to enjoy and appreciate single malt scotch. He pushed me through my studies and at the beginning of the year when I was having a tough time emotionally, he never left my side, even when his best friend and I had a falling out. He never judged me. He was my stability and my rock. He never showed that there was a problem.

Until a couple of nights ago. All of his frustration came out. I thought it was a breakthrough. Some of my questions were finally answered. And then that was it. It was over. 


It takes a special person to love someone with anxiety and depression. It’s hard, I know that. But we both had our flaws and we both made it through for as long as we were together. He never made me feel different because of my anxiety or depression and with every mountain I climbed, he was the first to tell me how proud he was of me. I’m one class away from my BS in a major that I love. I’m sending out my resume to companies that I hope they will hire me in this state that I moved to, 3,000 miles away from home to be closer to him and to live in the hub of the field that I am in. My life is about to become amazing and I wish he was here to share it with me. It's not fair. I don't want to walk this path alone. 


I still love him, Reddit. It’s stupid, I know.


I joined the site to make people happy. Where I can offer advice, I will. Where I can comfort sorrow, I will. I want to make people who are sad as happy as he once made me.


I just needed to get this off of my chest.


That’s my story, Reddit. Have a great day.

I am new to the city and just started attending classes for a Master's degree in Computer Science at DePaul. I received a Bachelor's of the Arts in English in 2011. I have intern experience with a literary journal doing audio editing, literary editing and a little page-building. I worked for an SEO doing freelance writing for a short while.

I also have about three years combined customer service experience; I spent most of my undergraduate years in restaurant and retail environments.

I have experience building and troubleshooting my own computer. I also had some hardware experience working on the audio editing machines during my internship. I am familiar with OSX, Windows (through 7, with a little experience in 8,) and Linux (Fedora/Ubuntu). I have been studying programming for school and have a very basic knowledge of Python and Java and continue to study them in my own time. I can type 90+ WPM.

I would really love a tech job of any kind, and would welcome one as lowly as they come. I am looking for any excuse to learn more about computers and to exercise some problem-solving skills on IT related issues.

However, I am not limited to just that. I am highly adaptable, love to learn and open to just about anything. The biggest concern is just being able to make a little money to keep me going during grad school.

I am looking for part-time work, preferably on weekdays. I can work closer to full-time during breaks. 

If any of this smorgasboard of skills fits your needs, PM me for more details and/or a resume. 

Thank you for your interest! "

***
*What Is and What is to Come*
***
* What is: IU lost 4 key players. Zeller and Oladipo are obvious at 2 and 4 pick in the draft, but Jordan Hulls' leadership and winning mentality had been unmatched in the past decade of IU basketball. Christian Watford is a key departure as well. We are left with Will Sheehey as our senior leader and Yogi Ferrell as probably our best player, which is good enough to make us fringe top-25 ranked to start the season, emphasis on fringe. The big question marks are our unproven but quite talented freshman class (led by Vonleh, Williams, Fischer), how much improvement comes from our sophomores (mostly Perea and Hollowell), and leadership (Sheehey, Yogi, and hopefully Gordon and Etherington). Eric Gordon's younger brother Evan has transferred from ASU and will compete with Williams, etc. for starting 2 guard minutes. Crean basically plays 4 guards anyway so expect 3-4 of these 2 guards to get major minutes. We will be thinner down low so expect a perimeter oriented offense and fast break style surrounding Vonleh and Fischer/Perea. Defensively in the B1G we will be tested since we aren't big down low and won't have many big bodies off the bench.

* To Come: Tom Crean is ALWAYS recruiting so if someone checked back in next week our recruiting situation could be different. But our top priority is an elite point guard always. I'd say IU has as good of a chance to land Dante Exum as anyone, which isn't even that great of a chance. He could go pro after next year without coming to the states as he is from Australia. Also, Goodluck Okonoboh, Ahmed Hill, Phil Booth, etc. are on our radar. James Blackmon has already committed for 2014 and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpF4cI8Zzss) and others out there should speak for itself. Averaged something like 32 pts for his high school team and has done very well this summer also. Tre Lyles was committed before both parties realized IU wouldn't be a good fit. 
TL;DR we always are looking for good guards and wings and if we can land Okonoboh or another elite big man our 2014 class could be special.

*Random Tidbits*
***

* Larry Bird would have been a part of the 1976 undefeated IU team as a freshman.
* Bob Knight cried once describing how Isaiah Thomas was an ambassador of the game. He also stuffed an intern (secretary?) into a trashcan.
* Breaking Bad’s Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks) attended IU
* IU hosts the largest collegiate bicycle race every year called the Little 500. It is generally a week of drinking and general debauchery, capped off by a relay bike race. A fictionalized version of this event and much of campus was featured in the movie [Breaking Away](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Away). 
* For the years prior to Assembly Hall's renovation, IU's home win percentage was around .920
* After Bob Knight's first game as coach, IU player Steve Green got into a fist fight with an IU student who was trashing Knight's slow, motion offense, and team defense style of play. That student most likely came around as Knight's record in his first 5 years was 125-20.
* While we are regarded as a basketball school, it turns out IU’s soccer team has more NCAA soccer championships (8) than basketball (5), most recently with winning this past year’s college cup.
* A funny [mock campus tour video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCERVghyDms) since you made it all the way to the bottom.

I haven't been browsing here as much and since I'm not in AA or SMART, I think it's time I get involved again.

Currently, I'm happy in my sobriety. I'm working an internship toward my career, taking my last classes for my degree, being active, and in addition I've been meeting some new people.

Everyone new I've met drinks. I wouldn't consider them alcoholic at all--we've hung out many more times sober than when they weren't, including late night parties, and the few times a month they do drink it's only a few. I'm not even sure one of them does drink. I realize by looking at them and their relationship with the stuff that there is no real relationship at all and how truly alcoholic I am. I feel they shouldn't be a bad influence on me.

Additionally, part of my internship involves working with people who have DUII convictions or diversions. So I spend a good 12 hours a week listening to how alcohol has ruined lives and the lies these people tell themselves and how delusional they are. I feel they shouldn't be a bad influence on me.

But for some reason, all this re-exposure to alcohol has begun to get some wheels turning. No one I've met has ever tried to get me to drink and they have each been supportive of my choice. And I really am happy that I don't drink. But I've been really honest with myself this time and to be honest is to admit exposing myself to alcohol again has given me some desire to take a few sips, have my intake increase until my first binge, make myself sick, possibly killing myself, and watch my life enter complete chaos again.

I don't feel I'm just on the edge of that next drink quite yet, but I don't like these intrusive thoughts or feelings. So. That's why I have you guys.

I'm sorry this was so long and a bit of a rant. As always, thank you all very much."

I'm a Dutch student,Rick93NL,California,https://www.reddit.com/r/California/comments/1j3gqt/any_advice_on_how_to_apply_for_advercies_in/,"From begin 2014 till mid 2014 I'll be doing a graduation internship and I hope in California.

My plan is to move to California once I've finished my study in the Netherlands and I thought doing an internship beforehand would be great to increase the odds of finding a job next year.

I was hoping that some people could give me tips on how to apply in America/California, is it any different than in Europe? I know that I'm in a disadvantage because companies will likely be to ignore my applications quicker, applying for a visa can be a time consuming process..

Anyways, I hope I'll soon be enjoying the California way of life!

But I acknowledge that sometimes it’s nice to be able to speak my mind and let things out, so that’s what I’m doing now.

I just, for whatever reason, feel so disappointed with life. I’m not really sure why, as I’ve had a pretty good life up to this point. Anyone looking at me from the outside would say that I’ve been quite successful – I was salutatorian in high school, and I am doing an awesome paid internship at the moment – but really, I’m just so unsatisfied with who I am. There were some things that happened to me during my late adolescent/early teen years that I feel really affected me negatively and hurt my personal development through my teen years. I know that I shouldn’t dwell on the past and that I still have control over my own life – hell, I’m only twenty, I have my whole life ahead of me – but for whatever reason, it’s so hard for me to move on. I’m not going to get into my whole life story because I could write a book on it and nobody has time to read all that, but basically it has a lot to do with abusive parents and being brought up in fundamentalist Christianity. A ton of details I’m skipping over here.

Anyway, I feel that many of the things I went through as a child/teen really hurt me. I’m painfully shy now and I can’t force myself to talk to anyone unless they speak to me first. If I’m at work then I’m perfectly fine talking to people, but in my personal life it’s insanely difficult for me. I was constantly criticized by my stepmom for having interests that differed from hers. Everything I did was wrong somehow, and I was always mocked for trying to be myself. And she would try to humiliate me on different occasions. As a result, I try to hide who I am from people. I can’t open up to anyone. When somebody asks me what kind of music I listen to, I can’t just tell them I like X band and Y genre. I give a vague answer like “I like almost all genres of music” and avoid going into specifics. When people talk to me, I feel very nervous. I feel like I have to constantly be alert and watch out for ways I may be caught off guard. I can’t just relax and have a friendly conversation. Every conversation is almost like an interview to me. And I haven’t had any friends since I stopped going to church two years ago. I really wish I had some friends, but opening up to people and allowing them into my life is so difficult for me. I’m also gay, and I’ve kept that fact hidden from everyone too, though I wouldn’t be surprised if people already thought I was gay. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to “come out” or be in a relationship.

Other things are really bothering me, too. I live in North Carolina, and I’m really unhappy with the direction the state is heading. On one hand I want to move somewhere else, but on the other hand I want to do something about it. But I just don’t feel strong enough to do something about it. I feel like I need to help myself before I can help anyone else. I’m tired of people making jokes or bigoted comments about things I can’t control. I know I shouldn’t, but I take it personally. It’s like I can’t do anything right, even though I have no control over where I was born or what my orientation is.

I’ll stop now. I just needed to let off some steam and get some things off my chest. Sorry if this is incoherent. I just needed to get my thoughts in text form and can't bring myself to read it again right now."
1j3e1m,54,2013-07-26,Intern Stories: Night rounds,tunatunayeah,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j3e1m/intern_stories_night_rounds/,"I'm currently an intern in a hospital that I'm not gonna name anymore (confidentiality reasons) and being an intern in a place where deaths happen regularly..well, you better expect a lot of crazy shit to happen. Just for the heck of it, I'll share some of my intern stories.

So this crazy thing happened some weeks ago. I had a 12 hour duty from 7pm to 7am that night. Things were pretty chill at the lab, I only got called about twice by the clinical instructor to extract blood from two patients from the children's ward. Around about 12 am or 1, a patient suspected to have dengue fever was rushed in the emergency room. Once the boy's fever was managed, he was transferred to a room in the children's ward and I was ordered to extract blood from him for a complete blood and platelet count. So me and my clinical instructor went to extract blood from the boy, he was fairly calm and all. After the extraction my clinical instructor left me to take care of the labeling and shit because she was needed in another floor. I took my kit, placed the sample securely in my tube holder and then went on my way back to the laboratory. 

On my way, I noticed that one room's door was wide open, as if a patient was gonna be discharged from the room. This puzzled me. I'm still fairly new and I've never encountered patients being discharged at this time of the night (or morning's more like it), so I discreetly peeked in. I could easily see the patient's bed and the one occupying it. What I saw puzzled me even more because there was a lady lying on the bed. Her back was turned on the door so I couldn't see her face but it was easy to see that she didn't belong in the children's ward because she had long graying (almost silvery) hair and her paper gown exposed her wrinkly, liver-spotted back. he wasn't hooked up to any IV's or anything so I thought maybe she had memory problems and simply got lost. So I walked in the room with the intention of asking her if she's lost and at the same time, discreetly looking at her patient bracelet. I readied my gentlest, friendliest voice (that would've been the first non-blood extraction interaction I'd have with a patient, okay?) and tapped her shoulder. 
I said, ""Well hello there madam, I'm sorry but this is the children's ward. You seem to h-""

I didn't finish my sentence because the old lady slowly turned to gaze at me....well she would've gazed at me IF she had eyes. Her whole face was just blank. It was all jut wrinkly, graying and decaying skin. I didn't friggin' know what to do, my hand was still on the lady's shoulder and for the life of me, I couldn't move. I was snapped out of my trance when I saw the lady's left hand twitch and reach out for my paralyzed hand. That's when I flinched back and ran out.
I think it took me less than two minutes to run back to the ground floor, in the safety of the clinical laboratory. When I dashed in my clinical instructor and a bunch of the other interns who were having coffee looked at me. I was still shaking but I managed to tell them what happened. The other interns were terrified as shit but my clinical instructor was all smiles, saying ""Well, I guess you've met no face. So where's your kit and the blood sample?"". I realized in dismay that I'd left it in 'no face's' room. 
""Well, you better get it before no face herself give it back to you"", my clinical instructor said laughingly, but then she added ""Seriously though, demerits on your part if you don't get the sample back. Those platelets are very sensitive you know"".

I will graduate in May with a BS and MS from a top-10 US school with around a 3.7 GPA (probably).  I have about 3 years of development experience from before school, and I went back to get a formal CS education and hopefully find something that interests me. I love algorithms, CS theory, and math, but I found AI to be pretty interesting as well.  I've been focusing on it in school and these are some of the courses I've taken (along with the core CS stuff and several math classes):

* Machine Learning
* Data Mining
* NLP
* Information Retrieval
* Neural Networks
* Autonomous Robots
* Distributed Systems

Here's my situation:
I really want to apply what I've learned (in other words, I don't want to be a general code-monkey anymore -- hence why I'm getting the Masters).  However, in my internships I've always been given pretty boring, general development projects.  I have a very generous full-time offer to return to the place I'm currently at, but no guarantee of what I'll be working on or what team I'll be on.  I even have confirmation from my manager that the chances of working on AI/ML are pretty low. But...it is a good company with good work-life balance, and the potential to work in something interesting is possible, but not guaranteed.  I'm also not a huge fan of the company's location.

Given my profile and the current job market, what are my chances of obtaining a position in my area of interest (AI/ML/etc)? Is it realistic, or should I just give up and go with the offer I've got?

I would value any advice, especially from recruiters or hiring managers who know the market, or others who have been in similar situations or have a similar profile.

Thanks!"
1j2rlx,2,2013-07-25,Best plan for CS non-major/CS minor?,ftfthroway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1j2rlx/best_plan_for_cs_nonmajorcs_minor/,"I'll try to be as brief as possible, but I do have specific questions for my personal circumstances.

I just finished my first year of college at a large state school with a well known College of Engineering and CS department.  I came in majoring in electrical engineering, but quickly realized I did not want to pursue that as a career.  I took a visual basic course in community college while in high school (waste of time/ junk course which did not teach good programming habits or theory, but still somewhat interesting), and the final project for our ece class involved making programming and embedding an Arduino micro-controller(got over 100% on that project which helped save me from my test scores;). I then realized that I greatly enjoyed programming.

Second semester, I decided to transfer into CS, which requires the completion of a intro CS course in Java(covered OOP, recursion, and various sorts), and a discrete math course which I am about to complete.  Unfortunately, it seems everybody else and their grandmother is trying to transfer, and while I did well in the Java course, I don't think my discrete math grade will be high enough to get into the department.  This is a problem because a) I actually enjoyed both of these courses(yes even theory) and want to major in Computer Science because I am interested in the field on a personal level and b) aside from that, I want a career as a developer.

But can't just sit around and bitch and moan all day, especially considering my ambition to work as a developer is still totally achievable, which brings me to my options.  Let's assume I choose to major in physics, another subject which I feel personally interest while still within my school's engineering college and because I may yet wish to work in physics:

* I can obtain a minor in computer science, which will require a course in data structures as mandatory, and three other CS electives.  (I want to be clear here that I do **NOT** want to do this for a minor piece of paper).  The three electives I would consider taking would be any three of the following: *Algorithms*(relevant knowledge for anyone who wants to work in any form of development and a must for interviews), *Parallel Computing*(useful in physics research and the fact that most personal computing devices have multiple CPUs from what I have read few people seem to know well), *Numerical Analysis*(a must for any computational physics research), *Theory of Computation*(generally theoretical problem solving skills for computer science problems).  There are other courses I would be interested in such as systems programming, graphics, AI etc. that all sound interesting and fun to take, but I only get three and my university is very strict about its major/minor only policy.

* Needless to say, I plan to much more programming on my own,  I taught myself a limited amount of C/C++ at the beginning of the summer but never really did any projects, but I plan to start a portfolio and maybe start dabbling in C# .Net and also some scripting languages.

* Resume building, such as finding an internship for next summer is imperative to me.  However, does choosing between a straight developer internship vs doing computational based research limit me in the other respective field (i.e. how do i get the best of both worlds while keeping my future options open). I plan to hit up my college career center and start getting serious about my internship/research search.

All of this is based on what i have read online and the limited amount I have learned in a classroom thus far.  

**tl;dr** Unable to major in CS at my uni, will probably major in physics instead with CS minor, which electives to take to optimize my career and other general advice.

Your feedback is appreciated.

1j2p0l,3,2013-07-25,I [23/m] have a crush on shy girl [24/f] for a few months. Can't find good moment to tell her,hillhill333,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1j2p0l/i_23m_have_a_crush_on_shy_girl_24f_for_a_few/,"I met this girl a 3 years ago. When I got my first job, she was an intern where I was working, she ended her internship a few months later and became co-workers for a while. We developed a good friendship and I felt somewhat attracted to her, but not enough to make my move, we have a circle of friends with a few co-workers as well, we all often gathered for having meals together, play videogames, drinks at someone house, we still meet up once in a while, we are all good friends, but keep in mind that I'm definitely not on the friend zone with her. I left that job almost two years ago but we all keep in touch, she eventually left the company too and joined mine almost a year ago. Since that time, we started to share a little bit more together and not directly with the group, since February this year I really got a crush for her and nowdays is extremely strong and I just can't stand another day without telling her.


She is shy and most of the time hates to be around people, she is very cool when she's around people she knows. She is very intelligent with a bizarre sense of humor at times (which I fucking love and share with her), she's very pretty and somewhat short compared to me, I now feel physically attracted to her too.

The thing is, she is very dull, she does not have any hobby at all, she does nothing on the weekends, really, NOTHING, she spends all day sleeping, sharing images on facebook (we have a closed group on FB with those friends I mentioned above) playing videogames or eating trash food. EVERY Single time I ask her out to have a coffee, go out for dinner, EVEN if I know she's hungry and would certainly welcome a meal or coffee, she would say ""Nah, I'm too lazy"" that's her phrase for everything ""I'm too lazy"", it's extremely complicated for me to bring up a decent conversation because there's no topic of conversation that can come from her and I feel I'm pushing it by trying to bring up something to talk about, she loves to talk about other people (their shortcomings, their flaws, gossip, etc) but she never talks about herself (or if she does she talks about her sister or her parents), and she's like that with everyone, not just me.

I really think something is wrong with her but I can't make her to open up without feeling pushy. It's been months trying to find a moment to have a deep conversation with her about stuff. I want to tell her how much I like her and how much I would like to try things out with her, but I can't find that moment to tell her that. We live nearby and carpool together, one week she picks me up, another one I pick her up and that's the only alone moment I have with her, should I tell her that I have a huge crush for on while driving? I don't want to tell her that through a message or chat or something lame, I want a good moment on a quiet place, probably sharing a meal or a coffee and just... talk with her you know? but she won't accept any of my attempts to go out, even when I said 'I have something I would like to tell you' she said no... I'm really getting tired about this and feeling like just giving up and moving on, but I feel there is a lot she has to share with someone, I know she is a beautiful person but I'm very frustrated trying to crack that shell you know...

Should I just tell her that I have a crush on her while driving? Are those signs that she doesn't want anything with me? "
1j2ie0,17,2013-07-25,"First time here, a little backstory on me:",jw88p,GayBroTeens,https://www.reddit.com/r/GayBroTeens/comments/1j2ie0/first_time_here_a_little_backstory_on_me/,"Drum roll commence: I am 15 years old. Entering my sophomore year of high school. I am openly gay. Ooopenly. Todo el mundo status. Facebook official. I've known I was gay since I started masturbating. We'll call that 11. 

Curtain opens: First day of 6th grade. I'm the smart awkward kid who wears a brown shirt literally every day. I'm not sure if it was a goth thing or not. Whatever. Anyways. Cute girl, actually I will note right here that every name except my own has been switched. She is called Francesca I suppose. Anyways the young pre-pubescent me really enjoyed looking at her. A lot. Her hand touched mine? God had just touched my hand. I was obsessed with her. Her looks. The way she dressed. Gawsh. In computer class, she helped me with something and her hand touched mine? OOOOOO

Around this time puberty started to become noticeable, and by that I mean hair. Hair. Everywhere, I was like yeah I'm a mother fuckin man now right? Anyways it was this time that I discovered porn. I wasn't quite sure what to do with it. Continuing. Probably within a month of that I realised I looked at the guys a lot more than the girls. What can ya do. I quickly discovered 'gay porn'. If gay means happy, it certainly made me feel that way. Everyday I would spike up my hair. I guess it made me cute, or whatever because pretty soon I had the slutty girls going for me. (I fucking know, right? Slutty girls at 11-12, Jesus). Whilst ""dating"" these girls I continued delving into homosex. I soon stopped with the hair because the guys told me it made me look gay. By this time I had assumed that I was at the very least bisexual, and not very interested in sharing it con el mundo, you see.

There was a cute blonde boy in my grade. I guess we can call him Rick. I quickly became obsessed with him. With a 12 year olds hormones in mind, I suppose you likely know what I mean. I did whatever I could to be close to him. I really really hoped he was gay. That would've made my year. In fact I decided that if he was gay I would come out to be with him. Yeh fucking right. I sat at his table for lunch a bit, abandoning friends I had had since the 1st grade. I guess that was the beginning of the end of the friendship with them, but that is another story that I'll get to later.

Soon summer came. With it I didn't see Rick for 10 weeks, but I replaced him with porn. My iPod quickly became filled with porn. Lots of it.

This summer I became better friends with an old friend. His name was Ike. He was born in Kyoto and moved here in Kindergarten. His father was born in Sweden and his mother Japan. What can you do, you certainly can't choose your parents. No, I didn't hit on Ike like that. We were friends only, we still are. I slept over his house often. We were always hanging out. His dad works in the English department at a university in our town. We were often there, exploring the halls. One time, we were in the locker room, and this massive man like 400 lbs came out of the shower to get soap and we was like wadafuq wadafuq and we high tailed out of there. The glass walkways for us being 12, are the equivalent of giving a ball to a 3 year old. We pissed off sooooo many people haha. Anyways I'm just emphasizing that we were good friends. Summer ended quickly.

Enter 7th grade. I had 2 classes with Ike. Math 7A (advanced, or pre-Algebra) and English. Again this year I had no classes with Rick. I sat with him at lunch everyday. This year was the Washington DC trip. Coincidentally the midterm election, but that's irrelevant. I was going to do whatever I could to get to bunk with him. I got him and 2 others (4 to a room) to sign off on a slip saying they would for school. I turned it in.

They didn't. The next day I went to school. The fucks had screwed me over. Fuck fuck fuck fucking fucks. They had changed to another ugly ginger boy who is not the same one I will mention later, and they regretted it they told me during the trip. I mean they had promised him before me, but still. They said sorry, but ugh. 

I left their lunch table. I felt betrayed. I moved with my old friends. Ike and a hottie who we can call Henry who is literally a god, were the black holes for us, the galaxy to circle around. They welcomed me back, but said they had already formed a Washington group. I was literally fucked. I got stuck in a group with some dumbass who didn't shower or put on deodorant or brush his teeth the whole time we were down there. We can call him Peter. Fucking Peter. He was sooo ugly. In addition to that, he went to bed at 10:30. Like what the actual fuck. Something funny about him is that he accidentally walked into the women's restroom at the WWII memorial. Our staff guy literally picked him up and placed him out of there. Picture massive black guy throwing little white boy out on grass in front of many, many (I mean it's Washington) tourists. He called him a peeping tom. Anyways, that was Peter. Here's the rest of the trip:

Washington.

Day 1: We woke up at 5:00 to get on the bus bright and early. We were all packed in the school cafeteria with our luggage. One ass hole in my outer sphere of friends, shoved another asshole into the wooden stage. Crack. 5 stitches in the head. Poor fuck couldn't go. But the asshole who shoved him could. Like wtf mate. Yes, well anyways we were set to get there at 11:00 and go for a tour of the Pentagon because someone had an uncle who was high level brass. Anyways. Some idiot decided to shoot at the Pentagon and we had to go to the zoo. It rained. That was the first leg of the worst field trip of my life.

Day 2. We did the usual stuff. National mall, reflecting pool, FDR memorial, Air and Space Museum, bla-bla-blah. Very uneventful to start out with, but it get's bad. Very. Very. Bad. 

The afternoon. Right after viewing the national archives, we sat on the steps outside. A girl asked if she could play games on my iPod. I said sure, I'm a nice guy. Too nice. She decided to look through my search history for god knows why. I mean she is a bit of a whore, I suppose she was checking if I watched porn, but guess what? I do!  ""Gay teen pprn, gay teen porn, gay porn, gay sex,gay videos.."". Whatever you can imagine. The news that I was a fag spread like wildfire. Curiously enough another boy had the same thing happen to him. Devin. Devin wasn't cute yet, I mean he is now but he hadn't grown into it yet. I told anyone who asked that it was my brothers iPod. Yeah right. I was devastated. I had to walk with these people for like 100000000 blocks after that back to our buses. We weren't supposed to have phones, (but iPod's were cool for god knows why) and yet as kids will do, the news reached my entire class in under an hour.

All I remember after that was going to the Jefferson memorial that night and spouting facts about him, to my very impressed guidance councilor. The next day was brisk. We got on the bus and the girls who had somehow figured out I was gay in 6th grade all were asking me the same thing. Well are you?

Fucking no! Eww Jesus NOOOO! Sigh. On the bus home I sat next to a cute boy Evan, but I didn't care anymore. I was contemplating suicide ffs. Evan has a reputation as a hacker. So I used him as IT. ""How do you delete an app? Which one? Google. Like this:"" Boom. Gone. If I had done that 3 days ago I doubt I would be writing this right now.

That was almost 3 years ago. All of 7th grade. Are you gay? I heard you like gay porn. Faggot. Faggggg. Sigh again. I don't blame them. When I've asked them about most have apologized. MOST. My close friends didn't believe it, and I told them nothing to the contrary. It was around this time that I started crushing on Henry. Big time. And I had credible evidence in my head he was gay. That can be read below.

One day, out of the fucking blue he asked our table if we support the LGBT. I was like wtf Henry. The boy next to me, Dean said what's that, and Henry responded: lesbian gay bisexual transgender. Dean said no that's disgusting. Henry said if you hate gay people then you are just a massive douche.

In hindsight I bet that his sister had recently come out to him or something, but I don't know that for sure. I was stunned either way. Later I asked him if he was gay, and he responded agressively (verbal agression I mean) with no!! Intrigued I was. That was the way I usually responded to that question. How very similar. I quickly fell for him. His clothes. His hair. The beautiful skin from his Anglo-Indian mix. Dear god. Anyway. I recently came out to my cousin and she had told me that his sister was dating some girl. I was out to a few girls in my grade at this point, and a really stereotypical gay guy in the grade above. I came out to my mother shortly after and we both cried. She told me this wasn't the life she had imagined for me and that it is very hard. Meh. Thank's mom.

Summmerrr. I hung out a lot with Ike this summer. Henry was off at soccer camp. So I became Ike's best friend for a bit. I was at his house constantly, and he mine. I'm a big Halo nerd, and he's COD loser, so we clashed over video games. Though I did find him a very nice laptop because his grandparents were buying him one, so any animosity was soon gone.

New York had recently legalised gay marraige, and one of the senators that was a crucial yea vote lived down the road. I decided to gauge Ike's view on this. He said something to the matter of it didn't matter to him or something. We watched the worst movie of 2011 that night. Battle Los Angeles I think. It was a shitty alien movie Whatever. I don't remember much of anything from this summer. I don't even remember where we vacationed. Perhaps the Outer Banks. Not sure. Anyways, end summer now. 

Inset day one of 8th grade. 6th period Earth Science. Mrs. Barne. The most LGBT friendly lady in the school. She had a safespace flag and all that jazz. She had a faggot definition sign. One kid, Jordan made fun of it. He has been my friend since 1st grade, and I was a little upset, but that didn't compare at all to Mrs. Barne. She was sooooooooo pissed. I loved that class. In fact my grades were at an all time high for middle school But the bullying. My parents looked set to split, my grades quickly dropped to shit. I couldn't take it. I skipped 2 days of school. On the 3rd day I was admitted to a psychiatric hospital and put on suicide watch. I hated it.

You have no idea how bad those places are. If you or someone you love needs that sort of help, I highly highly recommend an out-patient sort of thing. The kids there were inner city fucks. One of them was there for manslaughter. It was essentially a pseudo-prison. I played good kid and got the fuck out. 22 days. Out of school. Rumor was I died. I spread the rumor it was mono on facebook. Excellent grade A excuse.

On the day before Thanksgiving 2011 I told the world I was gay. Todo el mundo haha. First response was from Henry, and he said something like respect, that took some cojones amigo, et cetera. Soon I was Duke of the gays according to the President (King) of the high school GSA. He also happened to be Maureen's best friend, who I might mention a bit. I was happy. I got a lot of people come out to me and thanking me for opening the door for them. One of them, who I wish hadn't, was Jeb. He was a good looking boy, and my first gay kiss. Then we became facebook official. 67 likes. His father found out. He backtracked into the closet. He is still there. He blamed me and said voices in his head told him to do things with me. He has since apologized and re-come out to my telling me they were made up to hide him. His father is a mean SOB. So I sent him an email, and told him what I thought of him. I ended up in the guidance office, not for the last time, for doing so. I wonder why he thought that would do anything, telling the school. My father is on the Board of Education. Not really anything you can do on that front buster.

So he banned Jeb from talking to me. Calling me. Seeing me. Texting me. He checked his phone every day. At different times. I felt like absolute hell. Skip a few months. May 2012. Bamboozle. That excellent concert in Asbury Park. Cute guys everywhere. My cousin, whom I was there with. Hooked up with a lifeguard. How cliche, amirite? This was the time I started making my gay teen vlog. It's still up on yt. I loved that weekend. I could taste high school. More gay guys to hook up with. Yehhhhh. Middle school ended.

I had an average summer, went to a radio camp, spent 2 weeks in south Florida in Ft Lauderdale Miami area. Where my mom grew up. I love it there. So much. I made a vlog on the beach there. Lauderdale by the sea. The little fro yo shop right by the beach. Awww yeahhhh.

Get home. August. Enter Miguel, my Dominicain boyfriend. That summer, at 14 for me, and 16 for him, we each got our first man sexual experience. Nothing virgin status. But earth shattering nonetheless. We didn't last long. By September we were over, and I was hitting on Henry every chance I got in school. He was in 5 of my classes. Biology was the best. I had a desk behind him and I would stare at him everyday. Some days. Nevermind too sexual. Anyways. My gbffl told me pour my heart out to him. So one October night in 2012, I did.

Henry is 100% straight. Sadly. For me at least. December. Enter a ginger twink named Sam who I had on and off flings with. We exchanged messanges. He hates relationships. In February, in a bathroom stall somewhere in Podunk New York, we 'hooked up'. Again, nothing virgin status, but still. We quickly ended whatever that was. Enter again Miguel in March. Enter virginity loss. Unprotected. Worst decision ever.

The unprotected part I mean. In November that year we had some HIV+ gay dude come give us a don't do that peptalk. He asked us what we had called gay that morning. I raised my hand and said me. He said:""omg, I love you"". He had a moment, and the entire auditorium clapped for Jake the gay kid. March again. Neither of us had any diseases, but still. Here's an overview of my family: my dads dad:? my dads mom:bitchface drunk old rich lady my moms parents: wonderful people. My brothers dad: some Mexican guy my mom met in college at FAU. My parents: okay, middle class Americans. We are WASPs through and through.

I thought the above was important to note. Anyways. Miguel and I are no longer together. It is now July. The place I went to radio camp for loved me. I have a weekly broadcast and I am a liscenced Board Operator for the studio. I work for the radio, a summer internship is a better title. I have five brothers.

The oldest has another dad. I'm kid number 3. Brother 2, Jodey, had a girlfriend Maureen. She is currently a good friend of mine. They ended amicably. She painted a nude twink today. Live model. She has a summer thing at Cooper Union. It's a weird life. But it's mine. This is my life so far. Anyone care to comment?

1j2cwt,4,2013-07-25,Grade this for me! thx,The-Dude-abides,Proofreading,https://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/1j2cwt/grade_this_for_me_thx/,"In several paragraphs, please explain why you would like to serve with the SCA. (32,000 character limit)

http://thesca.org/about

My motivation to serve with the Student Conservation Association stems from a personal passion growing over several years. This application is a step in my career that I have come to by recent years of work experience and exploring personal interests. I began applying to Peace Corps shortly before I earned my degree in business administration. After a year of satisfying work in real estate management I joined Peace Corps and served in Moldova for two years. After completing Peace Corps and returning home, I have interned at Plenitud Eco-Educational Initiatives where I practiced sustainable architecture, self-maintained agriculture, and ecological design techniques in Puerto Rico. Plenitud implements principles of perma-culture and I learned more about how real sustainability can be possible. In pursuance of sustainability, I think how our resources are managed and studied must be based on principles of environmental stewardship and conservation. Our natural resources are increasingly precious in this era of unprecedented population growth, technological advancement, and consumption. I am applying to graduate schools in related areas because I think it is imperative to intelligently and effectively conserve, study, and manage the environmental resources available. Gaining skills and training from the National Parks Service would strengthen my candidacy to these graduate programs.

Part of Peace Corps service my service was to live in average, local households, where we share work, life, and culture. Like many volunteers in Moldova, I lived in an agricultural, rural town where much of my host family's food came from what they grew. There I led a youth group for extra curricular English, cultural exchange and critical thinking, and computer literacy for adults and youth. I had the opportunity to learn about about the farming culture in Moldova that has been passed down for centuries, so I helped with planting, harvesting, and everything near and in-between over the course of two years. I planted corn, beans, and squash; As these ancient crops grow symbiotically, I perceived a similar harmony among the community where neighbors helped each other for the greater good. More than ever, I sensed the connection between humans and their natural resources. This inspired me to learn more about sustainability, environmental science and stewardship.

I was admitted to the University of Missouri School of Natural Resources and have explored potential research projects with my advisor. However, before enrolling in such a program, I feel it prudent to first gain more work experience in the field; this would add value to my application and research assistantships. I would find either working an internship or corps position fulfilling, as both types of assignments have openings where I can receive various types of training of which I can take great advantage. With parks services I will employ my new skill set and receive training that would allow me to further explore related fields. Having done some research and reading more than a few position openings, I know that I would fit well within the professional culture and work at National Parks. I am a diligent worker who is excited to contribute to public land conservation efforts.

Permaculture projects such as constructing earth-bag housing was a great experience for me seeing tangible examples of sustainability. Plenitud allowed me to learn about sustainability by doing type of work found through the conservation corps. I was responsible for tasks required of many position openings for example, I hosted visitors, trained other interns and volunteers, and maintained the facility of the farm in trail maintenance; vegetation control; and equipment maintenance. The goals of my projects at Plenitud also had similar purposes as those in the NPS e.g. sustainability, conservation, and education. Both local and national student volunteers visit Plenitud's farm in Puerto Rico for educational and internship opportunities. I had the pleasure of training more experienced interns in earth-bag construction, and student volunteers in agro-forestry. I am seeking this position not only because I will like it but because I value the exchange of knowledge and my experience allows me to do work, I hold important, well.

Like most, I aspire for fulfilling and enjoyable work. And, I am grateful to have the opportunity to serve a project to which I attach personal significance. The skills and training I will receive as part of this projects will allow me to continue working in a field that enables me to serve nature, with other professionals who are joined together for that common purpose."
1j2cph,8,2013-07-25,My life so far: a little NSFW at times.,jw88p,gay,https://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/1j2cph/my_life_so_far_a_little_nsfw_at_times/,"Drum roll commence: I am 15 years old. Entering my sophomore year of high school. I am openly gay. Ooopenly. Todo el mundo status. Facebook official. I've known I was gay since I started masturbating. We'll call that 11. Curtain opens: First day of 6th grade. I'm the smart awkward kid who wears a brown shirt literally every day. I'm not sure if it was a goth thing or not. Whatever. Anyways. Cute girl, actually I will note right here that every name except my own has been switched. She is called Francesca I suppose. Anyways the young pre-pubescent me really enjoyed looking at her. A lot. Her hand touched mine? God had just touched my hand.

Around this time puberty started to become noticeable, and by that I mean hair. Hair. Everywhere, I was like yeah I'm a mother fuckin man now right? Anyways it was this time that I discovered porn. Probably within a month of that I realised I looked at the guys a lot more than the girls. What can ya do. I quickly discovered 'gay porn'. If gay means happy, it certainly made me feel that way. Everyday I would spike up my hair. I guess it made me cute, or whatever because pretty soon I had the slutty girls going for me. (I fucking know, right? Slutty girls at 11-12, Jesus). Whilst ""dating"" these girls I continued delving into homosex.

There was a cute blonde boy in my grade. I guess we can call him Rick. I quickly became obsessed with him. With a 12 year olds hormones in mind, I suppose you likely know what I mean. I did whatever I could to be close to him. I really really hoped he was gay. That would've made my year. I sat at his table for lunch a bit, abandoning friends I had had since the 1st grade. I guess that was the beginning of the end of the friendship with them, but that is another story that I'll get to later. Soon summer came. With it I didn't see Rick for 10 weeks, but I replaced him with porn. My iPod quickly became filled with porn.
This summer I became better friends with an old friend. No, I didn't hit on Ike like that. We were friends only, we still are. I slept over his house often. We were always hanging out. His dad works in the English dept. at a uni in our town. We were often there, exploring the halls. One time, we were in the locker room, and this massive man like 400 lbs came out of the shower to get soap and we was like wadafuq wadafuq and we high tailed out of there. Anyways I'm just emphasizing that we were good friends. Summer ended quickly.

Enter 7th grade. I had 2 classes with Ike. Math 7A (advanced, or pre-Algebra) and English. Again this year I had no classes with Rick. I sat with him at lunch everyday. This year was the Washington DC trip. Coincidentally the midterm election, but thats irrelevant. I was going to do whatever I could to get to bunk with him. I got him and 2 others (4 to a room) to sign off on a slip saying they would for school. I turned it in. They didn't. The next day I went to school. The fucks had screwed me over. Fuck fuck fuck fucking fucks. They had changed to another. I mean they had promised him before me, but still. They said sorry.
I left their lunch table. I felt betrayed. I moved with my old friends. Ike and a hottie who we can call Henry who is literally a god, were the black holes for us, the galaxy to circle around. They welcomed me back, but said they had already formed a Washington group. I was literally fucked. I got stuck in a group with some dumbass who didn't shower or put on deodorant or brush his teeth the whole time we were down there. We can call him Peter. Fucking Peter. Washington.

We woke up at 5:00 to get on the bus bright and early. We were all packed in the school cafeteria with our luggage. One ass hole in my outer sphere of friends, shoved another asshole into the wooden stage. Crack. 5 stitches in the head. Poor fuck couldn't go. But the asshole who shoved him could. Like wtf mate. Yes, well anyways we were set to get there at 11:00 and go for a tour of the Pentagon because someone had an uncle who was high level brass. Anyways. Some idiot decided to shoot at the Pentagon and we had to go to the zoo. It rained. That was leg 1 of the worst field trip of my life.

Day 2. The afternoon. Right after viewing the national archives, we sat on the steps outside. A girl asked if she could play games on my iPod. I said sure, I'm a nice guy. Too nice. She decided to look through my search history for god knows why. ""Gay teen pprn, gay teen porn, gay porn, gay sex,gay videos.."". Whatever you can imagine. The news that I was a fag spread like wildfire. Curiously enough another boy had the same thing happen to him. Devin. Devin wasn't cute yet, I mean he is now but he hadn't grown into it yet. I told anyone who asked that it was my brothers iPod. Yeah right. I was devastated.

All I remember after that was going to the Jefferson memorial that night and spouting facts about him. The next day was brisk. We got on the bus and the girls who had somehow figured out I was gay in 6th grade all were asking me the same thing. Well are you? Fucking no! Eww Jesus. Sigh. On the bus home I sat next to a cute boy Evan, but I didn't care anymore. I was contemplating suicide ffs. Evan has a reputation as a hacker. So I used him as IT. ""How do you delete an app? Which one? Google. Like this:"" Boom. Gone. If I had done that 3 days ago I doubt I would be writing this right now.

That was almost 3 years ago. All of 7th grade. Are you gay? I heard you like gay porn. Faggot. Faggggg. Sigh again. I don't blame them. When I've asked them about most have apologized. MOST. My close friends didn't believe it, and I told them nothing to the contrary. It was around this time that I started crushing on Henry. Big time. And I had credible evidence in my head he was gay.

One day, out of the fucking blue he asked our table if we support the LGBT. I was like wtf. The boy next to me, Dean, said what's that, and Henry responded: lesbian gay bisexual transgender. Dean said no that's disgusting. Henry said if you hate gay people you are just a massive douche. In hindsight I bet that his sister had recently come out to him or something, but I don't know that for sure. I was stunned either way. Later I asked him if he was gay, and he responded agressively (verbal agression I mean) with no. Intrigued I was. That was the way I usually responded to that question. How very similar. I quickly fell for him. His clothes. His hair. The beautiful skin from his Anglo-Indian mix. Dear god. Anyway. I was out to a few girls at this point, and a really stereotypical gay in the grade above. I came out to my mother shortly after and we both cried. Meh.

Summmmmmmmmerrrrrr. I hung out a lot with Ike this summer. Henry was off at soccer camp. New York had recently legalised gay marraige, and one of the senators that was a crucial yea vote lived down the road. I decided to gauge Ike's view on this. He said something to the matter of it didn't matter to him or something. We watched the worst movie of 2011 that night. Battle Los Angeles I think. Whatever. End summer.

Inset day one of 8th grade. 6th period Earth Science. Mrs. Barne. The most LGBT friendly lady in the school. She had a safespace flag and all that jazz. She had a faggot definition sign.

1j6qui,23,2013-07-27,One Night in China,throwaway_chinese,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/1j6qui/one_night_in_china/,"Okay. This story is 100% true. No fake facts at all. Apologies if it's too long but what's the point of a good story without the build up

Last year I was in business school living in the dorms. A beautiful Chinese girl lived down the hall from me. Let's call her 'N'. N was very, very beautiful. 5 feet 6 inches in height, extremely fair complexion and had the most amazing hair. She had what I had assumed, wonderful breasts. Over the summer, she picked up an internship in the city and was out of school for 6 months but was still staying in the dorms. The only interaction we had was saying ""hi"" to each other in the hall. I knew that she was not uptight like the other Chinese girls from the stories I had heard about her. School started in the Fall and I went back to finish my last semester. One sunny afternoon I noticed that N had bought a new car and was in the parking lot trying to wipe off the 'for sale' sign that was on the car which had been made using glass chalk. I noticed that she was having a hard time removing the sign and decided to 'help' her. I walked over and asked if she needed help and she handed me the toilet roll and paint thinner she was using. We spent a good 20 mins trying to get rid of the sign and in the meanwhile I kept on asking her questions to strike up a conversation. After we were done she said that she wanted to thank me and would buy me a drink sometime. I then left. A few weeks later we were at the school pub. After the pub shut down, I invited a few people back to my dorm room for drinks. The people who showed up were my flat/dorm mate, N and a 37-year old guy who had been hitting on her all night. I didn't really care. I offered them beer and we started talking. At one point N told us about a Chinese drinking game in which they can drink an entire beer in less than 6 seconds. I challenged her to do it and to my amazement, she downed the entire beer in one sip. That was the hottest thing I had ever seen. We were then talking for a bit when the other guy told me that I was cock-blocking him. So I backed off and he went up to N and they left. He walked her back to her room (Don't know if they hooked up that night). During our conversation, N had brought up her love for Indian food and I had promised her to take her to a nice restaurant the next evening. I woke up the next day and after nursing a hangover, I texted her asking if she still wanted to go. She said yes. That evening I was waiting outside my room for her to come over when she walked out of her room. She looked exquisite in a short dress and some make-up which she didn't need at all (Yes, she was that pretty). We went to the restaurant and had a great evening. After we got back, I decided to play hard to get and hugged her and said that I am heading to the pub. She hugged me really hard and when she let go, I could see that she wanted to do me right there in the hallway. Her mouth was still open in amazement as I walked away as she could not believe that I was leaving her like this without doing anything. A few days went by. I started flirting with her a little on text. One day I asked her if she wanted to go for a movie and she said yes. I got ready that evening and was again waiting outside my room thinking over how I am going to make my move during the movie. I then thought to myself that I cannot wait this long to have her. So when she walked out of her room looking stunning, I asked her if she wanted to watch a movie in my room instead and she agreed.  We sat on my dorm bed besides each other and drank wine. Both of us had our legs under my duvet 'NOT' touching each other. I finished my glass quickly. To this day, I can't tell you which movie we watched coz I was least interested in it. She looked tired. Halfway through the movie I decided to play the Indian card and asked her if I could read her palm (I don't know shit about palmistry). She handed me her soft hand and I blabbered some crap. After I was done, I didn't let go. Instead I grabbed her hand very intimately. She didn't resist. I knew it was on. I then slowly started stroking my finger into her palm. Eventually, I put my leg over hers and started rubbing her bare leg with my foot. Her skin was so soft and warm. It turned me on immensely. This continued for the rest of the movie and as the movie got over, 

**Sex begins here...**

I looked over to see that she had dozed off on my shoulder. I was not going to end the night like this. I quietly removed the gum from my mouth that I was chewing and disposed it off in the empty wine glass. I then slightly nudged her to wake her up. She slowly opened her eyes to find me looking into them. I then slightly grazed her lips with mine. I felt her trying to kiss me as my lips brushed against hers. That was the green signal. I started kissing her intimately and could feel her kissing me too. She was not such a good kisser but I could hear her breathing getting faster. This drove me insane. We kissed for a few minutes (I like kissing) and I started sneaking my hand up her leg and eventually to her magnificent breasts. They were larger than I had imagined. I started squeezing her left boob with one had while my other hand was on her waist (we are still sitting next to each other). Her breathing got faster. I then picked her up and put her on her back with her head on the pillow. We kissed a little more while I was caressing her boobs. I then started puling down her dress her little to expose her beautiful breasts. Her breasts were not that large but were not small either. The areolas were a beautiful light brown. I started sucking her boobs which drove her crazy. I then pulled up her dress up her legs and she lifted her ass to allow me to remove it. I then removed my jeans and boxers to expose my penis. I kept on kissing her and slowly moved my hand down to her underwear. I could feel that she was getting wet. I slid my hand inside her panties to feel her lips. She was extremely wet. I inserted one finger inside her vagina. She moaned. I then started fingering her and could feel her going insane. I pleasured her for a bit while she was massaging my penis. I then pulled down her panties (bra had already been discarded) and went down on her. Now I am not very skilled in orally pleasuring women (at least that's what I thought) but I must have done a good job coz when I looked up, she was scratching the walls next to the bed while moaning loudly. This was it; I was standing at the edge of the cliff and this was enough to push me over. I got a rubber out of the drawer next to my bed (It's school, everyone has condoms in the drawer next to their bed), tore off the packaging hastily and slipped it on. I then inserted my extremely hard penis into her vagina slowly and she moaned again. I then started stroking slowly and could feel the inside of her vagina gripping my penis. It felt awesome. I never knew sex could be this good. I tend to last long during sex so we had the chance to try a few positions. After a few minutes, I grabbed both her legs, put them up on my shoulder and started pounding her hard while she yelled her lungs away. The room was filled with noises of my scrotum hitting her naked ass and her yelling. I then picked her up, and got on my back. She got on top of me while holding my penis with her hand. She then sat down on my penis inserting it completely inside of her. She then started grinding slowly with me inside of her. This felt like ecstasy. I could feel myself about to cum after a few strokes (Yes, I know I last long but it felt that good). I immediately asked her to stop and get on her knees. I then entered her from behind and fucked her doggy-style for a couple of minutes while she moaned in pleasure. I then picked her up and sat her down on my penis facing me, at the edge of the bed. She was hugging me tightly while I sucked her beautiful breasts. I then started fucking her in that position. Her arms were around my neck as she held on for dear life while I pounded her. This whole time our tongues were exploring each other's mouths like we were trying to find hidden treasure. Finally, I put her on her back, put her legs over my shoulder and entered her again. I pounded the life out of her this time. I could feel myself on the verge of cumming and decided to give it my all. I kept pounding until I exploded into the condom. I don't think I have ever come this hard. I then collapsed on to the bed next to her and we lay there for I don't know how long. We then got up and she said that she better go back to her room as she had to get up early the next day (Honestly, I was very happy about the arrangement). I helped her find her clothes and then put mine on and left for the pub. We had sex a few times after this which encounters were even more intense. I'll write about them if people are interested. 

She will always be one of my most memorable sexual partners as long as I live. Best sex I have had till date. "
1j6po5,2,2013-07-27,I need some advice on moving to HK with a mathematics degree,[deleted],HongKong,https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/1j6po5/i_need_some_advice_on_moving_to_hk_with_a/,"Hello, my girlfriend has moved back to china and is looking to work in HK or close to it. I am I'm looking to find a job in the finance sector of HK but I am unsure if I am qualified for the job. I have a Masters degree in mathematics from Leeds university in England but I have covered very little statistics and have no experience in the financial field at present. I also can only speak English. 

In England the banks will generally take maths graduates and train them from the ground up in how to use the software and thus having a maths degree is just seen as being numerically competent. I have noticed though that in Asia it seems that a far greater emphasis is put onto degrees that have more practical knowledge in the field, such as accounting and finance degrees, so I am unsure if I would see the same level of training that would be required for me to be able to competently function in the job. Could you guys give me some advice on this?   

I was also hoping you guys could shed some light on the living expenses and the likelihood of me being able to afford them on an internship if I was to do one of them.

1j69wx,7,2013-07-27,after finishing my master's degree: GER &gt; Singapore,crt32,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/1j69wx/after_finishing_my_masters_degree_ger_singapore/,"I will be finishing my master's degree in Mathematics (Computer Science as minor) in about one year.

For personal reasons I want to move to Singapore after graduating, living there for at least a few years with open end.
I really want this to happen, which is why I'm currently evaluating my options so I could take action if necessary.

My first choice would have been to pursue another degree in Computer Science; a master's degree or a PhD. However, I can't afford to pay for university nor the living costs, so I would be needing a full scholarship. While I will still try and apply for some scholarships, I don't have high hopes to get accepted.

Another option would be to start working. I want to work in IT as software developer or something similar. However, I don't have any work experience. I know that these kinds of jobs might not be paid very well in Singapore, but that's no priority for me.

How would I go about finding a job in Singapore? I'm guessing that no employer would be willing to help me relocate, given my non-experience.

I know of one company in my area which also has an office in Singapore, so I could do an internship there and hope that they are willing to get me into Singapore after graduating. I'm not sure if employers usually do something like this?

I would appreciate any ideas/tips/input on this :)"

I took it because it paid better than any summer job I could get and also housing. It's located in the Midwest where things aren't too expensive, so this summer I was paid $18 an hour and housing. Next year, I am being offered $20 and housing. Would others of you be happy with that or keep looking? 

I'm not that big into programming, but I love coming up with ideas and coordinating with other people to get things done. I am a CS major with around a 3.3 GPA from an unknown school. Are there any other companies that have internships that you don't necessarily have to program but still work in a ""systems""  department with decent pay? 

If I did come back the next year full time I would be getting a huge benefits package and $60,000 starting. Is that similar to what other people expect or below your expectations? 

Also, does anyone have any suggestions for an internship next year where it's not so much programming but a more analyst role?"
1j5t5q,7,2013-07-27,[FR] Late night party yesterday. 3 #closes. Failed hard my pre-selection.,Seddit_b1ood,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1j5t5q/fr_late_night_party_yesterday_3_closes_failed/,"Little background if you haven't checked my previous FR before anything : I'm in my early 20's, from Europe, not a native English speaker, I've been in the seduction community for over 2 years now. I've had SNL with very hot girls (For reference with your HB scale : from ""8s to a 10"", anything under 8 is approached for warmup sets and for female friends). I consider myself intermediate - advanced in pickup, and my speciality is night game at bars and clubs.


Let's do something different. I'm not gonna post another succesful FR today, rather something I see as a failure. I screwed up real bad this one, so I thought it'd be more valuable to talk about one of my failures. Alright let's jump in the FR :


  

**1. Context**

I'm in internship in a major european city since the beginning of July. 2 days ago I was out for drinks with my coworkers and other interns, one of them invited me to his friend's party. Only rules : There must be more female than male, so bring girls with you. Also, bring alcohol. The guy who invites me *(We'll call him Pete)* describes the host as a ""fuck maniac"", he'll fuck litteraly everything with a vagina... Huh alright..

I invite a very cute girl *(We'll call her Sarah, 8)* from the office that I #closed on my 2nd day there (She seemed pretty into me). She also wants to bring her best friend. More girls, why not?

 

**2. The venue + party**

Here's the program : We have a party at the guy's house then we go out in bars and clubs. Sounds good. I arrive at the place at 22.00 (10PM), ""my girls"" will join me later. There are about 20 people when I arrive, I know some faces there, mostly people from work. I introduce myself to everyone, get some good vibes going, there are people litteraly from everywhere in Europe and there's only 2 other people from my country. I talk with the host a bit, with about everyone, then a bit more with Pete. He shows and names me her ""targets"" for tonight. Sarah's in the names. *Hehe sweet,* I offer him to wing him, he accepts. We approach his #1 target who is with her best friend, but I realize quickly that she has a boyfriend (hints everywhere). My suspicions come true when the said boyfriend arrives and kiss her. 
 *It's ok buddy, plenty of fish in the sea.* 

 

We get some drinks, time flies, ""my girls"" and some more arrive. Venue is now about 40 people. I talk with Sarah's best friend :

&gt; Soooo, what's your name? 

&gt; I'm ""HB7"". Surely you must be Seddit_b1ood?

&gt; Huh yes I am, how do you know my name? 

&gt; Oh, Sarah talked about yo----

* Sarah walks in:

&gt; Wait a sec, what's going on here? 

*Ahah, nice. She was indeed into me.* 

I go sit with Sarah in the couch, while one of my coworkers takes care of her friend. We're on the couch and we're doing something who used to be common a couple years ago in PUA community : 

&gt; So, what do you think about this girl? Would you approach her?

&gt; What about this guy? Would you fuck him?

We have general opinions about some other people in the venue. *Wait, Pete's on fire! He approaches like crazy.* I offer a bet :

&gt; Hey, you know what? We're gonna do a bet. If Pete successfuly hooks up with a girl tonight, you buy me drinks. Good ones.

&gt; Deal. But only if it's with **THAT girl** *(she points at a fucking gorgeous 9. I remember when she arrived at the party, Pete told me she became one of her primary targets. We'll call her Amy)*

We keep talking, having **really really strong eye contact**. She's honestly one of the girls who held the longest eye contact without looking away. (Yeah, don't ever look away first, you pussy!) I kino her, she's receptive. I had already kino'd her a couple times at some medium spots (not the heavy stuff), and she was receptive so it was pretty easy kino. Good vibes but I'm not agressive yet, I'm waiting for the 2nd part, the bar part (where I excel).

 

 


**3. Pre Selection for the bars &amp; clubs**


I go talk with other girls a bit after that. A coworker points out to me how ""intimate"" (read : how we kino a lot) I am with Sarah. I don't really answer it, I know he's into her (he told me it earlier).


I meet 2 girls I like so I preemptively get their numbers. They seem cool, I'll have them as **possible targets in the bar**. One seems really into me. I also talk to a lot of other girls so I'm sure to **build basic rapport** before doing something more physical. And because I like to talk to new people, too.
 
 

 

**4. The part where everything goes wrong** 
 
         *Fuck, guys. This is a shitty part.*
 

Cops arrive at the party, saying there's been complaints about the noise. We need to leave the house and disperse in small groups. Alright, it's fine we wanted to go out anyway. we're heading downstairs (party was mainly upstairs), and a coworker fucking falls down the entirety of the stairs. He seems so wasted. We ask if he needs an ambulance, he says a taxi will be just fine. Everyone is worried, people goes to several places and we lose some people in the process.

We carry him to a popular place so the taxi will have easier time to pick him up. More people disappear. It's 4:30 at that moment. Everyone's going their way more and more, Sarah and her friends are leaving, Pete's gonna leave soon. Alright, nothing to see gents, time to pack up and go home. I call a taxi, Amy (HB9) joins us at the place! .... But she wants to leave too. Well I'm leaving as well. I ask her 

&gt; Where are you going?

&gt; At ******* street. 

&gt; Wait really? That's like 2 minutes away from where I'm sleeping. I just called a taxi, wanna join it? 

&gt; Sure!

I didn't connect with Amy. But she's gorgeous. C'mon man you have your perfect opportunity right there. The taxi arrives. I say:

&gt; You're coming with me on the backseat.

She complies.            
Oh fuck fuck fucking seatbelts we're like so far away from one another. No way I can kino with that shit. Fuck fuck. I'm getting to know her a bit between the ride. Taxi stops at one point because he needs to do some stuff I don't even know what. We get out of the car for 2 minutes when some drunk asshole comes and talks to us. WTF he's from my town. Pfffft. He's trying to AMOG me. I'm playing it cool, this guy is obviously drunk and is no threat whatsoever. We get in the (same) taxi again. I'm still trying to build some rapport but she seems unreceptive. Fuck. 

 

We arrive at a place nearby our (temporary) appartments *(Remember that none of us are originally from this town. For reference, I actually live 125km away from her*, we get out of the taxi, we split the bill and we walk a bit towards our respective places. When we arrive at the spot where we must split, we stop by and keep talking. We talk about partys, events and stuff and I tell her about this really cool 2-days event that she totally needs to check out in my town (It's in 2 months though). I tell her if she wants to check out the event, she can come sleep at my place during it, there's enough room for everyone. She seems interested. We exchange numbers and personnal infos. Am I back? No.
 

 

After we exchange numbers, I try to take her by the hand to lead her to a bench (to talk a bit and chill). She refuses, she has a train to take to visit her parents in her city very early in the morning (it's legit, we talked about it earlier in the night, I don't remember why). I know she'll refuse the kiss and the escalation at that point, she was too unreceptive. So I don't go for it, I'm like whatever, we hug, kiss on the cheek and part ways.

 

 



**TL;DR :** Waited too long to isolate and escalate, focused on the wrong girls, shitty pre-selection, dunno how I can still fail like that 2 years into it. Also, ask details/questions if you want. 


 


 

Well it's saturday today, so I'm going out, with new lessons learned. Probably no FRs tomorrow, unless everything doesn't go smooth."
1j5pss,12,2013-07-27,Focus on School or Unrelated Job,BloodyTesla,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1j5pss/focus_on_school_or_unrelated_job/,"I will be starting my junior year in Mechanical Engineering this year and have had no internship/co-op experience.

Friends close to me have been a bit critical of me not having a job.

My question is what would be more beneficial to me in this coming year, assuming I wont be getting an internship:

1) Focus on my school work, raise my GPA, and participate in engineering related extracurriculars and research.

2) Listen to friends and get a generic job (like fixing computers or stocking shelves) and gain unrelated experience.

Which one of these options would make it easier to get an internship my senior year?  School related experience or unrelated job experience? "
1j5ltl,3,2013-07-27,"A journal entry I wrote about my recent episode of major depression and past episodes, including its origins. Thinking about showing it to my bosses to explain myself.",KiteAndAnchor,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1j5ltl/a_journal_entry_i_wrote_about_my_recent_episode/,"[I took out information that could identify me. I'm considering giving an abridged letter to my bosses to explain my lack of work for the past month. Unprofessional and way too much info or good communication?]

When my paternal grandmother was young, her father passed away from a severe heart attack. In the aftermath of his death, her mother, my great grandmother, had an onset of psychotic depression. After hallucinating the ghost of her deceased husband, she was diagnosed with manic depressive disorder and institutionalized for life. Genetically, I wonder what the chances are that I inherited her disease.

I had my first major episode of depression my junior year of high school. I was suicidal for nearly the entire year of 2008, though I never acted on the suicidal ideation in terms of carrying a plan out. I did, however, have very extreme mood swings, full of spite and anger. I acted out in ways that hurt friends and by withdrawing socially—when I was social, it was an unreal game. The thing I regret the most was how cruel I was to my parents. My family was very dysfunctional, and sure enough I thought they were the cause of my depression. And indeed, genetically they may be. I forgive them now for not being perfect parents, as no one is. High school did not feel “real” to me, and being depressed in high school felt like a bad dream.

My second episode, maybe even a continuation of my first, occurred when I first started college, and it was a bit soul crushing—I had been looking forward to being in a healthy environment for years. I thought all my problems would be solved. The stress of college, roommates that gossiped about me, the stress of a new city, and a chemical imbalance triggered it. In November of 2009, I took a medical leave and came home because I was feeling suicidal. I was unable to complete any academic work with my then state of mind. Though, in the Spring of 2010, I came back full force after getting on Wellbutrin. I started attending the ___, switching to a major in Computer Science (quite different from my English predisposition at ___).  I maintained a 4.0 GPA for two years, and the summer after my sophomore year I had a research internship at ___. The next summer, I completed a research internship at ___. The next year, my high school dedicated 4 pages about me in ___ on how successful I had become.

Now, in July of 2013, I’m having my third episode of major depression.  The average number of episodes in a life span for someone with depression is 4: I have already had 3. Rather than be in denial about what I have, I’m getting help from a psychologist and a psychiatrist at my university. My diagnosis is major depression and ADD, but my prognosis is good. However, I have likely been mildly depressed for the past year or year and a half. The “W”s started accruing on my transcript, but in my mind, it was the class, not me. After all, I had become so successful. But 3-4 weeks ago I tried Depo Provera, a hormonal birth control shot, which I believed sent me over the “edge” to suicidal again. It literally hurts to get out of bed or exert myself, akin to how one would feel if a long-term relationship had just ended or physical weights were tied (too tightly at that) to you. The silver lining to my suffering is that I am going to get total help—I am going to totally recover, I am no longer going to stay “mildly depressed,” while believing myself to be functioning and giving my all in school and work at 100%. I am forming a plan to actually recover, and to stay healthy, so that I can be as successful as the “me” who is good enough for __, __, and __. A me who is good enough to complete my senior project. A me who is good enough to do Computer Science research that I love. A me who can complete projects form start to finish. A me who attends every class. A me who is healthy.

1j5hnj,2,2013-07-27,"just got interviewed for an internal IT support position, any indications i can use to gauge how the interview went?",[deleted],sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1j5hnj/just_got_interviewed_for_an_internal_it_support/,"I am a little bit between a rock and a hard place, and was wondering if any of you guys (preferably IT managers/hiring managers) might be able to help me out here.

At work, i have taken on the responsibility of part time IT support to help with an employee ramp up. Basically my job is to help get our work software running properly with new employees. My job is entirely work from home, so i never see anyone face to face. I am working directly under the manager that interviewed me. When i saw the internal posting for the IT gig, i applied ASAP. The job description is basically exactly what i am doing right now for part of my work week.

The interview, i think, went well. I had no intentions to discuss salary, or any intentions to discuss other people that applied to the job. The manager bought up salary and said ""im sure this will come up later down the road, but salary will be between x range, we are not sure if it will be salary based or hourly yet, but we will let you know as soon as we know something""

this was kind of red flag number one for me, but i don't want to read much into it. The next one, he nonchalantly stated that they ""have to interview everyone else that applied and give them a chance, but will get back to me in a couple weeks"" when he gets off his vacation.

To me, these seem to be fairly decent indicators that im in the green to be hired for this position, but ya never know i suppose. I also figure with me helping out a couple days out of the week with exactly what i would be doing full time is a huuuuuuge leg up. (somehow, i landed this part time role with a recommendation from another manager)

There is a problem, however. I also have an oppertunity at a supervisor internship with the same company. Although not final, my chances of getting into it are extremely good, and i will know sooner about it than the IT gig.

The IT support role is really where i want to be, so it kind of puts me in a hard place. IF i actually make it into the supervisor intern thing, how would i let them know im more interested in the IT support without actually burning my bridge? if i flat out tell them i respectfully decline their offer, then im taking a leap of faith on getting the it support title, and if that falls through...well..i just burned both my chances for now, so i am not  entirely sure how to handle this situation.

thats assuming i even get selected for the supervisor intern thing, though. if i don't, the situation wont be nearly as complicated.

So, general things i should look for in a phone interview to gauge how my interview went would be the most important thing to answer, again my gut says i got this, so i guess thats usually the strongest indicator."
1j5ag2,0,2013-07-27,How to grow online community surrounding a blog without sacrificing the your free non-work FT time you have?,FintageParadiso,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1j5ag2/how_to_grow_online_community_surrounding_a_blog/,"Hi Reddit, like many of you out there, I have a FT job and has lots of hobbies. One of them is blogging, and while my content is well-received, it seems very difficult to get new followers, comments, and the like. 

It is hard to post regularly for something I see more as a hobby, but on the other hand, I'm starting to lose serious amount of faith when I see really slow growth from month-to-month traffic (my blog gets approx. 1500 visitors per month) after a year.

I understand the requirement to be active in social media, however I feel that at this point, I need to hire an intern to fully engage in different social channels to increase exposure and readership. That's something I cannot afford, especially with the domain and site maintenance expenses already.

Do I have no other choice but to sacrifice all of my free time outside of work to increase exposure and get more followers, likes, Google circles adds, and what-not? 

Sometimes I look at a friend's blog and how she seems to effortlessly get 4K+ subscribers in just several months, and here I am having a Klout score bouncing in the mid-40s, never pushing past 48.

It's really frustrating and discouraging. Maybe I should redefine my blogging goals and make it simpler and manageable, and choose two channels to get focused on. And it's not all bad anyway...ever since my blog's Alexa ranking jumps to 5 million global rank range, I've been getting weekly solicitation email from SEO companies...that must mean I'm doing something right, right?

Either way, I am looking forward to what Reddit community thinks. Thank you in advance."
1j57kb,28,2013-07-27,"Facing unemployment after ""quitting""",andsometimesidostuff,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1j57kb/facing_unemployment_after_quitting/,"Long story short, my first job out of grad school turned out not to be the best match skill-wise, and after about 10 months, I was essentially put in a position where I'd have to resign/quit, or face rejection on a year-long probation period (it was a CA state government job). I chose to resign because I didn't want failure to pass probation to follow me around on my state employment record, in case I wanted to seek another government job in the future (I am still eligible to reinstate to another state job in CA).

I started applying to jobs before I left my previous position, and was able to get interviews at 2 different places. However, at the time I interviewed, I had only been out of work for a week or two. Now that it's been 5 weeks, I'm beginning to lose sleep over the fact that no one will want to hire me because I am unemployed. I've applied to about 25 jobs, half of which still have open application periods. For about the first 10-15, I was able to get those 2 interviews. But nothing else. The first place said I did well in the interview and on the test they gave me, but they most likely won't be making hiring decisions for a few months out. I'm still waiting to hear back from the second place.

I understand that my performance in my previous job wasn't stellar, but I've learned a lot and know I have it in me to do well in another career. I know that I interview well, but I also know that the fact that I'm currently unemployed will deter potential employers. 

Obviously, if I resigned, I accepted the fact that I'd be facing unemployment. I know better than to complain about my previous employer/job in an interview, and even if I state professionally that I'm looking for a career change or job with a different skill set, I know that the fact that I resigned raises a handful of red flags. 

I'm wondering if any of you have experience with such a situation, and how it panned out for you. I know that employers are wary of hiring the unemployed, and that it's easier to find a job when you already have one. I've been having trouble sleeping, and being out of work is the first thing I think about in the morning, and the last thing I think about at night. 

As for background, I'm a 26 y/o female with an MA in economics. I don't have much of a work history, since I spent 3 years in grad school, but I have a lot of internship experience.

1j55h2,2,2013-07-26,What types of skills should we be building?,dalidala,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1j55h2/what_types_of_skills_should_we_be_building/,"I apologize if this has been asked before, but I was wondering what types of marketable skills I could be learning during summer down-time (had classes earlier this summer, so no internships). As a civil engineering major with an interest in either an environmental tract (hydrology and water treatment) or bridge construction/design/maintenance, would a background in coding be useful in any way, or should I focus on becoming more proficient with CAD programs?

Added information, I have worked with Microstation V8i (unfortunately my school doesn't use AutoCAD) and Wolfram Alpha, and... that's it, so far. I know some very basic C++ from Codecademy. Both sets of skills, or even a well-argued third set of skills, could use the practice.

Basically, would I be better off practicing my CAD program skills, expanding my coding skill, or a third set, such as doing basic mechanics practice problems?"

I took every class available in that subject, I even interned for two summers at an organization  I wanted to work at. Those were happy times, I had a goal and was working hard for it. 
I finally graduated and was happy to be done but then life went to shit.

Then internship I banked on working at decided they weren't hiring, because I didn't have enough experience. I was also out of school money and was working full time as a server so it left little time to pursue career interests. Soo I quit the serving job and moved back home with my parents to try an focus on a career. Little did I know how terrible a choice that was.

My plan was to work somewhere small while like a ruby tuesdays or part time at an office, while I worked towards my career. Unfortunately my college degree and 6 years of retail and serving experience cant even get me a job at the local ruby tuesdays. 
This would be fine if it werent for the overbearing mother I have. My father does all he can to help me and provide a home. But with my mom I spend the whole day being guilted into doing her will and being told I am fat and  not competetive enough for any job.

So finally I decide to try and join the military, where I am told I will have to wait 5 months before i can even take a test to join.

So here I am on a friday night stuck at home, with no job, being told to beg for a job but then being told I cant live at this house if it doesnt pay enough, or seem good enough. All the while seeing my plans crash around me.  Its at points like these where i contemplate dissapearing completely but instead I just cry until another day comes and fill the same routine.

I Just wanted to vent and see if anyone else has had these troubles."

Just a few questions regarding working for the Government (as a CS major...either in security, cryptography, etc.)

Before I began researching this I was under the impression that the NSA/CIA/etc. only recruit the cream of the crop, and are working on the bleeding edge, etc.

This summer two of my friends got internships (one at the CIA, other at NSA), and neither are necessarily impressive as CS students go....I am fairly certain one of them couldn't code his way out of a paper bag.

Their pay is relatively low (I believe they are both paid as GS-5, but I cannot recall exactly), and neither of them were given any sort of technical screen or interview.

As you can see there must be some sort of disconnect here. How can an agency with such low recruiting standards (Compared to top tech companies at least) have such success and be working on the bleeding edge?

1j4vjh,4,2013-07-26,[Oregon] 3-month lease expiring,TenancyOR,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1j4vjh/oregon_3month_lease_expiring/,"Hi all,

I'm currently living on a 3-month summer lease out here in Oregon for an internship. May 10th to Aug 9th. Anyway, I was just called (today, 7/26) and told to renew, give notice to vacate, or wait for it to roll over month-to-month automatically. I today then signed the notice to vacate, with about 2 weeks notice instead of 30 days. They said I'll have to pay 1/2 month pro-rated rent for this, and I thought since my lease had a fixed end date, that I didn't need to give notice? My lease states they need a 30day notice but do not say anything about a fee or penalty for not giving one.

I was looking into ORS 90.545 and came across this: http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.545

Is this applicable to me? Do I really have to pay half a month's rent that I'm not going to be here, especially when my lease had a fixed end date?"

I've heard numerous times that there is a vast difference between a programmer and a GOOD programmer.

Since I had to take out a loan to dorm, I want to make sure that I can get most out of my college and education. I know that I will have to have side-projects as well as internships. Do any of you have any tips or experience to share with me? I'm very nervous about these because I barely know any programming at all.

I'm also kind of worried about the debt, but many are saying that I shouldn't worry about it because I am pursuing a STEM degree in a good field. I'm going to a state school, so the debt isn't that bad.

Anyway, how can I ensure that I become a good programmer and get the most out of my education? (Besides studying, I know this is a must and I will apply myself. I plan on using all resources available for this if needed.)

1j8no2,8,2013-07-28,My [21M] boyfriend of almost two years just broke up with me [20F]. Feeling like I've lost everything.,Never_Lucky_In_Love,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1j8no2/my_21m_boyfriend_of_almost_two_years_just_broke/,"I stated going out with my boyfriend two years ago, on my first day of college. At first things were great. Really there were always great moments throughout our relationship. We were both crazy about each other. We had all these funny little in jokes and nicknames for each other. I fell in love with him really quickly, and he ended up becoming my best friend as well as my boyfriend. I did, and still do, love him more than anyone else in my life.

That's not to say the relationship was a good, or even a healthy one. We fought all of the time. There were faults on both sides. I was insecure, and jealousy flared up very easily, so I was always wondering where he was and who he was with. I would text him on his nights out and ring if he didn't reply for a long time. I also had a tendency to just assume at first that he couldn't hear his phone, so I would hit redial, except this ended up with anything up to twenty missed calls on his phone, which used to make him absolutely furious. He wasn't exactly a saint either though. He was always a bit selfish. He brushed a lot of my insecurities to the side, which generally made them even worse. He tended to put other people ahead of me, but would refuse to acknowledge that he was doing so. He cancelled plans sometimes and never understood why I got so angry when he wasn't spending much time with me, but he had all the time in the world for someone he's just met weeks before. 

Like I said, we fought a lot, but usually we would get over the arguments. One of us would apologize and by the end of the night we'd be fine again. However, this summer he spent six weeks in another country doing an internship, and I felt like he was slipping away from me the entire time. He barely wanted to talk and always sounded a bit distant, which made my insecurities flare up, which made us fight. The difference was this time he would be angrier than normal, telling me he was at the end of his tether, and he would be angry with me for longer. He came home a few weeks ago, and was supposed to come visit me (we live about an hour and a half bus ride away from each other during the summer, but I couldn't travel because of work) but he came down with a chest infection and couldn't. I was upset and disappointed, and didn't talk to him for a few days. I know it wasn't his fault, bit I was just so disappointed I didn't know what to say to him. That was the Tuesday he was supposed to visit me, and on Friday he went on a night out with his friends. I wasn't feeling well that night, and of course sent him texts, and when he didn't reply after about an hour and a half I got a bit annoyed and rang. He doesn't pick up for ages, and when he does he gets extremely mad, tells me he's at the end of his tether, and breaks up with me.

Saturday he rings me again, I get my hopes up, but its just to tell me he's sure he wants to break up. He says it will be better for me because he wants to make me more independent. So we go our separate ways. 

He seems to be pretty okay with the breakup. He's acting normally on Facebook and when I talked to him on the phone he was fairly set on his decision, and basically said he was never going back on it. He also thinks we shouldn't have any communication for a while. More than that though, he didn't sound like the guy I fell in love with. He said it wasn't because he didn't love me anymore, but when he spoke to me it wasn't with the kind of feeling he'd had for the last two years. It feels like he's moving on almost immediately.

The problem for me is I don't know how to even begin to move on. He really was the center of my life. He was also my best friend. I told him absolutely everything, he was the first person I went to when I was upset about something and he knew me better than anyone else, so it's like I've lost a best friend as well as a boyfriend. Because we started dating in my first week of college, I just ended up becoming friends with his group of friends instead of making my own, and I know most of them won't want much to do with me now that we're not together. It won't matter for the semester coming as I am going on Erasmus/Study abroad and won't be in college with him or any of his friends, but I'm worried about what will happen, and who I'll have when I get home in January. 

On top of it all, it's his birthday and our two year anniversary in the next month, and I have already spent about €150 on gifts for him (I don't earn a lot where I work, so €150 is a lot of money for me). Most of what I've bought isn't returnable as it was all personalized stuff, and the rest I threw out receipts for. I asked if he still wanted any of it, and he said no. Problem is, I don't know what to do with them. It would feel weird using any of them, and I can't bring myself to throw them out or give what I can to anyone else. Should I send them to him anyway?

Most of all though, I just loved him. He was everything to me and I don't know how I can start to move on. I'm tired of crying and sick of thinking things like 'I'll never get to kiss him again' and 'he'll never just be sitting on this couch with me eating a Chinese and watching t.v. again'. Its like there's a huge hole in my life. The worst part is I know that the break up was my fault. I pushed him too far and if I had just given him his space and not nagged him that night we would still be together. I don't know how I can forgive myself for this. 

I want to be able to move on, and I don't want this breakup to ruin my Erasmus, or my college experience, but so far all I can think about is the trip we won't be taking in October to Paris for my 21st birthday, and the house I won't be moving into with him, and the Halloween and Christmas and New Years I won't be spending with him for the first time in two years. What can I do, Reddit, to make this breakup easier?

(Also, congrats if you managed to get to the end of this post, it's probably longer than half the essays I write for college)

---

**tl;dr**: Boyfriend of two years broke up with me and the breakup was my fault. I've lost a best friend and someone I love in one go, and don't know how to recover. Also unsure of what to do with the birthday and anniversary gifts I've already bought him."

If anyone can find his original reddit posts that would be appreciated. I did a fairly detailed outline of the beginning just to give it a feel. Hope you like!

Phase One
The Batman
The movie would start out with Captain Gordon and Batman visit a warehouse by the docks. Gordon would comment that this is the largest cache of bodies they’ve found and shine a light on a body; the audience would not see it yet. Batman would comment that it appears he’s perfected his process to which Gordon would ask, what do you think that means? Batman would reply, he’s ready. Cue dramatic music and camera pans onto a body clearly exposed to venom. The next scene would be a dream that Bruce has of his parents dying, showing his origins briefly in flashbacks. He would wake up and Alfred would make some kind of snarky comment. Cut to Bruce eating breakfast and Alfred hands him a news paper. Alfred comments, there is another article on that Cobblepot fellow. Retched family, if he’s anything like his father was he is the worst kind of villain. Bruce replies, not the worst kind.

Cut to Gotham PD Gordon is filling out paperwork on all the bodies and trying to ID the victims. Renee Montoya says his wife called and asks him why he hasn’t been home. Gordon looks up and says too much work to do. Renee reminds him there are more things in life than work. Gordon shows a little smile and tells her to tell his wife he’ll be home soon. Renee smiles back and says, she told me to remind you that Barbara is coming to visit. 

Cut to later than night at the grand opening of the Iceberg Lounge Bruce Wayne shows up with a beautiful girl in toe. As he enters a news reporter asks for an interview and he says he will another time and asks for her card. She gives it to him and it reads Vikki Vale. Inside Bruce scouts the place on his date and notices numerous mobsters are dinning there as well. Carmine Falcone comes over and introduces himself and comments that he still owes Bruce for a favor his father did for him years back. At this point the lights go out and the Joker reveals himself. There is some show put on by him and he makes a joke at Carmine’s expense. When Carmine doesn’t laugh the Joker looks at him very menacingly and tells him the last guy who didn’t laugh at his first never stopped laughing at his second. The Joker then proclaims that on New Year’s Eve at midnight Gotham will never be sad again. Batman comes in and there is a fight with a few of Jokers henchmen but Joker gets away. 

The rest of the movie is the Batman hunting down the Joker and uncovering the Penguins mob connections. The Penguin ends up being the police codename assigned to Cobblepot and that’s how the media picks it up after his arrest. You learn that the Penguin and the Joker were in on something though Cobblepot is angry he threatened Falcone. Dent would also appear in the movie more towards the end. The climax would be similar to the story were Joker tries to fly the plane into the clock as midnight. The movie would end with Cobblepot paying off a jury to give him a short stay in Blackgate for some small tax charges and the Joker in Arkham. 

The final scene of the movie would be interns at Arkham walking through the sever unit with names like Crane, Day, Walker, and Tetch on the doors. The Joker would have a small window with bars on his door and be asking if anyone wanted an autograph with a pen in his hand. As the group walked past he would drop the pen and one intern would go back to give it to him. The Joker read her name tag and say thank you Miss… Quinzel. Cue credits. 

The after the credits scene would be Bruce in the Batcave training. Alfred would come down and inform him that he sent flowers for Captain Gordon’s sister who died and remark how Barbara will apparently be living with them from now on. He would also remark that a reporter from Metropolis called for an interview by the name of Clark Kent. Bruce would smirk.

I am a college student with good grades about the graduate with degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics. I won't owe anything for college after I graduate because of scholarships. Also, I have always wanted to continue on to graduate school and eventually get my PhD in Computer Science, with hopes of doing research and being a professor. 

I took an awesome internship this summer because it seemed like a good experience. I was surprised to learn upon starting that the goal for most interns was a job offer. Anyways, the internship is about to end and they offered me a job. This job is outstanding as far as pay and benefits for a recent college grad.

Now I am completely lost because I really want to go to grad school but this job seems like a wonderful offer and a chance to experience the industry first hand. However, I am not convinced that it will be fulfilling. My potential bosses suggest trying it for a year or two and then going to grad school if I still want to. 

What advice can I get? Is it a good idea to work in industry before grad school? Is there anything you would suggest considering before making this decision? Are my bosses trying to trick me into the job for some reason? Is it a red flag that this job would waiver my choice at all? 

TL;DR: Internship lead to great unexpected job offer but future grad school student doesn't know if it is a trap.

****
So after 2 years of college, I decided that Computer Science was all programming and that got tedious quick, and I was told Computer Engineering was more hardware-oriented. I also decided that of all the computer technologies I see come and go, nothing excites me more than reading about a new CPU or GPU technology, the more technical the better.

So I switched to Computer Engineering and have been loving it. I've gotten pretty ""okay"" with circuit theory and had a blast with discrete logic and microprocessors with Assembly. I'm finally getting into the low-level courses like embedded systems and VLSI.
====
*Where I am now*
****
I'm two semesters from finishing my BS, and then two years from finishing my MS with a minor in Business Administration. For expediency, I'm going to keep living like a monk while working as a TA (tuition waiver, apparently) and hopefully a paid internship at the campus IT department.
Presently, I'm looking around and trying to find job openings of the sort I'm hoping to get in 3 years.
====
*What I need advice on*
****
What sort of job titles should I be looking for? Ideally, I'd like to work somewhere in the design and development process for CPUs or GPUs. I've scanned through listings at Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and ARM, but just about every position I find seems completely unrelated to processors. Mostly positions related to marketing, software/firmware programming, and, with curious consistency, Android programming.

Also, what other steps should I be taking? I've looked for internships vaguely related to the field, but there aren't any in my state.

I figured I'd hang around and catch up with old friends and family for a few months then probably move back West

However, about 3 months go by and I meet a guy at a party my cousin had. We hit it off immediately and it was obvious there was a mutual attraction. Long story short we made it official after about a month of hanging out and it was great. He was so different than my last boyfriend who dealt with depression, we had so much fun together whether it was the month long road trip we took or just lounging around and watching a tv show or movie together. I've never cared about anyone as much as I cared about him. The last relationship I was in lasted almost 4 years and I had never felt this strongly about him (that's a whole other story). 

Point being this relationship was great, he made me feel more confident and I was crazy about him. We had talked about moving to California together because he was finally finishing up school and I was ready to get out of the small town we were living in. He was nervous about moving out West as he had never lived anywhere except for the state we grew up in but I was confident he would find something amazing. He mentioned to a teacher that he wanted to head out West and she told him to apply for this internship in San Diego. It would be for 4.5 months and although it was unpaid you were provided housing (which no one could stay over at, even if they were visiting). Now I had a bad feeling about this internship from the start but I didn't want to be paranoid and so I was as supportive as I could be. Granted I did mention some of my insecurities about him being an awesome, hot 26 year old dude and living with a bunch of young impressionable 20 year old girls in the internship house but he said I was being silly.

Cut to now, he found out he got the internship about a month ago and started acting a little distant. I had asked him if it was something he felt he needed to do by himself and he had said no both of the times I asked. I was going to move out to San Diego a month or two after him and get some temporary housing and a temp job until he finished and we could figure out where we should go together. So about 2 weeks ago we went out for a ""celebration"" drink since he had finished working at his job here and he randomly tells me he doesn't want me to go to San Diego with him and he needs to do it on his own. I react pretty strongly because immediately my mind goes to the worst spot of him not loving me and it came out of nowhere. It was like someone had knocked all the wind out of me.

We were at a bar so I said I would go back to the house and wait for him, he finally shows up 40 minutes later and I had taken some of my stuff out to my car. I was basically inconsolable, I didn't see this coming at all so the talk we were going to have turned into a huge fight. Before this we didn't really fight at all, we always were very honest and talked about everything, or so I thought. He ended up breaking up with me and it was loud and terrible and I basically cried for 2 days straight which is something I've never experienced before. I wanted to hate him but I couldn't. He had said he knew he would never care about me as much as I cared about him so that's why he ended things. 

I was doing my best to not contact him but after about a week I knew he was going to be leaving soon and decided I needed to talk to him, to try to understand what had happened in a calmer environment. We agreed to meet up and we talked and he didn't really give me any clear answers but I felt a little better seeing that he was upset and not totally fine with being apart from me. I felt an overwhelming anxiety after seeing him and it sucked because it felt so good to be around him even though it was a painful thing we were dealing with. I called him again a couple days later and we agreed that we were both miserable and maybe we should talk as neither of us had been totally honest about how we felt. 

The next 2 days were torture for me, anxiety wracked my body and I couldn't concentrate on anything knowing that maybe he had just reacted strongly and we could try to make it work while he was away. But no, we talked again and he was set on being single for this experience. That he couldn't handle the pressure of our relationship and my worries about him not cheating on me out there, etc. I was devastated all over again but at least the anxiety of not knowing how he felt has subsided. I took the rest of my things and put them in my car. I was going to leave but I couldn't without saying something so I went back in and silently sat next to him while he smoked his cigarette out in the backyard. When he was done I looked at him and asked if we could be friends for 30 minutes and go get one more drink. He hugged me and agreed. 

We had a couple drinks and it was kind of awkward and we walked back to my car to find out someone had broken into it and stolen a lot of the stuff I had just taken from his house plus a couple other items I had so there we sat for an hour and a half waiting for the police. We got into that old comfortable friendship groove and after returning to his place we decided to get a pizza and watch a movie. To hang out as friends for one more night. Of course things got heated, and we ended up sleeping together a few more times and I stayed the night. I knew it might not be the best idea but I wanted it to happen so badly I did it anyway. Leaving the next morning, this morning actually, was so sad. The thing of it is I have to see him again tomorrow at a concert we had all been planning on going to as our last hurrah since he is leaving tomorrow.

I just don't know what to do. I'm all alone, stuck in this stupid little town at my lame job that I was basically using to pay the bills until we could go on our next life adventure together. Everything around here will remind me of him and he gets to go off to San Diego to experience a new life surrounded by little 20 year old girls who can give him the attention and praise he apparently needs. It hurts so bad that I wasn't special enough to him for us to try the long distance thing, that our relationship didn't mean enough for him to be able to say he could stay faithful to me for 5 months apart, that everything I thought mattered didn't matter to him.

I've never felt this terrible in my entire life. Hanging out with him last night was so wonderful but it made my sadness levels double. I just don't know what to do, I try to think positive but sometimes it's basically impossible and that's how I feel right now. I can't stop crying, I already miss him so much and I know everyone says it will get better with time but it's hard to believe at this point…I managed to go through life until this point without a true heartbreak and it's the worst feeling ever. 

TLDR: My boyfriend of 1.5 years stomped on my heart and carried out ""our"" dream of moving to California without me. I am very, very sad."

Fairly certain I'm going to major in CS, and i've got a 4.0 unweighted GPA and a 36 composite on the ACT, and i'm concerned with what schools i should be applying to.

I'd like to apply to schools like Stanford, Harvey Mudd (kind of my top choice if I could get accepted), and maybe UChicago. I'm also looking at schools not exactly on that level, such as Indiana University Bloomington, Purdue University, Centre College (liberal arts school in Kentucky, i live in louisville), University of Miami in Ohio.

Assuming I'm lucky enough to get into a top tier school and financial aid works out, would I be much worse off if I chose to go to school a little bit closer to home like the second group of schools in terms of applying for internships, etc?

Thanks in advance."

1j79yw,0,2013-07-28,Democracy is Dead,gnarpnk,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1j79yw/democracy_is_dead/,"I'm only going to be using Presidents starting with the end of the first Bush and ending with Obama. Mostly because those are the presidents I grew up hearing about.

And before anybody say's it, yes, these are my opinions. But all of them are based off of facts.

George H. W. Bush presidency mostly consisted of him starting a war in the Middle East. This war was called Operation Desert Storm. Now the media had us thinking that the reason behind the whole thing was because Saddam was trying to be that generations Hitler by invading and occupying neighboring countries. And America, being the World Police it's shown itself to be, quickly sent in troops and pretty much camped on the border like Gandalf saying “You shall not pass!”

The truth of the matter is the only reason that war was ever started was because Saddam wanted to take control of the oil fields in the Middle East. So the Bush family, who made all of their billions by owning oil companies, couldn’t have that happening. So H.W. sent in the vastly superior American army to push every Iraqi soldier out of the country. All while using ammunition tipped with D.U. (Depleted Uranium) which has had serious repercussions on the civilians and soldiers in the cross fire or injured by this radioactively tipped ammo.

But I digress. Bush left his administration leaving the country in debt from yet another useless war that we didn’t need to be a part of in the first place.

Then in comes Clinton, and during his 8 year term. We saw no wars, except a war against the biased nature the military and politics had towards the LGBT community. And we also saw a surplus in the economy for the first time in over 20 years. Employment was up. The standard of living was up. Everything was looking up for Americans.

Now we can’t have that can we? At least that’s what (and I may lose a LOT of you here) the Illuminati, henceforth referred to as the 1%, were saying.

So what do they do? Pay off an intern to either seduce or lie about having sexual relations with the president, and then go VERY public with the information. He left office still a popular guy, but the public needed to have that bad taste in their mouth of the first Democrat president to be elected since FDR.

Next comes the debacle that is the election of 2001. The opponents? Al Gore the ex-VP and Dubyah the legacy.

Now the 1% can’t have the environmentally conscious VP take the presidency, that would see an end to the oil age and cause all of the 1% to lose trillions in money. They would probably have to get jobs! God forbid!

So when it came down to the only state IN THE COUNTRY that was being run by another family member of the Bush family, and it was looking like Gore was easily going to take the presidency. Suddenly there’s a flub in the counting of ballots and there’s got to be a recount, and another recount, and another recount. Until the ballots ended up looking like how the 1% wanted them to look like. With Bush winning. Big win for standard oil.

But when it looked like the country was going to turn on the president because, let’s face it George W. Bush may have been the closest thing to a mentally retarded president we’ve had.

I will admit he had ONE redeeming factor, and that was his trying to pass a Zombie preparedness type law. Other than that, he was completely worthless.

But when the public was turning and his approval rating was dropping like a house of cards in a wind storm. Suddenly we get “attacked” by a group of “terrorists” and suddenly Bush is our messiah delivered unto us by God almighty, to save us from the threat of the “terrorists”.

A majority of the hijackers weren’t anywhere near the United States at the time, and if they had been, I know for a fact 1 of the supposed pilots had never learned how to fly a plane. He admitted to this very fact several months AFTER he supposedly died running into the WTC.

So now Bush is popular and we have another unnecessary war on our hands. And guess what!!?? It’s right back where we were 8+ years prior. Remember how we were attacked by Afghanistan, at least that’s what the media kept saying every day until we sent troops over there. But not to Afghanistan, no first we have to invade Iraq, just like Saddam did to Kuwait. Only this time were looking for the mysterious WMD’s that everybody heard they had and were going to use on us in support of the Afghani attack. But did we ever really see any of those? I’m gonna answer that with a big NOOOOOOO.

Now after 8 years, we need a new president. But the country didn’t want another rich white republican in office, because who needs all the heartbreak that comes with those guys, amirite? So we elect the first (light skinned) black president. Who just happened to use the word “Change” a lot in his election campaign and administration. We were still at war, of course, but people didn’t want to end it, they only wanted to bring out troops back. The vast majority of Americans would have been perfectly happy if we brought all humans back and then just started bombing the country from the sky with planes and drones. Easier and less (American) casualties. 

That brings us to this past election. Which was between Obama and Romney.

Now here’s where it gets interesting. Obama was what we were used to, so everybody felt safe with him. Romney was literally, and I mean literally, the cookie cutter version of a money grubbing, greedy 1% Republican. And he wasn’t really shy about saying how he felt about the poor of the country.

What happens in the election? Romney loses and we get Obama back. Yay! Take that you dirty Republicans. Score 1 for justice and Democracy. Right?

Wrong. Since then we’ve seen what exactly? No change for the better. No end to the war. No returning of troops. (I will admit, I could be wrong and we could be over with this war. Seeing as how I never watch or stay abreast on the news because the media is just another propagator of fear, and I’m not going to be scared of things that I shouldn’t be afraid of just because some talking head repeats what they’re told to tell us.

But I’m pretty damn sure if the supposed “War on Terror” was over I would have heard about it.)

But literally nothing has happened that would make me proud to be an American.

Now before you start in with the Nationalistic BS. I say this “I love my country too much to be a Nationalist”

Now if you step back and actually look at all the fact you realize that no matter what, every 4 years. The country holds a superficial election with 2 candidates who are cookie cutter copies of each other, the only true difference between them is their views on certain topics. But in truth, no matter who’s elected, they’re still going to do what the 1% tells them to do, because wouldn’t you want to stay president too?

And that is why Democracy is Dead, at least in my opinion.

You may respond to this negatively or positively. It doesn’t really matter. I find these truths to be self-evident because I’m a Patriot in the oldest sense of the word. And you should too.

TL;DR – Democracy is Dead, and has been for a while. And if you think you’re choosing your president. You really aren’t and haven’t been for years.

1j789t,3,2013-07-28,Anna broke out of the mirror.,thesistergeek,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j789t/anna_broke_out_of_the_mirror/,"According to my post history, it's been about 9 months since I originally posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1296gs/i_was_always_scared_of_mirrors_then_something/).  It feels like so much longer.  The nightmares just stretch everything out I guess.  If you have no idea who Anna is, or what's going on, [start at the beginning](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1296gs/i_was_always_scared_of_mirrors_then_something/).  The tl;dr version is that Anna has haunted me for years, and I see her in mirrors.

Several months ago, [I saw Anna again](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/18qnpq/i_should_never_have_posted_here/) for the first time in years.  It was quiet for a while after that, but I was paranoid nonetheless.  My small panic attacks when using the mirror to put on makeup returned.  I always felt like someone was watching me.  I was never sure if it was all in my head or not.

It all sort of fell by the wayside when my big move came up.  I got an internship, and I'm living in New England for the summer.  My fiance and I moved in together, and I forgot about Anna for a little while.

I'm interning at a museum.  The building is 170 years old, a big grey stone and brick holdover from a past era of commercial sea trade.  I have never felt anything but safe there, even during some of the worst storms of the summer.  It's right on the ocean, and when the wind blows in just right the whole place smells like the sea.  It's three stories, a basement, main floor, and top floor.  The gift shop, where I work, is on the main floor just inside the front doors.  I'm always there in the daylight, the place is only open 10AM - 4PM.

Earlier this week, my co-worker was sick, and I had to cover the gift shop for an evening event.  It was some big Coast Guard dinner, and all of those New Englander retirees loved my played up Southern accent.  I even got to have a glass of wine while on duty.  Overall, it was a pretty awesome evening.  I was relaxed and having a good time for the first time in a very long while.

Part of gift shop duty is turning the museum on and off.  That means turning on lights, opening doors, putting out signs, turning on fans, and opening shades, then reversing it all in the evening.  Because of the way the building was designed back in the day, as much natural light as possible filters in.  During the day, even in a decent rainstorm, turning on the lights makes almost no difference.  It's always bright inside.  I had never closed at night before, and my boss had left to take the rest of the food to the local homeless shelter, promising to be back in half an hour.

I started on the main floor, closing down the gift shop and counting out the money.  I hummed along with the sea shanties that were playing over the loudspeaker still hooked up upstairs.  I deposited the cash in the safe, and started with the front rooms.  That was when I first noticed the other voice humming along with me.  I turned around to see Anna staring back at me from a late 18th century silver mirror.  

Her face was cracked.  It looked like clay after it had been baking in the hot sun, but the cracks were oozing dark blood.  She smiled at me the lopsided smile she often gave when the chase was about to be on.  The blood dripped into her mouth and gave her teeth a pink sheen.

I'm still not sure why I didn't scream.  I guess I just didn't think it would do any good.  While the museum is made of shiny surfaces (glass cases, old pictures, etc), that was the only real mirror in the place.  I thought I could get away if I was smart and careful.  Or just lucky.

With my eyes mostly closed, I went through the final rooms, all six of them.  I hurt my ribs tripping over a raised brick, and scratched my palms catching myself.  But I kept running, and finished my job.  She was still humming along to the music, like she was right behind me, like she could reach out and touch me.  I was so close to escaping.

There is one window in the museum that is different from the rest, one that was meant to be different because it was for the main office in the building.  It's harder to get to than the rest, and the lock likes to stick.  Whoever closes has to move a table, get a chair to stand on, hop up on the marble windowsill, and stand on their tip toes to get to the shade.  This often leaves a nose print from the person doing it on the window, which we joke with guests is proof the place is haunted because it's so high up.

I had my nose pressed against the window when I opened my eyes.  It was a stupid mistake.  Anna was staring back at me.  I stumbled at bit, knowing if I fell it would be straight into a brick floor from 4 feet up.  I made a split second decision to fuck the window shade, I was getting out of here.  I took a small step back on to the chair I had used to get up, when I felt warm breath on my face.

What happened next is hard to explain, god knows I can barely comprehend what I saw.  But her face, her three dimensional, very much alive face, had emerged from the glass.  She was looking down at me with the most triumphant smile I've ever seen.  From day one, Anna has always been avoidable in my life because she's been trapped in mirrors.  I was actually seeing my childhood nightmare escape.

I scrambled backwards, half falling, half landing on my legs.  She was pushing herself out of the reflection, all the while making eye contact with me, the smile never leaving her face.  I really thought before this that I knew what fear was.  But my body was too scared to choose fight or flight.  So I was frozen, watching her hands emerge and pull herself out of the window glass using the walls.

Her feet landed on the marble windowsill, and she stood upright.  Her long red hair partially matted with the blood still oozing from her face.  I saw the rest of her body was also cracked and bleeding.

In two awkward steps, like a fawn learning to walk for the first time, she stepped down to the floor.  And then, Anna winked at me.

I don't remember standing up.  The next thing I remember is landing at the bottom of the steps, already at a full run.  All I had to do was close the back door, and I was out.  She would be locked in with the security system, the 4"" thick wooden front doors, and the iron back doors that held in millions of dollars of cargo a hundred years ago.  She would be trapped, and I would be safe.

My manager was at the back door, waiting on me.  He asked me what the hell was wrong, and I told him I had a family emergency and could he please finish locking the door.  I made it to my car, fully expecting her to be there, in the mirror.

That was Wednesday.  I went back for the first time today, and everything seemed normal.  The gallery and table were reset the next morning, and I told my manager it was a false alarm.  I haven't seen Anna since.  I'm not sleeping, and my fiance is starting to wonder why.  And I guess I just have to tell someone.  

I can't protect myself anymore.  I can't avoid her.  I don't know what she wants.  But to make all of this stop, I honestly might be willing to give it to her."

I'm a horny 18 year-old guy with a thing for older women. I have two types of scenarios in mind: **seductive** and **degrading.**

----------------------------------

**Seductive** 

In these scenarios, I'm an innocent, sexually inexperienced teenager. You want my fresh young cock so you seduce me and teach me how to make love to a woman.

Some starting points for these rps might be:

1. You're my mom and you walk in on me masturbating
2. You're my teacher and you call me in for a ""special tutoring session""
3. Your son and I are best friends, and while sleeping over at your house I run into you wearing nothing but lingerie
4. We're neighbors and I do yard work for your husband. One day, I walk into your backyard only to find you by the pool topless
5. I'm dating your daughter and I come to your house to see her but she's not there. You use this as an opportunity to show me what a difference experience makes
6. I'm an intern at your office. One day you ""accidentally"" email me a naked photo of yourself

**Degrading**

In these scenarios, you're the hot milf I've masturbated to a million times. In all of these, I discover a secret you've been hiding and use it as an opportunity to blackmail you into becoming my personal slut. These rp's are perfect if you like being tied up and having the shit fucked out of you.

Putting a twist on the seductive roles, some starting points could be:

1. I find out you're stealing money from my dad
2. I discover you were watching porn while our class was taking a test
3. I have information that could get your son kicked out of school, and I'm going to tell the principal unless you obey my every whim
4. While mowing your lawn, I see you cheating on your husband and take photos of you and your lover
5. I find out that your husband isn't the father of my girlfriend and threaten to tell him
6. I discover you've been lying on your reports to corporate and I'm going to get you fired unless you become my slave

Is this reasonable? I'd much rather do my CS degree where I am now and avoid the stress and debt I would incur at the engineering school, I just don't know if I'd just end up with a degree and no job.

In fact, distance has been a major problem in the relationship since the beginning and something we had been working to overcome.

For the past 2 months she has been at her internship in California, but we managed to talk just about every day and videochat most days. We did know going into this that the distance would be an issue but we thought that it was something that could be dealt with, not to mention the forced 3 month abstinence would allow the relationship to be more that just a physical one.

The relationship was a very good one. It was the first one she was willing to tell her parents about and the first time she was ever willing to put it on Facebook. (I've known her for six years and she rarely ever shares anything on Facebook)

She really doesn't like to talk about her past, or whats happening with her and mostly just wants to know what's going on with me, how my day was, how I'm feeling, etc. She even knows a number of my friends by name because I talk about them quite a bit. However, I don't get much information on her and I hadn't pressed it because she seemed very sensitive about the topic.

She did share, however, that she has been dealing with depression for a very long time and did not want to share it with anyone. She hasn't even told her parents or her sister. In addition, I noticed that she gets doubts about the validity of both her and my feelings about once a month.

I spoke to her about depression, since I have gone through it myself, even being suicidal at one point. However, she insisted that getting professional help would be useless. She also talked a bit about how her previous relationships were mostly physical and how she had poor experiences in them.

Last Saturday night, she messaged me that she needed to talk to me when I got home. When I got home she dropped the bomb ""I don't think this relationship is working anymore"".

Honestly, this was quite out of the blue. The Friday before last had been our three month anniversary and we had been making plans to spend Sunday together as it was 100 days since we had begun dating and she had seemed very excited by it.

When I pressed her about why she wanted to break up the only answer I could get was ""It doesn't feel right"". However, a number of other things she said have made me think that a lot of this is due to the depression.

First off, this fits in with the previous pattern of feeling very down and out and doubting of her and my feelings at the end of every month. Second, she made it very clear that she wants to remain in my life and I in hers, at least as friends. 3rd, she kept reiterating that she wasn't the best for me and that someone out there would be better for me and refused to take anything I said to the contrary, saying only that ""you feel that way now"".

The most worrying thing to me is this last point. She asked several times if I would hate her, saying she wouldn't blame me if I never wanted to talk to her again. The other points came up a few times, but this was a heavily recurring one.

However, a few things give me some hope:

1) She refused to say 'ex' at any point, although this may simply be due to it being a hard word to say this soon.

2) She hasn't changed anything about our relationship status on Facebook, which I would have expected.

3) She really (and I mean really) wants to remain close friends, talking every day, videochatting, hanging out, and even visiting one another at school.

However, I am honestly scared shitless that she might do something to hurt herself. I also think she may be pushing me away before I get too close so it doesn't hurt so bad.

tl;dr: Girlfriend of 3 months just broke up with me but wants to stay very close friends. Her feelings at the moment fit into a pattern of depression that has been very apparent."

A bit of history about myself, I used to play GW1 intensively, I played for 7 years roughly on and off but I got into GW1 PvP and played GvG a lot for top 200-300 teams (not that high but still extremely fun) and a lot of Random Arena (memories). The main reason I quit GW2 for a long time was its grind that I personally felt was out of line, but coming back for a couple days it seems like its not a big deal since everything is fresh and new again.

I tried PvP but I just don't get the feel for it, that will probably change soon when I get into full swing of things.

**My Question for you guys** 

What is the best way to get back into things? I know there is a shit ton of new things to do, however I am currently an intern for the summer and I have maybe 10 hours a week to play. 

Do I start doing the new things or continue beating the storyline to lvl 80 (second character) and then start the new stuff.

What are your tips for leveling (guides or videos recommended )

Any other advice for a fellow GW player?




Thanks,

I spoke to her about depression, since I have gone through it myself, even being suicidal at one point. However, she insisted that getting professional help would be useless. She also talked a bit about how her previous relationships were mostly physical and how she had poor experiences in them.

Last Saturday night, she messaged me that she needed to talk to me when I got home. When I got home she dropped the bomb ""I don't think this relationship is working anymore"". 

Honestly, this was quite out of the blue. The Friday before last had been our three month anniversary and we had been making plans to spend Sunday together as it was 100 days since we had begun dating and she had seemed very excited by it.

When I pressed her about why she wanted to break up the only answer I could get was ""It doesn't feel right"". However, a number of other things she said have made me think that a lot of this is due to the depression.

First off, this fits in with the previous pattern of feeling very down and out and doubting of her and my feelings at the end of every month. Second, she made it very clear that she wants to remain in my life and I in hers, at least as friends. 3rd, she kept reiterating that she wasn't the best for me and that someone out there would be better for me and refused to take anything I said to the contrary, saying only that ""you feel that way now"".

The most worrying thing to me is this last point. She asked several times if I would hate her, saying she wouldn't blame me if I never wanted to talk to her again. The other points came up a few times, but this was a heavily recurring one.

However, a few things give me some hope:

1) She refused to say 'ex' at any point, although this may simply be due to it being a hard word to say this soon.

2) She hasn't changed anything about our relationship status on Facebook, which I would have expected.

3) She really (and I mean *really*) wants to remain close friends, talking every day, videochatting, hanging out, and even visiting one another at school.

However, I am honestly scared shitless that she might do something to hurt herself. I also think she may be pushing me away before I get too close so it doesn't hurt so bad.

**tl;dr**: Girlfriend of 3 months just broke up with me but wants to stay very close friends. Her feelings at the moment fit into a pattern of depression that has been very apparent."
1jaxf5,1,2013-07-29,Where to get financial help for college when my parents make too much money?,imreallypoor,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1jaxf5/where_to_get_financial_help_for_college_when_my/,"(This is probably going to be really long, so be prepared)

I am a junior at a public university, and recently my parents have not been able to help me with any finances. I really am trying to be frugal, and I only spend money on gas and food, but they act like I am a constant nuisance. I'm trying to point out to them that when I got a job last year, they freaked out about it taking away from my schooling and how I wasn't supposed to work in college and that they would support me financially like they did my brother and sister. I told my mom about this last week and she said ""We know its hard on you right now, but we don't want you to feel the burden of finances right now."" In the past year I made about $4000 which I used mainly for food although I did use a good portion of it to buy (craigslist) furniture for my apartment and clothes for work. 

All I want right now is to be independent, but I know that is not possible at all. My rent comes to around $720/month, and other living expenses usually around $250-300. My parents make over $150,000 combined so I do not qualify for any financial aid, despite the fact that they are in tons of debt and are barely paying for me. 

I'm willing to take out loans, and I've told them this, but they're just dragging their feet along telling me its going to be okay when I'm getting more and more behind. I'm starting an unpaid internship in the fall and will have to cut my hours at work even more, so I'm really looking to get some sort of financial support soon. 


Are there any private loans I can take out? Do I have to have a cosigner? (My parents have horrible credit so..) 


(Also would like to point out I offered to have my boyfriend move in with me to cut the rent in half as we've been dating for over two years and plan to get engaged within the next year, but they allow it while they're paying for it, so theoretically if I was paying for myself rent would be significantly lower.)

**TLDR: My parents make a lot of money, but are hesitant and in too much dept to actually support me right now so I'm looking for other options.** "
1javp4,1,2013-07-29,Me[21M] with my ex-girlfriend [21M/F] of 4 years: not sure if time to get back together,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1javp4/me21m_with_my_exgirlfriend_21mf_of_4_years_not/,"Hi all,

My first real girlfriend and I broke up last August because she wanted to see what else was out there. I was not 100% into it, but obviously I respected it. During that time we both got with other people. I still feel like I kind of want to be single, but one year later she wants to get back together. We hung out a bit and it feels like we are boyfriend/ girlfriend again. I love her and do want to get back together, but I don't know when.

However, I moved a lot further up north in our state (NJ) for an internship this summer and have been hanging out with other girls. I am also moving to NYC for school next month. I really don't know:

1) how to let this girl I am going to be hanging out with tomorrow down easy that I am not looking for a relationship

2) if I should get back together with my old girlfriend right away as she would like because I'm starting a new school and will be 2 hours away from her

3) why I am feeling so guilty about hanging out with other girls even though my old gf and I aren't anything official (it just feels that way)

If you could help out a lost-in-the-world guy it would be much appreciated to get other people's opinions on the situation.

Thanks

TL;DR- I feel guilty I have been leading on old gf that I want to get back together very soon. I am also guilty about hanging out with other potential girls this summer while we are away from each other. I feel like I am being wrong to both girls."
1jato7,0,2013-07-29,"On the tv show ""Scrubs"" JD is a figment of Turk's imagination",[deleted],FanTheories,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1jato7/on_the_tv_show_scrubs_jd_is_a_figment_of_turks/,"So we all know and love ""Scrubs"".  As a joke I told my friends I thought JD was an imaginary character, but the more I thought about it, it seems plausible.

""Scrubs"" is portrayed as a show following new doctors, but it is actually a show about Turk coping with a new, high-stress job.  He leaves college and starts up as a surgeon in a struggling hospital.  Unable to quickly make a name for himself, he invents JD as an imaginary friend.  Whenever Turk is in trouble, he imagines JD having a good time to cheer himself up; whenever Turk is bored, he imagines JD going on an adventure to amuse himself; when Turk gets married, Carla gets annoyed with JD ""living"" with them, but this is easily explained as Turk's psychological rationalization of Carla's reaction to Turk talking non-stop about a made up person.

In the pilot, when Turk and JD meet Elliot, Turk asks (in a sexually interested way) ""Are you medical or surgical?""  When Elliot says she's a medical intern, Turk gets a little sad because his ""in"" with her is now gone.  So he imagines JD hooking up with her, to fulfill Turk's desire of sexual conquest, but only vicariously through fantasy.

During the season of Turk's wedding, a running theme is the stress of planning a wedding.  JD once again becomes an emotional outlet.  While Turk is bogged down in DJ reservations, tux rentals, and wedding invites, JD is still living the single life, and still hooking up with new, hot women.

When Turk's career does not progress as quickly as he wants, JD gets a promotion.  Except despite the position being intended for one person and Elliot getting the job, JD gets the job too, something that is highly unusual for any job.  However, if Turk were imagining JD, he could give JD any job he wanted.

The show also offers no reason behind Janitor tormenting Turk.  It shows the story behind *JD* getting hassled, but if we accept that JD is imaginary, then we know that Turk actually initiated the pranks, and *with no justification*.  That last part is important, because it also explains why Janitor's retaliation seems so mean.  It's not that he's borderline insane and hassling young doctors; a young doctor began pranking him out of nowhere, and then yelling about someone who doesn't exist as his rationale.

And finally, the ultimate sign of JD existing in Turk's mind, is JD's baby.  As a delusional person, Turk imagines JD but as his best friend.  So he naturally identifies with JD.  This goes to an extreme when JD has a child.  Turk has gotten married and has a daughter, but JD as stayed single.  Once a family man, Turk's mindset becomes very far removed from where it was as a single bachelor, rooming with his bestie.  Unable to imagine what single guys do anymore, and also unable to have JD marry anyone since he isn't real, JD suddenly fathers an unexpected baby to make his life more similar, and easy to imagine, to Turk's.  Hell even after JD's baby is born, the mother is rarely seen.

So I posit, therefore, that JD is a delusion of Turk."

I know you’ve probably changed in 6 years, but I’m pretty sure I’ve changed more. During that time, I actually changed into an adult (I know, you think that’s hard to believe). 

I love you and all, trust me. But I do know how to dress myself, compose myself, use manners, put on makeup the right way, talk to people like an adult, and know what I should be bringing with me in my bag when I go out to interviews or adult meetings or what I need to pack when I go on trips. I mean, I did manage to get into college, grad school, hold a job, have a successful internship, gain friends and man friends, and not completely fall apart at the absence of you not being there to help me.

I do admit though, I apologize for the late night calls when I was deathly sick and when my house got broken into. I didn’t mean to freak you out. I probably should have called more often than late night emergency calls. Sorry for the heart attacks. I always appreciated when you picked up though. You never let me down.

Just because I don’t feel the need to tell you about it, doesn’t mean I’m not applying to jobs multiple times a day and trying to do something with my life. Believe it or not, I actually do accomplish things when you’re not looking. I don’t just hang out in my room and sleep/listen to music/veg out, although I probably do that too often. 

Also, just because I do feel the need to talk about things that make me happy, doesn’t mean I’m just going out and partying with my friends 24/7, blasting music, trolling the internet, and am overly obsessed with my boyfriend. Trust me, in the meantime, I’m trying to accomplish something. I’m just trying to celebrate the little (perhaps meaningless to you) victories, so I’m not completely miserable and drowning in my own self pity. 

I know you care. Trust me. I know you love me and care about me a lot. This does not mean I will willingly accept your help and advice to try and “steer me into the right direction"". I’m 24 years old. I’m more than capable. One more reminder - I did live on my own for 6 years. I’ll try not to be mean or ungrateful when I decline your invitation to try and find me a job, but just know, I really can’t deal with you worrying about me in that area. I worry about myself enough. 

I apologize in advance, because I will be a raging bitch sometimes. It most likely won’t be anything you do, its more a result of my uncertainty of my future and fear that my life is going nowhere. Sometimes I just need to shut myself away from the world and try and deal with those feelings. So your space and not coming to save the day is appreciated. Sometimes I need to stand on my own 2 feet.
 
On a final note, I do love you a lot. I appreciate all of the late night calls, the confidence that I sometimes lacked, and being that stable rock even though I usually didn’t need it. The fact that I know it’s there is more helpful than anything in the world. But please, STOP CLEANING MY ROOM FOR ME.

Love, Me. "
1jarg3,6,2013-07-29,"[For Hire] Experienced Cook/BOH Supervisor (resume, and a lot of background) Gimme a chance and we can all grow together.",LFWDVCO,denverjobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/denverjobs/comments/1jarg3/for_hire_experienced_cookboh_supervisor_resume/,"So about me, If you're reading this as a possible employer...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm looking to relocate to the Denver area, I'm 28, hardworking, and passionate about everything I do, there's nothing I do that I don't put my heart into.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I've spent much of my working life ""playing the field"" so to speak, and I'm ready to find a good company to settle down with. 

I have a bachelor's degree in Biology. The sad truth is that I come from a rural area in Missouri and I took the most ""scientific"" degree I could get at my local satellite campus of Drury University. Unfortunately I didn't research the program and I ended up learning a lot about the theories of biology; sadly though nothing technical and practical enough to get me a job as even an intern in most labs.

What college really taught me, Is to stick to what I've always loved doing, making good food that makes people happy.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I have a Culinary Certification (also from the local technical school), which taught me all the basics, but the last 10 years I've learned a lot more from my oodles of experience. I've worked in the back of crummy dive bars, I've worked in a five star resort that had 4 restaurants and hotel room service, 6 kitchens and 10 coolers/freezers. A desert production facility, and the standard Cracker Barrel and random steak houses. I've ended up in lead/supervisory/trainer positions in almost every job I've had. I'm a natural leader and a positive presence and influence in any team. 

The last few years have been... rough... to say the least. I was in line to take over the local Pizza Hut as general manager when my licensed got suspended without my knowledge. It was a point violation that was later thrown out of court and my license reinstated. I had to take a delivery one night and got pulled over and arrested and subsequently terminated. After I fought the charges and ran through my savings I was destitute and still jobless. Every background check for a possible employer would come back with pending charge, no one would hire me.

Finally my parents moved me to Nashville, where I currently reside and have been for three years. 

When I moved here I applied to a BBQ joint down the road that was getting ready to open. I can't really say I applied, because they refused to take my resume or information 3 times. Grand opening comes around and my sister stops by because they're so busy and asks if they need help and they throw her an apron. No less than 2 hours later their only grill cook walked out from the stress and my sister said ""I know someone that can cook!"" And so begins the story of the Cockeyed Pig....


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Cockeyed Pig (The Pig) was started by a two men that owned and operated a tour-bus cleaning business. They had absolutely no experience in restaurants at all. Zilch. My sister's most recent restaurant job was McDonalds at 16, over 12years ago for her. I am now the ONLY employee who has ever worked in a restaurant for more than a year. 

The rub recipe for the BBQ was absolutely brilliant... delicious with a nice kick and soft undertastes and a sweet after taste that left you wanting more and more, It was perfect for the pork butts and ribs. 

The original recipe was made by an old Texan and a generally nice though down on his luck old man I'll call SJ. SJ was the ""general manager"" at the time and AD was the owner/operator and smaller financial backer. 

SJ had a bit of a drinking problem and fell off the radar and the original rub recipe was lost. A truly sad day. All that was left was enough for about 1/2 a day's meat, and he taught no one his secret recipe. From that last half a batch I was able to reverse engineer the... majority.... of the flavor, though something was always missing. The original recipe had 22 different herbs and spices, and mine had 20. It wasn't perfect but it went unnoticed or without question with our customer base.

At this point I was finally put in charge of all BOH operations, inventory, orders, prep, meat, opening, closing, ""cook schedules"" which at the time consisted of me being there to open and close and one person to give me 2 days off. I was only allowed one more BOH employee, We'll call her Jay. 

I really hate bad mouthing former bosses... but this man, AD, was a snake. I slaved for him as a KM for 8.50 an hr. He would take money from the nightly deposits as though it just immediately was his. IE: The bank deposit was $2100, he would deposit $1500. At the end of the month the books would be off and he expected my sister to cook the books and participate in other shady practices. He once put a tip jar out for the FOH employees, then he would take it at the end of the night and pocket it and claim ""it was the store's money.""

Despite all the owner's horrible decisions, my sister's FOH skills and my BOH experience and skills we were still able to pull in about 7500-10000 a week in sales. A fairly successful first year.... 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Enter R. AD had decided to sell the restaurant, and R decided to buy it. Another owner with no experience or knowledge necessary to run, nay control a beast that is a restaurant. This owner came from a corporate office building working in accounting. The second he came into the place it was nothing but drama.

Any experienced  restaurant worker knows that gossip, is the thing to do. I personally don't like to participate, but we all do it at times. When people work together and with each other in such a personal way for hours, days on end, they talk. This is fact. R couldn't wrap his head around this fact and infighting and gossip had killed the team I had built.

You see AD was an old perverted man, and as far as he thought about me was that I was a know nothing kid. My sister though, he liked to flirt with her, slip her hundred dollar bills in her back pocket while his wife wasn't watching. Things like that....

When I suggested things like, portion control, labor costs, scheduling, orders, maintenance, etc.... my cries fell on deaf ears. When I told my sister what needed to be done, and she told him, we soon had new policy that mysteriously mirrored my own suggestions.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


When R bought the business, he saw that I was essentially training my sister to manage the restaurant and he decided to give out new titles and raises. We negotiated a salary for me as KM. I now had 2 employees, Jay and M. After I left that meeting, my sister told me he made M the new KM. I was then told we were doing something else for me and my sister. My sister formerly FOH/GM would now be Asst. MGR, I would now be GM. (I HAD TO LIVE WITH THIS WOMAN AFTER THIS!!!!!)

Everything seemed fine, except R would have random ideas that were just not cost effective or made no sense. May 2011 comes and R has my sister and I go to Memphis in May BBQ competition. We got 6th. However while we were gone our KM M, and other cook Jay failed to load meat in the smoker for the next days business and R was (rightly) furious. He charged me with finding out who  was responsible since both of them worked and both blamed each other. I demanded that M be terminated (like originally suggested when I was made GM). He insisted I snoop around instead of making the KM take responsibility for his (in)actions.

A week later he decided that Jay, the girl that had worked so hard for me the whole time should be terminated. I insisted otherwise, and was terminated for ""inability to perform required job functions."" IE firing and innocent employee.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I decided to take a line cook position at another random steak house chain, O'Charleys. Where I currently work. I thought I didn't want to run a restaurant, or want the responsibilities of a leader.... now all I can think about is getting back in, at least management of a good restaurant.

The problem now, and I'm gonna be completely honest, this is reddit and a throwaway account, that I don't expect a response from so full disclosure.

Currently on probation for misdemeanor marijuana possession. I'm currently clean, and marijuana isn't the reason I want to move to CO.  I've always lived in rural Missouri, and now Nashville, I've never even seen the ocean, or a real mountain. This is the first step. First the mountain, then the ocean, then the world. 

None of this happens without a good job, with a good company, that I can settle down with. All I need is a chance to prove myself. We all need that chance sometime and this is me at least reaching for it.

PM me for a Resume with references, this is a cut down version removing as much PI as possible.

I have some questions for men regarding women with money. Women, if you're browsing and have experience in this area, I'd like your opinion too!

**First, some background about my wealth:** 
I am very wealthy. Not .0001% wealthy like the Trumps or Rockefellers, but wealthy enough that I will be a multi-millionaire by my mid-twenties, which will compound over the years even if I did nothing to increase it. My mom, born middle class, climbed the corporate ladder and has a great job. She would be considered upper middle class. My dad, born lower class, dropped out of college to bootstrap his own software company. 28 years later, he still run the whole shebang, which dominates its industry. My parents divorced when I was very young, and living with my mom and her parents was a great, but very normal life. In fact, we had pretty distinct money issues in my younger years, her being a single mom and all that. I didn't understand the extent of my wealth until middle school, and even then my day-to-day lifestyle was perfectly average, glittered with the occasional outlandish trip or purchase with my dad. As I got older, my dad began discussing bank accounts and trusts, and that, paired with things like brand new luxury cars, excess spending money, and lavish houses, made my financial reality very clear. After a lot of rough years, I now have a blended family -- mom's side, dad's side, step parents' sides are all close and do a lot together -- and the dynamic is incredible. We are from so many different backgrounds, and everyone is down to earth, genuine, and intelligent. (But my dad takes the cake as the most eccentrically brilliant, hard working, and business-savvy people that I've known; every dollar that he makes and I receive comes from all-nighters and perseverance.) My brother and I were raised to see past dollar signs, and often give each other shit when we hear the other say something completely ridiculous with a desensitized casual attitude, like ""oh, it's only like $5k more, so it's whatever."" We don't hang around ""rich people"", in fact, my friends all struggle with money so I try to treat them to things that I know they would/could not do for themselves. My parents made it clear that material things are only important when they help create memories.

**Next, a little about me:**
I'm young, like early-20s-still-in-college-young. I would consider my life normal but well-rounded: I do well at a tough school, play sports, am involved in a variety of extracurriculars, party a fair amount, work internships, etc. To stereotype myself Breakfast Club Style, I would be the ""popular"" girl, but I try really hard to dispel that by being kind to everyone, letting my actual weirdness shine through (which is immense and sometimes terrifies people), refusing to act like a Princess, and generally not tolerating shitty people or attitudes. Although I could lazily sit on my ass and still make an incredible living, the idea of having no ambitions, not putting my brain to good use, or not using my money for the greater good, sickens me. My dad worked so hard so that we could live without financial stress (but, life is balanced, and thus it has invited plenty of new stresses), and I intend to do the same by contributing to the wealth to leave to my kids, to leave to their kids, and so forth. I adhere to the notion that money can't buy happiness, but it can reduce some stresses and buy some pretty fucking fun/badass pleasures. A lot of people don't know that I'm anything more than an upper-class kid, but the close friends and family who do definitely benefit from my lifestyle, and I like it that way. My boyfriend or husband would certainly share in my wealth. Unfortunately, I've witnessed my dad being used for money by people that we really trusted and had let into our circle. I've also heard of plenty of offensive and ignorant comments by my peers about the monetary value of being my friend or dating me (for the record, I've not dated anyone in the past five years.) Needless to say, it's given me some pretty large concerns regarding dating. I am terrified of ending up with someone who likes me just fine but isn't in love with me yet chooses to date me with the mentality of ""just dealing with it"" for the perks they would receive as my boyfriend/husband. Oh, and I'm a hopeless romantic that truly cares about love and the foundation of a relationship -- I don't care if my husband is wealthy (though that would cut down on some explaining) or well-off in the slightest. I am attracted to (and judge a man's success by) his passion, drive, and commitment to those that he loves.

**THE QUESTIONS**

1. How can I be sure a man isn't dating me for money?

2. Given the traditional and prevalent notion that men are the breadwinners or just the tendency of men to feel like they need to be, how do I make a significant other feel comfortable with my money? How do I make sure they are secure in our relationship?

3. What are some things that are ""pride points"" for you? As in, what are the expenses, purchases, or gifts for your girlfriend/wife that you want to solely make, and you would offended or hurt if she did for herself or contributed her money to?

4. Would you be comfortable letting your girlfriend/wife pay for most meals, bills, vacations, etc.? Why or why not?

Any other feedback, advice, thoughts, etc. are appreciated! 

EDIT: Y'all are all giving amazing advice, thank you so much. I knew I always liked this sub ;). It's awesome knowing that money is much more of a non-issue with men than women. There are a few things I want to add since I've needed to repeat them in almost every comment: 

1. Most people know I live comfortably. A very limited number of people know I'm very well off. No one outside my immediate family knows how well off I am. I would never disclose my wealth to someone I am casually dating, and I would get the fuck out of there if he asked. 

2. My questions aren't really referring to casual dating, and the first question is kind of out of sync with the rest. I'm picturing a scenario along the lines of: I'm with someone and we progress well and get along WITHOUT him knowing how wealthy I am, and little by little I let him in. Although I am concerned about being used, I am much more worried that he would feel uncomfortable, insecure, or intimidated by the money and that it would change the dynamic of our relationship. "
1jach4,13,2013-07-29,I[23/M] haven't seen or spoken with my father for over 4 years but am going to dinner with him on Thursday... Feeling lost on how to approach this very complicated relationship to make sure no one gets hurt and how I can have a healthy relationship going forward.,Questionforreddit09,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jach4/i23m_havent_seen_or_spoken_with_my_father_for/,"Hi all - not really sure if this is the right place for this (most posts seem to be about romantic involvement, not family), but I figured it's worth a shot as I don't really know where else to turn at this point and I don't really have much time left. This is not a sob story by any stretch of the imagination, I feel that I could easily go this alone, but this is a big event for me and I really would like to have some outside input, if possible.

(This is a throwaway because there are some pretty specific details..)

Long story short: my parents got divorced when I was 6 or 7 (too young for me and my siblings to remember anything from the marriage) and their relationship since then consisted of only lawyered up responses between each other regarding finances (child support, paying for college, etc.--my dad made about 5 times as much as my mom and my mom felt he was trying to control our family through money, thus she told us not to share any financial details with him whatsoever... obviously this                                                                    affected our view of him... we were too young to understand anything, really); I haven't seen them exchange a word in probably 15 years, and then it was niceties exchanged through pursed lips.  My brother, sister and I all lived full-time with my mom when my dad moved away, trying to balance the every-other-weekend and one-week-a-summer thing with my dad. As the years progressed, we began to get busier and busier and spent less and less time with him, although we still maintained the relationship (me more than my siblings).

Fast forward to high school: my dad and I were really the only ones with any type of real relationship, mostly due only to sports. I'm the only one of my siblings to ever have been heavily involved in team-sports, which gave my dad and I a reason to spend some time together (all the while trying to stay out of the middle of the ongoing court battles about who was going to pay for college...my mom and us felt that since he was making so much more money, that he should help pay for a lot... he had a different opinion, which made us all feel like he loved his money more than his kids). He would take me to tournaments; one of his good friends was a coach of mine for many years; etc..  My brother became apathetic towards the relationship and did what was easiest, avoiding conflict and just letting it fade out (avoidance is a big reason why my relationship now is nearly nonexistent); and my sister now held the same opinion of my father that my mom did: greedy bastard who only likes his money and not his kids (they will never have a real relationship again, my sister has made very clear).

By my freshman year in high school, the court battle heated up, as my sister was due to graduate and begin university that next year. I have one distinct memory of being at the county fair and seeing my mom all of a sudden just break down in tears. Not knowing what to do or what was really going on, I tried to comfort her and learn what was wrong. Turns out the judges decision came through that day, mandating that all 3 parties involved (us kids, my mom, my dad) split the cost of college evenly--1/3, 1/3, 1/3. In hindsight, it is really hard to explain how unfair this felt, as my dad and his lawyer apparently used some pretty ruthless allegations against my mom in the courtroom (we never learned details about this stuff) to try to convey to the judge that my mom was using the child support on herself (not the case at all). Needless to say, this really set the tone for the next few years. My mom, although never intentionally bad mouthing my dad, shared details of his attempts to manipulate our family through monetary means... which, of course, indirectly led us developing certain opinions about our dad.

By the end of high school I was still the only sibling to have a real relationship with him. My mom, although she made her opinions of him very clear, never actively tried to prevent us from having a relationship, but did make it clear that if we didn't want to have one, that was OK. Even though how we were to pay for college was still up in the air, there was no doubt in my mind that I was going to university to get my degree. And this is where it kind of gets messy.

One of the things I respect most about my mom is that she always considered her own mom (my grandmother) one of her best friends. By the end of high school, my grandma was well into retirement and had taken a keen interest in investments, the market, politics, etc. My grandma had always helped out financially whenever she could (my mom didn't make more than $15-20k a year from her own small business), but we soon learned that she'd had a college fund for us grandkids set up for a while now (I graduated high school in 2009, so the fund was down quite a bit). Needless to say, when we learned that my grandma was going to help pay for college, it was a huge relief and we felt so incredibly thankful.

However, when I was getting ready to go to college, I attended my orientation camp and accidentally ended up rushing a fraternity (I wasn't interested, but wanted to meet new people). As it turns out, I really clicked with the guys in the house and ended up wanting to join. Of course, the first thing my mom thought of was that my dad might use this to get out of paying for college by maybe saying that he wouldn't pay for his kid to go party for four years or that since room &amp; board would be going to the fraternity and not the university (for the dorm), he wouldn't have to pay for it. In the end, I went with my gut and joined the fraternity (one of the best decisions of my life... and no, I'm not a frat douche bag or an alcoholic... I actually graduated Magna Cum Laude! =] ). 

One thing that my mom would always convey about my dad is that he would try and benefit from things he didn't deserve, like spending just fun time with us kids while not having to do any of the hard work (although it didn't come out like that); she also made it clear that he liked to play the victim in many situations (one that led to one of my step mom's sisters writing my own sister  nasty letter, conveying her disbelief that someone couldn't be the absolute biggest fan of my dad, who was such a nice, nice guy)... So one thing my mom subtly mentioned when I was about to start college was that my grandma really didn't want my dad involved in the frat, partly out of fear that he might stop paying for college if he knew about it (we didn't tell him) or that he would try to somehow sabotage the relationship and the good things going. *It's really hard for me to write things like this because it kind of paints my mom in a bad light, when in reality she was just doing her absolute best to protect our family from any manipulation or further pain. However, now that I'm more mature and older, I'm able to see how she maybe could've handled things a little bit better... but hindsight is always 20/20*. As a result, I began to truly avoid any and all contact with him except for the semesterly email where I had to send him a tuition statement and proof that I was passing my classes. After sophomore year, I was lucky enough to get some pretty good paying internships (combined with some hefty scholarships) that allowed me to make enough money in a summer to pay for most of the year of college, so I eventually just stopped asking him for money... Partly out of avoiding the awkward contact of asking for it (despite that fact that my sister and my mom would be on me, asking if I'd sent him the statement yet). Luckily, I was still able to graduate college with some money in the bank and no debt.

Fast forward to Junior year: after about a year and a half of really no contact whatsoever aside from the occasional email he would send every couple of months of so since the start of college (always saying that no matter what he would still love us), I got an email that said he was moving away to Hawaii in a few days. Of course, a rush of emotion came over me and I realized that despite the last three years or so of living near my dad but choosing to never see him, I soon wouldn't even have a choice. I also realized that a large part of why I cut off my relationship wasn't necessarily due to the feelings I had towards him, but instead out of fear of hurting my mom and my sister if I did have a relationship with him.

I responded to the email saying that I would like to have dinner, if possible (accepting his invitation). But as the week rolled along, it turned out they had some moving snags and he wouldn't have the time to meet. Needless to say, that hurt a little bit, but at the same time I felt no right to feel hurt, as I had completely shut him out of my life for the last couple of years. After he moved, we've been in a little more frequent email contact (still maybe once a month), but it's often superficial emails. He'll tell me about their property in Hawaii, what they plan to do with it (they're building a house), the dog they rescued from the beach, etc. I'd tell him some about what I'd been doing that semester at school (he literally knew nothing other than my good grades, because, again, I felt the need to not share details because my mom felt like he could use those against her/us financially). 

That is pretty much how the relationship is now. 

I've since graduated university and lucked out enough to get my dream job. Possibly even luckier was the opportunity to have the summer off to go and travel the world (I just got back from one trip and take off on another in a few weeks). 

Since he moved away, my mom has gotten remarried to one of the most respectable men I ever could've hoped to have in my life. He's helped me mature an insane amount in the last two years or so and has filled a fatherly role that I often felt like I missed out on (although I also lucked out to grow up in community surrounded my the love of my friend's parents... all of whom's dads I got to know very well, so I definitely wasn't some delinquent kid). I've also been lucky enough to pick up a few really, really, really great mentors on my journey through college, one of which also had a falling out with her father at one point in her life. When I was sharing some details with her (she's so good at getting me to open up), she just subtly said a ""oh how heartbreaking... imagining having messing up the relationship with your kids so bad that they don't even want to talk to you""--and damn did that hit a heart string. I all of a sudden started feeling kind of guilty for doing what we'd done... knowing that my dad probably did try his best in his relationships with us, but for some reason it wasn't good enough for us. Even though it was simple statement in passing, it's really helped me think about what I value in life. 

I've sometimes asked myself, in a very cliche, hollywood-type moment, what I want my life to be like in 10, 15 years.... Things like whether I want my dad to be at my wedding, one of the first to hold my own kids. Needless to say, I've been doing a lot of thinking (without throwing any type of pity party... I hate that stuff). 

Moving on... While I was out of town, I got an email saying that my step mother's dad passed away and that they would be returning to the mainland for a week to help settle the estate. My dad invited me and my three siblings out to dinner, of which both my brother and I have decided to accept (really surprised my brother accepted, as he hasn't really had ANY contact with him lately, not surprised my sister declined... Still thinks he's the devil). And we've made tentative plans to go out to dinner on Thursday. However, I'm now realizing that I have no idea what I'm going to say, what he's going to say, no real justifiable explanation for why I cut him out of my life.

So now here I am, three days away from seeing my dad (and stepmom) for the first time in almost half a decade, literally having no idea what the hell I'm going to say, what I might need to say, if I owe him anything, or really what to do when I see him for the first time (I anticipate it will be me, my brother, my dad, and my step mom... Although I'd prefer if my stepmom wasn't there the first time, as she probably doesn't like any of us kids any more.. but I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt). 

Reddit -- this is the first time I've turned to a place with a real problem like this, but I think I need some level headed, non biased thoughts on this... Not only for myself, but also for my brother. I know that I cannot change the past, or even necessarily fix any mistakes that were made, but I do know that I'm still young and there's still time left in life to change things going forward. After all, he is my dad. 

I've decided not to hide this dinner from my mom and sister, after initially wanting to do so. I don't want to lie.

I know this probably all seems like just a random, unorganized, gramatically-nightmarish collection of events from my life; but that's because it is. I've never written anything about this before and have really only told a select few friends details (the ones who are really good at getting me to open up).

What do you think I should do?

---

**tl;dr**: Completely shut my dad out of my life four years ago for some very, very complex reasons but my brother and I going to have dinner with him in only three days. I've made the decision to see him mostly because I've recently started asking myself what I truly value in life, and, despite our history, a relationship with my dad is one of them. I've realized you can't change the past, that nobody is perfect, and that there's plenty of time going forward to have a healthy relationship; I'm just hoping someone might be able to help me get off on the right foot. Thanks so much in advance, I love you all."

She joined this program to intern abroad for the summer. The months leading up to it was stressful for the relationship, but we managed to work it through. While she was abroad, she started changing, and rethinking her future. She returns in 2 weeks, and thinks she will be this completely different person. We skyped last night and at first she said she didnt think it would be best for me to be around when she gets back, and then she immediately changed her mind because she ""just doesnt know"" what to expect when she gets home. Her parents and I know that she is just in over her head, and that once she gets back into the swing of things it'll be okay. I'm worried she's going to make an irrational decision and tell me to leave. The conversation leaves me worried and stressed for various reasons, and I am unsure how to deal with it. 

Update: She messaged me on Tuesday apologizing and saying that she was crazy. She said she was PMS-ing and  us arguing was making her upset. She's unsure about what's going on, but will ""figure it out"". She still wants me to be there when her family picks her up from the airport(it was originally going to be just me, then just her family, but now everyone). I still am extremely worried about the relationship, which has made me kind of sick. I don't know what else to do."

Idealy I would like a to make a search bar in my excel, where I can input the stock I want options data on, and use that search to query a web pull of options data going 6, 12 and 18 months out

I can get the current months options data, but I dont know how to also import data contracts with later expiris .... meaning I can import the table for July 2013 options (this month), but I really only want January 2014 and January 2015 options for this model. Currently I use web queries (where you check the box for which data you want), but would like a more automated process .... input stock symbol and it pulls the data in... I think this involves creating macros? I have a few weeks to learn and a few very smart interns to help with the heavy lifting

Any help or pointers welcome! 

Thanks!

We arrived at his building where the door man greeted him by name, “Evening Paul, Madam” and proceeded to tip his hat. Stating, “Enjoy your evening” 
We rode on the lift for what seemed minutes to his penthouse suite the doors opened on a darkened living room lit only by the moon light from the far window, he clapped twice and the room lit to reveal leather couches and large wooden bookshelves lining the far wall filled with books obscure shaped bottles which were filled with the amber joy of scotch. My attention was drawn to view which was anything if not spectacular I stood there speechless admiring the view as smooth jazz stated playing in the background when my concentration was broken by his warm hand and smooth voice. “The view makes me speechless at times too” as he placed a drink in my hand and kissed my neck. I sip the most amazing drink ever and as I turn to see the TV is a fireplace with the perfect ration of flame to embers, he kisses my lips firmly yet softly as I melt into his arms, and slowly dance together as this warm breeze brushes my neck. I kiss his neck though obscured by his suit my hands make short work to gain better access. 

I nibble softly as he strokes my hair and work my way through his numerous buttons, with his soft pecks and hard abs making my knees weak I bite my lip as I finish. His hand has made it to my zip and as I flip his shirt over his shoulders as my dress hits the floor. With him checking me out against the moonlit backdrop he picks me up as he simultaneously kisses me hard as I wrap my legs around his waist, this continued on our journey to his bedroom as he laid me on the edge of the bed with his head moving south and his hands north up the inside of my thighs, I let out a small moan as he kissed my stomach and teased me with his mouth and hands. I reached for his belt in frustration for wanting more but it was too far away. He teased more as he moved back up my chest kissing my breasts along the way. At last belt access my hands and feet made short work at removing his pants as the outline of his erect penis stood proud from his underpants with the hint of tip showing. Before I had a chance to grab him, his mouth was at my covered vagina kissing it softly teasing me and ruining my favourite lace panties. 

He pulled them off much to my delight as he looked up with his tongue out slightly and moving his thumbs against may outer lips teasing as he started licking my clitoris with delight I moaned and melted at his wonderful technique and repetitious movement he was truly a god among men. I longed for more as he returned to kiss me, the taste of me was as delightful as ever. I rolled him onto his back as kissed his neck and rubbed his chest as I moved south for his reward. I kissed the tip as it pocked out of his short style underwear as I slid them off, it was like releasing a tensioned spring as he struck my face softly which made me giggle with delight. I couldn’t help but take him in my mouth as salivate as I stroked the remaining shaft as he was too big for my small mouth, his eyes closed with delight as I looked up if to seek his approval. I kept massaging as I moved over him to which he intern grabbed my waist and pulled me close as he flipped me on my back and kiss bit my neck as he inserted himself into my dripping vagina. 

I moaned with delight as he filled me fully and trusted gently and deeply as his pelvis rubbed against mine, I moaned louder with delight as he increased the pace and length of his strokes, I couldn’t keep quite any longer as I let out a scream of ecstasy his eyes opened and he smiled with delight at this revelation, he kissed me hard on the lips and bit my neck as he continued his work on my orgasm which approached quickly as I screamed OH yes Paul, yes, yes, YESSSSSSS . He continued as I climaxed once and then twice and then continued to the third where we climaxed together his semen warmed my insides with further delight as he kissed me, looking pleased with his accomplishment of making me have a full body orgasm I was in speechless ecstasy he withdrew himself and laid on his back. I couldn’t leave such a masculine penis in such a messy state so I humbly licked him clean as his penis twitched in thankfulness, I then  rested my head on his chest happy and satisfied I fell asleep to him stocking my hair and kissing my forehead.

I kept massaging as I moved over him to which he intern grabbed my waist and pulled me close as he flipped me on my back and kiss bit my neck as he inserted himself into my dripping vagina. I moaned with delight as he filled me fully and trusted gently and deeply as his pelvis rubbed against mine, I moaned louder with delight as he increased the pace and length of his strokes, I couldn't keep quite any longer as I let out a scream of ecstasy his eyes opened and he smiled with delight at this revelation, he kissed me hard on the lips and bit my neck as he continued his work on my orgasm which approached quickly as I screamed OH yes Paul, yes, yes, YESSSSSSS . He continued as I climaxed once and then twice and then continued to the third where we climaxed together his semen warmed my insides with further delight as he kissed me, looking pleased with his accomplishment of making me have a full body orgasm I was in speechless ecstasy he withdrew himself and laid on his back. I then  rested my head on his chest happy and satisfied I fell asleep to him stocking my hair and kissing my forehead.

1j9s0x,3,2013-07-29,Help me get into a good grad school by planning early,GFWL_adam,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1j9s0x/help_me_get_into_a_good_grad_school_by_planning/,"I went through undergrad with little planning, so this time I want to get it right.
I've just graduated from undergrad:

* with a 2.8 GPA
* some research experience, but no published papers
* one outside internship 
* computer science

I'm going to grad school in a few months for a masters:

* local state school, ranked much lower than my undergrad
* computer science


What should I do at this point, if I want to get into a good PhD program for either computer science or economics?
I'm thinking of:

* bonding with the professors more for recommendations (never talked to professors that much in undergrad)
* making sure to maintain a good GPA (i often took too many classes at once in undergrad)
* study hard for the GRE and get a good score on it

I know that my low undergrad GPA will probably hurt me.  Will a high masters GPA be able to ""offset"" a lower undergrad GPA?  Do I even have a chance of getting into a top school like Stanford?  What do admissions officers usually look at?  I'm interested in applying computer science concepts to economics, so I'd be happy getting into a PhD program for either of those fields, but will my lack of an undergraduate degree in the subject hurt my chances of getting into a good econ program?"
1j9q9b,19,2013-07-29,I'm graduating in May 2014 and I have basically nothing to show for it. How do I buckle down for the next year to make sure I get a job?,rust_oxide,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1j9q9b/im_graduating_in_may_2014_and_i_have_basically/,"I'll make this as brief as possible.

* My overall GPA is 3.0. My CompSci GPA is probably 2.25-2.5, I haven't calculated it. But it's low. 

* The short and sweet story is I have spent the past 4 years of college having severe depression / suicidal tendencies and substance abuse problems, and have basically skated by as much as possible. I have taken this summer to get professional help and sort out these issues, and I feel I am ready to enter my fifth and final year and do the best I possibly can.

* I have nothing CompSci related to put on my resume. I have no internships and no completed projects.

Basically, if I don't take this next year to buckle down and do well, I feel I will be in a severely bad place come graduation. I don't want that to happen. I know I have a lot of work ahead of me, but I want to make the most of my time and do my best I can with the bad situation that I am in. I feel very very far behind everyone else in my department and am looking to close that skills and resume gap as fast as humanly possible.

I am currently working on making a game in Python, and feel I am making good progress with that. It's a very simple arcade-y game, something that should be done by the time school starts up again in September, but I'm looking for advice on what I should be doing once I am back in school again:

* Should I focus on one language (say Java or C++) and look to make as much content as possible in those languages?
* Am I really as screwed as I think I am? On one hand I am an 'undesirable' candidate and I have no false hopes of working for someone like Google or Facebook. However, at the same time it seems the job market is in desperate need for programmers. Will I be 'okay'?"
1j9o6z,78,2013-07-29,I feel like I'm stuck in a hole I'll never get out of.,jsauk,unitedkingdom,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1j9o6z/i_feel_like_im_stuck_in_a_hole_ill_never_get_out/,"Apologies for the whine, I don't know where else to post this.

I'm 24, and I live in Manchester. I moved here a few months ago after finishing university. I have a music related degree - I don't regret doing it and am slowly building freelance work out of it, but nowhere near enough to live off and I'm at peace with it only being a hobby. I've been looking for a job since I moved here and have had no luck. I'm starting to get seriously depressed and I don't know what to do anymore.

I originally couldn't claim JSA/housing benefit as I am living with my girlfriend who earns above what they deem enough for two. She is paying for family members back home so certainly didn't have enough spare to pay for me. She is leaving to go back home at the end of this month and I won't be going with her; we want different things but it's a five year relationship ending and just adds to everything else. 

As she is leaving work in two weeks, I've started to sign up for JSA/housing again. According to the online calculator I'm not eligible for housing benefit but I may have filled something out wrong and am waiting for an appointment. I am worried that after providing my bank account details I'll be rejected because they'll see monthly payments from my dad.

In terms of job searching, I feel like I'm completely stuck. I'm not an idiot and am skilled in general IT, am fit/strong and have good written/personnel skills but have very little experience (I grew up overseas where as a foreigner it was almost unheard of to work while at school) . Nearly every job I apply for I'm rejected almost instantly because of lack of experience; admin, retail, customer support. I can't do an internship at any of the ones (30+) I've applied for because I don't have the right type of degree. I can't do an apprenticeship because I DO have a degree. I've been rejected from jobs automatically because I don't have a driver's license, but can't afford to get it because I don't have a job. I am trying to find volunteer opportunities but have had no luck within 5 miles of me and anything further becomes difficult to travel to. I can't join the military because I have the mildest case of asthma. I'm applying for everything I find, even though I often don't meet the specs.

I've looked into doing some courses so I have some sort of qualification that might get my foot in the door, but the cost is totally out of reach to me.

Moving back to the country I grew up (i.e move back in with my mum) isn't possible as I need an employment pass to stay there, and they are becoming harder and harder to obtain (my parents who have been working there for a decade are struggling with it and it is based of work experience in the country, savings etc). No job out there is going to hire/sponsor me for an employment pass as it is expensive and I've get zero experience; cheaper for them to get local talent.

I've looked into moving to somewhere in Europe but as I don't speak any other languages an English speaking job is almost always in business/IT and again, I've not got enough experience to be considered for an interview. I could try and move somewhere else in the UK but it would be jumping into the dark and the upfront money required to move I can't come up with.

I have almost no friends (will be totally alone when my girlfriend leaves) and so have exhausted the two personal connections I have. I got an interview out of one, but again, they went with someone with experience.

I really don't know what to do anymore. I'm borrowing money from my dad every month and he can't afford to do it past the end of the year. My lease is up in 4 weeks and my landlord is asking me if I want to stay. I spend hours every day filling out forms only to get a negative check box and I don't even feel like a human anymore. I'm not sleeping, hardly eating.

I appreciate this is a huge wall of text but if anyone can offer me any advice I'd be very grateful.

EDIT: *Thank you all for your responses. I've got a few things to pursue now. You've improved my day*"
1j9k5o,1,2013-07-29,My first love.. Gone,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1j9k5o/my_first_love_gone/,"I met this girl, literally a perfect match for me. We were both twins, our brothers had the same name, we were studying the same thing, same religion, and when we met we couldn't stopped talking. This went on for months, and then when I came back from University, we met up, we started dating. For 2 months, she taught me how to care for a women, how to open up, how to kiss and cuddle. I've always been Independent and away from socializing, but she pushed me out of my shell, and she helped me. We started saying I love you, we planned for the future, I was madly in love and she was too. Then for 3 weeks, I was unavailable, I had to go to cousins place for a while but I still talked to her everyday via phone/msg. I came back and we were going to go on a date. She messages me saying we need to talk when I'm at work. I doubt in my mind that she's going to do anything related to dumping, because we've never fought ever and we're so attracted to each other. She was calling me baby last night, saying I love you. So my work ends, and she tells me that this is the wrong time for a relationship. We went back and forth for 4 hours, long story short, she was going to an internship in a different country, important for her career, and that she didn't want to lead me on till then. I told her that we could do it, that I wouldn't drift, not cheat and she trusted me, then she asked me to come and broke up with me in person. I was devasted, got a cold for 3 day, barely slept and became pale. I didn't have anybody to talk to, I have friends but none of them super close to talk about what happened. I tried to get her back but she refused. Then, out of nowhere she messages me and says she's sorry and wants back in. Of course I said yes and it all went back to normal. She understood that I wouldn't drift that I was loyal and would love her unconditionally. We had two dates, both where we talked alot, but she wasn't the same as she used to be, I feared she would feel ""lost"" Again and break up with me again. But she said she wouldn't, that we were forever and she called me baby and said she loved me. We kised and cuddled but she acted like a rock she promised that she was going through something, but next date she would be like before. 

Fast forward, I was planning the third date with her, and she pushed the date, cause she said she was going to be tired from work. I said okay, and talked to her for so long just like normal. She ends up having a movie night with the bros (siblings) , and she then messages me ""baby are you still up"". 

She then does the same exact thing, except this time saying she's lost and that it's not fair to me, that I should move on and find someone better. I tell her she was normal like before our first breakup, that there's love inside of her, but she just needs time, but we still need to be together. We then go at it at each other for 5 hours she ends saying she loves me but she can't do this to me. She swears on her religion that she's not cheating, but she can't deal with a relationship now, and that she can't drag me down with her. She says good bye, and blocks me off everything. There's no way I can even talk to her. 

It's been 2 days. The first day, I could barely work I ended up quiting my job (not an important job, just a student fast food thing) and just buying protein powder. I feel lost in every way, I miss her every second. I feel like bulking up, improving myself will make me feel better. But I don't want to ever even find another girl, and I can't even imagine the pain I would feel if she got with someone. 

She told me she'd never forget me, and that she's always going to remember me. That she's going to stay single indefinitely. And that I'm perfect but she can't drag me down with her. 

I wanna help her feel less lost but she doesn't open up. It's about her ex boyfriend, and she isn't seeing him she swears but how she feels so empty. And now, she just disapears, like literally gone off the face of the Earth. We don't even have mutual friends. 

I just miss her so much... And I don't know what to do I can barely hold conversation, and I just shut myself in my room, working out and making music. 

I'm sick... "

1j9e3c,3,2013-07-29,I'm a 19 Brazillian Student who is getting in some serious debts.,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1j9e3c/im_a_19_brazillian_student_who_is_getting_in_some/,"So hi Personal Finance ! I just found out about this sub and I really appreciate if you guys could give me some advice.
So, I'm on my 2nd year of graduation (it's a 4 years bachelor in Computer Science). My dad is a Bank manager and I recently got a job. I'm on a internship program on a SQA sector of a big company. My dad covers all my expenses and send me 200 reais (about 90-100 dollars) per week to buy food and bus tickets to go to the unievrsity (I live outside it, a bit far). My internship pays me 600 reais (300 dollars) and It is a quite goos amount of money (I do my monthly shopping and spend only 300 reais, 150 dollars). But here's the deal now: My monthly income could be set at around 1.4k reais, about 700 dollars. Wich 150 dollars go to shopping and the rest is all mine to do whatever I want (just you guys have a comparrison tool, with the 1.2k that is left I could pay my rent and my cable tv, but my dad covers that so i have all to myself). And going on the heat of the moment, I made 2 credit card (thos easy ones to make, at a store or something) and I already had one, not to mention that, my dad send me the money to pay for my driving license test (we can only do it here at the age of 18, but last year I was kind of busy in college research and other stuff) the price of my driving license is 700 reais or 350 dollars and I spent all that money on other things, so I'm paying for my driving license in 5x of 170. My first credit card is ok, and I have 600 limit, but is all paid and fine. The problem is with the other 2: I'm on debt of 700 reais right now and my name is registered on some national credit agency. I managed to negotiate with the company so I would pay 100 reais and pay the rest of the credit card with 3x of 263. And the other credit card I would pay the 60 reais that I have to pay and wait for the next month bill.
So basically, what I want to tell you is, I'm in debt of around 350 reais for this month. I need to pay this month bill of the driving license ( with the interest rate it must be around 190 reais), I need to pay 1 of the portions of my credit card bill (100 reais) and 60 reais from the other credit card. 350 reais is my current debt. I have 390 credit on one credit card (the one that is paid with my salary, my salary is used to pay for this credit card) and 170 reais on my account right now. 
This needs to be solved this week, since my credit card debt and portion of driving license bill is 1 month late. :(
So after paying this debts I want to organize my finances and put everything on a sheet. 1.4k income - debts - some emergency fund deposit = what I can actually spend.
I would love some advice on what should I do. 

P.S. I really don't want to use all of the 390 limit that is left on my main credit card. So I guess I could do it like this: 170 on my bank account + 180 from my credit card limit to pay this debts. I really want to avoid asking for my dad's money since he doesn't even know about this other 2 credit cards and the diving license debt.

I've been kicking around the idea of going to teach English in Asia for a year, or maybe just traveling around and couch surfing, maybe WWOOFing. 

Could this be a bad idea (killing my career before it has started)? Sometimes I don't think I'm cut out to be a developer because I get so burned out from it. "
1j9aa2,2,2013-07-29,"She keeps saying that it was co-dependency, but she banged her coworker two days after kicking me out.",havetoleave,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1j9aa2/she_keeps_saying_that_it_was_codependency_but_she/,"I was with this girl on and off for about 5 years, mostly on, and we've lived together for about 2.  We've been very happy, though we've had a unique arrangement of her devising.  I come from a mid to lower middle class family and I was lucky enough to be blessed with a grant for my schooling as my family could never have afforded to help me with it.  She comes from a wealthy pair of divorced parents, both of whom give her $400 dollars a month, a total of 800 or so every month.  On top of that, we both worked as often as we could during school.  Since we were both full time in school and almost full time work, and we were in love, she wanted me to get an apartment with her where she would pay the rent and I'd help out where I could.  The money from her parents alone covered more than rent.  I have told her a bunch of time through the years that I never liked the situation, that I felt like a mooch and this and that. She would re-assure me time and time again that we were both working equally hard and that I didn't have to worry. Because we were in love, I was inclined to trust her. 

So that was five semesters straight ago and this summer has been my first off in all that time, and I recently started to work as an intern doing graphic design at a local magazine, working my shitty job and doing some volunteer work to fill up my summer.  She worked weekends and didn't do much with her time during the week.  

she turned 21 at the beginning of the month, we were so incredibly happy, we had a great time at the bar for her 21st and we got tattoos and everything.  It was beautiful and exciting again, and I was just about to start a new job where I would be doing graphic design pre-production for a new company full time.  I would finally be in a situation where I could comfortably split rent with her and my brother who also lived with us.  But something happened to her. 

She came home from work one day when I was working on some ad design for that magazine and she had asked me to do the dishes while she was at work, I did half of them as I was pretty busy and had a deadline to meet.  She gets home and immediately freaks about the dishes and then the conversation drifts into her telling me that she wants to be single, and of course my first reaction is to ask who it is that she wants, it was too sudden, she had to someone in mind and I asked her about this co-worker who I knew had a crush on her. She tells me its nothing like that. I talk her out of it, I tell her how much I love her and how I have just been busy with the internship, interviewing for a new job, working my current job, volunteering and working at the university near us teaching children about art to bring in some extra cash so I could help us go on vacation. I explained all of this and she calmed down.  

The next day it happened again. During the day she goes and visits a friend and comes back and wants to end things again, we talk more and she tells me that I'm dangerously co-dependent on her and that if I don't seek counseling its over.  So the next day I do some research on co-dependency and realize that she is the one that has it, I didn't tell her that, but she also did research the next day and realized the same thing. Though because of her ultimatum and my desire to help us work stuff out, I set up a therapy appointment for the following tuesday(not that she gave me the chance to get there).  In any case, in regards to the codependency, I didn't see it as dangerous, we just happened to be in a relationship, there is a fine line between co-dependency and love. I was not an alcoholic, I never beat her, I never hurt her, I encouraged every one of her endeavours though she never stuck with any of them, I encouraged her every time she wanted to do anything.  I loved and cared for her with all of my heart and brought her flowers when I could and made her notes and made her drawings and everything.  I didn't have much money but I tried to let her know all the time that I loved her and appreciated, respected everything she did for me.  But apparently it wasn't enough.

So I get offered the job, good money, full time everything, I was so excited, but she was already fading from me.  I leave early in the morning to fill out new hire paper work and come home to find her still in bed, I lay down with her and hold her until I fall back asleep.  I awake to an empty bed and a note on my computer telling me that she will be out for the rest of the day and that I have to move out by the time she gets home.  The home that her and I built for the last two years.  just pack up and go, like I was a fucking monster.  

So in a flood of tears and pains in saying goodbye to our two cats and all of our memories, I packed up and left in the midst of deadlines and job duties and volunteer responsibilities, on my bike with two bags of clothes, computer and art supplies, I crashed on my best friends couch.  

the next evening her and I talk, and for convenience sake, she decides to let me stay on the couch for the next week to get through my first week at the new job and teaching the kids. 

Its super sad being on your own couch, not ever having betrayed or hurt your partner, having given nothing but love and hard work to her, and having your hard work finally pay off in a new job, and just being shunned like a bastard.  I was blaming myself for it all, because I had been so busy, and didn't clean up as well as I used to, and leaving her alone too often, and my designs suffered for it.  

The monday after she kicked me out, she said she was going to go sleep over at her girl friends house to have drinks and talk.  the day after, I see the therapist, he helps me a lot, he tells me that I need to do my absolute best to not talk to her, to leave her be as painful as it may be.  

I came home early that day to hear her on the phone telling a mutual friend that I was manipulating her into staying in her apartment, that I was a good for nothing. 

Fuck, but here is where I figure it all out.

I shouldn't have done it, but I had a right to know.  I snooped on her facebook, I looked at her private messages.  I found out that that night that she said she was going to sleep at her girl friends house, she actually slept at that co-worker that I was worried abouts place and they had sex 'several' times.  And her exact phrasing was ' I slept over at that co-workers place'  so the friend that she was talking to knew exactly who this was and they must have talked about it prior to the break up even.  

My hands went numb, my world froze, my dreams of reconciliation were shattered and I was terrified, I talked to my support group and got some advice and then I went on a furious run straight up bunch of hills and screamed and shouted and surely looked insane.  but I had to wear myself out before I talked to her about it.  

She denied it over and over again, saying that she didn't sleep with anyone, and then changing it over to that she didn't 'cheat' on me.  She was rolling with the technicality that we had broken up though I hadn't even moved out yet and she had already moved on. She kept telling me I was a piece of shit and that I needed to leave and then she moved on to attacking my psyche, telling me that she doesn't love me that I owe her everything and she doesn't owe me anything.  That I'm an unsuccessful irresponsible bag of shit who acts like a child and need her to be my mommy.  Saying that this dude that I was worried about had nothing to do with this.  She has a thing for trainwrecks, a thing for people she can care for and try to 'fix' and she moved on from me to a thirty year old veteran alcoholic with PTSD.  Talk about keeping with a pattern.  

She now keeps telling me and her family and friends that I am just manipulating the situation to make it seem like it wasn't my fault and that all that it is is that she needs time to work on herself and her co-dependency.  She even messaged my dad to tell me that I was out of control and that her sleeping with that co-worker has nothing to do with any of this.  

But I know better.  I want to be so mad and yell at her and make her hate herself.  But I don't, because I love her. I love her so incredibly much.  She has been trying to break me down, trying to hurt me and make me hate myself.  But this is on her, she left me to get some dick.  Some dick that I was worried about, some really unhealthy and potentially dangerous dick.  

I secede that we had our issues.  Dishes, cleaning, communication (on her part), our sex life could have used some work. But in a committed adult relationship, those are normal things, things to be worked on over time.  But she couldn't help her desires and just wanted me to vanish so she could pounce and get some dick that wasn't mine.  

Now she is all uppity about her feminine rights, now its her vagina, and I can't have any of it, thats what she told me.  

She is not the woman that I loved less than two weeks ago.  She now is blaming me for her unhappiness, for her anxiety, for her depression.  Though I did my best to help her with those things, I never pushed it because I suffer those same things and know that pushing her would never help.  I just love her so much and scared for the way she did this.  

I have now moved out and am trying my best to not let this affect my performance at my new job.  I wish her the absolute best, and I hope to be able to have an open dialogue about all of this. but I need to move on and I need to not see or talk to her for some time.  

If anyone made it this far, thank you.  This has been the lowest point in my life, and any advice would be appreciated.  I don't want to be mad at her, but she has hurt me so bad.  

TL:DR I have no idea how to not blame myself and not hate her for this, I am still desperately in love with a woman who pushed me away without ever giving me the respect I deserve and lied to me about sleeping with co-worker two days post break up."
1j99rc,6,2013-07-29,"Brace Yourself, LDR is Coming.",[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1j99rc/brace_yourself_ldr_is_coming/,"So, I've been in a great relationship for a little while now. I moved to his city at the end of March, we met in early April, and after becoming fast friends, we started dating. I'm on medical leave for nursing school right now, and I had come to terms with the idea that I was not going to get to go back at the end of those six months, but with his prodding and support, I'm going back. 

I'm fucking terrified. 

I've been in an LDR before, and I swore up and down I was never going to do it again. Too bad the universe has a way of making you eat those words, huh? Last time it started as a long-distance thing and then we bridged the gap. That relationship didn't work out. This time I'm going from seeing him most days out of a week (including crashing at his place a lot of the time) to *maybe* seeing him on weekends, sometimes. At minimum, we're going to be at least an hour and ten minutes apart. To add to the fun, it looks like he'll be going out of state (or possibly out of country) for an internship. 

I don't know how to do this again. The last time I did this it started as an LDR, so we built our routines around that. I *know* I'm going to be a little shell-shocked at not having him around all the time. He's become my favorite person in the world to spend time with, and we do *so much* stuff together. I have a lot of anxiety about going LDR (what if he meets someone else? what if we start fighting all the time? what if, what if, what if?), and I tend to deal with my anxiety by planning. 

If you had about six weeks to prepare to go long distance, what would you do? So far, I'm making sure that I have a few/handful of pictures to keep and making him a jar of notes that he can dig into because I have hidden notes around his room throughout our entire relationship, and it makes me sad that I won't be able to do that anymore. If you had time to prepare, what did you do? What would you do differently? Anyone wanna give me a pep talk to get me ready to do this again? 

**TL;DR--Please help me remember how to be a good LDR girlfriend. Also, feelings.**"

new subscriber to this sub. Excited to learn from ya'll, and share my experiences, (and hopefully some fun photos as well!)

anyways, my first post:

my girlfriend (22) and I (32) have an amazing sex life, and we are already a tiny bit kinky. We are actually apart for the summer right now (im away on internship) but we will be back together again in sept.

shortly before I left we ordered our two first lengths of rope. Didnt really get to use them tho, sadly. 

Anyways, she is flying to meet me and drive back home with me, and when she gets here, I have a little bag of tricks for her. Got my rope, just ordered a riding crop, a pinwheel, a tickling feather, and a ball gag.... add a blindfold and a hotel room... fun!

Im planning on taking her through our first bondage, slave/master, denial/edging type of experience. 

shes gonna love it, im gonna love. Im pretty good at talking and being dirty and sexy anyways, so Im sure that left to my own devices we would be just fine, and have fun, but im also really into putting the work in to make it as amazing as possible...

so to get to the point, as I fantasize about this, i have some ideas about the vocal interaction that could go on as I tease,  torture, deny, and fuck her, but Id love some help!!

Ive tried watching videos online, but they are all super hardcore. Im looking to see the mental aspect of it in action. either through anecdotes, written stories, videos, whatever.

anyone know any sources?? or have anything to contribute at all?

when I go through it in my mind, im punishing her for leaving me alone all summer, and neglecting my cock, etc etc. I go through each body part, and punish each part etc. but Id love some more ideas and stuff... 

THANKS SO MUCH!!!

im sure shell let me post a non face photo of her amazing body all tied and redded up."

I'm 21, I have a GED and I simply don't know how to progress forward anymore. I have't made any significant advancements towards my life and professional career. Four months ago, I left the only thing  going for me at the moment.

It was a program called Year Up, through a local community college. Where they train, pay and intern you on Desktop Support (A+). It's WAY much more in depth than that description, but it ultimately geared you towards getting a decent job. Before I got accepted, I was finishing my GED and I decided to follow this path thinking it's good enough for me.

I quickly concluded and followed my guts, I did not wanted to go into Networking or Desktop Support. I want to make my ideas come true, through software. But here I am now, no job and no training...

I want a career that I love, that field is technology; more importantly it's software. I want to join the Web and Mobile platforms as a developer. I want to make between $60k to $80k...

I understand these things take time, but damn it I want to do something about it now, before I forget the clock is ticking and notice I'm in my 30's and I still haven't done nothing. I understand that some people are lucky enough to not go through college and learn everything on their own, but I'm not that guy.

I feel like I have no sense of direction, I'm hungry for something much more but nothing seems to stand out for me. Don't know where to go from here...No mentors, no friends, nothing to pull ideas from. I've read as much as I could, but my mind feels cluttered with so many options. I just don't know.

1jdpnj,110,2013-07-30,Confronting Confatcius: My Lumpy Subway Co-worker.,Lucius-Malfoy,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1jdpnj/confronting_confatcius_my_lumpy_subway_coworker/,"Sometimes, my dearly beloved muggles, sometimes you come across a lump of lard so pathetic you desperately desire to help them in their quest to find sanity. Sometimes, you listen to their cries of anguish, their excuses, and whence your patience wears thin; no more you can handle it and man the fuck up so they can follow suit. This was one of those times.


Since the dawn of my need to pay for university (no part-time during secondary because I wanted good grades, yo), at the ripe old age of 17, I've worked at Subway. I've worked there for nearly four years now, in different locations with different management. I wish I could say this summer I finally scored a government internship, but alas, history majors get the short end of the stick when it comes to those options.

Moving on; FPS, like other franchises, there are strict rules that must be adhered to at this beautiful sandwich establishment. Only, I ended up (in the first few months of my employment) with a manager that did not care at all about his job. Seriously. At all. If something was out of compliance, he would shrug and 'fix it tomorrow'. He was a 30-something Mormon biker who is doomed to work at that shithole forever, because his father owned about 10 stores. Working on salary and basically never getting fired/broke is hard to pass up apparently, even though I could tell it was with malice he donned that ugly uniform every day,

Mormon-Manager was pretty awesome actually, albeit quiet, and I only mention him because he literally didn't care what you wore, what you looked like, and most importantly WHAT YOU ATE.

&gt;Enter Confatcius, stage left. 

&gt;And stage right?..... oh wait.
 
&gt;He's taking up the whole counter, boys.

&gt;His belly is spilling into the marinara sauce, red alert, red alert!

&gt;Crisis averted, he licked it all clean.

You know what? Fuck greentext for most of this, green is bad for your sugah levuhls anyways.

Dubbed so is Confatcius, for his obsession with China (I swear he mentioned it 100 times a shift). Picture this, if you will:

A man of 37 years old, with crunchy brown hair; must have been nearing 400 lbs, and was 6'3"". Just one gigantic ogre of a person. Had that look, you know it; the one where you *know* he watched anime porn. And maybe kinky tentacle shit too. Probably way too much of it.

Confatcius wasn't in school or anything, doing what I did, working the mcjob to earn his way out. Because usually people who are older in those positions either a) have two jobs, 2) are in need of extra cash for x,y,z, or c) used to be a stay-at-home- ____. 

No, not Confatcius. He was waiting to get an in to go teach english in Beijing, I wish I were kidding. He had done so before three years previous through a college program he dropped out of it. After visiting the land of the dragon, he couldn't stand life in the true north strong and free. It was hard to find companies who let you go away twice, and he was looking all the time. For THREE years. 

&gt; Confucius say, it does not matter how slow you go as long as you do not stop.

To be honest, while explaining this over the internet sounds funnier, Confatcius was a really sad specimen. This isn't really going to be an epic of hilarity. There will be no part 2 (perhaps about a different co-worker).

Overflown with fatlogic, yes he fucking was, but aside that Confatcius was actually a very nice human being. He wasn't a hamplanet cause he had decent hygiene. And he was not an asshole; no. He was much worse.

Let me tell you with great sincerity that he was SO far lower than beta status I can't even come up with... FPS, he was an epsilon. If Aldous Huxley was ruler of the universe, he would have born him to be at the bottom in that brave new world. 

Every one of the co-workers who were dudes made fun of him, and he just laughed it off. Mormon-Manager constantly ignored his attempts at conversation because he was annoying. Confatcius was super friendly to all customers to the point where it was actually irksome, but he couldn't turn it off. He was really slow because of the attempts at small talk. Some people humoured him (or liked it, at least some regulars were nice), but there were so many times you could tell they were disgusted or put off. Bitchy teenage girls thought he was hitting on them by being nice, and giggled about it frequently, leaving him redfaced and awkward. 

I guess a lot of this doesn't have to do with fatties fatting, but it's relevant to how I came to tell him to pull himself together.

Confatcius wasn't loyal to his sub-habit. He had a job at A&amp;W (50s burger joint) as well, leaving him constantly eating. He would show up for work with bags of burgers and then go on a smoke break and devour a foot long steak sub with extra cheese and bacon, with 5 kinds of sauce. Contrary to popular belief, subway isn't honestly that healthy if you eat it every day; all meat is processed, and the sodium, oh my god, the sodium.

He'd get the munchies from the smoking (somehow, maybe he had spliffs and was always stoned) and came in and eat like THREE COOKIES and THREE BAGS OF CHIPS. These are things we are supposed to pay for, but generally he'd pay for one of each. No1curr.

I'm honestly surprised Mormon-Manager didn't fire him for all the food he ate. 

Everyday I had a shift, I had to work with him because I was unfortunate enough to be stuck with the 11am-7pm or 12-9pm piece-o-crap ones. Beggars can't be choosers. And he always closed.

I try very hard to get along with people at work as I love dicking around while I slice onions and shit, having a laugh instead of being silent. So Confatcius takes this as me loving him and always talks to me. Not in a creepy way, but a BFF!!!!!! kind of way.

And ladies, you know how we get in closed quarters when we're friends fo life. He spills his metaphorical guts to me, his rolls over the pants of life if you will, tells me ERRYTHANG. All the fat sordid details.

It's all pretty irrelevant to here to mention it all, but the way he talked about people and life was very discerning. His word filter went off as soon as we were alone together. This character....man Confatcius was such an interesting specimen of wisdom and ew. 

&gt; Loved telling me random factoids about Asia. (China has one time zone, didya know?)

&gt; Also loved reaching up for chip boxes so I could see he ass crack and puke into the cold cuts at the sight and smell.

Some gems from the mining shaft that was his mind:

&gt; 'I just want to settle down and marry a cute chinese girl.'
 
&gt;""I'm pretty sure that sweet onion sauce is good for you.""

&gt;""fate free honey mustard, yay!"" (proceeds to glob on half a bottle)

&gt;""OMG, Lucius-Malfoy, I downloaded some more Mandopop for you to hear! Didn't you love those 235333292 songs I e-mailed you?""

As a side-note: he loved to send me music for some reason. He thought i'd like Chinese pop music right off the bat. That's a thing. Like K-pop, or J-pop, whatsitcalled? I dunno, I listen to dirty punk music.

&gt; ""You know, in some Chinese villages, girth is seen as being wealthy. It's attractive.""

&gt; ""I didn't have any fries today!"" he says with glee while scarfing down a root beer float and 5 cookies.

&gt;""Fuck, i'm so thirsy after playing DDR with my roommates!"" Chugs Coke.

And my favourite, after telling him on the weekend I went running down the canal. (Rideau Canal for all the Canucks) :

&gt; ""I hate running, it's bad for me. I would never get healthy that way. Walking is pretty bad too.""

&gt;Walking is pretty bad too.

&gt;Walking is
 
&gt;[Walking??](http://i.imgur.com/nVFuTX3.gif)

All of the logic was ridik. However, most of the time I *knew* he was kidding himself when it was about weight or exercise. I could see it in his General Tao-lusted eyes. Because after a few weeks of working with him (he latched on pretty quick, as I was one of 2 girls there and didn't treat him like shit), he would complain about how he was fat.

Every day, whine whine whine. Scarf, scarf, scarf. The straw that slurped the soy-sauce laden won-ton soup for me was when he told me about his ex-girlfriend. They dated for a week (A WEEK; HE'S THIRTY FUCKING SEVEN) the year previous and she wanted to move in with him in his room to get revenge of his roommate who she fancied and was rejected. 

AND HE LET HER.

He fucking let her in, knowing she was using him. Still in love with her, she dumped him right away cause he was too fat for sex, or some bullshit reason. And he didn't take the hint then that she was a vile scumbeast. He apparently had lost 40 lbs since then, but he was still massive. Like I shit you not, he resembled a Buddha statue with more hair and less Azn features.

This poor, poor kid was still hopeful.

So I manned the fuck up and told him that he was being a doormat. 

&gt; Real knowledge is to know the extent of one's ignorance, Confucius say.


Confatcius, I said:

&gt; You are a nice guy. 

&gt;No, a NICE GUY doesn't mean - LISTEN TO ME CONFATCIUS -

He kept on interjecting, telling me he was friendzoned (serious guiuse, I was 17 and he was 37? Who talks like that irl?) for being a nice person. 

I took it up a notch and stopped using my gentle soothing voice, as generally it can get any man to stop and listen, but he didn't want me to pop that grease bubble of denial he was living in. 

So I lowered the octaves to 'serious'. I had to do it. Sometimes, I myself am 'too nice' because I don't want to hurt people's feelings. Sometimes, I am selfish and would rather stifle my thoughts so others can be happy with me than angry. But it seemed like he had no real friends outside of his Final Fantasy Online Crew, and to be honest, I had nothing to lose (was told he would be leaving soon) and would've felt guilty had I not explained to him how real life is. 

 I'm not proud, FPS. But I stared Confatcius down the way Mulan stared down Shan Yu and blasted him with some fat-free truth fire-works. I said (and though I remember this memory vividly, the words are not exactly the same because it was 3 years ago):

&gt;Listen to me. 

(Tone was super effective!) 

&gt;Confatcius, life is not some RPG game where you help the Princesses be safe from asshole guys and unlock vaginal achievements. If you want a nice girlfriend, you have to stop putting girls on pedestals and treating them like a majestic unicorn. Because there is a person with feelings underneath those boobs. 

&gt;Besides all that, your ex is not a nice girl, and any hope of you kissing her or romancing her is going to fail no matter what you do, or say. I'm sorry, but i'm right, and you know it. I know you do. 

&gt;You can't let people push you around the way you let the guys at work do, and probably every other person you speak to on a regular basis. 

His eyes began to become round, watery, but I forced myself to stare.
 
&gt;You're better than that. You deserve so much better than this. (hfw I said this told me he didn't believe me, broke my heart)

&gt;And, Confatcius. You know you're too heavy. I know you want to lose weight, but you aren't doing it right. I've tried to tell you to slow it down, same with FemaleCoworker2, but you can't seem to actually try it. If you want to lose weight, stop eating so many damn cookie and subs, and maybe go for a WALK once in a while. Or swim, something you *like* and can do. 

&gt;You also shouldn't lose weight for anybody but yourself, it seems like it's all for VileBitch, but I know it'll help with your confidence and girls if you do. You'll feel a lot better cutting out some sugar, and you'll have more energy. Maybe you can meet up with your gaming friends and get out of the house on your days off. (He never slept, I swear to god. How did he work 2 job and have time to vidya and send me music files?) 

He looked weepy now, and I didn't apologize, I told him I was only concerned for him. He needed to hear it.

And i'm afraid to say it FPS, but he didn't respond. Nothing.

I was actually hoping for a meltdown, or a ragedown, *something* to show me he wasn't too beta-delta-gamma-whatever to function. 

It was so awkward the next couple of days, he avoided me. Bare minimum conversation.
 
And then, miraculously for Confatcius, after standing the test of time, he scored a teaching job in Tianjin. Apparently that's why he was going to leave but it wasn't a sure thing so he didn't tell me (so he didn't look stupid I guess?).

I told him good luck the last shift we worked together, and he was actually bouncing with giddiness to go, actually handed me a genuine thanks, and munched on his veggie sub. Wait....veggie? VEGGIE? 

&gt;Did I get through???

No, I didn't. 

&gt;He didn't make it.

He added me on facebook randomly a few months later, after he was settled in. Told me he missed my company, and that I was the only person who ever took him seriously. While I was happy he acknowledged that, his profile pics of anime, statuses, pictures of memes and some from China (mostly mountains of food but also his students, awwww) showed he was still 15 at heart.

Seriously, I was rooting for him when he left, because he was so fucking happy to be leaving Canada. He was a good person underneath, I definitely saw it when he talked about his passion for teaching, and even just for his gamer pals and shit. I thought perhaps the culture shock he didn't apparently get last time would come for him and he'd understand why he was abrasive, and why he needed to change his habits.

Alas, I have since not heard from him in about 2 years, and he deleted his FB. FPS, now I am sad. I tell you with a heavy heart i'm sorry this doesn't quell any jimmies you might have. I hope he's married now to somebody who loves him and cooks him bowls of rice every night with oolong tea, extra sugar."

[What has been the most significant discovery so far?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jd005/we_are_engineers_and_scientists_on_the_mars/cbdfggr?context=5)|The results from our first rock drilling told us that the past environment, when that mudstone rock formed, was suitable for life.   The mudstone formed in an ancient river system or an intermittently wet lake bed that could have provided the chemical energy and other favorable conditions for microbial life, if life existed then. This ancient wet environment was not harshly oxidizing, acidic or extremely salty.  All the necessary chemical building blocks were available.   (JC) 
[If conditions were good for life why do you think there has been no hard evidence found yet to show that life did exist there in the past?

The instruments were selected to meet the objective of characterizing environments and searching for habitable environments.  It has been successful in doing that.   (JC)
 |Over millions of years the water evaporated because the atmosphere got too thin to support it in liquid form. Mars does not have a global magnetic field the way Earth does, which helps shield the atmosphere from stripped away by the sun's damaging radiation. So while there is plenty of CO2 and H20 ice, no liquid is possible.  If life arose on Mars, it would have been millions or even billions of years ago, and preserving evidence of life for billions of years is very hard.  So the evidence could be there and we haven't found it, or life didn't arise. We have to find out! - SM.
 |Much of the water has been lost to space (stripped away by the solar wind) and some of it is now frozen in polar ice and ground ice at high latitudes.  Some water is bound in minerals.   (JC)

[What type of fuel does Curiousity use?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jd005/we_are_engineers_and_scientists_on_the_mars/cbdg02w?context=5)|Curiosity has an MMRTG that provides about 100W of power continuously along with a Lithium Ion battery that has ~80 AHr capacity.   THat's enough energy to keep us awake and heating / operating for about 6  8 hours per day depending on what we're doing, and providing power for us to sleep the rest of the time (yes, we need power to sleep as well!) - JHT.

 |We appreciate your question and we're glad you like the personality! Curiosity had the benefit of learning a lot from a previous Twitter  account for @MarsPhoenix (2008). It was obvious during @MarsPhoenix that using first person was the best way to go.  People were more responsive to the first people and it was easier to fit tweets into 140 characters. Curiosity is a mashup of personalities from three of us working together to do the posts each day. We want to make it fun but educational and interactive.  - VM

The women in the room say the 10 to 1 ratio may have been true at their universities, but it's not the case at JPL.

I majored in Mechanical Engineering but any science, engineering, programming job would be an option on the technical side. - MR.
 |Update: Hi Everyone, I'm so glad there's so much interest! Definitely check out or online applications: [Link to careerlaunch.jpl.nasa.gov](https://careerlaunch.jpl.nasa.gov). Read through job descriptions and see what requirements there are for the types of positions you are interested in. That may help you decide on a major. As a high school or college student you can apply for internships or co-ops. There are several hundred summer interns on lab right now. I've met a few high school students but college students are more common. Look on the career launch website, Space Grants: [Link to www.jpl.nasa.gov](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/education/index.cfm?page=35)  or SURF programs: [Link to www.surf.caltech.edu](http://www.surf.caltech.edu/.)
 |From an engineering side, it is common for employees to get hired on with a Bachelor's or Maser's degree. Higher degrees are more common on the science side, though you see a mix of everything. It is also fairly common for co-ops and interns to convert to full-time employees so I really recommend looking into those options. I myself did 2, 6-month long co-ops before I started full time. It was a great way to see what the job entailed and make connections that would help me get a full-time offer.
 |For those of you mentioning Purdue, I know many Purdue Alumni working at JPL. Cornell, RPI, Caltech, Stanford, Georgia Tech, and Cal Poly Pomona are popular but people come from all over. I graduated from Northeastern University with a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering.

 |Fascinating results or pictures of beautiful scenery can provide a sense of excitement, awe, and wonder in the public, making them more interested in learning about ""how things work"" and could encourage more young people to be interested in science and engineering, causing some of them to change career paths.   This is important because science and technological innovation are critical to our economic prosperity and national security.  Results from space missions can provide positive news that makes us proud of what humankind has accomplished, and shows the world that we’re still interested in exploring new frontiers and learning more about how the Universe works.  The Curiosity mission has contributions from 8 other countries (Spain, Russia, France, Canada, Germany, Finland, Mexico, Switzerland) and joint efforts like this can help bolster international cooperation.

 |For me landing was the most intense moment. We all gathered together with all the team members who had put so much into this mission that we were on the edge of our seats waiting to hear how the 7 minutes of terror would end. The feeling when we got that first photo back of the wheel on the ground was one of the greatest feelings in the world - MR.
 |For me it was getting ready for launch - I worked on the Cruise ops team before getting to support Surface and that was the first big deadline where we had to be ready or miss the opportunity for another 2 years! EH.
 |On Sol 200, we had a hardware problem on the rover that then caused the software to not work properly.  After looking at the data, we decided the safest thing to do would be to swap to the back-up computer that didn't have the problem.  We did this as soon as we could by getting a large (70m) station over Madrid and sending hardware commands that bypassed software to swap computers.  We then had to wait the round trip light time (~ 30 minutes at the time) to get the signal that it had all worked fine.  It did and now we are on the back-up computer!  JHT.
 |For me, waiting for the MastCam picture of material in the scoop from our first drill hole in the John Klein rock in Yellowknife Bay was pretty intense.

Originally I wanted to be a DBA (my degrees are BS in CIS and MS in IS), fell into the programmer role through an internship.

At my current work environment we don't have any DBA's and the programmer do all the DBA work.  In addition I have been to relevant trainings.  So I think I am qualified to apply to some of the DBA postings I have been seeing.

My questions are

*  How should I setup my resume?  Should I only speak about DBA type work or should I include analyst/programming examples.

* I only have had 1 job since graduation, should I list education and work first, then fill the rest of the page with relevant accomplishments?

*  Also for sites like Indeed the couple of postings I have seen only had a spot to attach my resume, should I include a cover letter in the file or not send one?  Most of the posting I see are through hiring firms.

I used it last year at a career fair and got 6 interviews for internships (which led to 5 eventual offers).

One recruiter (from IBM) cringed at the 2nd page, but then suggested that if I have a two page resume to duplex print (front and back) rather than using a staple as I had done at that particular career fair.  
 
the concept- I am a computer science student. I have designed a resume which looks like a computer program. The header of the resume is designed to look like a program being compiled and executed, whereas the rest of the resume then looks like console output. The design is very clever for my technical field, as pretty much every recruiter I have given my resume to will instantly recognize the theme I am going for, and I am very often complimented on the design.  
 
the issue- I am a very active college student, I am involved in several on campus clubs, a teaching assistant, and have a fair amount of professional experience (both internships, campus jobs, and a previous career I began before I returned to school) which quickly consumes a lot of space on the resume. Even after drastic chopping of extra wording and entire sentences, my entire work history falls onto the second page of the resume.  
 
Am I severely crossing an expected boundary here, or does my awesome design and considerable work history make up for the fact that the length is unorthodox?"

So I am looking for some suggestions by more learned men/women, to help me out here.

* Should I cancel my internship without shipping a final product, which I can add to my resume, something I worked my ass off in the summers ?

* Should I stop working on my side projects, which is something I really really enjoy doing ?

* I surely can't ignore my college education, so that is out of the option.

1jcutm,25,2013-07-30,"On the tv show ""Scrubs"" JD is a figment of Turk's imagination (repost from /r/FanTheories)",spewtoon,ShittyFanTheories,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyFanTheories/comments/1jcutm/on_the_tv_show_scrubs_jd_is_a_figment_of_turks/,"Feedback from /r/FanTheories was rather critical, so lower your expectations and read this:

So we all know and love ""Scrubs"". As a joke I told my friends I thought JD was an imaginary character, but the more I thought about it, it seems plausible.

""Scrubs"" is portrayed as a show following new doctors, but it is actually a show about Turk coping with a new, high-stress job. He leaves college and starts up as a surgeon in a struggling hospital. Unable to quickly make a name for himself, he invents JD as an imaginary friend. Whenever Turk is in trouble, he imagines JD having a good time to cheer himself up; whenever Turk is bored, he imagines JD going on an adventure to amuse himself; when Turk gets married, Carla gets annoyed with JD ""living"" with them, but this is easily explained as Turk's psychological rationalization of Carla's reaction to Turk talking non-stop about a made up person.

In the pilot, when Turk and JD meet Elliot, Turk asks (in a sexually interested way) ""Are you medical or surgical?"" When Elliot says she's a medical intern, Turk gets a little sad because his ""in"" with her is now gone. So he imagines JD hooking up with her, to fulfill Turk's desire of sexual conquest, but only vicariously through fantasy.

During the season of Turk's wedding, a running theme is the stress of planning a wedding. JD once again becomes an emotional outlet. While Turk is bogged down in DJ reservations, tux rentals, and wedding invites, JD is still living the single life, and still hooking up with new, hot women.

When Turk's career does not progress as quickly as he wants, JD gets a promotion. Except despite the position being intended for one person and Elliot getting the job, JD gets the job too, something that is highly unusual for any job. However, if Turk were imagining JD, he could give JD any job he wanted.

The show also offers no reason behind Janitor tormenting Turk. It shows the story behind JD getting hassled, but if we accept that JD is imaginary, then we know that Turk actually initiated the pranks, and with no justification. That last part is important, because it also explains why Janitor's retaliation seems so mean. It's not that he's borderline insane and hassling young doctors; a young doctor began pranking him out of nowhere, and then yelling about someone who doesn't exist as his rationale.

And finally, the ultimate sign of JD existing in Turk's mind, is JD's baby. As a delusional person, Turk imagines JD but as his best friend. So he naturally identifies with JD. This goes to an extreme when JD has a child. Turk has gotten married and has a daughter, but JD as stayed single. Once a family man, Turk's mindset becomes very far removed from where it was as a single bachelor, rooming with his bestie. Unable to imagine what single guys do anymore, and also unable to have JD marry anyone since he isn't real, JD suddenly fathers an unexpected baby to make his life more similar, and easy to imagine, to Turk's. Hell even after JD's baby is born, the mother is rarely seen.

So I posit, therefore, that JD is a delusion of Turk."
1jcs83,11,2013-07-30,Melody,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jcs83/melody/,"I guess it began when I was 6. It didn't feel like anything 'started' at the time, but it was at that age I first experienced the melody. I should note, the only reason I know these events aren't a fabrication my memories assembled is the recent dreams I've had, but we'll get there.


When I was 6 years old, my little brother and sister, twins, had just been born. Up until then I had been sharing a room with my older sister, 8 years old. But when my brother and sister arrived, they took our room and my sister and I had to sleep in the living room. If you were anything like me as a kid, you know that this was *awesome.* My late nights often consisted of repeat viewings of the Jamie Foxx Show, laid out on the floor with my toes perched on the TV power button, ready to shut it off ninja-style before my parents were any the wiser.

Besides the obvious benefit of late night TV, something about sleeping in the living room made night time not so scary. After all, mom and dad were right in their room down the hallway, ready to save me from any evils my imagination plagued me with. I felt safe.


A few months after the twins were born, my parents built my older sister and I rooms in the attic. I hated those rooms, and was happy to go when I turned 18 and left for college. The room had ample floor space, but the ceiling was angled with the roof, and only 5' tall at the highest point along the middle of the room. The only window was at the far end of the room opposite the door and was claustrophobically small. Everything was new and scary, and I longed for the nights when my parents were right around the corner.


My new room made my almost nightly trips to the bathroom a dreaded routine: creep quietly downstairs so I don't wake my parents, use the bathroom and finally sprint back up the stairs and into my room without looking back at the beasties I was sure were nipping at my heels. 


So on the night in question, I woke up with my bladder ready to burst, but it wasn't what woke me up. Instead, I'd been roused by the sound of a very soft, gentle lullaby-like melody. I remember upon waking up feeling a comforting warmth wash over me. I reasoned that if music was playing, one of my parents was likely awake, which meant that no monster in the world could touch me. Not even bothering to turn lights on at this point, I practically danced with the music to the bathroom. I did my business, but noticed on the way out that my parent's room was absolutely dark, and, thinking back on it now, the music didn't seem to be coming from there anyway. A little scared, I walked into my parents' room and gently shook my mom awake.


""Mama? I think you left the radio on.""


She rubbed her face, sighed and still wasn't awake enough to say more than 'what ra- what?' 


""Somebody left their music on... it's pretty piano music.""


And it *was* pretty. I didn't and still don't know the tune, but whatever it was had a profoundly... fundamental familiarity the significance of which I didn't and still don't understand. 


My mom assured me everything was turned off, and insisted there was no music. I tried to convince her, but she just sent me off to bed. I decided I'd just try to go back to sleep, because the music didn't seem too loud and I was very tired. Of course, I was scared to walk around the pitch dark house with my parents asleep, and so I ran as fast as I could. When I got to  the stairs, I stubbed my toe and 'fell up' the stairs onto my elbows and shins. Pain shot through my body, and as if to reflect my agony, the music I'd been listening to changed to organ music so loud that it filled every inch of me. I couldn't get up off the stairs and so I screamed, more scared than I'd ever been. 


My parents came running to me, inspecting me for scrapes and bruises. I was hysterical, crying about the piano music and asking them to turn it off. My parents were helpless until my sister turned on the light at the top of the stairs, and the music finally stopped. I cried and cried, finally finding sleep at the foot of my parents' bed. 


I had frequent night terrors as a child, but nothing this severe. My parents remember it as the night my terrors began, but it seems like more to me. Anyway, I eventually grew out of them like any child. I suppose anything could have caused my hallucinations, assuming that's what they were. My parents owned an old piano, and we had this creepy painting of a church on the living room wall... but neither of those gave me the feeling I got from that tune. Frankly, they seem too obvious and cheesy to really be the source of my horror. This is still a mystery.


___________________________________________



So I eventually outgrew my night terrors and had a pretty normal life, until now. I moved out at 18 and headed to college. This fall will start my 3rd year at university, and for the summer I'm staying at my parents' house while I work. I've been sleeping on the couch most of the summer. My mom kept apologizing for storing stuff in my room, but I didn't mind. I didn't want to sleep in there anyway. Yesterday, unfortunately, my dad surprised me by cleaning it out. 


I haven't had night terrors, or even especially bad nightmares since I was a kid, but last night has me shaking just thinking about it. 


The dream began as if I'd woken up normally. I got up, showered, got dressed, brushed my teeth, ate breakfast. I got to work and sat on reddit until it was time to leave and then headed to my friends' house for beers and a blunt. Frankly, I was having a good day at first. It was dark when I left my friend's house and things started getting weird. I tried to turn on the radio but it wouldn't play, and all my mirrors were matte gray, with no reflection. I made it home and the second my house was in view, the melody began. I hardly recognized it at first, but when I did I got uneasy. Each movement that took me closer to the house seemed to increase the music's volume. The closer I got the door the more I felt like I shouldn't be there... like I didn't belong, even though this was my childhood home.


I walked in and by now the music drowned everything out. My parents mouthed words, but all I heard was my own haunting lullaby. As I finally headed to my room for bed, the music got louder. When I touched the doorknob, the piano again became an organ and seemed to swallow me up.


I swung the door open and looked at my bed. There, lying asleep was...me. Exactly as I'd gone to bed last night. I inched closer toward myself, fascinated to see my own face without a mirror. I got to the side of the bed when a floorboard creaked beneath my foot. The me lying in bed jerked violently awake and stared directly at me. At that same instant, I jerked awake from the dream and found myself in bed, staring at the spot where I'd just been standing in my dream. No one was there. I was alone. But my door was open, and I was sure I'd closed it last night. 


Now I suppose this could just be a dream. It isn't crazy to think my brain would call on past horror in a dream, especially when I'm back in a familiar place like I am. 


There is something about this tune, though... I know it, but I couldn't reproduce it if I tried. It seems somehow... basic. Primal. I can't describe it. 


I'm at work now, and even my coworkers whistling makes me jump. My boss thinks I'm high or something and if anyone knew I was on reddit, I'd probably get some shit, being the intern. I might just be scaring myself, but it doesn't feel like it will stop here. Something is coming."
1jcp5i,6,2013-07-30,Questions About Peanut Butter and Oats,the_gv3,nutrition,https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1jcp5i/questions_about_peanut_butter_and_oats/,"So I have two questions here.  As the title points out, one about peanut butter and one about oats.

A little background, I'm living on an intern's salary with lots of loans that I'm currently paying off so my budget for food (or anything) is really low.  I'm not trying to lose or gain weight, I just want to maintain although I would not be upset if I ended up losing 5 pounds or so (6', 185 lbs).  I exercise at least 4 times a week and live a fairly active lifestyle outside of that.

Number 1:
Is peanut butter a good (or okay) thing to have in your diet?  It is an easy way for me to buy some cheap food that lasts a long time.  I also happen to love it.  Peanut butter and celery sandwiches are one of my favorite meals!  I know there's probably a lot of added sugar in regular peanut butters, but is it an okay thing to have in my diet?  Are there better alternatives that are still decently priced?  I know there are some organic peanut butters out there that are probably much healthier, but they come in small jars that cost twice as much.

Number 2:
What is the deal with oats?  I see a lot of people on this sub and others that just *love* oats.  Are they packed with nutrients?  Should I have these in my diet?  Also, I have seen people mention steel-cut oats and other types of oats.  Mostly this is in relation to instant oats, and people are saying stay away from instant.  I did some research, but really only found info on what steel-cut oats are, not really why they are better for you.  So, why are they better for you than instant?  Where can I get steel-cut oats and are they reasonably priced compared to instant oats?

Thanks in advance for any info!"

I realize this isn't as pressing as a lot of the issues on the sub, but I could use some impartial opinions. 

In April of this year, I deferred a final exam to August because I was feeling overwhelmed. As August gets closer, I find myself with a bit of a dilemma - it's important that I study for this exam, but with the way my schedule is currently set up, I would have to study during the night, which I don't think would be as effective as if I were to study in the morning or early afternoon.

So, my courses of action are either: 1.) leave work on the 9th of August and study unperturbed for a week, or 2.) leave work on the 15th of August and study a bit less effectively. It comes down to an academic versus a financial decision, and all the friends I've asked fall on either side of it.

I was just wondering what some anonymous folks had to say about it because I'm having a rough time coming up with a choice.

Thanks!

EDIT: Some additional information. I'm 19 and this is a typical intern tech job. Not a massive amount of money/week, but money nevertheless."
1jc7ez,3,2013-07-30,How to tell my mentor at my internship about it?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jc7ez/how_to_tell_my_mentor_at_my_internship_about_it/,"I'm faced with a problem that I would want to fix this week if possible. I did a summer internship at a company where I worked on my graduation project. The project was to make a web application and then write a paper about it. The company that I worked for is a sister company of the company that I did an internship for about a year and half ago. So I'm pretty known there. They know me pretty well personally (except for the stuff I haven't told them) and I'm pretty fond of the people there. The project that I did wasn't really a success and I will talk about that a bit later in my post. The project before that went a lot better and I felt competent about myself. The company even hinted multiple times at hiring me after I graduated. However after finishing my graduation project, I haven't really talked to anybody from the company or been there since.

Before I left, my mentor at the company was expecting me to upload some files (the work I did there) on to the company servers. I haven't done that because I was scared of doing so. Not only was the work incomplete, but I was worried about the quality of the things that I did finish. The main obstacle I faced during my project was the communication with important stakeholders. I couldn't get to anybody important to give evaluate or give feedback on my work. My project really depended on it. Because they were people who initiated the project and wanted certain functionality built in. I cannot build anything if I don't know what they want. Hence why the work is incomplete and I'm scared to show it. I tried everything in my power to make the end product as good as possible despite having limited communication. I didn't want to work too much on assumptions. So after 10 weeks of trying to reach people through email, phone or even approaching them directly, I barely managed to get a hold of somebody to evaluate my work. I finished the project with whatever limited information I had. Nobody really evaluated my work either, so I don't know if I even made the right things.

Now that my time there is over, I'm stuck with a guilt that it's my fault for the project going this way. I could have done a lot more in the time given and of better quality. I know I can't blame myself, because I really tried. I cannot make things if I don't know the wishes of the company. But I still feel worthless and scared.

I feel scared showing my work or getting in touch with the people from the company. Last time I spoke with my mentor he mentioned about continuing the project during the summer holidays. The problem is that I haven't been in touch with him for over 3 weeks now. I'm afraid to call him or even open my email now. 

I don't really know what to do. Do I tell them about my problems or do I keep avoiding them? Avoiding them would lower my chances of graduating. Because I need the mentor of the company to come and defend me during the assessment of my graduation paper. I don't want to make it sound as if I'm making excuses for not showing up. I'm afraid on how he will react if I let him know. I don't want to leave on bad terms either. What can I do?"

1jbx4e,2,2013-07-30,"Best choice of email address/domain to put on resume for entry-level software engineer, web developer, etc? (also: should I include unrelated jobs on my resume?)",scootey,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jbx4e/best_choice_of_email_addressdomain_to_put_on/,"Hey /r/cscareerquestions:

Two questions. First is rather long.

**First question:**

**TL;DR:** what sorts of domains/email addresses would be best (or worst) to put on a resume or otherwise give to an employer?

I have a ""personal"" email account that I use for people I know well, and many of my online activities. Throughout college, I treated my university (.edu) email address as the one I used for academic and career/job-related endeavors. But now that I'm out of college, chances are that I won't have it forever. And I probably should have just used my own email to begin with.

Anyway, I decided to get my own domain name for the email/website that I give to prospective employers or otherwise put on my resume. Here are the ones that I own and am deliberating amongst:

* *Lastname*.org. It's a relatively uncommon surname, so there were some domains available to register.. Other available possibilities include *Lastname*.net and *Lastname*.us. (*Lastname*.com is taken by an email service that's had it forever and probably won't be dumping it anytime soon.)

* *FirstnameLastname*.com. This is a bit longer than I'd like, around 15 characters or so. Tedious and boring in a sense, too.

* *Firstname*.im. This is what I'm leaning towards. My first name is very common in the US and unavailable on almost every TLD, but I managed to get *Firstname*.im. The registration isn't even that expensive (compared to some TLDs) at $15-20/yr. The .im extension may seem obscure to some; it's the ccTLD for the Isle of Man. The "".im"" TLD seems fairly marketable for English speakers; think ""i'm/I am"", ""IM"", etc. But might the less tech-savvy be suspect of an unfamiliar domain extension? Might I be seen as less ""professional"" than with a typical .com/.net/.org?

    * Also, is it a bad idea to ""market"" myself with my first name like this in the first place?

* *Other possibilities?* Would it possibly be better to use a name that is not related to my real name? Maybe come up with another name to use for email, my ""professional"" portfolio, etc, and use that instead? Or just use a username that I've been using all along?

Also, I would probably end up with an email address like: *Firstname*@*Lastname*.org, me@*FirstnameLastname*.com, me@*Firstname*.im, *Firstname*@*Firstname*.im, etc. Should I avoid ""me"" and the like? Or suggestions on how others do this?

**Second question:**

**TL;DR:** My last job was a customer service job (as an upperclassman), although I had a couple of IT/programming-related jobs before that. Should I list the customer service job on a resume under prior work experience?

Might it be okay/worthwhile to put jobs that aren't related to the field on my resume as previous work experience? Most recently I held a customer service job (gotta pay bills ya know!) But prior to that, I had an IT/programming internship and part-time job that are definitely worth mentioning. I'm thinking I might put the recent service job on for the sake of completeness/full disclosure. And fwiw I left on good terms so I have no worries about them saying bad things about me.

But if it's typical to exclude non-related jobs from ""work experience"", I may consider that. One concern is that they may question why I was working a retail job as a CS upperclassman rather than finding some kind of work coding or etc. On the other hand, I suppose some might find it beneficial if they see it as an indicator of decent people skills or something (although I'm doubtful how many do see it this way). Any ideas?

**Thanks all!**"

Using massive datasets to make better decisions about what future products to introduce and what these products should have included in them to make them profitable.

What I seek from this post, is a better sense of what I would be doing in a couple career fields involving data science. I looked online for several applications but due to past several events (NSA spying), everything seemed to directed about data mining and the government.

What do I do now?,IdeallyRelaxed,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jbk1i/graduating_with_a_degree_in_a_major_that_only/,"I'm into my senior year of college now, and I am now realizing that I have spent the past 3 years of my life studying a major that will most likely get me nowhere in the field that I want to get into, programming. After spending the past couple of months interning under a designer doing some creative work while also doing some work on their website, I have realized that I absolutely detest the creative work and I love the coding work. I like to create more than I like to be creative.

My major taught me pretty much the most generic overview of coding in some basic markup languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.) and designing websites. At the time, I thought it was genius because I was going to be able to design and implement the websites that I created. After I had my realization at the internship though, I realized that this was crap and spent most of the rest of my summer learning everything on codeacademy.com. After doing that, I realized that I simply just learned the syntax of the different languages while being taught the basics of coding over and over again.

Now that I want to get more into computer science, how do I do it without completely breaking the bank?

1jbfwm,1,2013-07-29,Boyfriend [20M] of almost two years just broke up with me [20F] before I study abroad.,inalimbo,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jbfwm/boyfriend_20m_of_almost_two_years_just_broke_up/,"
Wall of text, sorry guys, looking for advice! My boyfriend called quits on our relationship last Friday. We have been having problems this past semester as a long distance relationship, minor ones, but they were made worse by mutual stress and a lack of communication. The idea for this summer was for me to move in with him just for my summer internship. I asked him over and over again if he was certain it was a good idea, because I had my doubts, but he reassured me that things would be fine. I moved in. 

His university made him move into a small single in a dorm as temporary housing before he moved into his apartment for the year. We shared the space with difficulty, but we managed. The main problems came from him distancing himself from me, the same problem we had the past semester. Previously, he would blow off phone calls and claim to be too busy to return them (something we would do all the time, previously), and would instead watch movies with friends. I understood at first and didn't let it go, but it became a repetitive thing when it previously wasn't. There also was the problem with him being too busy to say simple things like ""I love you"", but he would assure me he still did, etc, that things were fine. This summer was my last summer before I head over to Spain for four months, a point of concern for both of us. I was worried maybe Spain was making him nervous and causing him to act like he was, but when I asked him about it, he wouldn't talk.

I'm used to being open and honest with him, and vocalizing concerns if I have any so we can nip problems in the bud. But the more we lived together, the more he distanced himself. He would work late and I would barely get to see him; I would ask him to go running with me, but he wouldn't. He seemed too busy for anything. The more he needed space, the more I clung. I know that was a huge problem on my side, and at the time I didn't even realize what I was doing, but it happened. 

I would mention to him some things I wanted for us to do this summer, like go to the beach or go mountain climbing. He blew me off for the beach and went with his friends one day, and then he ignored my request to go mountain climbing because his friends invited him to go (I got an invite last minute, so I went). Last summer, we had done little adventures on our own so I was expecting similar things to go on this summer, since I would be leaving for such a long time. They never happened.

The distancing thing got worse, and eventually I would be so upset that I would try to talk to him, get nothing, and cry. I tried to keep it together and work through the problems by giving him space and so on, so I made plans for July 4-5th, since he was going home. This same weekend, his friend S (female, a year younger, and I love her) invited him and a few others up to visit her in another nearby state. S had been on campus all summer and I learned that while I was at work, she would visit my bf and they would get lunch and things together. S likes another boy from her hometown, so I wasn't worried about her sneaking around with my guy, but it made me uncomfortable. I was told by my bf that he was too busy to even text me at work, yet S would send me photos of him out to lunch (not knowing that each one hurt). I was told by my bf that he would not be going up that weekend, and I told him it was my last free weekend to spend with him. I work weekends to make money for when I return from being abroad – to visit him, ironically. So he understood that.

I found out the weekend is cancelled for certain reasons, okay, no problem. Then all of the sudden it is back on and he is going. What? I reminded him that he told me he wasn’t going, and that this was my last free weekend to spend with him. I thought we could try to repair some problems we’ve been having, since we’d have ups and downs. He became annoyed and argued with me saying that his decision “a month ago” shouldn’t be something he has to follow through with. I expressed that I blocked off this weekend in advance so we could do little adventures. He became angry, I let it go. I thought about it and let him decide what to do. I received an invitation last minute to join in on the weekend, but it felt weird, plus I was low on money and would not be able to afford the ticket to get there. I presented my bf with three options I could think of, open to hearing some from him: 1. He paid for my ticket and we both took the bus together to get there, 2. He didn’t go and stayed with me like he said he would, or 3. He left and I remained stuck in the dorm because I didn’t even have enough money to go home. 

Now I want you to know that my bf and I are open to reading each other’s texts and fb messages. It started as a trust thing, but I quickly became too attached to it. I hate myself for this. I was never so insecure before. But anyway, he chose to not go visit, and I asked if he was certain. He changed his mind and said we were going, and I said okay, but that he had to travel with me. Last minute he said he was ditching the bus and riding with a friend, leaving me to ride by myself with one of his other friends I don’t really know. I didn’t feel comfortable with it, I tried to talk to him about it, and he said his phone battery was dying and he wasn’t able to text. I was leaving for my friend’s the next morning and he had gone home that night, so I was alone. He left a tablet that had the same app on it as his phone and computer did, allowing access to his texts from all three devices. I, against my better judgment, read through his texts with S and saw that he had lied to me about his phone battery dying to ignore me, and he began to bitch me out to S.

I. like. S. very much. I have no problems with her. I just felt sidelined from his actions this past semester, this summer, and this was icing on the cake. I confronted him, he lied, we went on a break and I moved out. Moving out made things better for a time. He came to visit me one weekend and we talked. He visited next weekend, we talked some more, and I addressed how I was upset over his treatment of the weekend and how he smacktalked me behind his back. I admitted to causing problems that weekend, too, and I apologized to S about it (I had talked to her about wanting my bf to travel with me instead of going up with a friend because I felt uncomfortable) and I apologized to my bf. He told me he would not apologize, even though I was very hurt over the entire matter and wanted to just get past it. 

One thing lead to another and he broke up with me at his house. I sobbed, he held me and rubbed my back, and then I left. We talked sporadically since then. I deleted his number and stopped talking to him for days at a time. Today I reached out because I realized he still had some things of mine, and he only said “well you know where to come and get them”, which left me furious and he got pissed about how I was asking him to come home and return my things. Ugh.  

Reddit, can you offer any advice on dealing with this break-up and also give me your opinions on what went wrong? I know I messed up a great deal. There are things I left out because I forgot, so I can provide more info if you need it. 

Some other things worth noting:
- I highly encouraged my bf to talk to his friends when we were fighting to get an alternate opinion and just discuss. I even contacted S to see if she could approach him and open up that line of communication.
- We have had decent conversations since the breakup. Nothing too drastic or clingy, just “it will take time”,  etc. 
- HIS FRIENDS STILL TALK TO ME. ALL THE TIME. Since the breakup, S has reached out to me along with a few other friends to make sure I am doing okay, sending their well-wishes and offering to hang out soon. Two of his guy friends have been connecting with me on instagram and things like that and still liking my stuff. I was a good friend to his friends, I went out of my way to get to know them and be a person they can communicate with. My bf never did that for my friends. 

tl;dr – Boyfriend of two years breaks up with me before I leave for Spain for 4 months, we had a series of problems that got worse when we lived together briefly. Advice on dealing with breakups and what I should not repeat in future relationships?

1jbd9r,1,2013-07-29,DBA or CCNA? (teamcenter),Ramxi,ccna,https://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/1jbd9r/dba_or_ccna_teamcenter/,"So, recently i had an old friend of mine talk to me about a software that is that is pretty much making huge strides in the world of Database management and automotive management.  It goes by the name TeamCenter.  He gave me a rundown of the software on his huge 17inch laptop and he expressed to me the opportunities that TeamCenter holds within.  I have no knowledge of automotive car parts however he told me that TC requires specific DBA positions to operate the software efficiently and i would not have to touch anything related to engineering.  I would get my training strictly for DBA related material.  

My question put pretty simply is - will i have more opportunities in the future with TeamCenter or CCNA?  I couldnt think of any other place to ask this question so i came here.  As of right now, i only have knowledge of subnetting class B and C, RIPv1 and v2 on packet tracer.  Thats where i stand in terms of CCNA.

Whats worrying me is my friend who introduced me to the software doesnt even know that much about it besides the engineering aspect since he is a CAD designer at GM looking to learn more skills and make more money.  He will offer to give me lessons on the software for very cheap and will provide studying materials for me.  As i mentioned, TeamCenter is a fairly new software developed by siemens and companies are starting to jump on the bandwagon. 

I just dont know how good my resume will look without a formal degree in DBA management.  I have a bachelors in sociology and im taking community courses on CCNA.  Will i be able to apply for a job and just slap TeamCenter on my resume and expect a job or even an internship?  This could be a major move for me if i decide to move away from CCNA and dive into this DBA stuff.  I really need a second opinion on this matter and would really appreciate any input.

Figured I'd come here and ask.  Im hoping theres a DBA amongst this subreddit.  Thanks and sorry if i broke any posting rules. "
1jgh21,6,2013-07-31,What do I do if my boss told me he was going to fire me by the end of the week....but hasn't followed through?,mlh32,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jgh21/what_do_i_do_if_my_boss_told_me_he_was_going_to/,"More specifically, what are my rights?

Significant background:

* I've worked at my company for almost 10 years. Last year I applied for a promotion at a store 2 miles from my house. Got the promo, and was never trained for the position. Tried my hardest to learn ""on the job"" but there's a lot of SOP that gets really intricate, especially in my position, and I don't know all of the answers.

* I have an assistant who is also brand new to the job, from another department, also untrained. I was brought on, and one of my tasks was to get her trained to take over a position on my level within 6months. 

* I have worked for almost 7 out of the past 13 months without an immediate superior who, in most similar stores' cases, is there to train, help, direct, delegate etc. Someone had filled the position in February, but she works in our corporate offices 2 days (soon to be 3) out of every week. In my job performance failings (mentioned below) I had constantly asked her for help in how to improve, to which she shrugged her shoulders numerous times. 

* Two weeks ago, (7/16) my district manager pulled me into his office to tell me that my performance (specifically my quantifiable performance indicators) had not been where it should be, and that he would give me the option of: transferring me to a smaller store, offering me a voluntary demotion, or transferring me to a store 1.5 hours away from my house. 

* This was the first time I had been sat down and told of my myriad shortcomings. I had no idea that this type of conversation was on the horizon. Admittedly I knew I was falling short in some areas, because I didn't have the knowledge or experience to handle the majority of situations I experienced exclusively to this position, but in no way did I think that this lack of training would ever result in a performance-based transfer. I had requested formal training some half-dozen times over the past year, though it was never granted me due to payroll constraints. 

* (7/23) In our next meeting, I told him that I refused to move stores, as my poor performance was directly related to a lack of training for the position to which I was promoted. He said that refusal was not an option. I said that I refused to concede failure, as I am very hardworking, dedicated, and ready to take on the job (in my current store) with the fine-tuning that I need to succeed and otherwise I would be set up for failure. I indicated that if the company did not see fit to accommodate these requests, they would have to fire me.
* At this point, my DM said that as a salaried associate, I didn't have a choice, and that since I refused to move, they would be firing me later in the week. 

* Friday 7/26 at 4pm I still hadn't heard anything, so I sent an e-mail to my Regional VP asking for clarification on my situation. He was unable to advise me. All that he said was that my director of HR would be coming out this coming Monday (8/5) to sit down with me. I'm still not sure what that means. 

* Since all of this has transpired, I no longer feel any attachment for this company. I have already moved my wedding date twice, and prolonged graduation from college as a result of the endless hours I put in trying to do what is best for the store. The day that my DM told me I would be fired later in the week, I registered for college full time, and started looking for internships. Now it sounds like the company higher-ups are backpedaling. I feel that my DM spoke out of turn when he told me I would be fired. I have no intention of quitting (I want to collect unemployment until I find another job/internship, and to do this I must be fired) Now I worry that in my meeting with HR on Monday, they will say that they are not going to fire me, even though my subsequent actions were entirely based on taking my District Manager at face value, and acting as a person whose job was no longer viable. 

* P.S. All conversations (with the exception of the first one--I was totally blindsided by it) have been recorded in accordance with NYS wiretapping/recorded conversation law. 

* Do I have a case to demand termination? I have already made plans for myself with the understanding that I was effectively fired. I have worked too long and too hard to kowtow to a company that so clearly sees me as expendable after almost a decade of dedicated service. I now feel it is time to get my life in order, and in doing so, I would like to know if I will be able to receive unemployment assistance until such time as I am able to find appropriate work. 

tl;dr Apparently I am living the life of George Costanza.  "

Do you realize what you’ve done? Do you realize the horrible, unspoken impact you’re having on the self-esteem of girls all over the entire planet?  Are every one of your employees (none of whom look like your models or can afford your own clothes) so desensitized that they don’t see the truth about your business? 

Your stocks are falling, and what have you done? You’ve released a new line of thongs that spell things like “wild” and “call me” – for tween girls – for girls who look at your models with envy, who lie in bed at night, crying, wishing they were thinner, had more hair, had bigger breasts. Girls who, like me, have contemplated taking chain saws to their midsections, have scoured the web for “safe” ways to be anorexic, have counted every calorie, every pound. Aren’t you ashamed? Don’t you realize WHY your stocks are falling? You sell underwear at a huge premium to a consumer culture that is completely fed up with your bologna. I hope that this letter finds itself on the desk of someone other than the lower-level intern at whichever state headquarters it happens to travel to, because I’VE GOT A LOT MORE TO SAY!

Do you want to have more customers? Then start promoting body acceptance instead of body envy. Do you want to have women lining up for your newest promotions? Then feature models that are normal-sized. Stick-thin, muscular, pear-shaped, small-breasted, big-chested, full-bodied, REAL WOMEN should be the focus of your marketing.  We want to feel accepted, not ignored. We want to be that beautiful blonde on the beach – with full-on cellulite! We want to be that winged runway model – whose boobs naturally bob as she walks! We want to go into your stores and not feel cut down to size, with those underweight, dead-eyed, hunger-stricken and Photoshopped-to-hell fabrications gazing down on us. 

Please get real models! Like it or not, you have a certain responsibility in our society – you represent us at our most intimate, most vulnerable. And when one of my middle school students complains that her “thigh gap” is not as big as that of Heidi Klum, I feel like my heart has been punctured by a needle. As hard as I try, I can’t keep my anger from flowing out. 

Please provide role models that I can point to and say, “Look at this gorgeous creature, and look at the gap-less, luscious thighs! Look at how well she’s wearing that lace bra – see her confidence!” Be at the forefront of the new body war – don’t stand on the sidelines and watch our young girls sicken themselves to fit YOUR norm. 

That is all. 
Change your ways, or lose customers. Your choice.

I am looking for a junior web developer position or an internship.

When I'm not looking for a potential job, I am working on my second website. I have completed one web application and an online portfolio, both deployed on heroku. I can give links to that too.

I'm a canadian student entering my fourth (and final) year of SE in September.  My school isn't very well known for CS/SE so I want to do everything I can to ensure I get a good first job to build a reputation.

I have a decent amount of experience.  This summer I am a software developer working in a medium-sized agile team at a large, non-tech company.  I worked for the university as a software developer on a two month contract before I left for that internship (I'll probably be returning to the position is September).  The previous summer I was a software intern at a small healthcare IT firm.

Right now, I'm rebuilding my resume (based on the one from careercup), creating a personal website for myself, and improving my github.  I'm also updating my LinkedIn and started adding co-workers and classmates.  I had a couple interviews last year with the big guys (MS and AMZN) and got nailed on the technical stuff, so I've picked up PIE and CCI, bought a white board, and started working through the problems.  I've also become an executive at SE club at my university, to gain some volunteer experience.

What other things should I be doing that I'm not currently doing right now?  Should I be adding recruiters on LinkedIn and stuff?  Ideally I'd like to get a job in the states (higher pay).  My long-term GF is an american citizen and will hopefully be my green card, but she doesn't graduate until 2015 so in the interim I'll need an H1-B.

Thanks.

I'm a recent college grad, holding my B.S. in Business/Marketing from a decent California State University, meh GPA (3.06 overall, 3.3 in major, Dean's list student).

I have had a great paid internship in Product Marketing at a industry leader in semiconductor chip design &amp; fabrication (yep, that one).

I also have experience in Marketing research for a local business for my senior project, office/accounting/clerical work experience with good MS Excel skills, MS Office suite, etc. I have a good head for visual design &amp; concept.

I'm not a scrub(*edit: some redditors disagree*), I have good communication skills, I work well with others, enjoy learning and contributing in groups.

**Situation**

I am coming up against some very big roadblocks in trying to find career work in my field, Marketing, Marketing Analytics, Business Analytics, etc.

All the positions for Marketing, even entry level, require years of experience that I just don't have. I've had a number of interviews, never proceeding past an initial phone interview, no luck. They end up choosing ""more qualified"" candidates.

**Question**

What can I do to better myself, or prepare for a marketing career? Any books? Skills I should pick up? 

I'm not hurting for employment currently, I am launching a MFG startup that has solid potential, but it's a part time thing. I'd love to have a full time career in Marketing to round myself out better in addition to pursuing my business.

Any input from Marketing people? How do I get my foot in the door? I'm young, have a relevant degree, relevant experience, and have the burning desire to learn. I have that chip on my shoulder - I have everything to prove, I *want* to get in there and learn, contribute, be awesome in this field.

Going to be applying in London soon and could use some advice...",seointernship,bigseo,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigseo/comments/1jg3qp/people_who_own_digital_marketing_agencies_what_do/,"Hey everyone,

I've noticed there are quite a few users here who work for or own companies that deal with SEO / Digital Marketing. I am going to start applying for internships with companies that offer these services in London and could use some advice as to what you would look for in an intern. I'd like to get this right first time so any advice would be greatly appreciated.

So i'll basically explain who I am and what i'm currently doing.

-------------------------------------

- I graduated in 2010 with a 2:1 Marketing degree
- My final year dissertation was titled ""how small business websites can utilise online word of mouth"" which I received a 1st grade on.
- I learnt how to build websites using Joomla and know basic HTMl, CSS, and PHP.
- I've created a website centred around android games where I test a lot of what i've learned so far. This can be found here: http://www.topandroidgames.info/
- I currently do some online marketing work for a golf product called Golf-Grip found at www.golf-grip.com.

**With these two websites i've tested:**

**Keyword research / Competitor Analysis**

- I've read a lot of articles on Moz and other SEO blogs about keyword research. From what I understand you need to find a keyword that's low in competition, relevant to your objectives, and high in search volume. Before I created my android site I carried out a competitor analysis of the top 10 results for various keywords relating to the site idea. I used a free trial of long tail pro to analyse the results, looking at page rank, amount of backlinks, amount of juice links (backlinks from sites with high page rank), page title, meta descriptions, H1 tags. 

- I then did a content audit of all the competitors to see who was creating what and where the gaps for content were. I checked their social media pages to see what content was being produced and what was getting the most interaction.

**Content**

- I spoke to the android gaming community to find out what sort of content they wanted. This thread can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidGaming/comments/17bdrk/new_website_for_android_games_would_love_your/). I used these responses to shape each page around the needs of the targeted users in order to provide the most valuable content.

- I used google analytics to see what search queries people were using to get to my site once it was completed. I then built content around these keywords in order to satisfy the query and reduce bounce rate for those searches. For example [people were reaching this game](http://www.topandroidgames.info/battle-cats) through the search term [battlecats chapter 3 stage 48]. It turns out that a lot of players have difficulty beating this stage without spending money on in-app purchases. My page for this game didn't originally have a section addressing this, so I created one.

- I'm currently about to talk with customers of the Golf-Grip to find out a range of information about their buying process of training aids, what difficulties they have with golf, how golf fits in with their life, how they consume golf content, the information they want to see when searching for training aids, what their decision to start looking for a training aid was. I'll combine this information with keyword research to see if there are any pages relating to grip training aids I could potentially rank for.

**Link Building / Social Engagements**

- For my android site i've tested one-on-one marketing techniques to build a relationship with the people using my site. I've done this by recording personalised video messages to people who have commented positively on my site. This has led to them linking to my site on their social networks: [Example 1](http://i.imgur.com/7HAjknb.png) [Example 2](http://imgur.com/YdnQpF6). I noticed a rise in search ranking for my main keyword which I attribute partly to these types of links.

- I've also had some success with one-one-one marketing on twitter: [Example](http://i.imgur.com/lgH7JgV.png) [Traffic from twitter from these types of conversations](http://imgur.com/rNsHjxZ).

- For my work with the golf-grip site, i've managed to get 13 golf blogs / forums to write about the product and link back to the site through contacting them via email about the product (4 are in the process of being created). This has resulted in an increase in ranking for search terms like [golf grip] and [golf grip training aid]. The main reason this has worked quite well (around 6.5% success rate when contacting blogs) is because the product is good and provides a lot of value. I've been reading the effects SEO has on the entire company and how SEO should be integrated with each department.

- I've also recently been talking to a youtuber who creates golf videos. I sent him a free product and he likes it so much he plans to create a video for it.

**PPC**

- For the golf-grip site I was given £25 which I turned into £125 with a coupon. Although i'm aware that this isn't nearly enough of a budget to create a successful PPC campaign and get accurate stats, it did force me to make sure I had the best converting keywords as possible. In the end these turned out to be product listing ads for various golf training aid queries. The keywords chosen were partly based on understanding user intent behind the queries, and through optimising the campaign.

**Tools used / Website structure**

- I downloaded screaming frog and used it to crawl my site to look for 404 errors, make sure page titles, meta descriptions, alt images, and h1 tags were correct.

- I made sure that my site wasn't producing duplicate content which is a major issue with Joomla.

- Made the URLs simple and clean.

- I use http://tinypng.org/ to compress all images used on the site to help make each page faster.

- Created a sitemap using screaming frog (although I have look into image / video sitemaps).

- I use excel to store information about the top 10 results for my targeted keywords.

- I consider blogs tools and keep up with digital marketing blogs like Moz, Quick Sprout and of course /r/bigseo.

- I'm going to be completely honest and say i'm just too poor to pay for a monthly subscription for Moz Tools or something similar. But they do look very useful.

----------------------------------------------
I think that is it.

So does anyone have any suggestions on areas I can work on or that are missing? I'd love to make the best first impression so i'll aim to work on any areas I am lacking.

1jg1od,13,2013-07-31,Shady move? Practicing interviews.,julius559,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jg1od/shady_move_practicing_interviews/,"This is more of a question of opinions rather than, ""I'm going to do this, what do you think?"".

I am a mobile dev intern at a local company and I plan to stay here for the rest of the year, build up solid experience at the company, apply to next summer's internship opportunities this fall and see what happens.

My college posts quite regularly, on their careers development page, full-time/part-time(entry-level) jobs and internships local companies are looking towards college students to fill. My college hands the resumes (small college, less CS students more-so) themselves to the hiring manager and almost guaranteed an interview, rather than an online blackhole process.

My question:
Would it be wrong, or dangerous to apply to those positions in order to gain interview experience? I'm currently an entering sophomore, and I don't have much experience in that realm, especially technical interviews. I would take it as a learning experience for my (possible) interviews later in the year, when it really counts.

Again, I don't have a master plan of doing this, but it popped in my head and I wanted professional opinions. I don't plan jumping internships, just simple experience.

Thank you."

After some troubling info, I (26/M) recently found out his (27/m) number.",sexvacation,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jfwg9/how_many_is_too_many_after_some_troubling_info_i/,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for 6 months very happily except for over a month whilst he was away and we were long distance. I recently found out the number of sexual partners my boyfriend has had. Now, when it comes to that number, my mantra is don't ask, don't tell. However, some information he had told me caused some concern about his views on intimacy and the like.  

My boyfriend is a graduate student right now while I'm done with grad school and currently pursuing my career. In the past year, he came back from 3 years in Singapore last August, went to Malaysia for 2 weeks in early January (for optional credit applied to spring semester), went back home for a week in March and then went back to Singapore for over a month, June/July, to pursue an internship. Before we even began exclusively dating (about 15 weeks ago), I cautioned him that I don't do so well with LDR. It's just too much anxiety for me and I choose not to participate in them especially if they are really new. Suffice it to say, the month in Singapore was brutal and upon his return, I really wanted to take it even slower as I wanted to see where his head was at in terms of travelling like that. I didn't/don't want to be manipulative and tell him not to go anywhere ever, but I'm cognizant enough to know that someone with wanderlust is not for me. 

He said that he was done travelling like that for good as he now wants to put down roots somewhere and feels like he has nothing to show for his age. Also, he does not want to return to his country love, Singapore, to live as he feels it never felt like home to him and the gay culture is not as progressive as he would like.

I was skeptical about all of this given his past history of travelling and his affinity to Asian guys. Something he also said was fleeting now with the cultural difference being too hard to handle, but I understand that preference is preference which is fine. Just as long as it doesn't overly dictate your life. 

I brought up his prior trip to Malaysia as an example of him just travelling wherever the wind blows where he studied food for 2 weeks as being another example of his wanderlust. He claims that it was to help him with a career in study abroad and it looked good for future employers. I personally called bullshit. It didn't make sense. 

It's through this conversation where I found out that during his time there he had hooked up with 7 different guys and had sex with 6 of them in 14 days! Claiming to have started on the third day of his trip. This greatly disturbed me as my view on sex is to wait (at least not on the first night) though anything other base would be fine. At this point, I had to know what his number was. He told me that the total number of people with whom he has had sex with was in the mid-20s... The people that he had hooked up with (more than kissing) was about 40!

My view of him has shattered in which I don't know if I can look at him the same way. I don't know what to do. I want to ask the question of how many partners, is too many partners? Has anyone else been in a position where they were shocked by their partners number and it changed their viewpoint of them? Did it end up working, did you get over it or was it too much to bear? How does one get over it? I'm still not sure if it's the number itself or what I call sex tourism vacation (sexation?) that has me troubled.

---

**tl;dr**: I found out my bf magical number and it has me aghast.

Sidenote: I do have to admit, given my initial shock and desire to take it slow right now since we really only have known each other for a few months, my bf has been trying to do everything in his power to not let the relationship fail or for us to break up. I don't think I question his actual commitment to this relationship. He seems completely committed in my perspective. I just need some advice. Thank you so much for reading!"

The beginning of July would have marked 6 years with someone that was absolutely wonderful. Like most relationships we had our ups and downs, especially since it was my first serious relationship. We worked through all the problems. Every time I would work harder on being a better boyfriend/husband. I grew by leaps and bounds of the time we were together. I was no longer an asshole and I didn't drool over women when we were out(I still deny that I did this).

As time went on, the physical aspect of the relationship suffered the most. In the beginning it was great, but it quickly deteriorated. When she was in mood, it had to be certain positions because it hurt. She had always wanted kids and I eventually came around to the idea thanks to my nephew (best decision I ever made). After that, sex only happened once a month during ovulation.

Once she became pregnant, found out the day I proposed which happened to be my birthday, the real changes happened. She became less affectionate and more hateful towards me, but no one else. I blamed the hormones due to pregnancy and brushed off and was supportive throughout the entire thing. It didnt change after birth either, I blamed it on the hormones still as she was breast feeding and that keeps the hormones from going back to normal levels. Breast feeding stopped but she didnt.

We would go months without sex and she would complain about the way I showed affection. We both wanted another child and wanted the age gap to not be too extreme so we started trying again.
About 6 months after my child was born, I was laid off for the second time in my life. It was also a couple of weeks after our wedding. I decided to go back to school and finally get a degree. It was tough, I pushed myself to excel because I knew it would pay off in the end. I missed a lot of time from my daughter and my wife. Halfway through the summer semester our relationship was in tatters. We had recently had a big arguement and I vowed to be a better husband, again, but also stated that I had to put school as a priority because we didnt have a secure future without it. Luckily I was able to get federal aid for school so it was paid for and I was on unemployment, but it would run out before I graduated school. I started to 'extreme coupon' to help provide more food with less money. It worked, we didnt have to worry about groceries or other household necessities and actually built up a 3-6 month supply of food.

Around August-October of last year, she tells me her 'friend' from highschool messaged her on facebook. I knew who this friend was, we all went to highschool together. They were a 'thing' in highschool and her friend was the cause of a lot of stress and mostly ruined highschool for her. I knew this and had no reason to think that any thing would be different now. She told me they were talking more and were going to hang out some. I was fine with this as my wife was the most caring, giving, and trustworthy person I knew.
For clarification, I think I should state her friend was a female. They were in a long term relationship in highschool and my wife and long assured me she was not lesbian, this was long before the friend cam back into the picture. Once again I say I had no concerns.

They started hanging out a lot, which was fine by me as it allowed me to do the copious amounts of reading and homework that follows a fulltime student. But I started noticing things that bothered me. The first is that they would stay up late talking and hanging out. Then she started to crash on the couch and so would my wife, We had a big 'L' shaped couch, one on each leg. I also noticed they would take like 10 mins to say bye in the mornings she crashed over and stand in a spot were it made it difficult to be seen from the house. What made this really odd to me is she always was late for work and complained about, she was now getting ready earlier and in some instances take her friend back home in the morning(nearly a 20 min detour).

At the time we were using Google voice for all text messages to save money on our wireless bill. One morning after she left for work I had a strange feeling, I still cant explain it and have not felt it since. Seeing as I had set the Google voice thing up for the both of us and we both trusted each other with password, I logged into Google and checked her text messages. I was baffled, there was only one conversation between the two of them. I let it go, but the conversation was just off enough that it got stuck in my head. After a few minutes of trying to get ready for school, I was back on Google. As reddit knows, nothing leaves the internet. There it was in the trash folder, 1-2 thousand text messages between the 2 of them a day. I started reading, it was like a train wreck, I couldn't stop. There before my eyes, my whole world was falling apart. With each text a sickness I had never knew grew inside me. I'll paraphrase some of the text later for those that enjoy others misery.

I don't know how much time went by but I was able to stop and to go back to getting ready for school. In the shower I lost it and started crying like a little kid that lost its dog. After getting ready I remember standing in the house having no clue what to do. I was completely lost inside my house. Before I left I took off my ring, put it in an envelope and wrote ""The worst part is, te amo"" on the outside of it and taped it to the TV. She had once left me a note that said ""te amo"" as it was one of the only things she remembered from highschool spanish. It means I love you. 

I decided to wait until she got home before I went back. She texted me saying she was going to her friends house for awhile. I was at school until 10pm that night. When I got home she asked me what this meant. I told her I knew everything. I kicked her out of the bedroom and made her sleep on the couch.
She tried to apologize and have me forgive her. I put a keyed lock on on the bedroom door and through all of her stuff in the livingroom and told her to live in the spare bedroom.

We lived this way for 4 months because I couldn't bare to leave my daughter. I took the time to try and wean myself off of seeing my daughter everyday to get ready for moving out after school was over. In the mean time her friend started living in the room with her. The whole time she kept begging me to take her back. Then she tried to guilt me into it by using the broken home speech for our daughter.

At the end of March she finally realized I was done with her and asked me to leave. That was the last night I stayed in the house. From then on I only see my daughter a couple times a week and live with my parents.
Some how I managed to not kill myself(thanks to my daughter) and actually graduated with honors from college with an A.A.S. I turned down and awesome and well paying job for a summer internship with NASA. The company I turned down the job from is now in contact with me again since the internship is almost over and I have an interview with another company as soon as I get back to town. All of my hard work as paid off, but I have no one to share it with now. She recently changed her facebook status to 'in a relationship' with her friend. 
This summer, while away, I realized I can not be away from my daughter and therefore am forced to return to a place I don't want to be. As a peaceful and tolerant person, I know have to find a way to get myself and my daughter out of NC(no longer a good place to raise a child) without screwing over her mother. Regardless of how much she ruined my life, I cant separate a child from their mother, its not right.

I have a bright and prosperous future ahead of me, yet I spend everyday on the verge of slipping back into depression. But I step forward everyday for my daughter because I know I can provide her with an amazing future. I just hope our relationship doesn't get trashed by distance, her mother, and her mothers friend.
Sorry for the long post and if anyone happens to read all of this, thank you.

In summary, cause I don't know the stupid acronym, My wife cheated on me with her highschool lesbian lover who now lives in my house with my daughter and I have no joy in my life save for my daughter.

Señor Tigre walks out with Wilikins in tow.

ST:  Gentlemen, I am making my way to that ring.  Ju have but two options:  flee or fight.  Fair Warning, though, I have been in de muy mal humor.

Both of the jobbers look at one another and stare down Señor Tigre as he makes his way to the ring.

ST:  It's jor funeral.

Señor Tigre' undoes his tie and hands it to Wilikins as he makes his way up the steps.  As he enters the ropes one jobber makes a break for it, running up and through the crowd to escape.  The other lunges for Tigre, going for a leg takedown which Tigre avoids with the uncharacteristic flourish of a bullfighter.  The jobber comes in again and Tigre turns and hits him with a vicious Pele kick that leaves the jobber laid out face first on the ground.  Tigre steps over him and places him in a modified camel clutch, signaling to Wilikins, he reaches out to have his gold plated mic placed in his hand.

ST:  I warned ju, didn't I? {he puts the mic near the mans face, his screams all that can be heard}  Now ju get to be my seat as I speak to these nice people, you'll like that, jes?  Getting jor fifteen minutes, eh?


Tigre settles back looking oddly relaxed as he speaks to the crowd over the moans of the jobber whose back will never be the same.

ST:  Hola!  It has been a while since we have spoken this way, hasn't it? {Tigre's chair begins to beg for mercy, Tigre bops him with the mic}  Que tranquilo!  Where was I?  Oh, jes.   It seems that I do not get the respect I deserve without my tag team championship.  This idiota por ejemplo, what is jor name? {Miguel de Cerveza he screams}  That's too long, jor name is 'chair' now.  So, Chair here, he felt that he had the right, the skill, the huevos to challenge me, all because I am no longer a champion.  And whose fault is that? {Wilikins steps up and raises a hand}  No, no, old friend.  Ju suggested a match that I would find entertaining, and I did, I thank ju.  Was it the interns fault?  No, he wrestled well and did the Nation of Hurtsville proud, he is coming along quite well.  Was it the Foundations fault? {his laughter echoes, drowning out for a moment the groans of Chair} HAH!  Those two buffoons have had chance after chance and fallen short every time.  Was it then the Blaade Brothers, who now own what is rightfully ours?  No.  They won.  We lost.  Nor was it Damien Mitchell's fault we lost. {Tigre looks down realizing that Chair has been silent for a few moments, he hits him and there is nothing, standing he looks down and slowly kicks the unconscious body to the mat outside} Someone come and get this chair, don't bother bringing a new one, I'll stand.  

ST:  {pacing the ring waliking to every side and speaking to the crowd} The man to blame for jor heroes having been laid low, is Anton Sykes.  But ju all know this don't ju, ju bought Gold Rush, just like the other four million people out there.  Ju also know that for now mi hermano y yo have no intention of retrieving our belts.  And make no mistake:  they are now, always were and always will be OUR belts.  The Tag Team Division is dry-sad, really, the Army of Anarchy is defeated, jor welcome, the Kings of California are broken, all that remains is the Stone Foundation and the Blaades.  Both are so far beneath us that, we agree that we'd rather have no gold then prove to be the best of a bad situation.  So, ju ask jorselves:  ""Señor Tigre what will ju do with jo time?""  Simple, I am the Hunter, so that is what I will do, hunt.  I have multiple targets:  first and foremost: Sykes;  second:  singles gold; third: a woman for this evening. {the ladies in the crowd go insane}  Clearly, these are ranked in order of descending difficulty.  So, in the spirit of the hunt, I am here to take the ground away from my prey: ju all know I am wealthy beyond imagining.  Anyone who brings me truthful information on the whereabouts of Anton Sykes, will be greatly rewarded.  Very greatly. {cellphones can be heard whipping out, many people are making their way to the exits} Don't leave yet!  Ju see I did not become wealthy by taking stupid risks.  If ju bring me faulty or fabricated information {his smile here is chilling-sinister} then ju get a one way trip to Hurtsville- and there is only one punishment in Hurtsville...the factory.  Go.  I have hunting to do."

I'm a bit nervous that a 22 year old ""kid"" from Indiana (I've never been west of Chicago, btw) might have trouble getting a job, although I've heard that the web development/CS jobs are fairly numerous.

I know this isn't the SeaJobs or a CS subreddit, but I figured I'd get the most help here from those in the webdev field.

What are the chances of someone fresh out of college getting a decent job in the web development field?  I've got an internship under my belt and plenty of personal projects.  I'd definitely consider myself to be an above-average developer for someone in my position (not insanely good, but really solid), but I'm still nervous that I'll wind up working for some dead-end company making 40k a year in Utah.  No offense to Utah... :)

Is it abnormal for someone out of state to get a job at an average Seattle company?  I know places like Amazon/Microsoft don't have a problem hiring out of state, but I'm not sure every company is willing to bring someone who lives 2000 miles away in for an interview.

Without asking some more typical questions, I'll say that I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get my ass to Seattle with a solid job in May.  What's a guy like me need to do?

Don't get me wrong I am not complaining, I have gotten to do some really cool things but as I begin to stay in one area from now on to finish out my studies I want to get my game back.


Background:
- athletic and in good shape but I have a baby face

- I had a lot of confidence in high school, somewhere I lost it

- I feel like I have always been more mature than people my age this makes it harder to connect with people

- I have always been a bit shy

- I really don't think I am overly geeky. I'm an engineer, sure I know math and all that jazz but I'm also into cars, outdoors, etc.

- I try to put myself in places where people with the same interests as me are but I haven't had total success on connecting fully with someone yet.

I have had plenty of platonic relationships that I was always too shy to go anywhere with. Now I feel like I've hit the point where girls out there will be way more experienced in everything and that I won't measure up or they will be too impatient to put up with me. Talk about needing some self confidence, yeah I know. I haven't had a girlfriend and the only kissing I've done has been in drunk situations.

When it comes to athletics, school, jobs, style, etc. I am very confident because I am extremely goal oriented (the mature side of me) and have been pretty successful up to this point. When it comes to girls I need work/help. I have no problem talking to girls but I usually find myself interested in shy girls which doesn't make things any easier.

Thanks in advance

Since there are so many people asking about internships and such with the big 4 I thought I'd write up my thoughts on my first internship for anyone who is planning on/thinking about doing an internship with one of them in the future.

Going into this internship I really didn't know what to expect. I had gotten really lucky with this being a freshman (incomming sophmore now) and had been put in the tax department since it was the only one available.

The main stuff I did during the 6 weeks was tax compliance stuff. Ie preparing an estimated chargeable income from g/l accounts. I also filled out the occasional tax form and did some general ''intershippy'' stuff like making amendments to query letters to clients and such.

It was a much less ''guided'' experience than I thought it would be. Orientation was done with a whole range of people who were entering the company, from interns to managers transferring over from other countries. It would've been quite easy to just coast by and not do anything and simply collect paychecks during these 6 weeks, but obviously that would've been just the biggest waste of time. I had to force myself to actively ask around for work.

In my opinion the most important skill was knowing how to use excel. There was another girl who did her internship in the tax department with me who was going into her senior year in accounting, so she obviously knew A LOT more than me about accounting, but she barely knew anything about excel and as a result she struggled because it would take her so long to do everything. I on the other hand, despite my limited accounting experience, was able to cope quite well thanks to my ability to easily follow the previous years excel sheets, creating formulas, knowing short cuts etc etc, really nothing that advanced but it helped a lot.

All in all it was a great experience and I learned A TON. It was very intimidating starting out since I had such little experience but I soon realized that everyone at the firm more or less knew I didn't know too much and I never felt that there were any outrages expectations."

I’m the marketing manager at Curve Studios. We’re an independent developer and publisher in Central London and currently working on several Vita and PS3 titles.

We’re looking for an intern for four weeks. It’s unpaid, but we’ll cover your travel within London and give you some money each week for lunch. Hours and days are generally flexible.

If you’re interested drop an email to rob.clarke@curve-studios.com with your CV and a quick covering letter.

Responsibilities

• Social Media: We’ll put you in front of Twitter and Facebook day one, and we’ll expect you to be able to pick up interesting Tweets (Not just sales or self-promotion stuff) quickly.

• Blog: Writing for our blog, both promotional and informal posts, as well as coming up with ideas for what to write about.

• Asset Management: Helping our production guys and marketing to make sure things like screenshots, trailers and art assets are all going to the right people at the right time.

• Research: Making sure our press lists make sense and are up-to-date, looking at how other developers and publishers are approaching certain topics and collating press coverage.

• Admin: You won’t have to make the coffee (we have a machine for that), but you will have other similar exciting tasks such as updating spreadsheets and mailing out competition prizes. The games industry is a glamorous place.

Requirements

• Some sort of experience in social media, pr or marketing. That could be part of a school project, a degree you are working towards, a website you run or write for, that sort of thing.

• Mad Twitter skills. You don’t need to have 2,000 followers but it helps if you’re active and contribution on at least one form of social media (Yes, Reddit counts).

• You need to play, enjoy and generally know about indie games and have a strong idea of why people like to play them. We don’t just mean you’ve played Minecraft on your 360 – if you don’t know what a Roguelike is or aren’t aware of recent games like The Swapper and Gunpoint, this probably isn’t for you.

• Excellent English skills. You need to be able to write engaging copy in a variety of different styles. Check out our blog for an example. 

• Some basic technical skills would be strongly preferred – the ability to use an FTP, resize images and make attractive PowerPoint presentations all come in very handy.

When in doubt, I erred on the side of crediting time worked, such as military service after a career had begun, or those working while also pursuing graduate degrees. I also considered employment by TSCC organizations such as BYU as part of the career, not a church calling with a stipend.*

**Some stats**

~~Educators: 4 (6 if you count Oaks and Monson, but law was Oaks' field and Monson was mostly in newspapers)~~

Academic Professors: 2

Seminary/Institute: 2

Presidents of Church Schools: 4

Attorneys: 3 

Judge: 1 

Doctor: 1

Pilot: 1

Average career length: 21.4

Shortest careers: Monson 11, Packer 12, Andersen 12. 

Longest careers: Nelson 37, Cook 30, Oaks 27. 

Interesting points, while researching the Q15's job history, I noticed nearly every one had, not only college degrees, but graduate degrees (with a high occurrence of the Ivy League). This was highly extraordinary in the 1940s when [fewer than 1 adult in 20 held a bachelor’s degree](http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf). Even in [1980 only 22% of the population received bachelors degrees.](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/06/12/us/across-the-board-growth-in-college-degrees.html?ref=education) Additionally, none of the 15 had blue-collar careers. But that wasn't the point of this post. 

One last thought concerning the earning of GAs. I don't believe they aspired to lead TSCC because it was the most profitable career move.  While it has likely been profitable, there is no substitution of money over power. To quote House of Cards - ""Money is the McMansion in Sarasota that starts falling apart after 10 years. Power is the old stone building that stands for centuries.""

Edit: I'm bad at *Bold**"

Because I took a semester off, my class schedule is completely thrown off. I would like to graduate on time, but I also don't want to overload myself this semester. My adviser said I should take Physics 2 this semester, but I've heard from other UVa students that taking the class at a community college in the summer and then transferring the credits in is a lot more manageable. What do you think r/UVa?

Update: Thanks for the advice guys! So I am actually relying on internships and/or jobs to actually pay to take classes at UVa, so I'm just gonna go and take Physics 2 at UVa. :)"

Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.

You're so beautiful and charming. We seem to have similar interests and my heart does the oddest flip whenever I hear you laugh. My ears turn red when you say my name and I can't help but stare as you walk away.

I hate that I don't have the courage to come out to you. I hate that I'm 90% certain you're straight (who is this guy you keep talking about?). I hate that, soon enough, you won't be at the receptionist desk anymore. This was just an internship of sorts for you and I was just some girl you transferred phonecalls to. Maybe it was for the best, because I think you could have easily broken my heart and who knows how long till I'd be able to recover from a girl like you.

Hug me, Raptors. For the first time, I've fallen helplessly for *The Straight Girl*."

I'm 20, soon to be 21 in less than a month. My girlfriend just turned 22. So, were a year apart. I want to start off by saying that I have very conflicting thoughts, feelings of guilt and disgust, and don't know what I really want. 

I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for a year and five months, and we met in an academic setting, on campus. She is an amazing person, a person full of love, kindness, and beauty. When we started out dating, I never cared about her religion and mine, I didn't care about her Latin culture (which I actually love!), and all I wanted was to be with her. I'm sure she didn't care about my religion, culture, and Iranian background either. 

Her personality is amazing. She will definitely be a wonderful wife and mother one day, no doubt. She loves kids, loves family, loves love and romance. 

So, here's my dilemma with this spectacular girl. I noticed I'm not extremely attracted to her looks around the second month. I'm not saying that I am good looking, nothing like that. I may, in fact, be very ugly in some people's eyes. Anyways, that mindset almost cost me the relationship two and a half months in, when I attempted to break-up with her, but she cried, and I felt really guilty, and somehow convinced myself I'm doing the wrong thing here. I was glad I did convince myself at the time. 

She then went to Europe for an internship over the summer, and was gone for three months. We've only met each other for two and a half months by this time, and she's officially my girlfriend. We made it! We made it without a problem. We Skyped almost every other day, FB messaged, emailed, called, etc. It made us stronger. 

She comes back, and now she only has one semester of college left, while I have four. We have an amazing semester together, spending a lot of time together, but then she graduates. The physical appearance is still an issue with me. She is very beautiful, but slightly overweight. That's no issue if I'm living with her. I can always go workout with her, eat with her, etc., but we're probably not going to be with each other for the next couple of years, as we're both pursuing to go to grad school.

throughout this time, I've been to several masses on Sundays, and have had no problem with it. I think Christianity and Islam have a lot of similarities. But, I feel like this will be an issue in the future, as she wants to get married around 24-25, and have kids, while I don't intend on that scenario. 

Anyways, I believe my situation is very convoluted, and I need your advice. What should I do? I want her to be happy, and I want me to be happy. We're both applying to graduate programs soon, and I don't want our relationship hinder our decisions. I should also mention, I tried breaking up with her after I got back from a trip to Middle East, this past spring, but I didn't have the heart, as she said ""she wouldn't have kids or get married to anyone else besides me."" That broke my heart, and I don't ever want her to be unhappy. Please help me! I tear up when I think about breaking up with her. Someone who loves me so much, how can I be so ungrateful of her love, generosity, kindness, and care? I love her, too. Believe me, I do. But, not as intensely as her. My mind wonders about other girls. I think about other relationship scenarios, and I, honestly, want to enjoy being single and able to flirt. I am currently away from her, doing an internship, and it has been very difficult to not think about other girls, as many opportunities have risen . 

I'm only 20. I don't want her to wait to have kids or get married because I want to get married around 27. Frankly, I don't want to even think about marriage. I love kids dearly myself, but I don't want to have them so soon. I'm leaning towards breaking it off, but I am a coward and think of how wonderful and loving she is. She has family problems, recently divorced parents, and a sister who doesn't hang out with her much, and friends who are abandoning her because she's not as rowdy as they are. I'm her escape. I don't want her to be trapped and not have a escape. I want her to be happy. I don't want to leave her in such a situation, where she doesn't receive the love and attention from her surroundings. What do I do? Please help me. 

Thank you very much for any valuable advice you may give me. "

This is my first post. I'm having a hard time with my girlfriend so im hoping for a little guidance/feedback.

---


We have both, in the past, dated before but this is the first relationship for both of us. We've been together for a little under than 2 years now but have known each other for the last 5 years as friends.



The first year and a half went by perfectly. We have been a bit like swans, always advance and receding. Ups and downs but we've grown closer on each other. We used to hang out a lot and do all sorts of stuff. I consider her one of my best friends and we could talk about anything. 


This spring she got an offer of an internship on the other side of the world.
I was from the start very supportive because i know she would have gone crazy if she didnt take that opportunity and i really wanted that for her even if that meant a difficult half year. We have been apart from each other while travelling, but not for 6 months before.






4 months later she left. Before she left we sat down and talked about how we were going to do it. We both agreed on that we wanted to be together even if that meant we could only skype and i could visit her only once.  I know that she meant it and i meant it aswell. Then she left. That is about a month ago now. We can both function apart from each other so i thought this would go really well. 


The last two weeks however has proven to be very difficult. In the start we talked over skype, she told me about all the cool stuff she did and i was super happy for her. 


Then after about two weeks she stopped saying she missed me, that she loved me etc. and i noticed that she was not so eager to talk to me. I was a bit concerned about that but she told me before she left that i should not read too much between the lines (i have a bad habit of doing that with her and interpretating it on my own way, which is almost always worse than it is). 
Well, anyway i let it slide and tried being just nice and supportive back. 


It is hard to keep a conversation going when its only one part asking questions.


Three days ago i asked her if there was something troubling her and if she was being ""short"" on purpose. 


She told me that it was not anyone else involved but that there was something wrong. The last couple of weeks she hadn't missed me much, hadn't thought about me much and that she was starting to question herself if she really loved me. 


I said to her that i was glad that she didn't miss me much because that obviously ment she had a great time where she was and that it would be terrible if all she did was to miss me and that i didnt miss her so much either, just in some situations, for example when i was alone.


The part which made me really sad is that she questioned if she loved me. 
I asked her if she was unsure before she left but she told me that when we had the talk beforehand she was absolutely certain and that she really wanted to try even if it ment it would be some difficult times.


It was really difficult for her to talk about it and she kept saying that this was just something she had thought about and that she wasn't sure. I accepted that and kept talking with her to find out how she was doing.




The conversation ended really well and i had a good feeling afterwards that this just is a phase.


Now its been three days. Yesterday we talked for 10 minutes on the phone about other stuff and what she had been doing and she said that the talk we had was really good. I agreed.



I can't sleep because i haven't heard from her again. I was hoping she would have sent me something nice to let me know that its just a phase but that hasn't happened yet. Im thinking about how she could question that she loves me after just two weeks and not thinking its a phase and that we just have to get over the bump. We were supposed to plan when i am going to visit but that is of course not happening as long as this goes on.



I really want to be with her but i cannot be unsure of how she feels for a long time when we are so many miles apart.



I don't want to be with someone who doesn't love me but what i can't grasp is that she is considering this after such short time.



Anyone who has been in the same situation or can relate and have any tips on how to proceed for both of us?




**tl;dr**: Girlfriend went on a internship far away and after 2 weeks says she is unsure of her feelings. What to do?"
1jdyrn,5,2013-07-30,Am I in a position to negotiate? What are my options?,unionmade,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jdyrn/am_i_in_a_position_to_negotiate_what_are_my/,"For the past few weeks I've been an intern (post-grad) at a pretty big tech company (think top 10) recently I was offered a job position at said company, I would be working in the same group but on a different team, in a really different role. My degree is in CS and this is more CE/EE work. I haven't taken many CE/EE courses during my school time and am still unsure about my ability in these fields, although as always I'm willing to learn and it seems the company is willing to take a shot with me.

Anyway, as an intern to full time, I'm wondering if I'm in a position to negotiate anything -- salary, vacation, etc. I have no idea what to look for in terms of salary but in looking at this position on glassdoor at this site for this job title has the average at 83k (haven't spoken to co-workers) I'm wondering if I have more or less leverage as an internal hire or if I should just take the opportunity and whatever they give me.

I am now here to tell you most recent update on my most delightful co-worker, Mr Desperate Romantic, and his squeeze, LardLover.

&gt;Getting into work

&gt;Australian winters making it just cold enough to need a scarf

&gt;Nargh, give me tea NOW

For those of you who don't want to bother reading through my saga full of disgusting descriptions of the most fatlogic proportions, I currently work as a senior manager in IT, am a female (from previous misgivings with LardLover and women in the office, this detail is needed), and have been dealing with the repercussions of LardLover's original call to me for ""advanced IT support help"". This eventually resulted in one of my interns being sexually harassed by her, me finding McDonalds in a freshly disheveled bathroom stall from her rumpus, and Mr DesperateRomantic being audited in his job in HR, because he kept LardLover there, claiming 'disability' benefits without proof. He was the poor chap who was on the receiving end of her McDonald's fueled 'rumpus'

Oh, and turns out LardLover didn't actually do any work at all!

&gt;Walk into office this morning

&gt;Finally have tea inside of muh tummy

&gt;Dept. Head comes in for a morning chat

&gt;Oh how nice it is to be able to relax before checking tickets

We got to chatting, this morning, about how he was contacted by a real lawyer this time! A real one! None of this 'brother' business! He didn't want to update me, or anyone else in the workforce until he had cleared up any legal repercussions. Apparently the whole fiasco went something like this....

&gt;Be IT Dept head, trying to delegate some new projects out

&gt;*boop boop boop*

&gt;This had better be something damn important

&gt;""Hello, I'm [Lawyer from fancy company] calling on behalf of LardLover. Am I to understand you are the superior of [ohgodwhydoineedthis]?""

&gt;""I suggest you call our legal department""

&gt;Hangs up, suspecting 'brotherly' mischief

&gt;*boop boop boop*

&gt;""I don't think you're taking this very seriously. There are thousands of dollars at stake""

&gt;""Call the legal department""

&gt;Hangs up again

&gt;*boop boop boop*

&gt;""I hope you know I will take you people for all you have! This is a serious matter and I dou-""

&gt;Hangs up

&gt;Two hours pass

&gt;*boop boop boop*

&gt;""Hey, its Bob from legal. I think you should get up here. I'm not sure if I should be taking this seriously""

&gt;Realizes LardLover isn't shitting around anymore

&gt;Goes up to legal, trying to push the ideas of possibly settling with this beast for made up charges

&gt;Goes into Bob's office

&gt;""Look. This lawyer is claiming all sorts of discrimination and even abuse. They want to try and settle out of court, but they're demanding that they will only do that if [ohgodwhydoineedthis] and ShyIntern are fired.""

&gt;""Why the hell are you thinking about settling then?""

&gt;""Because they've made a pretty good case against us. I just am incredulous about firing people with the settlement pay out""

My beautiful Dept Head then very thoroughly laid out all the evidence that LardLover had been stealing from the company through claiming disability benefits without proof, destruction of property she caused, sexual abuse she committed and knowingly using a fake lawyer to try and threaten the company.

Apparently no one told Bob.

&gt;Back in my office, this morning

&gt;Dept Head just received a phone call from the really real lawyer!

&gt;He is dropping the case and called to apologize for being so rude before

&gt;Apparently LardLover had made him do the phone calls in front of her, to make sure he was 'sufficiently demanding enough'

&gt;Legal professionalism? What legal professionalism? 

We chortle along, amusing ourselves over the claims she had made against us in the company. Everything from disability discrimination to sexism and even some shit about the women in the company being 'double crossers'. 

And then we come to news about Mr DesperateRomantic, whom had literally been hiding the progress reports that detailed how *little* work she had been submitting. By little, I mean constant complaints about all the nothing she was doing, all the time. Not a single report, not a single finished project. All complaints were kept under wraps, any higher complaints out of Mr DesperateRomantic's hands were leveled under the guise of 'disabilities'. 

&gt;Dept Head almost giggles his head off

&gt;Apparently he was fired last week Friday, and LardLover came in to help him 'clear out his desk'

&gt;Security isn't what is used to be around here

&gt;So glad I was unawares

&gt;LardLover goes through the fridges in the lunch rooms, clearing anything out of them that she thinks won't be noticed

&gt;All office bought coffee and tea, gone

&gt;Pens, rulers, paper, subtly stowed away in boxes that are being moved away on behalf of Mr DesperateRomantic

&gt;Managed to get all the boxes loaded

&gt;Security only stopped them when they tried to take away his super comfy leather chair

&gt;Facilities now sending them the bill for all the stolen supplies they recorded that day

&gt;If they don't pay it, they're going to be sending in the police

Considering she still hasn't paid for the refurbishment of her destroyed office, I doubt she will be paying for the things she stole. I'm damn glad I bring my own tea to the office.

So yes, a morsel of an update for you lot. I may have more as the day progresses... there are a lot of jaded colleagues who had to deal with her."
